              <p>StarHub has issued an apology to its cable TV subscribers. <br> <br> This follows complaints from its subscribers who said that they were
              not able to tune in to the cable TV network earlier this morning. <br> <br> In a statement, StarHub says that it understands that the problem started at 8am. <br> <br> It adds that investigations showed that the situation was due to an issue with a software provided by a third-party vendor. <br> <br> Earlier, a Ms Maureen called the MediaCorp hotline to say that she
              tried to view StarHub channels 12, 16 and 58 but was unsuccessful. <br> <br> She said a message asking StarHub subscribers to calll the customer service hotline popped up instead. <br> <br> Another caller, Mrs Tan, who subscribes to the basic channels as well
              as the Sports channels, also experienced similar difficulties.<strong> <br> <br> </strong>"Suddenly this morning when I turned on the TV, all the
              channels were blocked except for the Korean drama. So, I was taken
              aback why is it so and all the channels, on screen, there's a message
              to say that "please call 1633 to subscribe to this channel", which
              we've already subscribed to. So when I called Starhub, I just couldn't
              get through." <br> <br> Having tried calling for help several times, a frustrated Mrs Tan has this to say.<strong> <br> <br> </strong>"If there's any technical problem, at least they should flash
              it on the TV screen and say that there's a technical error and we're
              trying to remedy it. But there's none!" <br> <br> In response, StarHub says it experienced "a surge in call volume
              recently" largely due to public interest in its festive promotions and
              iPhone offerings. <br> <br> It adds that access to the cable TV channels resumed since 12.30pm.</p>
