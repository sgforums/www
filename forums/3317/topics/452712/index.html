              <p>An Indonesian maid has been charged in court on Tuesday (22 May) for 
              mischief after she added menstrual blood to her employer’s coffee.</p>
              <p>Jumiah, 24, committed the offence in August last year in her 
              employer’s Choa Chu Kang flat, according to The Straits Times newspaper.</p>
              <p>The maid had been working with the employer for a year.</p>
              <p>She will return to court next week and her interpreter told the court that she intends to plead guilty.</p>
              <p>Jumiah has been offered a bail of $5,000 and faces a jail term up to a year and a fine.</p>
              <p>It was unclear why the maid had tainted the coffee and how her 
              employer had found out that he was having more than his regular dose of 
              caffeine.</p>
