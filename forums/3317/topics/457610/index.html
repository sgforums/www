              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The lawyer of a church pastor, who was sentenced to 
              two weeks in jail for giving false information under the Customs Act, on
               Thursday questioned if a "blanket sentence" had been imposed 
              "mechanically and religiously".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In the appeal 
              against the sentence, lawyer Peter Ong said Senior District Judge See 
              Kee Oon had "failed to consider" that he had the discretion to impose a 
              fine, instead of a custodial sentence.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The judge had 
              imposed a jail term on Steven Yang Suan Piau, a pastor at Eternal Life 
              Baptist Church, after he lied to an immigration officer. <br><br>On Jan 
              3, Yang had attempted to leave Singapore for Malaysia without the 
              required amount of fuel, or at least three-quarters of the tank, in his 
              car.<br><br>When asked by the immigration officer, Yang maintained that 
              his car's fuel indicator - which showed it was three-quarters full - was
               accurate and that the fuel gauge had not been tampered with. <br><br>However, an inspection of the car found it had less than one-quarter tank of fuel.<br><br>On
               Thursday, Mr Ong questioned if the Senior District Judge had placed 
              previous sentencing precedents "on an altar and obsessively worshipped 
              them".<br><br>In 64 of the 67 cases between 2009 and May this year, jail terms of at least one to two weeks were imposed. <br><br>Two
               other cases attracted fines, while the last was taken into 
              consideration during sentencing for other offences, Mr Ong noted. <br><br>The
               penalty for giving false information under the Customs Act is a fine of
               up to S$5,000 or jail term of up to a year, or both, and Mr Ong argued 
              Parliament did not prescribe a minimum sentence for the offence and had 
              left it to the discretion of the courts.<br><br>The lawyer also drew 
              similarities to the recent case of Woffles Wu, who was fined S$1,000 for
               giving false information to the police about his speeding offences. <br><br>In
               both cases, the false information given was to evade a small speeding 
              fine or a "small amount of excise duty on petrol", said Mr Ong.<br><br>Deputy
               Public Prosecutor Sarah Lam, however, said Yang's sentence was adequate
               as he had deliberately misled the immigration officer. <br><br>The appeal was adjourned to a further date. - </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
