              SINGAPORE: A former executive secretary of KPMG was sentenced on Monday to five years' jail for stealing her boss' chequebook and forging his signature to fraudulently draw S$641,872.88 from his bank accounts. 
              
              Forty-five-year-old Siew Siu Yin, who had pleaded guilty to 23 charges, admitted that she had stolen an unused chequebook from Mr Kikuo Yokota's office in March 2004.
              
              However, investigations revealed that her crime spree started much earlier - when she stole a cheque from the office at Hong Leong Building at Raffles Quay on July 1, 2003.
              
              Her crimes only came to light in July 2007 after Mr Yokota made a check with the bank.
              
              He confronted Siew who confessed and pleaded for forgiveness.
              
              Mr Yokota decided to give her another chance after she promised to return him the money which she had taken from him.
              
              By then, she had already forged 100 cheques and misappropriated S$569,372.88 from his bank accounts. 
              
              But it was not long before she re-offended.
              
              Siew fraudulently took out money from Mr Yokota's bank accounts from April 30, 2008.
              
              She was caught the second time round - this time after a bank staff notified Mr Yokota on March 17 last year about discrepancies found on his documents.
              
              Siew was immediately sacked and the authorities notified.
