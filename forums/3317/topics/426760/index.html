              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: During a dialogue at the Singapore Polytechnic's 
              Graduates Guild on Friday evening, one participant asked Senior Minister
               Goh Chok Tong about his views on the perception that young Singaporeans
               are "soft", compared to their peers from other countries, such as 
              China.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Goh said the more
               appropriate description for the younger generation is perhaps, that 
              they are "not hungry enough" and that is due, in part, to the fact that 
              Singapore has been successful, over the years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The solution - to keep with the right strategies, go back to increasing productivity and to improve pay.<br><br>He
               said: "It's a matter of market forces. Supply and demand. In China, 
              that man has no other job to go to. There are 600 million people 
              competing with him for jobs. In our case, because we have done so well, 
              every year we are creating 50,000 jobs. We only have 20 to 30 thousand 
              inflow into the workforce, people have choice. So what is the solution? 
              Well, maybe just a bad dose of government and you have unemployment for 
              five, six years and Singaporeans will feel hungry! Do you want that? 
              Answer is no!<br><br>"Because it's our job to make sure that we continue
               to grow and if we do so, they got a choice. What can we do? We all have
               a problem because people have a choice! So you just cannot compare the 
              problem with China? What is your solution? Then you have to go back to 
              productivity, to paying them well and so on. It's tough. Moving forward,
               rising expectations, better educated Singaporeans and new leadership, 
              can we lead Singapore forward? If we have the right strategies, our 
              future remains bright."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>Sporeans will always be hungry for survival and always be hungry to put food across the tables for family. Always by hungry to bring in cash for the family and pocket money for the children.</p>

              <p>Yes, Spore has been successful, we have a nice and good country. The only problem is cost of living is an issue now.</p>

              <p>Perhaps the same can also be said that the cynical view by most "young" Singaporean is that the Govt has dictate our lives so much that it erode young singaporean vision why even bother to work where there is no possibilities of alternative outcome other than leaving Singapore.... ( 1 in 5 want to leave Singapore) !!!!!</p>
              <p>So while pointing finger at the "young singaporean" why not asked ourselves what have we done to our Son and daugther of Singapore?</p>
