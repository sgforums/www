            <div class='col-md body'><p>Teachers these days dunno how to teach one lar. anyway they become teachers not because they like it, but because of the pay and perks. you know why there are a lot of vacancies when MOE is recruiting? reason being alot of teachers left the service when their contracts are up. it is obvious why MOE increase the pay of teachers. teachers are overworked these days, they have to come back during the holidays to work and teach, when they are supposed to take a break from work and recover and well rested when school resumes.</p></div>

              <p>I see it two ways:</p>
              <p>1. 'You should have failed' is pretty harsh; a more tactful way would be to just write 'See Me'. Any (constructive) criticisms should be done in person.</p>

              <p>This reminds me of an incident back when I was in Sec 4. My Maths teacher (who taught us both E and A Maths) showed on the OHP what grades the MOE expected everyone to get based on our PSLE scores.</p>
              <p>Since I had gotten C for PSLE Maths, the MOE projected that I would get B3 for E Maths, and B4 for A Maths.</p>

              <p>your teacher is great in using this as a springboard and motivation to spur you on. but then not all teachers use this method. even if all teachers were to use this to spur their students, not all students will make that leap and work hard and prove MOE wrong. some students might take this as a challenge and work hard, some simply not interested and heck care.</p>

              I guess if Hero Teen is the teacher, maybe he would have written something like...
              
              You almost got full marks, work hard abit and you get full marks. See me for rewards later on... And the student got 50/100 marks for the exam... =D

              <p>Teachers these days dunno how to teach one lar. anyway they become teachers not because they like it, but because of the pay and perks. you know why there are a lot of vacancies when MOE is recruiting? reason being alot of teachers left the service when their contracts are up. it is obvious why MOE increase the pay of teachers. teachers are overworked these days, they have to come back during the holidays to work and teach, when they are supposed to take a break from work and recover and well rested when school resumes.</p>

              <p>The presumption is I pay you more, so you should work more. Although this is not the trend, it is the result of increase pay. Higher pay means reduced manpower, which in turn means greater workload for the skeleton staff.</p>
