              <p>http://www.ivu.org/news/online/October_2010.pdf<br>What about yourself, your brother and sister? Why are you vegetarians?<br>Itâ€Ÿs quite interesting because weâ€Ÿre all vegetarians for different reasons: my sister for health reasons, my brother for environmental reasons, and myself for ethical reasons. All in all, however, we too believe in the advantages of a vegetarian lifestyle and are passionate in spreading this knowledge.</p>
              <p>Meat Wastes Water<br>Clean water for drinking and other human needs such as irrigation is a precious and increasingly scarce resource. Indeed, the increasing scarcity of water is one more reason to promote vegetarianism.<br>Meat production not only pollutes water, due to the huge amount of liquid and solid waste produced by the animals whom we eat, meat production also uses more water than does the growing of plant foods.<br>Many readers of IVU Online News are aware that environmentalists calculate peopleâ€Ÿs carbon footprints, but many of our readers may not be aware that environmentalists also calculate our water footprints: www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/productgallery</p>
              <p>We all learn from our mistakes. What is one example from your own experience?<br>I have learned as I get older that it is so important to promote the message positively. Making people feel guilty about animal cruelty or their diet never works, as they shy away from you, and I am sure I was guilty of that when I was younger and probably more aggressive!</p>
              <p>Tina stepped down as VSUK Chief Executive in 2006, the same year that she was appointed to Vegetarian for Life (now Director), and has now decided to step down from the IVU Council.<br>Who is one of your heroes from the vegetarian movement? What can we learn from that person?<br>I don't think I have just one particular person. I admire Gandhi a great deal for his persistence and willingness to suffer for the vegetarian and other causes, and I also admire George Bernard Shaw, as he used humour, and I think that is a very valuable tool in our armoury.</p>
