              <p>ITS CALLED ATOM POWER BY POWER Z!!!</p>
              <p>Formerly sold in autobac, silent and Stamford tyres as POWER-Z now renamed ATOM POWER with a <br>new better formula and better pricing is up for grabz here.</p>
              <p>Current company using this product:<br>- TNT express worldwide <br>- Comfort Delgro<br>- Penguin ferry services</p>
              <p>Its benefits!<br>- Reduction in Fuel consumption by 35%!<br>- Improvement in Fuel efficiency by 55%!<br>- Improved cold start engine<br>- Increased engine output thus more power<br>- New formula to help clear engine from carbon<br>- Reduced emission<br>- Reforms particles into super fine particles in fuel facilitating complete combustion<br>- Breaking up sludge in a fuel tank and reusing it as fuel</p>
              <p>Directions<br>Pour needed amount of atom power into the fuel tank before doing any top up of fuel and then proceed to do top up. Every 1ML = 1L of petrol<br>Over usage will not do any damage to the engine!</p>
              <p>Some Calculations:</p>
              <p>Reduction in Fuel consumption by 35%!</p>
              <p>Before adding Atom Power = 500km<br>After adding Atom Power = 650km<br>Extra mileage after using Atom Power = 150km</p>
              <p>Normally 1L of petrol is able to run 10km.<br>150km/10km = 15L of petrol save<br>1L of petrol in the market is S$1.80<br>15L * S$1.80 = S$27 you save.</p>
              <p>250ml of Atom Power = S$27<br>Average Full Tank is 50L of petrol<br>50L of petrol you will need 50ml of Atom Power<br>S$27/5 = S$5.40</p>
              <p>Total savings for every full tank of petrol:<br>S$27 - S$5.40 = S$21.60</p>
              <p>Average full tank petrol pumped per month is 5 tanks.<br>250ml of Atom Power can last for 5 tanks.</p>
              <p>S$21.60 * 5 tanks per month = S$108 save per month!</p>
              <p>If you continue this for 1 year?</p>
              <p>S$21.60 *12 months = S$1296 per year!</p>

              <p>Q: Will it spoil my engine if I pour in too much of ATOM POWER?<br>A: Rest assured that “overdosage” or pouring too much will not damage your engine.</p>
              <p>Q: I am currently using other additive/fuel saving equipment, will it affect the results?EG: mileage will it increase even more if I use all of them together.<br>A: On a neutral way of saying, perhaps your current fuel saver additive/equipment might have already some of the uses as the ATOM POWER itself, so most people will recommend that you drain out or perhaps stop for the time time being in using your current additive/equipment to give this product its fair chance of showing its effectiveness to you.</p>
              <p>Q: How will the deal be done?<br>A: It will be by bank transfer to a bank account thus you will have a receipt as proof of purchase, the acct number will be given through an sms when your order is confirmed, the timing and place for collection will be as above currently.</p>
