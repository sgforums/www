              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has made a 
              strong case for Singapore to continue with its calibrated immigration 
              policy as the country faces the prospect of an ageing population.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The ministry outlined three broad approaches in a paper on population and the economy, released on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Firstly, MTI said 
              Singapore should continue to raise productivity through business 
              restructuring and retraining of the workforce.<br> <br>Secondly, the 
              country should also work towards raising the resident labour force 
              participation rate. However, the ministry said there is a limit to this.<br> <br>While
               a percentage point increase in the labour force participation rate will
               add about 30,000 resident workers to Singapore's labour force of 3.2 
              million, it is not possible to continually increase the figure by one 
              percentage point every year.<br><br>That is because the percentage of 
              economically active Singaporeans between 25 and 64 years old is already 
              high -- at 80.7 per cent.<br> <br>Then there are those who will not enter the workforce due to family and other care-giving priorities.<br><br>"Nonetheless,
               we should continue to strive to ensure that those who wish to work can 
              do so, and to introduce suitable policies that can help residents to 
              remain economically productive, no matter what their personal 
              circumstances may be," said MTI.<br><br>The third strategy is to have a 
              calibrated level of immigration and foreign manpower -- both for 
              high-skilled and low-skilled workers.<br><br>Trade and Industry Minister
               Lim Hng Kiang said foreign manpower is needed to complement Singapore's
               resident workforce, and support the construction, health and social 
              services sectors.<br><br>He said foreign manpower is also needed to 
              anchor and build up new sectors in Singapore -- such as the biomedical 
              and aerospace industries. <br><br>Mr Lim said: "If you train 
              Singaporeans to fill up the sector before you launch the sector, you may
               lose the opportunity, and you take too long. <br><br>"So our strategy 
              is to bring the sector in, allow the companies to hire foreign talent, 
              workers, and meanwhile we train Singaporean workers to fill up the jobs.
               If you tell Rolls Royce, wait until we train all the workers and 
              technicians, I think we would have missed the investments."<br><br>The paper goes on to explain the role of foreign manpower in Singapore.<br> <br>The
               ministry estimates that by 2030, the number of Singaporeans who are 
              professionals, managers, and executives (PMEs) as well as technicians 
              and associate professionals (TAP) will rise.<br> <br>So there will be a continued need for foreign workers in low-skilled jobs to complement the resident workforce.<br> <br>High-skilled
               foreign manpower will also help companies as they restructure to meet 
              the needs of the new economy because the skills and capabilities that 
              new industries need may not always be immediately available in the 
              Singaporean workforce.<br><br>The paper said having a "readily-available
               foreign manpower with the necessary skill sets" allows Singapore to 
              anchor these emerging industries, while the country develops the 
              pipeline of Singaporean workers.<br> <br>MTI added that foreign manpower
               also helps to cushion Singaporeans from unemployment during downturns. 
              This was seen during the recession years of 2008-2009, as well as 
              post-911 and the SARS period.<br> <br>The foreign workforce also 
              contributes to Singapore's taxes. The ministry said while foreigners 
              currently account for about 20 per cent of all income taxpayers, they 
              contribute more than 25 per cent of Singapore's total personal income 
              taxes. <br> <br>Foreigners living and working in Singapore also add to 
              the GST tax base. "Their tax contributions increase the fiscal resources
               for government to meet various public expenditure needs, including 
              social programmes and transfers to maintain a progressive fiscal 
              system," said MTI.<br> <br>The ministry said calibrating the inflow of foreign manpower will be a delicate balance.<br><br>An
               overly liberal access to low-skilled foreign manpower could depress 
              wages for low-skilled jobs or encourage businesses to rely on cheap 
              labour instead of making productivity improvements. <br><br>Too much 
              high-skilled foreign manpower may lead to Singaporeans feeling a sense 
              of displacement. The physical infrastructure, which is being ramped up, 
              may also be placed under stress in the immediate term.<br><br>However, 
              the ministry explained that an overly restrictive foreign manpower 
              policy will have a detrimental impact on both the economy and society. 
              "We may have a less vibrant economy, with fewer job opportunities and 
              lower wage growth," it said.<br><br>It added that there are trade-offs 
              Singaporeans have to bear in mind when considering the appropriate level
               and pace of foreign manpower inflow.<br> <br>"We have pursued economic 
              growth not for its own sake, but for the opportunities and benefits that
               a vibrant economy brings," said the ministry.<br><br>The latest report comes as the government launches a national conversation on the future of the country. <br><br>The
               National Population and Talent Division is also putting together a 
              white paper on population policies, due out early next year.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
