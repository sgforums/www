              <p> </p>
              <p>A FULL-TIME national serviceman (NSF) who continued seeing his 
              14-year-old girlfriend over her family's objections in 2009 was abducted
               by her father and uncle and taken to a cemetery in the dead of night.</p>
              <p>There, Mr Lee Poh Kiang, now 19, was assaulted by six men, 
              one of whom even held a samurai sword to his neck and threatened to 
              finish him off. The girl's father then warned him never to contact his 
              daughter again before letting him go.</p>
              <p>Charged in court, the father and uncle claimed trial last 
              year. The hearing lasted more than three weeks and on Thursday, they 
              were convicted by District Judge Sarjit Singh of being part of an 
              unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapons that hurt and abducted Mr 
              Lee.</p>
              <p>Her father, 43, and uncle, 38, who cannot be named to 
              protect the minor's identity will be sentenced on April 21, 2011. The 
              other accomplices, who are unknown, are at large.</p>
              <p>Defence counsel Subhas Anandan told reporters that his clients intend to appeal against the convictions.</p>
              <p>Another charge of perverting the course of justice has been 
              stood down. It is alleged that when Mr Lee reported them to the police, 
              the father and uncle are said to have taken him to a karaoke lounge, 
              plied him with drinks and hostesses and tried to get him to change his 
              police statements</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Dad, uncle jailed for beating teen's boyfriend</h1>
              <p>THE father beat up a full-time national serviceman (NSF) in a Choa 
              Chu Kang cemetery for allegedly leading his 14-year-old daughter astray.</p>
              <p>Her uncle - the dad's younger brother - was also involved in the 
              assault two years ago that featured a baton and a samurai sword.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, the two men were each jailed a year and eight months by 
              District Judge Sarjit Singh for being part of an unlawful assembly that 
              had attacked Mr Lee Poh Kiang, now 19, with deadly weapons, hurting him,
               abducting and taking him by force to the cemetery.</p>
              <p>The judge observed that the attack was 'an emotional 
              response' by the two men who thought they were protecting the girl from 
              bad influence. The duo were convicted on April 7 after a three-week 
              trial.</p>
              <p>Asking the court not to impose a crushing sentence, defence 
              counsel Subhas Anandan said the two men sincerely believed Mr Lee had 
              instigated the girl to run away from home.</p>
              <p>They also suspected that she had sniffed glue and had sex 
              with him. The lawyer added that these suspicions resulted in the two men
               setting upon the NSF to dissuade him from continuing the relationship.</p>
