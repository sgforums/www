              <p><strong>Raising doubts over Hong Kong's feng shui 'masters'</strong></p>
              <p class="first">HONG KONG (AFP) - - A high-profile court battle over
              the huge estate of late Hong Kong tycoon Nina Wang has lifted the lid
              on the city's obsession with the ancient Chinese energy system of feng
              shui.</p>
              <p>From burning money to digging feng shui holes, the case has
              highlighted the superstitions many in the city are drawn to as they
              search for success, wealth and happiness.</p>
              <p>And while the system is often seen in the West as simply a quirky way of arranging furniture, it is taken very seriously here.</p>
              <p>At
              the centre of the High Court case is so-called feng shui master Tony
              Chan, a former bartender whose permanent grin has filled the city's
              newspapers for weeks.</p>
              <p>Chan, who says he was Wang's lover as well
              as her feng shui adviser, is laying claim to the eccentric tycoon's 13
              billion US dollar fortune.</p>
              <p>Chinachem Charitable Foundation, controlled by Wang's siblings, says the will giving Chan the money is a fake.</p>
              <p>Lawyers
              for Chinachem argued Chan took advantage of Wang's declining health and
              seduced her with promises he could use feng shui to get rid of the
              cancer that would kill her in 2007.</p>
              <p>They also claimed that Chan
              had told Wang he could help bring back her kidnapped husband, Teddy, by
              digging holes on the grounds of her properties and filling them with
              engraved jade pieces.</p>
              <p>Her husband has never been found since he
              was kidnapped for a second time in 1990. He was declared legally dead
              nine years later.</p>
              <p>During his week-long stint on the stand, Chan's
              credentials have been undermined. As a result, the entire practice of
              feng shui is in the dock.</p>
              <p>Lee Sing-tong, a veteran master, said
              the profession should be regulated to prevent people such as Chan from
              ruining reputations.</p>
              <p>"Chan has destroyed the trust that clients place in us," Lee told AFP.</p>
              <p>Chan
              was able to convince high-powered clients, including politicians and
              businessmen, to pay him huge sums for advice. Wang herself gave him
              three tranches of 688 million Hong Kong dollars (88.2 million US)
              shortly before she died.</p>
              <p>Chan has been pummelled on the stand, conceding that he did not know how to perform some feng shui rituals properly.</p>
              <p>His
              advice to clients to burn banknotes to improve their luck originated
              from his late father -- a retired schoolteacher who, he said, could
              have given him the idea as a joke.</p>
              <p>Feng shui -- literally
              "wind-water" -- is the art of improving the quality of someone's life
              by enhancing their environment according to the principles of harmony
              and energy flow.</p>
              <p>It says that everything in the universe is
              composed of two opposite yet complementary qualities: yin, which
              symbolises the passive side of nature, and yang, which represents the
              active side.</p>
              <p>It also incorporates five elements or forms of
              energy: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. The idea is to achieve a
              balance of these elements.</p>
              <p>Peter So, one of the city's most prominent masters, said it was a scientific discipline.</p>
              <p>"Feng shui is very straightforward. It has nothing to do with magic or religion," he told AFP.</p>
              <p>"Everything
              is about calculations and the interaction between people and their
              environment. Anything on top of that are gimmicks created by the
              so-called masters to increase their appeal to the clients."</p>
              <p>The
              case has also highlighted Hong Kong's fascination with good luck --
              lucky phone numbers are much coveted here and few buildings have a
              fourth floor as the Chinese word "four" sounds like the word for
              "death."</p>
              <p>The Bank of China tower, designed by American-Chinese
              architect I.M. Pei, caused huge controversy when it became part of Hong
              Kong's famous skyline in the 1990s as its sharp triangular design was
              said to exert bad feng shui on surrounding buildings.</p>
              <p>There was
              even a suggestion that the design was chosen deliberately to channel
              bad energy towards the then-British governor's residence.</p>
              <p>Disney
              employed a feng shui consultant when it built its theme park in the
              city -- it has since been plagued by bad luck -- and many residents
              would not dream of moving into a new flat before they had called in an
              expert.</p>
              <p>As a result, the field is lucrative. A consultant can
              charge several thousand Hong Kong dollars to look at a typical
              500-square-foot flat, with the best-known masters charging much more.</p>
              <p>Antony
              Hindmarsh, of Qi Homes Property Consultants, which offers feng shui
              advice, said the practice was spreading beyond Chinese people and one
              Western client had recently sought advice after a "string of bad luck."</p>
              <p>"More and more Westerners are embracing it. It's definitely gaining popularity," he said.</p>
