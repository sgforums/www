              <p><strong>Trouble on the Horizon </strong></p>
              <p>Tenants at Horizon Food Mall in Causeway Point shopping centre were
              shocked this morning when they were told the food court would be closed
              today. <br> <br> Steven Ong owns a yong tow foo stall in the eatery. <br> <br> "The boss suddenly called up in the morning to say that the food court
              will stop operations from today onwards. But all my things have already
              been prepared and workers have already started working. Today, I lost
              about $1,500 to $2,000. The food that's wasted is about $1,500 like
              that." <br> <br> Mr Ong adds, this sudden turn of events has taken place just a day
              before the stall owners receive one of their pay checks for the month. <br> <br> He usually receives between $15,000 and $20,000 from the food court operator. <br> <br> "We get our paychecks on the 20th and the 5th every month. He takes all
              our daily sales and pays us half on the 5th and another half on the
              20th. This, after deducting the rent, cleaning or other miscellaneous
              and we get the remainder back." <br> <br> Stall owners say they tried contacting the food court operator but been unsuccessful. <br> <br> And the food court manager told them he was unable to clarify the situation, saying he was just told to cease operations. <br> <br> A spokesperson from Causeway Point says, the closure is due to some
              unresolved issues between the food court operator and its cleaning
              service provider. <br> <br> He adds, the mall management has assisted to provide Horizon Food Mall with alternative cleaning contractors.</p>

              <p><strong>Horizon Food Mall remains closed</strong></p>
              <p>Two days have passed and Horizon Food Mall in Causeway Point shopping centre still remains closed. <br> <br> And its tenants have suffered losses amounting to thousands of dollars due to this closure.<br>  <br> One of them, Steven Ong says, he was told that the owner may re-open the food court in the next few days. <br> <br> "I have received news that he will be calling us to open on either
              Tuesday or Wednesday. But we have not considered this yet. This is
              because we want to pursue our compensation from the day he closed down
              and also these few days when we were closed for business." <br> <br> The food court unexpectedly halted operations a day before the stall owners were due to receive one of their pay cheques. <br> <br> And because of this, some feared that they would not receive their hard-earned cash. <br> <br> However, Mr Ong says, the operators handed him his pay cheque on time. <br> <br> " I feel a bit happy, but not totally as I need to see if the cheque
              goes through or not. We have received a call from the other tenants
              saying that they have already received their cheques."<br>  <br> The stall owners will be organising a meeting to discuss their next plan of action. <br> <br> That's because some of their leases will expire at the end of the month
              and they are worried the operators will not return them their security
              deposit. <br> <br> Leonard Loo who's a lawyer says, they can pursue legal action if they don't receive their money. <br> <br> "They can sue the landlord for the return of the security deposit. They
              can get a lawyer to issue a letter of demand and if payment is not made
              within a certain time, they can file a claim in court." <br> <br> A spokesperson from Causeway Point says, the food court closure is due
              to some unresolved issues between the operator and its cleaning service
              provider.</p>

              <p><strong>Banquet Holdings to take over Horizon food mall, opens on Thursday </strong></p>
              <p>Horizon Food Mall which closed down over the weekend will resume operations this Thursday under a new operator. <br> <br> Banquet Holdings Pte Ltd will take over the food centre at Causeway Point and rename it Mega Food Mall. <br> <br> It was revealed today the new operator had already signed a lease with
              the shopping mall to take over the food centre on the fifth level of
              the building in January. <br> <br> The company decided to start operations early, after the unexpected closure of Horizon Food Mall on Saturday. <br> <br> Currently 14 out of the 26 food stalls have decided to stay on with the new operator. <br> <br> Banquet Holdings, which operates another food court on the 7th level of
              Causeway point, has also asked the food stall owners for a month’s
              worth of deposit, amounting to $7,000  if they wish to operate till the
              end of next month.</p>

              <p><strong>Mega Food Mall opens for business </strong></p>
              <p>It has shaped up to be a merry Christmas after all for the tenants
              of Horizon Food Mall, which reopened on Thursday under new management
              after a sudden shutdown last weekend.</p>
              <p>But while
              the food stall operators in Causeway Point are glad to recoup losses
              after a week of lost business, they are now grappling with another
              problem - retrieving their deposits from their previous landlord.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Andy Lim, 47, who owns a roast duck and fish soup stall, said he is
              owed $26,000 in deposits. But he estimated that some stallholders who
              rented bigger stalls are owed up to $40,000 by their former landlord, a
              company called Horizon Foodmalls (Causeway).</p>
              <p>On top of that, some stallholders said they are also due their share of the foodcourt's takings for this month.</p>
              <p>Stallholders
              said they have yet to hear from Horizon. Horizon's director, Mr Mark
              Lim, did not answer repeated calls by The Straits Times to his home and
              office.</p>
              <p>The Horizon Food Mall made the news
              earlier this week after its sudden closure last Saturday left tenants
              fretting about lost business.</p>
