              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The issue of good governance has become a more 
              pressing challenge, and nations all over the world, including Singapore 
              and Thailand, must adapt to the changing operating environment, said 
              Foreign Minister K Shanmugam.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He noted that social
               media has altered the way people interact with states and governments, 
              and it is also easier now for people to organise themselves, raise funds
               and make their voices heard.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Shanmugam made 
              the point on Thursday when he co-officiated the 11th Coordinating 
              Meeting of the Thailand-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Programme with 
              his Thai counterpart.<br><br>The theme for this year's meeting was "Good Governance in an Increasingly Complex World".<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said the theme arose from a conversation between Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Thai counterpart Yingluck Shinawatra in
               December 2011.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said Thailand and Singapore are very
               old friends, and that the bilateral ties are underpinned by shared 
              political, strategic and economic interests.<br><br>He added: "These 
              exchanges form the foundation of our people-to-people ties. Our people 
              know each other well. Thai food has long been a favourite cuisine in 
              Singapore, while Thailand remains a popular holiday destination for many
               Singaporeans. <br><br>"Our students have also developed a better 
              understanding of each other's countries, cultures and traditions through
               our school-twinning programmes and student exchanges."<br><br>Echoing 
              Mr Shanmugam's point was Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
              Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul, who said that the Singapore-Thailand 
              bilateral ties are special.  <br><br>He added: "First, it is free from 
              any historical baggage, which allows us to sustain and further build on 
              our cooperation without impediments. <br><br>"Second, it is based on a 
              common vision of looking beyond our bilateral ties by making (the) best 
              use of our bilateral cooperation to support the broader regional 
              interest of an ASEAN community." <br><br>In 2011, bilateral trade 
              totalled S$31.9 billion. Singapore was Thailand's fifth largest trading 
              partner, while Thailand was Singapore's tenth largest trading partner. <br><br>Thailand
               is also an important investment destination for Singapore companies. 
              Many familiar Singapore brands, such as BreadTalk, UOB and Charles &amp;
               Keith have established a presence in Thailand.  <br><br>Singapore 
              investments in Thailand grew by 31 per cent to 25.2 billion baht (S$1 
              billion), making Singapore the second largest foreign investor in 
              Thailand in 2011, after Japan.<br><br>Both foreign ministers also 
              commented on the latest development in the South China Sea dispute -- 
              the decision of the Philippines to initiate an arbitration action 
              against China.<br><br>They emphasised that all parties should pursue peaceful means to settle the dispute.<br><br>Mr
               Surapong said he expects the matter to be discussed during the next 
              Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) between ASEAN and China in March.<br><br>"In
               this regard, Thailand as the country coordinator will carry out close 
              consultation with all parties concerned. So I have instructed my 
              Permanent Secretary as SOM leader to pursue this consultation with 
              China, the Philippines and other parties concerned," he added.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam stressed Singapore's position on the matter.<br><br>He
               said: "Every country in ASEAN decides on its own national policies -- 
              what are in its own interests -- and decides whether it is voting 
              records in the United Nations or specific issues, and ASEAN doesn't seek
               to control national decisions. <br><br>"That's why you have to 
              distinguish between a specific decision by any particular country and an
               ASEAN decision. ASEAN's decision has been set out in the six-point 
              principles." <br><br>On the Philippine decision, he said: "It's a 
              Filipino decision and I am sure they have looked up where their national
               interests are. I can't comment because I am not privy enough to the 
              facts and basis to which the claim is made. I am sure they have studied 
              it. <br><br>"In broad terms, ASEAN's position which Singapore has also 
              put forward is that we should all avoid heightening tensions. We should 
              try and deal with this in a way that reduces tensions in accordance with
               international law, including UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the 
              Law of the Sea) and avoid taking provocative actions." <br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
