              <p><strong>Felicia Chin Says No to Babies and Marriage</strong></p>
              <p>Felicia Chin will soon be taking up the challenge of playing a young
              unmarried mother but out of her reel life, she predicts her marriage
              will come after 30, with no plans for children.</p>
              <p>Baby Bonus, which starts production in June, sees Chin playing
              Apple, a young rebellious girl in her 20s who gets pregnant and drops
              out of school. Without a job, she makes her living by playing
              billiards. The young mother sees her son, named "Olympic", as a burden,
              and leaves him in the care of the neighbours before selling the child.</p>
              <p>Chin,
              who just wrapped up with The Ultimatum, has never imagined taking up
              the role. "When my manager first told me about it, I was quite afraid
              that I might not be suited for the role as a mother yet. After I found
              out that I'll be acting as a young mom, I felt it was time to find some
              babies to practice with."</p>
              <p>Chin also expressed that although she
              does not agree with the irresponsibility of her character, it is
              important to study, understand it, and convince herself, instead of
              jumping to conclusions and stereotypes.</p>
              <p>As for her own plans, the
              24-year-old actress replied, "Honestly, I do not know if I will have
              children in the future. A child is a big responsibility. I'm not
              prepared now and it would be unfair to the children. But if I do want
              to have a child, I will think it through carefully."</p>
              <p>"As for an
              early marriage," Chin continues, "of course, if the right man comes
              along, I will not reject the idea. I can only say that I will most
              probably get married only after 30."</p>
              <p>Following the weddings of
              Fann Wong and Michelle Chia, although not urged, Chin is envious that
              they have found their life partner.</p>
              <p>Felicia Chin's heart breaks for crying children</p>
              <p>This
              is not the first time Chin will play a mother. She had played mothers
              in both The Golden Path and Love Blossom II but only at the end of the
              series. This will be her first time acting with a baby throughout the
              show.</p>
              <p>It has been said that children and animals are the hardest
              to work with. Chin used to be afraid of holding a baby, but with many
              friends and relatives having babies lately, she is getting the hang of
              handling the babies.</p>
              <p>What worries her most now is when the babies
              start to cry. "It is not that I can't stand their crying," she
              explains, "It just breaks my heart to see them so helpless. They are
              crying their eyes dry but you don't know how to comfort them."</p>
              <p>She recalls on final set of Love Blossom II when "her" baby could not stop crying.</p>
              <p>"I hope the baby for the new show doesn't cry constantly. I am still not good at pacifying them."</p>
              <p>Having
              followed the cheerful students of Campus Superstar 2009 through the
              competition, Chin agrees that she has grown more motherly. What she
              imagined first as a big sister role care turned out to that of mother
              hen instead.</p>
              <p>Catch Chin along with other casts like Tay Ping Hui,
              Jesseca Liu, Darren Lim, Terence Cao, Jerry Yeo, Xiang Yun, Zhu Houren
              and Lin Mei Jiao in Baby Bonus when it airs in September.</p>
