              <p><strong>One of 6 deer which escaped Night Safari put to sleep</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : One of the six deer which escaped from the Night 
              Safari last Wednesday has been put to sleep. It had succumbed to heat 
              stroke on Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span> The rest are doing well, and keepers are keeping a close watch on their health. </span></p>
              <p><span> Meanwhile, the search continues for the last of the missing deer. </span></p>
              <p><span>Searchers have stopped sending out big teams as their presence may push the animal further into the forest.
              <br> <br> Instead, they are setting up feeding stations with the deer's favourite 
              food, such as grass and fruit, to try to lure it back into a temporary 
              enclosure in the forest. 
              <br> <br> Mr Kumar Pillai, Director of Zoology, Night Safari, said: "We think the 
              deer could have moved into the forest reserve. What we have done is 
              inform our counterparts in NParks and we have also given them a 
              description of the deer and its ID number."
              <br> <br> Search efforts have been hampered by the wet weather over the weekend, 
              the danger of poachers or even another deer from the wild.
              <br> <br> Mr Pillai said: "My biggest concern is that if any humans out there 
              would try and catch this animal because this animal is quite used to 
              human beings. I hope nobody will set up traps and snares to try and 
              catch this deer.
              <br> <br> "If she gets to pair up with a male, then I don't think she's going to 
              come back to our park. I'll just say she has just introduced some new 
              genes into the wild population."
