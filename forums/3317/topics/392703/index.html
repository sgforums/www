              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Resorts World Sentosa will open the gates of the 
              Universal Studios Singapore theme park on March 18 at 8.28am. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ticket sales for the soft opening phase will begin at 9 am on 
              March 10 and on March 13, the park's first guests will be team members 
              of Resorts World Sentosa, who will be the first to enjoy Universal 
              Studios Singapore with their families.
              <br> <br> As it's still during the theme park's preview phase, there will be 
              limited tickets and certain attractions may be temporarily unavailable 
              as Universal Studios Singapore continues its technical and creative 
              adjustments.
              <br> <br> A news release from Resorts World Sentosa said ticket prices will 
              therefore be partially rebated by shopping and dining vouchers valid for
               use at Universal Studios Singapore.
              <br> <br> Mr Tom Williams, Chairman and CEO, Universal Parks &amp; Resorts, said: 
              "We are thrilled to be taking the next step toward a grand opening, and 
              we are excited that, at Universal Studios Singapore, guests from 
              throughout the region will get to experience the excitement and 
              adventure our parks are so well known for around the world."
              <br> <br> Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, Executive Chairman of Resorts World Sentosa, 
              added, "we are excited to be gearing up to take our first guests on the 
              rides, which are naturally the highlight of the park. This is the 
              region's only Universal Studios theme park, and it will be a tourism 
              crown jewel for not just Singapore, but Asia as a whole."
              <br> <br> Tickets for the preview phase must be purchased online at 
              www.rwsentosa.com, or via phone bookings at +65 6577 8899. 
              <br> <br> Tickets can also be purchased for future dates only at the ticket booths
               from 9am to 6pm daily at Universal Studios Singapore.

              <p><strong>Theme park tickets on sale</strong></p>
              <p>TICKETS for Universal Studios theme park went on sale at 9am on 
              Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>Despite the morning rain, there were at least 20 people 
              queuing in line at the box office in Resorts World Sentosa.</p>
              <p>The overwhelming demand to book tickets on the phone and 
              online caused the website to crash in the morning and the hotline was 
              perpetually busy.</p>
              <p>Engineer Basheer Hamid, 38, was unable to get his tickets 
              and resorted to going down to the site office to get them.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I started calling at 9am sharp on two different 
              phone lines and didn't get to speak to anyone despite being on hold for 
              half an hour. I tried the website but it was also down.'</p>
              <p>The theme park is slated to open on March 18.</p>

              <p><strong>Glitches hit ticket sales</strong></p>
              <p>RESORTS World Sentosa (RWS) was dealt another blow yesterday when a 
              sluggish booking system took centrestage on the day tickets to its star 
              attraction - the Universal Studios theme park - went on sale.</p>
              <p>Perpetually busy phone lines and an equally unresponsive 
              online booking system yesterday left many potential customers of the 
              park - which opens next Thursday - seething with frustration.</p>
              <p>Customers reported long waiting times on the phones almost 
              as soon as sales opened at 9am.</p>
              <p>The situation eased somewhat at about noon, after RWS 
              doubled the number of staff to handle queries.</p>
              <p>But, despite doubling the bandwidth, booking via the 
              Internet was a tedious affair. Customers complained of Web pages taking a
               long time to load and of the site being generally unresponsive.</p>
              <p>Convinced that his own attempts online and by phone were 
              going nowhere, Mr Basheer Hamid felt he had no choice but to make the 
              trip down to the Universal Studios ticketing booths at the resort 
              yesterday.</p>

              <p><strong>Beware pickpockets at opening</strong></p>
              <p>THE police expect opportunistic criminals to be on the prowl at the 
              grand opening of Universal Studios Singapore on March 18, and have 
              warned visitors to be vigilant against pickpockets.</p>
              <p>Visitors are also advised to be considerate and refrain from
               actions that may compromise the safety of others. For instance, they 
              should queue up patiently for rides in an orderly manner.</p>
              <p>Families with children should also supervise their kids at 
              all times to prevent them from wandering off and getting lost.</p>
              <p>The police also gave the following crime prevention tips:</p>
              <p>* When walking in crowded places, be wary of anyone bumping 
              into you and check your valuables immediately if that happens.</p>
              <p>* Do not attract the attention of would-be thieves by 
              exposing cash, valuables or jewellery in public areas.</p>
              <p>* Ensure that your belongings are properly secured and 
              within view when walking;</p>
              <p>* Never leave your valuables unattended.</p>
              <p>Police officers will be deployed on the theme park ground on
               Sentosa , and members of the public can approach them for help, or dial
               999 if they need police assistance or spot any suspicious-looking 
              persons and items.</p>

              <p><strong>SE Asia's first Universal Studios opens in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Southeast Asia's first Universal Studios theme park, 
              featuring rides and attractions from box-office hits such as "Shrek" and
               "Madagascar", opened to enthusiastic crowds in Singapore on Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Hundreds of visitors including foreign tourists lined up to be 
              among the first into the 20-hectare (50-acre) park, part of the 
              US$4.4-billion Resorts World Sentosa casino complex built by Malaysia's 
              Genting Group.
              <br> <br> The casino, Singapore's first, started operations last month as part of a
               drive to draw more visitors to the city-state, which relies on man-made
               attractions to entice tourists.
              <br> <br> Singaporean newlyweds Raymond Ling and Liew See Eng took the day off to 
              try the roller-coaster rides at the seaside amusement centre.
              <br> <br> "The whole goal was to come here first and experience the most 
              terrifying rides. We'll definitely be taking it as many times as we 
              can," Ling told AFP after getting off a ride called "Battlestar 
              Galactica Human".
              <br> <br> "It was very scary! At the first drop, I felt like my heart was going to
               come out," Liew said after their front-seat experience.
              <br> <br> The park has seven zones of movie-themed attractions, including an area 
              devoted to Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" and a version of 
              Hollywood's famous "Walk of Fame".
              <br> <br> Nine-year-old Chai Jing Xuan, a Singaporean girl who was one of the 
              first to try the "Shrek 4D Adventure" ride, gave it a thumbs-up. "The 
              best part of the ride was seeing the donkey. He was very funny," she 
              said.
              <br> <br> Chinese tourist Huang Wenhui, 26, an engineer who was in Singapore for a
               one-day stopover, joined the early crowds. "I'm not a thrill-seeker, 
              but I'm enjoying the whole experience very much," he said.
              <br> <br> The park houses 24 rides and attractions in all, with 18 of them 
              originally designed or adapted for Singapore.
              <br> <br> The theme park is also promoting itself overseas, especially to 
              neighbouring countries.
              <br> <br> Liang Wern Ling, director, Destination Sales, Resorts World Sentosa, 
              said: "Asian markets are our target markets. For example, Malaysia , 
              Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and China. What we have been doing is going
               out to the market itself, talking to travel agents, to our business 
              partners, to create awareness.
              <br> <br> "So basically travel agents are very excited to sell our products. For 
              the next few weeks, we expect to receive more frequent independent 
              travellers, because of the tour groups because this is not actually the 
              travel season for the region."
              <br> <br> Asia's only other Universal Studios movie theme park is located in 
              Japan, while the two others are in California and Florida.
              <br> <br> Under a phased opening, Resorts World Sentosa launched four premium 
              hotels and a shopping and dining strip in January, followed by the 
              casino and a convention centre last month.
              <br> <br> Singapore gave the green light for casino gambling in 2005, hoping to 
              boost the country's tourism appeal and draw more visitors. A marine life
               park, a maritime museum, a spa and two more hotels will open at Resorts
               World Sentosa after 2010.
              <br> <br> Marina Bay Sands, Singapore's second casino complex, is scheduled to 
              open on April 27. It is now being completed by US-based Las Vegas Sands.
              <br> <br> Singapore welcomed 9.7 million visitors last year, down 4.3 per cent 
              from 2008 as the global recession hit travel demand, but arrivals have 
              begun to pick up. There were 908,000 visitors in January, up 17.6 per 
              cent from a year ago.

              <p><strong>Praise for Universal Studios</strong></p>
              <p>ACTRESSES dressed as Hollywood icons such as Marilyn Monroe and 
              prancing lion dancers were in attendance at Sentosa yesterday when the 
              Universal Studios theme park greeted its first visitors at precisely 
              8.28am. The park is the last of the attractions at Resorts World Sentosa
               (RWS) to accept visitors under Phase 1 of its opening.</p>
              <p>Universal Studios' 18 attractions include the Battlestar 
              Galactica roller coaster, several movie-themed thrill rides, and shows 
              like Waterworld, which is based on the movie of the same title.</p>
              <p>Most of the visitors in the early morning crowd of about 200
               yesterday were Singaporeans with children in tow.</p>
              <p>Lawyer Zee Liew, 39, who was with his wife and two sons aged
               eight and six, said the family had checked into the resort's Festive 
              Hotel on Wednesday for a school holiday 'staycation'.</p>
              <p>His elder son, Wei Jin, gave the theme park a big thumbs-up 
              and said the Jurassic Park ride was his favourite.</p>
              <p>For newlyweds Raymond Ling and Liew Soo Eng, the star 
              attraction was the Battlestar Galactica.</p>

              <p><strong>Same-day tickets for Universal Studios on sale from Monday</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Starting Monday, Universal Studios Singapore will 
              release tickets that can be bought on the day itself. </span></p>
              <p><span>Tickets that were sold since the theme park opened on March 18 had
               to be purchased at least a day in advance. 
              <br> <br> But for 600 underprivileged children visited the park on Saturday, they 
              were invited to join in the fun for free.  
              <br> <br> The children from various charities such as Mendaki and the Children's 
              Cancer Foundation arrived early for their one-day visit to Universal 
              Studios Singapore.
              <br> <br> They started their visit by watching a performance at the theatre and 
              they also took part in quizzes.
              <br> <br> Ivan Wong from Make-A-Wish Foundation was of the children. 
              <br> <br> He said: "I took pictures with Kung Fu Panda. Later I am going to take 
              roller coasters."
              <br> <br> Despite the rain, the number one attraction at the park was Battlestar 
              Galactica. 
              <br> <br> Universal Studios Singapore has welcomed thousands of visitors since it 
              opened. And there are plans to admit more. 
              <br> <br> Robin Goh, assistant director, Communications, Resorts World Sentosa, 
              said: "Considering this is only the soft opening phase, and we are only 
              third day into our operations, we have limited the number of tickets 
              that are available, which accounts for the park not looking as crowded 
              as it is. 
              <br> <br> "However, it will be ramped up as we ease in the operations, the rides, 
              and the retail and F&amp;B as well. "
              <br> <br> Resorts World Sentosa is looking into the possibility of extending the 
              theme park's opening hours on weekends. 
              <br> <br> Its opening hours are from 9am to 6pm daily. - CNA/ms </span></p>

              <p><strong>Battlestar Galactica grounded</strong></p>
              <p>IT HAS been just over a week since Universal Studios Singapore 
              opened to excited theme park enthusiasts, but their cries of 
              disappointment were heard not long after. The highly anticipated red and
               blue railed Battlestar Galactica screeched to a halt due to a technical
               glitch.</p>
              <p>While many weren't too happy about it, some of the visitors remained 
              fairly optimistic. Like one man who said that he was disappointed but 
              'the other rides made up for it'.</p>
              <p>For the same reason, Universal Studios Singapore remains an 
              attractive theme park to tourists and Singaporeans alike, who told 
              RazorTV what their favourite rides were. The entrance fees and queues 
              proved to be acceptable as well.</p>
              <p>Unsurprisingly, some visitors were not without complaints, 
              ranging from the short opening hours to the hot weather.</p>
              <p>However, as Universal Studios Singapore is only in its 
              soft-opening stage, there's more to look forward to in the months to 
              come.</p>
              <p>Do you agree with what the visitors are saying about 
              Universal Studios Singapore?</p>

              <p><strong>Battlestar Galactica ride may be closed for weeks</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: It may take weeks or longer before Universal Studios 
              Singapore re—opens its popular ride, the Battlestar Galactica.</p>
              <p>The roller—coaster was shut down on March 25 due to a "technical 
              glitch".</p>
              <p>Universal Studios has kept mum about the nature of the glitch but in
               its latest statement to MediaCorp, the company said the ride is in the 
              process of a complete inspection.</p>
              <p>This includes a review by an investigative team from the ride’s 
              design, engineering and manufacturing company, as well as several expert
               independent assessors.</p>
              <p>The ride has been dismantled and components analyzed, including an 
              X—ray of its parts.</p>
              <p>"It may be weeks or longer before these final conclusions are 
              reached," said Universal Studios Singapore.</p>
              <p>"Any comment prior to the experts reaching their determinations 
              would be purely speculative, so we will wait until the process is 
              complete before we issue any statement as to when the attraction will 
              again be operational and/or the additional testing to be performed in 
              order to prove the safety of the repairs performed."</p>
              <p>Universal Studios Singapore added that the world’s tallest pair of 
              duelling roller coasters will remain closed until all inspections, 
              repairs, and testing are complete.</p>
              <p>"We understand some guests may be disappointed; however, the safety 
              of our employees and guests remains our top priority," the theme park 
              said.</p>
              <p>Police have said Universal Studios Singapore must recommend 
              rectification measures and re—certify the safety of the ride, before its
               licence can be reinstated.</p>
