              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Following its recent move to increase the appeal fee 
              10-fold to S$50, the Subordinate Courts has disclosed that the number of
               criminal appeals has surged in recent years. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At the same time, the number of appeals that were withdrawn or lapsed is also on the rise.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A Subordinate Courts
               spokesperson said: "This contributes to much wasted work as the record 
              of proceedings is prepared and compiled, but the appeal is not 
              eventually heard".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However, lawyers who
               spoke to Channel NewsAsia pointed out that there could be various 
              reasons for the withdrawal of appeals, such as defendants lacking the 
              wish to prolong the agony of defending, or those who feel their chances 
              of succeeding are not high after feeling initially aggrieved by the 
              decision.<br><br>As reported by Channel NewsAsia last week, the Subordinate Courts revised the appeal fee for criminal charges from January 2.<br><br>The fee, paid to obtain a copy of the record of proceedings and grounds of decision, had stood at S$5 since 1985.<br><br>The fee hike has sparked concern among some lawyers that other criminal litigation costs may also increase.<br><br>Both
               the Law Society and the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore 
              (ACLS) -- who were not consulted on the change -- are gathering feedback
               from its members.<br><br>Noting some "grumbling" among members, ACLS 
              president Subhas Anandan said: "If feedback and feelings are strong, we 
              may suggest a meeting with the Subordinate Courts".<br><br>With the 
              exception of white-collar commercial crime, lawyers said that 
              anecdotally, those accused of criminal offences were mostly people 
              without much financial means.<br><br>Lawyer Sng Kheng Huat said: "To some people, the increase appears to be a big jump".<br><br>Mr Sng added that the appeal fee should only go towards covering administration costs.<br><br>But the Subordinate Courts said 47 per cent of accused persons who appealed in 2009 did not have to pay the fee.<br><br>Defendants
               who are unrepresented and serving sentence at the time the fee is 
              payable, and pro bono cases, will have their fees waived. <br><br>A 
              normal record of appeal consists of documents such as charges, statement
               of facts (if a person pleads guilty), the accused person's criminal 
              records, notes of evidence, and the court's grounds of decision.<br><br>The
               Subordinate Courts spokesperson added: "If a matter has gone to trial â€¦
               the record of proceedings often consists of no less than 150 pages, and
               may run into several volumes. In such a case, the S$5 fee is 
              insufficient to even cover the cost of printing the record of 
              proceedings".<br><br>But lawyer Tan Hee Joek said it was "strange" to speak about cost recovery in the context of criminal prosecution.<br><br>Mr Tan said he wondered if this would lead to cost recovery for all failed appeals in the future. <br><br>Pointing
               out that on average, appeals form "less than one per cent of the 
              criminal cases heard", the Subordinate Courts reiterated that the 
              revised fee should not discourage genuine cases.<br><br>Concurring, 
              lawyer Daniel Atticus Xu pointed out that the opportunity to get a High 
              Court Judge to preside over a case with a fine-tooth comb is worth more 
              than the S$50 fee.<br><br>Lawyer Amarick Gill added: "If you feel there are merits in your case, the extra S$45 will not deter you from appealing."<br><br>-- TODAY/wk</span></span></p>
