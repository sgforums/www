              <p>The body of a 47-year-old Australian man has been found in a drain near the Bukit Timah Shopping Centre.</p>
              <p>Police were alerted to the case at about 7.30 this morning, and the man was pronounced dead at around 8am.</p>
              <p>George, who claims to be the man's friend, said the man's name is Steve.</p>
              <p>He said Steve used to run an IT business in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But after his business ended, he returned to Australia.</p>
              <p>And his current visit to Singapore is part of a two-week visit to tie up some loose ends regarding his business.</p>
              <p>Just last night, George had met Steve and a couple of their friends in a bar in Orchard Road to catch up.</p>
              <p>Sadly, that was their last encounter.</p>
              <p>"Very sad, shocked, surprised, still can't believe it. You know last
              night he was happy, and planning the next part of life and today, he's
              dead."</p>
              <p>George added that Steve had no health problems, and couldn't have taken his own life.</p>
              <p>Police have classified the case as unnatural death.</p>
              <p>No foul play is suspected.</p>
