              <p><strong>Public servants have moral authority to uphold: MPs &amp; public</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Members of the public and MPs say they are shocked by
               news that several public servants are involved in an on-going 
              investigation into an online prostitution ring, including an ex-police 
              officer and ex-principal.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They said that 
              public servants, especially those in senior positions or who work 
              closely with minors, have a moral authority to uphold.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Hot on the heels of a
               recent corruption probe involving two senior civil servants, public 
              service officers are again in the spotlight, this time, over suspected 
              involvement with an online prostitution ring.<br><br>Public reaction has been one of dismay, especially over news that an ex-principal may be involved.<br><br>"I
               recognise the fact that this may be his personal life, so what he does 
              outside school is really something between him and his family. But 
              nevertheless, the fact is that he's leading a group of teachers who are 
              expected to be examples, good models for our students. I think it'd be 
              difficult for the teachers to look up to him, if there are moral flaws 
              in his character," said Lim Biow Chuan, Government Parliamentary 
              Committee Chair for Education. <br><br>The former principal, who's said to be 39 years old and married, resigned unexpectedly in December.<br><br>It's
               believed that teachers at the popular primary school were informed of 
              his resignation, but were not told the reason for his departure.<br><br>It's understood that the new school principal told teachers not to speak to media.<br><br>One
               teacher who works at the school in question, said the former principal 
              was very well liked by teachers and students, and most were "crushed" 
              when they found out about the news.<br><br>Described as "warm" and 
              "friendly", the former principal was also said to be a champion of 
              student and teacher welfare, trying to alleviate their workload as much 
              as possible.<br><br>It's understood he also pushed for sports excellence at the school, due to his love for sports.<br><br>Some Singaporeans Channel NewsAsia spoke with felt civil servants have to maintain a high standard of conduct.<br><br>"I
               think it's morally not right and these public servants should be sacked
               on the spot. They make lousy role models for children of our 
              generation," said one member of the public. <br><br>"Depends on what 
              position (they're) holding. If they are in the education ministry or are
               senior MPs or ministers, then I think it's not appropriate," said 
              another. <br><br>Mr Lim said he doesn't think the situation is a 
              widespread issue. But he noted that the Education Ministry may need to 
              review its selection process and see if there are ways to improve the 
              appointment of top leaders in schools.<br><br>Responding to queries from
               Channel NewsAsia, Government Parliamentary Committee Chairman for Law 
              and Home Affairs, Hri Kumar, said: "Civil servants should be expected to
               uphold the reputation and integrity of the civil service, and do 
              nothing to undermine public confidence."<br><br>And while he does not 
              think the recruitment process of public servants is flawed, he noted 
              that "there must be a regular and robust assessment process, and 
              disciplinary issues which surface are dealt with fairly and quickly".<br><br>In 2010, the Public Service Commission disciplined five officers for inappropriate or immoral behaviour.<br><br>According
               to PSC's annual report for the past five years, immoral or 
              inappropriate behaviour was among the top three reasons for disciplinary
               action.<br><br>Authorities have remained tight-lipped over how many public servants are involved in the probe, or how they will be dealt with. <br><br>They say that as investigations are on-going, it is not appropriate to provide further details.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Online commercial sex trade gains prevalence in S'pore</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Private investigators said the online commercial sex trade is gaining prevalence in Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>One private eye said
               the number of enquiries from individuals, who suspect their spouses are
               engaged in the trade, doubles each year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At the red light 
              district of Geylang, brothels and hotels line up the alleyways. But on 
              the online sphere, all one needs to do is click a few buttons to seal an
               arrangement with a sex worker. The key differences are convenience and 
              anonymity.<br><br>Such services are advertised on online forums, and 
              potential customers take their pick from a spectrum of girls, armed with
               vital statistics and even a number to call.<br><br>After booking the 
              services, the call centre notes it in a schedule, and customers can 
              proceed to a designated hotel to complete the transaction.<br><br>One private investigation consultancy said the number of requests it receives to track spouses has doubled. <br><br>Their
               clients suspect their spouses - most of whom are young adults - have 
              been visiting these illegal websites, or even worse, employing the 
              services of these girls.<br><br>David Ng, managing director of DP Quest 
              Investigation Consultancy, said: "We've been getting more enquiries from
               wives who think that their husbands are engaged in online commercial 
              sex trade. So from there, we get the feeling that more and more such 
              syndicates have come up."<br><br>At least four syndicates were reportedly busted last year.<br><br>But it's not as simple as busting a physical prostitution den.<br><br>"The
               movement of the girls working in such a trade is very fluid, and it's 
              difficult to get hold of them... Today they can be in a syndicate, 
              tomorrow if they get busted, then they can move on to another one and 
              work under a different boss," said Mr Ng. <br><br>And with most of the 
              communication taking place online or through text messaging, 
              psychologists said it's easy for those who get addicted to these 
              services, to lead a double life.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
