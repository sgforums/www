              <p>NOW the financial crisis has passed, people here are most concerned 
              with putting more cash aside for retirement and rebuilding their 
              savings, according to a new survey.</p>
              <p>About 70 per cent of respondents believed their Central Provident 
              Fund (CPF) savings will provide only some or a little of their 
              retirement income.</p>
              <p>Of this group, 70 per cent said they already had an 
              alternative plan to supplement their nest egg, although only 27 per cent
               of the total number of respondents had a formal retirement plan.</p>
              <p>The survey, commissioned by global financial services 
              company Citi, found that continuing to work and relying on insurance and
               investments were the most popular ways chosen by people to add to their
               retirement fund.</p>
              <p>About 52 per cent indicated that they would continue to work
               as long as possible. The same number also said they would rely on 
              insurance proceeds, while 51 per cent would turn to investment products.</p>
              <p>About 41 per cent said the total amount of their retirement 
              savings was still behind where it was two years ago, before the crisis, 
              while 45 per cent said this amount remained the same as it was before 
              the crisis.</p>

              <p><br>There's fixed deposit with higher interest.</p>
              <p>But terms and conditions apply for such deposit.</p>
              <p>Normally you have to put in there for a period of time like a few years and there's a minimum sum of money required.</p>
              <p>This is good for conservative investors.</p>

              <p>NOW the financial crisis has passed, people here are most
              concerned with putting more cash aside for retirement and
              rebuilding their savings, according to a new survey.</p>
              <p>About 70 per cent of respondents believed their Central
              Provident Fund (CPF) savings will provide only some or a little of
              their retirement income.</p>
              <p>Of this group, 70 per cent said they already had an alternative
              plan to supplement their nest egg, although only 27 per cent of the
              total number of respondents had a formal retirement plan.</p>
              <p>The survey, commissioned by global financial services company
              Citi, found that continuing to work and relying on insurance and
              investments were the most popular ways chosen by people to add to
              their retirement fund.</p>
              <p>About 52 per cent indicated that they would continue to work as
              long as possible. The same number also said they would rely on
              insurance proceeds, while 51 per cent would turn to investment
              products.</p>
              <p>About 41 per cent said the total amount of their retirement
              savings was still behind where it was two years ago, before the
              crisis, while 45 per cent said this amount remained the same as it
              was before the crisis.</p>
