              <p>After shattering his left heel bone when he fell off a ladder, 
              Chinese national Ah Ping's already difficult life as a labourer in 
              Singapore took a sharp turn for the worse.</p>
              <p>His Singaporean contractor boss refused to file an injury 
              compensation claim with the manpower ministry, fearing it would sully 
              the company's record. When Ah Ping applied for it himself after nine 
              days in hospital, things turned ugly.</p>
              <p>"He came up to me while I was resting and asked me why I filed the 
              claim," said the 23-year-old from Shandong province, in eastern China, 
              his youthful face creased in a frown.</p>
              <p>"He got angry and slapped me in the face, then he raised his fists 
              and punched me," said Ah Ping, who cannot give his full name because he 
              is assisting police with investigations.</p>
              <p>Fleeing the dank, mosquito-ridden warehouse he says his boss forced 
              him to stay in, Ah Ping went to aid group Humanitarian Organisation for 
              Migration Economics (HOME) seeking refuge in their shelter for exploited
               foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Social workers in Singapore are reporting a rise in the number of 
              foreign workers such as Ah Ping who approach them for help with cases 
              ranging from wage disputes to assault.</p>
              <p>Maligned by some Singaporeans for supposedly stealing jobs and 
              causing overcrowding, foreigners holding work permits numbered more than
               870,000 at the end of 2010 out of Singapore's total population of 5.1 
              million.</p>
              <p>They often do the dirty, difficult and dangerous jobs that 
              Singaporeans shun, toiling as maids, construction hands, street 
              sweepers, garbage collectors, cooks and dishwashers as well as lower-end
               factory workers.</p>
              <p>Most come from China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>"We see an average of about 120 to 150 workers a month... four years 
              ago it was less, maybe about 100," said Jolovan Wham, executive director
               of HOME.</p>
              <p>"The cases that we see are mostly about labour exploitation," he told
               AFP in his office as more than 10 workers waited their turn to consult 
              him and his colleagues about their woes.</p>
              <p>Even though the manpower ministry reported a fall in foreign worker 
              complaints from a three-year high of 3,774 in 2009 to 3,200 last year, 
              Wham said the figure was "not reliable" as it focused on only 
              salary-related issues.</p>
              <p>Wham said the liberalisation of Singapore's immigration policies in 
              recent years to bring in more workers to power the labour-starved 
              economy contributed to the growing number of abuse cases.</p>
              <p>"The government sees foreign workers as economic digits, here to help
               grow the economy, so they look at them as commodities," he said.</p>
              <p>The government has slowed down the intake of foreigners since the 
              2009 recession but says the economy cannot function without a steady 
              stream of blue-collar workers.</p>
              <p>The presence of so many foreign workers in a densely populated 
              city-state has become a hot issue in Singapore and the debate reached a 
              crescendo in the campaign for last month's general elections, raising 
              fears of more abuse.</p>
              <p>Migrant worker rights advocacy group Transient Workers Count Too 
              (TWC2) reported an increase in the number of foreign workers seeking 
              help to 2,178 last year, from 2,087 in 2009, and fears the number may 
              rise again.</p>
              <p>TWC2 executive director Vincent Wijeysingha, who lost as an 
              opposition candidate in the May election, said the manner in which 
              immigration was discussed during the campaign could hurt foreign workers
               even more.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately what the elections did, and we politicians must 
              shoulder our share of responsibility for it, is that a xenophobic 
              approach to foreigners could become widespread," Wijeysingha told AFP.</p>
              <p>"In other countries, when a politician says something that could be 
              viewed as xenophobic, a spike in hate crime sometimes results. It may 
              not be entirely different in Singapore."</p>
              <p>Before the elections, xenophobic sentiment had surfaced in scattered 
              incidents, including one in 2008 when residents of an affluent suburb 
              protested against the building of a foreign worker dormitory in their 
              estate.</p>
              <p>The residents petitioned the government to drop the plan, saying the 
              dormitory -- separated from the estate by a road -- would "create 
              security and social problems and spoil the ambiance of the estate".</p>
              <p>Authorities still approved the project but advised the dormitory 
              operator to consider chartering buses to ferry workers to popular 
              destinations in order to prevent them from congregating within the 
              estate.</p>
              <p>Ah Ping, the Chinese worker who accused his boss of beating him up 
              over an injury compensation claim, now worries about how he is going to 
              repay a 470,000 yuan ($72,400) bank loan he took out to pay a middleman 
              to get a job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>An only child, he also needs to support his parents, whom he has not seen since he came to Singapore two-and-a-half years ago.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes I listen to the old songs my mum used to sing on the radio
               and...," Ah Ping mused, his voice trailing off as he looked away into 
              the distance.</p>

              <p>Actually why do they assume it is always Singaporean Bosses? I

              <p>these are mainly uneducated people.  they are not tech savvy or educated like you and i. </p>
              <p>whats so surprising about them getting 'conned' by those greedy contractors?</p>
              <p>if there's anything we can learn from all this that's we should appreciate how 'lucky' we are to be borne in singapore.</p>
