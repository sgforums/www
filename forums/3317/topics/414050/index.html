The Professor and the very bright student.</a></h3>
              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Reading the article of the state controlled newspaper Channelnewsasia of May 13, 2008 titled "The Professor and the very bright student" you would be forgiven if you mistook it for a love story of how 2 lovers met, rather than believe it or not, how the Singapore government appointed the young Tamil Indian S Shanmugam Minister for Law in the cabinet.<br><br>You must read this newspaper article to appreciate my point. Internet edition of Channelnewsasia of may 13, 2008.<br><br>From the article, one thing is certain. This young man's entry into politics, his joining a law firm, his being given law cases and ultimately being appointed Minister for Law has all been orchestrated and arranged by Professor Jayakumar the immediate past Minister for Law, both Tamil Indians by the way.<br><br>Please don’t think even for one moment that this whole thing is even remotely related to politics as one would ordinarily expect in a democratic country. The tarpaulin covering on the outside claims it to be a democracy. In the inside, it is no different from the Soviet era Deutche Democratishe Republic or the DDR or East Germany as it was called in the west.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The love story starts more than 2 decades ago when a young man walked into Professor Jayakumar's constitutional law class at National University of Singapore when the Professor immediately noticed; or rather fell in love with the said young man. Nothing short of love at first sight.</span></span></strong><br><br>The article claims that as soon as the said young man, the present Minister for Law walked into his constitutional law class, the Professor immediately knew that that this was the man, or the chosen one.<br><br>There was an unmistakable chemistry in the air. Had the young man been a woman instead, it looks as if Jayakumar, the Professor would have dropped everything and proposed on the spot!<br><br>S<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">ince the Professor had no doubt at all that this young man, S Shanmugam was indeed the protégé, like the new found infant Dalai Lama, when the strongman Lee Kuan Yew wanted a name for the future Minister for Law, Mr. S Shanmugam, the new found love of the professor, was immediately recommended.</span></span></strong><br><br>There are even more touching passionate encounters in this long love story.<br><br>Professor Jayakumar tearfully recalls during one private moment between his new found love S Shanmugam and himself, when the professor popped the question of marriage, no not marriage, but whether S Shanmugam would join politics; the professor recalls with great emotion and tears almost rolling down his cheeks that he noticed his love, S Shanmugam nearly fell off the chair.<br><br>Although this is not mentioned, I am taken to understand from inner circles, that the Professor immediately ran to cushion his beloved from the fall thereby ensuring the young man was not hurt at all.<br><br>Not even a scratch, thank God.<br><br>Even today, when Professor Jayakumar recalls that moment, he cannot help tears welling in his eyes. The moment was extremely passionate, which Jayakumar cherishes even till this day and swears never to forget it until he is dead!<br><br>Imagine that. It seems when Jayakumar the Professor had asked the question, the young man was surprised why he was chosen. In utter surprise at the question, as was earlier mentioned, he nearly fell off the chair and was rescued by the gallant Professor in the nick of time at great danger to himself!<br><br>One thing is clear in the strange island of Singapore.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It appears this man S Shanmugam, had no intention of joining politics at all!<br></span></span></strong><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It seems from the article that it was only with great difficulty in persuasion that he was finally made to join politics</span></span></strong>. A strange parliamentary democracy indeed where<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> reluctant people are coerced and threatened to enter politics and made to rule over Singaporeans!</span></span></strong><br><br>It seems the odd entry into politics of a reluctant candidate was not only in S Shanmugam's case.<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Surprisingly, even the Professor Jayakumar himself, the recent Minister for Law was himself completely averse to politics. In fact, he himself states that he joined politics with great reluctance and did it as a duty to his country.</span></span></strong><br><br>If I could see Jayakuamr, I would tell him that he should have done whatever he wanted and stop trying to imply that he is some kind of a Godsend for all of us. It would have made no difference had it been a donkey instead of him.<br><br>Coming back to the intimate private tryst between the lovers Jayakumar and S Shanmugam, in their meeting of love, it appears that the young man was wearing a hat and there was a ring in the private room and when he was thus provoked with the question of politics, this boy Shanmugam forthwith took off his hat and gallantly threw it into the ring aforementioned. Why he did what he did and did it mean anything, that is throwing his hat into the ring, is a puzzle we will never know!<br><br>It seems that this new discovery S Shanmugam had told everyone in the People's Action Party or Lee's party that his ambition had all along been to become the best lawyer in Singapore. There is no doubt when the members of the said party was thus informed, immediately after he graduated as the best law student in Singapore tutored under the passionate arms of none other than Professor Jayakumar, he was immediately invited to join the largest law firm in Singapore where the lawyers are all Lee's party members and immediately given all the biggest cases, thereby making sure that his ambition was achieved to the letter.<br><br>Jayakumar states that his love S Shanmugam was never too far out his sight and he was arranging for this young man to become his successor when he left the post of Minister for Law.<br><br>It seems, according to the Professor, there was a lot of talk and private discussions behind closed doors as to whether it should be this man who was to be anointed Minster for Law, but his love the professor states unequivocally, he had no doubt whatsoever.<br><br>At the end of this story, the professor tearfully leaves his position he held as Minister for 26 years only to hand that position to his chosen love S Shanmugam.<br><br>I am not sure if Hollywood had gotten wind of this heartwarming love story between professor and student, somewhat in the lines of the Oscar winner Brobeck Mountain, but we will never know.<br><br>And all this has happened in Lee Kuan Yew's definition of a First World Democracy, none other than Singapore. If you are shocked, I don’t blame you.<br><br>As I had said in the past, had it not been for his part the professor and Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore strongman, it would have made no difference if this S Shanmugam was wearing the Tamil sarong, smoking a beedi, spitting betelnut all over the place and frying the Indian pancake "thosay" and stall 231, Tekka Market in Serangoon Road, Little India, Singapore, at $2 a piece.<br><br>By the way, you must read the Channelnewsasia article please.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</div>

What a miserable life.</a></h3>
              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Straits Times, the Singapore state controlled newspaper in a story dated March 30, 2008 "Loss to law profession, but gain for Singapore" is all praise for Mr. K Shanmugam, Lee Kuan Yew's Member of Parliament on his promotion as Minister for Law. Is this really, all glory for this man, or is it in truth, misery?<br><br>Just look at him. He is an Indian lawyer selected many years ago by Lee Kuan Yew to join his party and become a Member of Parliament. Knowing Singapore as a one party state under Lee Kuan Yew, you know how this works.<br><br>His main qualification from the beginning is complete loyalty to one man, Lee Kuan Yew. Meaning exactly that. A complete and utter subservience to him. And the willingness to carry out his any command, just as a dog will faithfully carry out his master's orders. His principle ambition being all along to catch Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's eye which he succeeded. Never mind what sort of a tyrant he may be.<br><br>Well he succeeded in his ambition to serve his master. He was chosen by Lee, lucky for him; or is it really? And all these years he does Lee’s bidding. Saying anything he wants said. Doing anything he wants done.<br><br>All because it is highly profitable.<br><br>And during all these years as Member of Parliament, no Singaporeans has any respect for him. None at all. Indeed they don’t even care who or what he is. He merely goes about doing his job. His job includes sitting at resident committee meetings and the monthly meet the people sessions, which he does mechanically. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He always contests elections in Group Representation Constituencies because there is a doubt whether he will win a single seat constituency, because he is an Indian in a majority Chinese country.</span></strong><br><br>But he always wins elections because his master, Lee Kuan Yew sees to it. Any opposition contender is defamed derided sued and sent to jail if they challenge him. With Lee Kuan Yew's blessing and protection, this man survives as a Member of Parliament and now as a Minister.<br><br>If the next moment, Lee withdraws his support, Mr. K Shannmugam will no longer be Member of Parliament, let alone Minister. He will be selling "thosai", the Indian pancake along Serangoon Road next to Norris Road. He won’t be wearing fancy suits anymore but instead the Indian lungi, and chewing betel nut! He is not master of his destiny, Lee Kuan Yew is.<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Within Singapore, in reality he represents no one. No one is bothered about him, or even knows anything about him. In fact no body cares two hoots, whether he is dead or alive.</span></strong><br><br>The state controlled newspaper the Straits Times will of course put out the standard propaganda that he is brilliant, that he is smart and that he is none other than superman. But just like everything else the state controlled paper will say; the people just ignore it.<br><br>This man may go abroad, meet foreign governments and politicians. But foreign politicians are not like him. They, being true politicians, truly representative of their people, look upon this man as nothing more than Lee Kuan Yew's page boy. They have no respect for him. They know he is not truly a politician. He is a mere employee selected by Lee Kuan Yew to play the part of a politician. Like me, they also know that the moment Lee tires of him, he will very probably, end up selling the Indian pancake at the aforementioned location at Serangoon Road.<br><br>If this man's life is a happy one; or a shameful disgraceful and miserable one, I leave it to you to decide.<br><br>Let’s look at someone else. Let’s look at Dr. Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore Democratic Party. Dr. Chee is not a Member of Parliament. In fact he is a bankrupt. He was bankrupted by Lee Kuan Yew because he crossed his path. He is not rich as Mr. K Shanmugam. He is defamed and demonized in Singapore’s state controlled paper by Lee Kuan Kew. Lee calls him a liar, a cheat and a rascal.<br><br>But despite all that Lee says, the situation is quite the opposite. The people respect him. The people know him as a true leader. He is not beholden to anyone. He speaks his mind; unlike Shanmugam who says what he is told to say. A great number of Singaporeans read what he has to say. They listen to his speeches and they are interested in his actions. Not only in Singapore, but throughout the world, Dr. Chee is respected. In reality, Dr. Chee stands as a giant, next to this man Shanmugam; no better than Lee’s poodle.<br><br>The European Parliament has honored Dr. Chee. He has won many world leadership awards. World leaders respect him as a force for freedom and democracy. He is unable to travel because Lee refuses to let him. He is in effect a prisoner within Singapore. But world leaders are constantly monitoring his circumstances. They care for him. They worry about him. They know him. They respect him. They continue to lodge protests against Singapore for denying his human rights. Dr. Chee is seen as a true leader, a true fighter for democracy and human rights. He is not a Minister in Lee Kuan Yew's cabinet but he remains a giant before this Mr. Shanmugam.<br><br>World leaders on the other hand have never heard of Mr. Shanmugam. Had it not been for the state controlled newspaper the Straits Times, Singaporeans would not have known him either!<br><br>Mr. Shanmugam lives his life at the mercy and pleasure of Lee Kuan Yew, the authoritarian ruler of Singapore because it is profitable. Dr. Chee lives as a free man with a conviction and a purpose in life.<br><br>Despite all the worldly pleasures, it can only be said that Mr. K Shanmugam lives a miserable life. He is not a free man. He is on Lee Kuan Yew's short leash. Dr. Chee Soon Juan on the other hand, is a giant, lives as a free and happy man; a man respected not only by Singaporeans but by politicians and people all over the world.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</div>
