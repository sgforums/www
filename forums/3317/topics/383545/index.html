              <p><strong>Main points of Obama's new Afghanistan plan</strong></p>
              <p>WEST POINT - In a landmark speech Tuesday at the US Military Academy at West Point, President Barack Obama outlined a new plan for winning the war in Afghanistan and bringing US troops home.<br><br>Here are the main points of Obama's plan to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and prevent the Taliban Islamist insurgency from providing it a safe haven:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>30,000 additional troops:</strong></span><br><br>Stressing that a troop surge was "in our vital national interest," Obama ordered a swift surge of 30,000 new US troops to Afghanistan within six months to "seize the initiative" and finally end the unpopular eight-year war.<br><br>Pentagon officials said an initial US Marine deployment would arrive in country by Christmas.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A way home beginning in mid-2011:</strong></span><br><br>Obama insisted he will start bringing back US troops beginning July 2011.<br><br>"After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan."<br><br>"We must deny Al-Qaeda a safe haven:"<br><br>Like the George W. Bush administration before it, the Obama administration says the Islamist Taliban in Afghanistan harbors Al-Qaeda extremists.<br><br>Obama said the extra US troops will help eliminate Al-Qaeda safe havens along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Additional international troops:</strong></span><br><br>"This is not just America's war," Obama insisted, stepping up the pressure on NATO allies to match him by providing more troops.<br><br>In a fact sheet released during Obama's speech, the White House said "we will be discussing additional alliance contributions - in troops, trainers, and resources - in the days and weeks ahead."<br><br>US officials in Kabul say there are about 70,000 US troops in the country, plus around 42,000 more from allied nations.<br><br>Handing over responsibility to the Afghans:<br><br>Obama set as a priority the expanded training of a competent Afghan security force to take over from international forces and put the future of the country in Afghan hands.<br><br>The additional US troops "will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces."<br><br>US forces would continue to advise and assist Afghan forces, Obama said, "but it will be clear to the Afghan government - and, more importantly, to the Afghan people - that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Capacity building for civil society:</strong></span><br><br>Obama said a "civilian surge" in Afghanistan was necessary and that the United States would work closely with the United Nations and Afghans to build capacity in the country.<br><br>But Obama stressed such US aid would be based on performance, and that "the days of providing a blank check are over."<br><br>His administration would work with Afghan ministries and local leaders who "combat corruption and deliver for the people," and implement a civilian-military agriculture redevelopment strategy to help restore the country's once vibrant agriculture sector.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Taliban amnesty:</strong></span><br><br>The White House said a key element of its political strategy "will be supporting Afghan-led efforts to reintegrate Taliban who renounce Al-Qaeda, lay down their arms, and engage in the political process."<br><br>An effective partnership with Pakistan:<br><br>Obama insisted that success in Afghanistan "is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan," and said the United States is committed to an expanded partnership with Afghanistan's nuclear-armed neighbor.<br><br>He announced US intention to strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target extremist groups and make it clear to Islamabad that Washington would no longer tolerate Al-Qaeda safe havens in Pakistan.<br><br>He also reiterated Washington's support for Pakistan's democracy and development, pledging that "America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent."</p>

              <p><strong>SAF to send 13-man medical team to Afghanistan</strong></p>
              <p><span class="update">Posted: 26 November</span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: On the heels of other successful deployments to
              Afghanistan, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will next month send a
              13-man medical team to a field hospital in Tarin Kowt, Oruzgan, for a
              stint until March 2010.
              <br> <br>The team will provide emergency medical support, primary healthcare
              and pre- and post-operative medical care to the International Security
              Assistance Force, the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan
              locals.
              <br> <br>Announcing this on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Defence
              Minister Teo Chee Hean presented the Overseas Service Medal (OSM) to 64
              SAF personnel.
              <br> <br>One 54-man medical team performed over 100 surgeries in their
              two-week stint helping victims of October's earthquake in Pariaman,
              West Sumatra.
              <br> <br>Six others oversaw the construction of a paediatric and women's
              ward at the Bamiyan Provincial Hospital, Afghanistan. Other recipients
              were two SAF personnel who served in the United Nations Mission in
              Timor-Leste, while a pair facilitated logistics support for deployments
              in Afghanistan.
              <br> <br> Moreover, 45 Singapore Civil Defence Force officers received Overseas Service medals on Wednesday night.
              <br> <br>Forty-two were part of Operation Lionheart, involved in the search
              and rescue efforts after the Padang earthquake. Three others were part
              of the UN Disaster Relief Efforts following Tropical Storm Ketsana and
              Parma in the Philippines.</span></p>
