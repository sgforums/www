              <p><strong>Man gets 24 months' probation, mobile phone ban for taking upskirt 
              photos</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A 25-year-year old man has been sentenced to 24 
              months' probation for capturing images up the skirts of five women. </span></p>
              <p><span> He is also banned from using mobile phones that can be used to take 
              pictures. </span></p>
              <p><span> Gary Huang Kun Jie had pleaded guilty to the charges in April. </span></p>
              <p><span> He had used his mobile phone camera to take photographs of the five 
              women's underwear between January 9 and 14 last year. </span></p>
              <p><span> Shortly before his arrest, Huang had entered a lift with one of the 
              victims at Block 875, Yishun Avenue 1 at around 8.30pm on January 14. </span></p>
              <p><span>He then secretly took a photograph of her underwear as the lift 
              was going up. 
              <br> <br> She turned around and saw him holding his mobile phone under her skirt. 
              <br> <br> The woman demanded that Huang handed over his phone and he soon admitted
               that he had snapped the photograph without her consent.
              <br> <br> The woman immediately told her husband about the incident. 
              <br> <br> Her spouse lodged a police report at around 9.20pm and the authorities 
              arrived soon afterwards. 
              <br> <br> They seized Huang's mobile phone and found more than 90 video clips of 
              unknown women in it. 
              <br> <br> All of them were taken inside lifts at different locations. 
              <br> <br> A district court on Monday heard that based on medical reports, Huang is
               suffering from a mental condition known as paraphilia.
              <br> <br> It is a disorder where a patient obtains sexual gratification from 
              unusual practices.
              <br> <br> Deputy Public Prosecutor Agnes Chan told District Judge Soh Tze Bian 
              that during his probation, Huang has to follow up with psychiatric and 
              psychological treatment.
              <br> <br> Huang's parents must also supervise his access to image-capturing 
              devices such as cameras and video recorders.
              <br> <br> In addition, they have to supervise his Internet usage to better manage 
              his access to pornography.
              <br> <br> His probation review will be conducted in six months' time.
              <br> <br> For each charge, Huang could have been sentenced to a maximum of a 
              year's jail and fined. </span></p>
