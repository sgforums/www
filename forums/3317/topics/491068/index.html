Increased police presence (roadblocks), screaming ambulances attending to BOTH the lifestyle sick and victims of terror + funeral processions would surely grind the transportation network to a total halt and damage the Singapore economy almost irrecoverably. Adopt bicycle transportation at that point U say?: I don't think it would be easily implementable then, at least not in chaos situation where many are psychologically unbalanced and physically weak by that point in time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is no further need to remind that the stink raised about Singapore's high greenhouse emissions does not endear our country to the world.</span> <br>UN funds would probably be tied up in helping refugees relocate from flood inundated areas of the world: Singapore, with its high per-capita GDP and astronomical defense budget would probably be last in line for UN disaster relief funding.
