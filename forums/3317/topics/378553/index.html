              <p>BANGKOK â€“ U.N. climate
              talks in Bangkok will end Friday without progress on the pressing
              issues of emission targets for rich countries and financing for poor
              nations, who insist they will not sign a global warming deal unless
              those matters are resolved.</p>
              <p>For months, negotiations have been
              deadlocked and delegates have begun raising doubts whether a new
              climate pact to rein in greenhouse gases can be reached by the time
              world leaders gather in Copenhagen in December. The pact would replace
              the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012.</p>
              <p>Rather than
              addressing the tough issues, U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer said late
              Thursday that the failure by rich countries to agree on ambitious
              emission cuts and billions of dollars in financing to help poor
              countries adapt to climate change has increased the distrust between
              the two sides.</p>
              <p>"People in this negotiating process mainly
              developing countries say we have been engaging constructively over the
              past two weeks to put meat on the bones of an agreed outcome in
              Copenhagen," de Boer said.</p>
              <p>"But we are not seeing an advance on
              the key political issues," he said. "The stark reality out there is
              that unless we see an advance on the key political issues, it is very
              difficult for negotiators in this process to continue their work in
              good faith."</p>
              <p>Even before the talks ended Friday afternoon,
              environmentalists including the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace were
              already criticizing governments for leaving the fundamental issues to
              future meetings in Barcelona next month.</p>
              <p>"With only five
              negotiating days, we can't continue to waste time on missing political
              mandates," the WWF's Kim Carstensen told The Associated Press.</p>
              <p>"My
              concern is that without political clarity from capitals on issues like
              finance, emission reduction targets and how we get developing country
              actions to count in the international framework, the next meeting in
              Barcelona will be another talk shop without the political breakthroughs
              we need," Carstensen said.</p>
              <p>Most countries want a new climate
              pact that includes measures limiting temperature increases to 2 degrees
              Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, a level
              necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But so far,
              there is no consensus on how to reach that goal.</p>
              <p>Industrialized
              nations have offered emission cuts of 15 to 23 percent below 1990
              levels by 2020 _ far short of the 25 to 40 percent cuts scientists and
              activists say are needed to keep temperature increases below 2 degrees
              Celsius.</p>
              <p>In the United States, which rejected the Kyoto
              Protocol because it exempted countries like India and China from
              obligations, a bill that passed the House of Representatives would
              reduce emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels _ about 4 percent below
              1990 levels _ by 2020. The Senate is considering its own bill that
              would cut emissions 20 percent.</p>
              <p>Only Norway announced a new
              target at the meeting, saying it would reduce by 40 percent, up from a
              previous commitment of 30 percent, by 2020.</p>
              <p>Developing
              countries have said they want to do their part but have refused to
              agree on binding targets and want to see more ambitious cuts by the
              West. They won't sign any deal until the West guarantees tens of
              billions of dollars in financial assistance.</p>
              <p>During the Bangkok
              meetings, there were several studies highlighting the cost of paying
              for mitigation and adaptation. The World Bank estimated it would cost
              as much as $100 billion a year through 2050 for adaptation while the
              International Energy Agency estimated it would cost $10 trillion over
              the next 20 years if the world wants to transition to a clean economy _
              three-quarters of the funding coming from rich countries.</p>
              <p>But
              there were no breakthroughs on either a finance package or targets,
              delegates said, mostly because countries did not send their top leaders
              to this meeting. The United States also was hamstrung, delegates said,
              because it still does not have domestic climate legislation.</p>
