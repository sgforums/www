              ordered to be given eight strokes of the cane for molesting a young boy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Desiyantoh Zainal, 
              was naked from the waist down when he grabbed the 10-year-old and 
              molested him at an HDB staircase landing in Bukit Batok on March 15.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He had approached 
              the boy and his eight-year-old cousin at a staircase landing of the 
              block of flats before asking them their names. Failing to get a reply, 
              Desiyantoh grabbed hold of his victim's left arm and pulled the boy 
              towards him just as he was about to run away.<br><br>He then restrained the youngster and outraged his modesty.<br><br>Assistant
               Public Prosecutor Jayarajan GK said that the 27-year-old Desiyantoh had
               been convicted of similar offences in the past.<br><br>He was fined 
              S$2,000 in 2004 for exposing himself in public. Three years later, he 
              was sentenced to three years' jail and five strokes of the cane for the 
              same offence as well as molest.<br><br>APP Jayarajan said that 
              Desiyantoh "had not learnt his lesson" and pressed for a jail term of up
               to six years plus caning. Defence counsel, Sunil Sudheesan, however 
              pleaded for a "non-crushing sentence", saying that the offence was not 
              pre-meditated.<br><br>The lawyer added that in the past ten to twelve 
              years, his client had issues with sexual offences which were "not 
              exactly natural".<br><br>To address the problem, Mr Sudheesan said that 
              Desiyantoh's medical report could be sent to the prison authorities so 
              that he can be counselled by psychiatrists within the facility.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
