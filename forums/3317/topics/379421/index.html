              <p><strong>MM Lee receives lifetime achievement award in Washington DC</strong></p>
              <p><span>WASHINGTON: Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has been given a lifetime achievement award in Washington. </span></p>
              <p><span>He used the occasion at the US-Asean Business Council event on
              Wednesday to urge the United States to remain engaged in Asia or risk
              losing global influence.
              <br> <br>Former US presidents George H W Bush and Bill Clinton sent messages
              of support, as did President Obama whom he will meet at the White House
              on Thursday.
              <br> <br>Mr Clinton said: "His work as Prime Minister and now as Minister
              Mentor has helped literally millions of people from Singapore and all
              across Southeast Asia live better, more prosperous lives."
              <br> <br> Mr Bush said: "All of us who have worked with him have benefited from his wisdom, his insight and his dedication."
              <br> <br> The Minister Mentor received the lifetime achievement award witnessed by US foreign policy giants like Henry Kissinger.
              <br> <br>Mr Kissinger said: "He has become a seminal figure for all of us.
              As I've said, I've known him for 40 years. I would say I have learned,
              I've not learned as much from anybody as I have from Lee Kuan Yew."
              <br> <br>After receiving the award, Mr Lee praised President Obama for
              effectively replacing the Group of Eight group of nations with the
              broader G20 at a recent summit in Pittsburgh.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "The American President has taken a realistic view of
              the changed world, although for the next two or three decades, America
              will remain the sole superpower."
              <br> <br> And on the evening before his visit to the White House, the Minister Mentor also offered some advice to President Obama.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "If the US does not recognize that the Asia-Pacific is
              where the economic centre of action will be, then it loses that
              economic superiority or that lead that it has in the Pacific; it will
              lose it worldwide."
              <br> <br>The advice comes as America's Commander-in-Chief prepares to visit
              Asia, where he will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
              summit in Singapore.
