              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) â€“ On
              a clear day, you can see Indonesia's Riau islands from the top of The
              Pinnacle@Duxton, a cluster of 50-storey buildings with spectacular
              views of Singapore's waterfront and financial district.</p>
              <p>But the seven towers of <span id="lw_1267032826_0" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">The Pinnacle</span> do not host corporate headquarters, a five-star hotel or luxury apartments.</p>
              <p>It is a <span id="lw_1267032826_1" class="yshortcuts">public housing project</span>, the tallest and most ambitious ever undertaken by a city-state that prides itself on almost universal <span id="lw_1267032826_2" class="yshortcuts">home ownership</span> after four decades of rapid progress.</p>
              <p>Boasting 1,848 flats with condominium-like finishes and costing up to 645,800 <span id="lw_1267032826_3" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Singapore dollars</span> (461,000 US) for prime units, The Pinnacle has taken <span id="lw_1267032826_4" class="yshortcuts">public housing</span> to new heights in property-obsessed <span id="lw_1267032826_5" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>.</p>
              <p>The price tag may seem high for a public apartment, but the project is
              located in the city centre and a comparable unit would cost a million
              Singapore dollars or more in a private condominium out in the suburbs.</p>
              <p>"It has certainly turned the notch a mark higher. With the Pinnacle,
              (the government) has sent the message that public housing can include
              good <span id="lw_1267032826_6" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">urban designs</span> and lifestyle elements," said Chua Yang Liang, head of research and consultancy for property advisers <span id="lw_1267032826_7" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in <span id="lw_1267032826_8" class="yshortcuts">Southeast Asia</span>.</p>
              <p>The view from the 156-metre (511-foot) rooftop garden is so good that
              outsiders willingly pay an entrance fee of five Singapore dollars to
              take in the scenery and shoot pictures and videos.</p>
              <p>"We came here just to see it because it's the only HDB flat like this,"
              said Nur Rashida Bte Naha, a 42-year-old part-time nurse who visited
              the complex with her husband and three sons on a recent Sunday
              afternoon.</p>
              <p>The HDB is the <span id="lw_1267032826_9" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Housing and Development Board</span>,
              a powerful agency whose projects have taken Singaporeans out of the
              slums and ghettos that once blighted the island and into multi-storey <span id="lw_1267032826_10" class="yshortcuts">apartment buildings</span> surrounded by shops, markets, banks, transport links and other essentials.</p>
              <p>More than 80 percent of Singaporeans live in HDB housing, and 95
              percent of residents own their flats, according to the agency's website.</p>
              <p>The agency has built more than 900,000 apartments since the 1960s, with
              recent HDB offerings like The Pinnacle a far cry from the early flats
              which were largely unfurnished, came with bare cement floors, squat
              toilets and lifts that did not stop on every floor.</p>
              <p>Savings stashed by Singaporeans in a compulsory national pension scheme
              are used to finance HDB mortgages, creating a permanent pool of funds.</p>
              <p>Public housing neighbourhoods are designed so that residents in the
              multi-ethnic nation have common areas to interact in a bid to promote
              racial harmony.</p>
              <p>The HDB has also put in place ethnic eligibility quotas for buyers to prevent racial enclaves from forming.</p>
              <p>"The idea of having a certain percentage of other races in a particular
              area, this is important," said Ho Kong Chong, an associate professor
              with the <span id="lw_1267032826_11" class="yshortcuts">National University of Singapore's sociology</span> department.</p>
              <p>"In other countries, if you look at the example of France, where the migrants converge in certain districts, you will have <span id="lw_1267032826_12" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">ethnic enclaves</span> and then there will be certain problems and issues of not being able to
              understand different ethnicities and backgrounds," he told AFP.</p>
              <p>The Pinnacle is a pet project of <span id="lw_1267032826_13" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew</span>,
              the longtime member of parliament for the district where it stands, and
              the design was the result of an international competition won
              eventually by a local firm of architects.</p>
              <p>The apartments' interiors, including glazed ceramic floors in the
              living and dining rooms and timber-strip floors in the bedrooms,
              reflect the country's growing affluence.</p>
              <p>Prospective buyers of new HDB flats have to take part in a
              lottery, and the lucky ones who were able to purchase units at The
              Pinnacle when it opened in December are delighted.</p>
              <p>Resident Jeremy Gan, 31, who bought a unit for 358,000 dollars
              with his fiancee, said he was attracted by its prime location and the
              convenience of having two train stations nearby.</p>
              <p>"We feel lucky having a home here because we didn't think we
              would get it. It's the cream of the crop for HDB now, so we are very
              happy," said Gan, who is planning a wedding ceremony at the rooftop
              garden in October.</p>
              <p>"It's an investment. It's worth it in the long run," he said.</p>
