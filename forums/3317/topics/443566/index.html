              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Fewer young working adults appear keen to pursue further education at a time when the economy is doing well.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>According to the 
              2011 JobsCentral Learning Rankings &amp; Survey, 69.6 per cent of young 
              working adults intend to pursue further education, the lowest percentage
               since the survey started in 2009.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The number was 71.4 per cent in 2010 and 79.3 per cent in 2009.<br><br>CEO
               of JobsCentral Group, Mr Lim Der Shing, attributed the decline to the 
              current economic situation in Singapore of strong performance and 
              near-full employment. <br><br>He said young working adults feel more secure in their jobs and hence feel less of a need to upgrade right now.<br><br>He
               believes the trend of learning and upgrading remains intact and will 
              reassert itself if there's a recession or downturn in 2012.<br><br>The 
              survey also found that 70.3 per cent of of respondents expect pay 
              increases of at least 25 per cent after they have obtained their next 
              level of academic qualifications. <br><br>One in five respondents, or 22.8 per cent, indicated that they expect to be paid 50 per cent more. <br><br>"For
               most employers, pay raise decisions are usually made based on job 
              performance improvement, increased job responsibility or increased scope
               of work.<br><br>"As such, professionals who expect pay raises simply 
              because of higher educational qualifications may find themselves 
              disappointed if they do not take on more work and responsibility at the 
              same time," said Mr Lim.<br><br>A total of 3,413 respondents took part in the survey, which was conducted online from August to September this year.<br><br>The survey respondents were mostly young working adults aged 21-40 years.<br><br>Another
               noteworthy finding is that recognition of certification is the most 
              important factor for them when choosing the institution to study in.<br><br>It's followed by reputation, course fees, syllabus, lecturers and facilitators.<br><br>Business
               Studies is the most popular course (42.1 per cent), followed by project
               management, communications/media, engineering and hospitality/tourism.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>your pay is also dependent on the sector you are working in. generally, petrochem companies pay more than lets say manufacturing companies.</p>
              <p>Yes, qualifications affects your starting pay, I'm not going to deny that. however, it only applies to bachelor and below. Masters and PHDs have little effect on one's pay level.</p>
              <p>and with the influx of FT changing the labour market, the concept of high qualification = high pay is becoming increasingly obsolete.</p>
              <p>You can see foreign degree holders working in a wide spectrum of jobs, ranging from the lowly technician, retail sales, customer svc, to engineers, financial consultants, doctors etc. Qualification is meaningless, if there are people out there willing to drastically undercut you on the basis of salary.</p>
              <p>Let's just take a simple ferry ride to batam. I saw job advertisement for the simple post of starbucks baristas. Looking for university graduates, not older than 25, monthly pay of approx. S$280. Outlet manager, cannot be older than 35. $350/mnth.</p>
              <p>And that's starbucks. Imagine what's the pay like for the less well-known companies.</p>
              <p>Maybe their university are lousy, but i believe that being uni grads, they are more than competent for most jobs available in singapore, excluding the really high-tech occupations.</p>
              <p>And I believe that these people, are more than willing to accept any jobs that offers higher pay. Simply by working as a junior admin assistant in spore, they can easily quadruple their pay, and drastically improve their family's financial standing. We have heard of maids and foreign labourers, saving enough money to the point that they can afford to construct beautiful houses back in their hometowns. And these workers are usually lowly-educated, lowly paid, $500/mth or less.</p>
              <p>imagine what degree holders can achieve by working in singapore.</p>
              <p>When you have so many qualified desperate young people, just 30minutes away from singapore, we can't help but wonder. What will happen had we just loosen immigration restriction a little?</p>
              <p>And the world is full of such desperate people, and many are actually well educated, or at least educated enough to compete with workers of the developed world.</p>
              <p>The West is slowly coming to realise that Efficiency simply cannot compete with Cheapness. C comes before E.</p>
              <p>They will never, ever, be able to create jobs that pay as well, with cheaper overseas labour available for every position imaginable.</p>
              <p>And with declining individual income, the economies of the West is doomed to shrink, and their debt crisis will only become more and more severe, as they find it harder and harder to repay their debts.</p>
              <p>The EU is bound to disintegrate, and the US is next on the list.</p>

Look, if you can't keep up with the current technology (especially my job which deals with chemicals), you are as good as fired. Just like now, there are a number of old people who doesn't know how to use a computer, but if you take lessons and courses they can use and this is an example of keeping up with technology.</div>
