              <p><strong>Botox helps Australian stroke victim to walk again</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SYDNEY (AFP) - - An Australian stroke victim paralysed
              for more than 20 years has walked again thanks to anti-wrinkle drug
              botox, in a case hailed as extraordinary by his medical team.</p>
              <p>Russell McPhee, 49, was confined to a wheelchair after suffering a
              severe stroke 23 years ago that left him so disabled that doctors
              initially told him he would never leave hospital.</p>
              <p>But after being injected with botox, the anti-ageing treatment
              popular among Hollywood celebrities, McPhee can walk around his home
              unaided and travel up to 100 metres (330 feet) using a walking stick.</p>
              <p>"I thought I was going to die in a wheelchair," McPhee told AFP.</p>
              <p>The former meatworker admitted he and girlfriend Kerry Crossley were initially sceptical when told about the treatment.</p>
              <p>"(Kerry) chipped in and said 'what, don't you think he's pretty enough?'" McPhee said.</p>
              <p>Botox,
              or botulinum toxin, blocks the nerve signals which tell muscles to
              contract, flattening wrinkles when used on the face. But it can also
              help patients left immobile by brain injuries, multiple sclerosis,
              spinal problems or strokes.</p>
              <p>Valentina Maric, physiotherapist at
              the St. John of God Hospital in Victoria state, explained that McPhee
              was unable to walk because the stroke had left his muscles in permanent
              spasm.</p>
              <p>"The muscles were turned on all the time because of the messages coming from his brain," she said.</p>
              <p>The
              botox stopped the spasms, Maric said, allowing the McPhee to stretch
              out the affected leg muscles for the first time in decades and
              strengthen other muscles needed for walking.</p>
              <p>She said muscles
              that had not been used for so long would normally have withered away,
              but McPhee's were remarkably intact, leading to rapid progress after he
              started the treatment 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>"You usually see results in
              someone who has recently had a stroke but we've never has such a good
              response from someone so far down the track (decades after a stroke),"
              Maric said.</p>
              <p>"The botox provided the kickstart needed to start the treatment."</p>
              <p>However,
              doctor Nathan Johns stressed that McPhee's muscle strength and
              determination were a key element in his remarkable progress.</p>
              <p>"Not
              every case is so successful," he said. "Mr McPhee had unusually good
              muscle power and great determination, despite the fact that he had been
              confined to a wheelchair for so long."</p>
              <p>McPhee said he had been forced to push through the pain barrier to become mobile again.</p>
              <p>"It's
              not just a matter of getting your botox injection then going to bed and
              being able to walk in the morning, it takes a lot of hard work," he
              said.</p>
              <p>He says inspiration came from girlfriend Kerry, a childhood
              sweetheart who rescued him from a spiral of depression and talked him
              into rehabilitation when they were reunited two-and-a-half years ago.</p>
              <p>"I
              was in a pretty bad way with depression," said McPhee, who played
              football, cricket, basketball and tennis -- "any sport you like" --
              before his stroke.</p>
              <p>"I felt like my life was over."</p>
              <p>With the
              help of Kerry and the team from St. John of God, McPhee hopes that one
              day he will no longer need the three-monthly botox shots in his legs
              and arm.</p>
              <p>McPhee said he was working on making his non-spastic
              muscles strong enough to compensate for the ones that contract,
              creating a long-term solution to his condition.</p>
              <p>"That's the aim," said McPhee, adding that he also plans to marry Kerry.</p>
