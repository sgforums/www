              <p>AN UNDERCOVER policewoman ended an hour-long hostage drama in Guangzhou, China, in three seconds.</p>
              <p>She fired four shots and killed a robber, who was holding a woman hostage, after distracting him with a bottled drink.</p>
              <p>Guangzhou Daily reported that the drama started after the 38-year-old man robbed a man near a train station on Tuesday at about 8pm.</p>
              <p>The victim had resisted and the man used a knife to stab him before fleeing.</p>
              <p>Police gave chase, but the man grabbed hold of a female passer-by near a bus stop and held her hostage in front of an ATM at about 8.25pm.</p>
              <p>He wrapped his left arm around her neck while holding the knife at her throat.</p>
              <p>Police cordoned off the area and hostage negotiators tried to talk the man out of harming the woman.</p>
              <p>The man said he did not want to harm the hostage, but each time police officers tried to edge closer, he slashed the woman on her arm and leg.</p>
              <p>The atmosphere became more tense after an hour of negotiations. The man had become more agitated after his requests for a gun and transportation to Hubei province were refused.</p>
              <p>By then, the woman's clothes were soaked in blood.</p>
              <p>At 9.25pm, a plainclothes policewoman approached the pair and offered the man a bottled drink after he complained of being thirsty, but threw the bottled drink onto the ground near the man.</p>
              <p>The man stepped forward and used his right leg to roll the bottle closer to him.</p>
              <p>He then bent down to pick up the bottle and the policewoman seized her chance to draw her gun. She ran forward and fired a shot at the man without hesitation.</p>
              <p>The man fell backwards, still holding on to the hostage. The policewoman then fired another three shots at the man at point-blank range, killing him.</p>
              <p>The hostage was taken to a nearby hospital. She is in stable condition.</p>
              <p>The man was reported to be a thief from Hubei and had been on the run from police there.</p>
              <p>The 1.6m-tall policewoman, known only as Ms Xiu, later told Guangzhou Daily that while she had been with the police force for 27 years and had received training as a sniper, this was the first time she had fired a gun at someone.</p>
              <p><strong>Force</strong></p>
              <p>"We had to use force because we could not guarantee the hostage's safety," Ms Xiu, who is in her 40s, told the newspaper.</p>
              <p>"My superiors told me to get a gun from the police van and I loaded it with six rounds and tucked it in my right trouser pocket.</p>
              <p>"When he bent down to pick up the bottle, he left part of his right chest exposed. I aimed for that area."</p>
              <p>She added: "He was still moving after my first shot, so I moved in and fired another three shots."</p>
              <p>"I had only two thoughts in my mind - to ensure the safety of the hostage and to overcome the man."</p>
              <p>After making sure the hostage was all right, Ms Xiu handed in her weapon and returned to work at a police station.</p>
              <p>When asked if she was worried about accidentally hitting the hostage, she said: "Failure was not an option."</p>
