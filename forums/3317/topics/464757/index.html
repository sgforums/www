              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government has announced a S$2b package in another attempt to boost the country's low fertility rate.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>To encourage couples
               to start families earlier, the government is making it easier for 
              couples with young children to get their first homes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Under the Parenthood
               Priority Scheme, up to 30 per cent of new public flats in matured and 
              non-matured estates will be set aside for couples with children under 
              the age of 16.<br><br>Also new is a Parenthood Provisional Housing 
              scheme for this group of parents, who can rent a flat from the HDB while
               they wait for their new flats to be ready.<br><br>The HDB will launch 
              about 1,150 units of three-, four- and five-room flats by the end of 
              this month which can be rented out at between S$800 and S$1,900.<br><br>The
               latest measures are the third round of enhancements to the Marriage and
               Parenthood package. It will cost the government S$2 billion a year -- 
              higher than the S$1.6 billion in the 2008 package.<br><br>It also covers areas such as assisted reproduction, healthcare and paternity leave.<br><br>Fathers
               will finally get paid paternity leave of one week. This is on top of 
              the one-week leave they can co-share with mothers under the working 
              mother's maternity leave entitlement of four months. <br><br>Couples who adopt can look forward to four weeks of paid adoption leave for working mothers.<br><br>Employers must make provisions for the various paid leave from 1 May 2013.<br><br>For
               those who have difficulty conceiving, the government will help pay a 
              bigger share of Assisted Reproduction Technology treatments. <br><br>It 
              will now cover up to 75 per cent of treatment costs. These will be 
              capped at S$6,300 per cycle for three fresh treatment cycles, and 
              S$1,200 per cycle for three frozen treatment cycles.<br><br>The Baby Bonus cash gift will increase by S$2,000 per birth, up to the fourth child. <br><br>Every newborn will have a CPF Medisave account with a grant of S$3,000 to support healthcare costs.  <br><br>The enhanced Baby Bonus and Medisave will apply to all Singapore citizen children born on or after 26 August 2012.<br><br>Congenital
               and neonatal conditions will also be covered under MediShield. The 
              government will extend MediShield to cover such conditions from March 
              2013.<br><br>For existing policyholders, such as insured children, they 
              will automatically receive coverage for any congenital conditions 
              diagnosed on or after 1 March 2013.<br><br></span><strong> Which new measure gets your </strong><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/polls/commentform.php?id=919">vote</a><span><br><br>Deputy
               Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who announced the measures on Monday, 
              said Singapore's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) rose slightly in 2012 -- due
               partly to the "mini Dragon Year impact".<br><br>The TFR climbed from 1.2 in 2011 to between 1.28 and 1.3 last year, according to preliminary estimates.<br><br>The last time Singapore's TFR was at the replacement level of 2.1 was way back in 1976.<br><br>The country's leaders now have a target of between 1.4 and 1.5, should the new measures make any form of impact.<br><br>"We
               hope that in the longer term we can get, of course, up to 2.1 but 
              looking at the environment and what other countries and cities are 
              facing, that really is a work in progress that will require a long time 
              but if we can get 1.4, 1.5 in the coming years, I think that will be a 
              good step forward," said Mr Teo.<br><br>Mr Teo said the Marriage and Parenthood package is the most fundamental component of Singapore's population roadmap.<br><br>He
               said the core is still a Singapore population and making sure it is 
              sustainable, as it is the most critical aspect to ensure the country's 
              long-term future.<br><br>"Singaporeans are the core of our society, and 
              the best and most fundamental way to build a stronger Singaporean core 
              is to encourage marriage and parenthood, to encourage Singaporeans to 
              have more children," said Mr Teo. <br><br>"So, regardless of whatever 
              else we do to deal with the population challenge, the core and the most 
              fundamental thing that we want to do is to encourage Singaporeans to 
              marry and have more children and this is the starting point of all that 
              we do. So, everything else we do is build around this."<br><br>"We hope 
              that it will help the young people to consider getting married earlier 
              and to have children earlier. Our survey shows that 83% of young people 
              do want to get married and have children and that a very high proportion
               of them also feel that the existing Marriage and Parenthood measures do
               encourage them and help them to do so, and of course they have feedback
               specific areas which they feel will be helpful and those are the areas 
              which are attending to in this enhancement to the Marriage and 
              Parenthood package," added Mr Teo.<br><br>Mr Teo, who is also the 
              minister in charge of population policies, announced the measures along 
              with ministers in charge of various portfolios.<br><br>They include 
              National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan, Minister in the Prime 
              Minister's Office Grace Fu, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and Acting 
              Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing.<br><br>While 
              practical concerns are addressed, the panel of ministers said just as 
              important are the intangibles that need to evolve in Singapore.   <br><br>Mr
               Chan said that "we should also look at it as a comprehensive package 
              addressing not just the tangible and immediate issues that have to do 
              with financials and economics but also the softer aspects". He said that
               these are equally important, if not, more important.<br><br>They 
              include "how we bring up our children, the kind of values that we 
              inculcate in them, how we give a sense of peace of mind to young parents
               to bring up their own children - the kind of early childhood 
              development opportunities, so that they don't have to worry that if they
               do not have the means somehow their children will be left behind even 
              before they start school," said Mr Chan. <br><br>"These are all 
              important pieces that we need to put in place in order for us to create 
              that entire environment where Singapore is really known as a pro-family 
              society."<br><br>For more information on the Marriage and Parenthood package, you can visit the website: www.heybaby.sg<br><br>More
               measures will be announced over the next few weeks to better support 
              families, for example, in making health care and child care more 
              affordable. <br><br>Two other reports are also due - highlighting the 
              government's strategies in creating better jobs for Singaporeans while 
              maintaining a high quality of life. <br><br>All these population policies will then be debated in Parliament.<br><br>- CNA/al/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>i ownder how they distribute wast emoney again. if the money 100% goes to singreans only i am fine. but what about - foreign guy marrying singpaore gals having babies? should we analyse their financial abilities frist before giving these privileges to theM? becuse if foreign guy likely they can still have their dotters and sons go back to their homepland again. so are we trhowing money into the sea?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>of course we can argue sgreans can also migrate, but that is another story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what we have to enforce here is, all monies shall be forfeiting or returned if sgreans and offsprings who use these priileges later migrate have to return the money,. simple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is this looked into when handing out money?</p>
              <p> </p>
