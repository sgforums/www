              <p><strong>8 held for murder</strong></p>
              <p>EIGHT suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 28-year-old man at Orchard Plaza early on Friday morning.</p>
              <p>The Malay Singaporeans, aged between 17 and 41, were picked up within
               27 hours in an operation led by the Criminal Investigation Department 
              at various locations, including Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Merah, Sembawang 
              and Marsiling.</p>
              <p>Seven of them will be charged in court on Sunday morning 
              with the murder of Mr Mohamed Noraidi Zahari, who was found in a pool of
               blood at the entrance of Orchard Plaza by police officers who arrived 
              at the scene after receiving a call at 4.15am on Friday. He had slash 
              wounds and was taken unconscious to the Singapore General Hospital where
               he died at 4.58 am shortly after arriving.</p>
              <p>The remaining suspect will be released on bail pending 
              further investigations. If convicted of murder, the seven face the death
               penalty.</p>
              <p>The police cordoned off a 10m area outside and around the 
              shopping centre in Orchard Road for about six hours while they conducted
               investigations.</p>
              <p>A fight about a petty matter is believed to have broken out 
              between two groups of men when members of one group were having roti 
              prata at a stall near the mall.</p>
              <p>Director of the Criminal Investigation Department, Senior 
              Assistant Commissioner Ng Boon Gay said on Saturday: 'I commend my 
              officers who have worked hard to bring the perpetrators to justice in 
              such a short span of time.</p>
              <p>'Such violent behaviour and blatant disregard for the law 
              will not be condoned. We will come down hard on any individuals or 
              groups who take the law into their own hands and see to it that they 
              face the full brunt of the law.'</p>

              <p>POLICE have arrested another suspect in connection to the murder of a 28-year-old Malay man at Orchard Plaza on Friday.</p>
              <p>This brings to nine suspects who have been caught for being part of 
              an unlawful assembly that attacked Mr Mohamad Noraidi Zahari between 4 
              am and 4.30 am last Friday on the ground floor of Orchard Plaza.</p>
              <p>Reports said a gang of about 20 men attacked Mr Noraidi 
              with parangs, glass bottles and a chair. He died from his injuries in 
              hospital at about 5 am.</p>
              <p>The Criminal Investigation Department tracked down eight 
              men - one of whom is out on bail - within 27 hours. The seven men were 
              charged with murder in a district court on Sunday morning.</p>
              <p>The latest suspect, a 25-year-old Malay man, was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on Saturday at about 12.05 am.</p>
              <p>He will be charged in court on Monday afternoon with murder.</p>

              <p>Is Singapore a country?</p>
              <p>If it is, then...there are fights and slashings in every
              country. Be grateful that such things don't happen frequently
              compared to other countries. Also, be grateful that it's illegal to
              possess a gun in Singapore unless legally allowed.</p>

              <p>no offense.. yes, there may be fights and slashings in every country, but I do believe in every country, there is a difference. Can you compare a South American one to Singapore?</p>
              <p>And I don't believe possing a parang is legally allowed, can someone from legal enlighten?</p>
