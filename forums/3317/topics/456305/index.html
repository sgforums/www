              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SYDNEY: An appeals court in Australia has acquitted Singaporean 
              Ram Puneet Tiwary, who was twice convicted of murdering his two 
              flatmates in Sydney.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 33 year old has spent more than eight years behind bars and will likely go free. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tiwary was accused 
              of murdering fellow Singaporeans Tay Chow Lyang and Tony Tan Poh Chuan, 
              both aged 26, in 2003. The two were stabbed and clubbed to death with a 
              baseball bat. <br><br>All three were studying at the University of New South Wales at the time.<br><br>Tiwary was convicted of both murders in 2006 and given a life sentence without parole. <br><br>He successfully appealed, but faced a retrial in 2009. He was again found guilty, and this time, handed a jail term of 48 years.<br><br>Tiwary has maintained his innocence, claiming he was asleep at the time of the brutal attacks.<br><br>But prosecutors said Tiwary killed his flatmates over money he owed in rent, said to be more than US$5,000.<br><br>The
               three-judge panel in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Thursday 
              quashed both murder convictions and acquitted him on both counts.<br><br>The appeals court is expected to reveal the reasons for the acquittal at a later date.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p><br>well tiwarys galfrend was a white.suppose if the white gals jilted boyfrend took revenge and framed tiwary which is very common in white society and aussie police are known to make big mistakes from terrorists to mistaken identity of a wheelbrake as a shotgun even.</p>
              <p>all they ever need to do is to to throw a bloodied baseball bat at some foreign dude and possibly let him take the wrap.i should say DNA evidence in oz has been compromised as i watched tv on real life happenings in oz with their CSI units.a negro immigrant from africa a few years ago was blamed for a crime he did not commit as the dna from csi was compromised.</p>
              <p>the only way,he could come clean is he approCH THE PARENTS OF DECEASED AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>the evidence so far:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defence counsel Peter Doyle got Dr Friedman and, later, crime scene investigator Philip Elliott to concede that they would have expected to find DNA of both victims on the weapons. <br><br>Detectives suggest that the blood from Mr Tay, who was attacked first, was washed off the weapons before they were later used on Mr Tan. <br><br>But if the killer had the presence of mind to wash the bat and knife the first time, why did he not do the same after killing Mr Tan? <br><br>Crime scene investigator Christopher Clarke said there was no sign of blood being washed down the sinks in the flat. Justice Adams also pointed out there were no water marks on the weapons to suggest they had been washed. <br><br>Mr Doyle has suggested that the baseball bat and knife the police seized were not the murder weapons, at least not those used on Mr Tay. <br><br>If the jury agrees, it means there could be another murder weapon and killer still out there, which would greatly weaken the prosecutionï¿½s case. <br><br>Mr Doyle argued in his closing submissions that the absence of Mr Tayï¿½s DNA on the accused was the ï¿½most striking feature of the crime sceneï¿½, and indicated his client was innocent. <br><br>The issue, and what Justice Adams calls the ï¿½clincher evidenceï¿½, is how the blood got onto Tiwary. <br><br>When police arrived at the apartment after the murders, several red specks were on Tiwaryï¿½s hands, feet, T-shirt and shorts. Only those on his hands were obvious to the naked eye. <br><br>The police say the other stains were too small for the accused to notice, hence he did not get rid of them. As for the blood on his hands, they claim Tiwary left it there to corroborate his story about checking Mr Tanï¿½s pulse. <br><br>They say the blood got there when Tiwary atacked Mr Tan, but Tiwary claims he was checking Mr Tan for a pulse when his dying flatmate coughed blood out onto him. <br><br>Justice Adams says this was a ï¿½crucial and decisiveï¿½ area that could swing the juryï¿½s decision. <br><br>Blood splatter analysts could not agree on what the stains indicate. To Sgt Elliott, the blood spots were of ï¿½medium velocityï¿½ type or ï¿½impact splatterï¿½, the pattern of stains created when the body is struck with force. The same kind of bloodstains were found on the wall behind where Mr Tan was assaulted, and on his feet. The police say this suggests two possibilities: Tiwary was the killer, or at the very least he was in ï¿½very close proximityï¿½ when the victim was struck. <br><br>If the jury concludes that it got there when Tiwary was trying to save his friend, or think there is sufficient doubt over how it got there, Tiwary will walk free. <br><br>Justice Adams says: 'Simply because they are mysterious issues does not mean they are not significant. They may be telling you that something went on here that we still don't know about.'</p>

              <p>tiwary may be a rascal and a normal playful guy who was a sign on officer but i doubt he would kill over $ or even the condition of a bed as he hardly  would do the housework kinda guys but i doubt he could do murder.</p>

              <p>Tiwary's flatmates, Mr Tay Chow Lyang, 26, and Mr Tony Tan Poh Chuan, 27, were found dead at the apartment in a Sydney suburb.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They had been beaten with a baseball bat and stabbed. Tiwary ran out of the house and called the police, telling them that he found his flatmates dead when he woke up. Police said then that he was not a suspect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>May 28, 2004:</strong> Tiwary was arrested by New South Wales police for the murder of his flatmates.</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>May 16, 2006:</strong> Tiwary's murder trial began; he pleaded not guilty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>June 21, 2006:</strong> He was found guilty of the murders by a jury.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Aug 5, 2006: </strong>Tiwary's lawyers filed a notice saying that he intended to appeal against the verdict.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Nov 7, 2006: </strong>Tiwary was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Dec 18, 2008:</strong> An Australian Court of Appeal upheld his appeal and ordered a re-trial.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Aug 31, 2009: </strong>Tiwary returned to court for the re-trial, pleading not guilty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Oct 7, 2009: </strong>Tiwary was found guilty again by a jury.</p>

              <p><strong>Dec 18, 2009:</strong> He was sentenced to a maximum of 48 years in prison, to be backdated to 2004, when he was arrested. He appealed against the conviction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>July 26, 2012:</strong> Tiwary's convictions were overturned by a three-judge panel in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal.</p>

              <p>he has a streak of violence in him. it doesnt have to be money, anything can spur him to commit murder, esp when one is filled with anger, one is unable to think clearly and logically.</p>
