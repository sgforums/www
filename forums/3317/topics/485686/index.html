              <p>SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has addressed 
                      concerns that Mandarin standards are slipping, saying that it is not 
                      appropriate to compare today's social and linguistic environment with 
                      that in the 1950s.</p>
              <p>Speaking in Mandarin at a dinner to mark the 75th anniversary of 
                      Chung Cheng High School, Mr Lee defended the Government's bilingual 
                      policy and presented a different perspective on the issue.</p>
              <p>"If we did not introduce the bilingual policy, promote Mandarin and 
                      start Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools, Singapore today might be a 
                      completely English-speaking society," he said.</p>
              <p>Given an environment where English is the lingua franca and working 
                      language, it has already not been easy to maintain Singaporeans' 
                      Mandarin standards at the level it is today...</p>

              <p>Wow, this is really shameless of Lee Hsien Loong. His father Harry Lee Kuan Yew promoted english as official language of Singapore to consolidate control of english speaking elite from the colonial era and continued the british colonial policy of suppressing chinese language and chinese schools to destroy power of chinese so they don't pose threat to PAP, now he is twisting facts to fool naive and gullible people.</p>

              <p>THE BABAS OF SINGAPORE</p>
              <p>What makes Singapore different? The majority of Singapore's 
                  population is ethnically Chinese, but Singapore is largely free of 
                  corruption, has sound institutions and the rule of law dominates. It's 
                  nothing like China. The answer lies in a historical division in 
                  Singapore's Chinese community between the babas and the sinkeh. The 
                  sinkeh, comprising the majority of the city-state's population, were the
                   recent immigrants from China, or whose parents were born in China. They
                   spoke Chinese, lived like Chinese and considered themselves overseas 
                  Chinese. In Indonesia, such Chinese were called the totok.</p>
              <p>The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were 
                  Chinese more in name than practice. They were the descendants of the 
                  very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the
                   straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). They 
                  assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom 
                  they especially admired. The babas developed their own culture, cuisine 
                  and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p>The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. 
                  The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; 
                  they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of
                   the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge. If the sinkeh 
                  received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another 
                  university in China. Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's 
                  population, it was the babas who dominated public decision-making. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In 
                  effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's 
                  attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China.</span></p>
              <p>It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and 
                  institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba 
                  backgrounds. Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged 
                  just 35, is the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, 
                  although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English 
                  with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was 
                  totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his 
                  childhood.</p>
              <p>For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political 
                  necessity. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but
                   as a baba who looked to England. He followed the conventional career 
                  path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of 
                  Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father
                   had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, 
                  names. Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways? 
                  No. He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator 
                  would have aspired.</p>
              <p>That other great framer of Singapore's institutions, Goh Keng Swee, 
                  who rose to become finance minister and deputy prime minister, is the 
                  epitome of the baba elite. Goh was born in 1918 in Malacca, the 
                  epicentre of baba culture, into a baba family. His parents were 
                  English-oriented Chinese Methodists.</p>
              <p>The baba influence is now more subtle, but still there.</p>
              <p>Singapore's 
                  current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has the strongest baba pedigree 
                  of any of the country's leaders.</p>
              <p>http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/648273/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From another paradigm, Singapore could be seen as the domination of 
                  one group over another.</p>
              <p>Most of the leadership has been drawn from the 
                  Baba Chinese community, a group cultured in Malay and “Colonial 
                  British.”</p>
              <p>Babas hold strong family values, community cohesiveness, and 
                  tend to respect authority.</p>
              <p>This is in contrast to the southern mainland 
                  Chinese migrants to Singapore who fled oppression and tended to oppose 
                  authority.</p>
              <p>Singapore has thus been run more in the manner to which a 
                  British colonial administrator would have aspired.</p>
              <p>Thus patriarchal 
                  leadership with neo-Victorian values is not something the migrating 
                  Chinese accepted openly.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore has seen many campaigns, incentives, 
                  and deterrents to achieve the values of the Baba class.</span></p>
