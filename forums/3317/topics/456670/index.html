              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said that 
              Singapore must ensure that it has a sustainable population to face 
              future challenges.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Teo said as a 
              small country, Singapore faces many uncertainties and emphasised the 
              need for residents to remain united to overcome such challenges.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"This is the way 
              that we have been able to make progress, in our four to five decades of 
              history as an independent country," he said.<br><br>"We continue to face
               big challenges for the future, and one of the big challenges we have 
              for the future is how to build a sustainable population for ourselves. 
              Our population is slowly ageing and eventually, over the next 15 years 
              or so, will even start to shrink."<br><br>"Having a sustainable 
              population is one of the most important things for the future because it
               will help to keep our country and our people vibrant, alive, lively and
               one of the most exciting cities in the world," he added.<br><br>Mr Teo also highlighted the importance of building a sustainable population. <br><br>"(We
               have to) help to make sure that our population continues to remain 
              sustainable so that we can continue to have a stable Singapore for the 
              future," he said.<br><br>"(We have to have) people to look after our 
              elderly, a country and economy that's growing, and also very 
              importantly, a place where young people, your children and your grand 
              children, will want to make their home because there are exciting things
               going on, interesting jobs, cutting-edge opportunities and also many 
              interesting things to do in their free time, in their leisure. And also,
               a very good place to bring up children.<br><br>"So there are many 
              things we need to do for the future. And having a sustainable population
               is one of the most important things for the future because it will help
               to keep our country and our people vibrant, alive, lively and one of 
              the most exciting cities in the world."<br><br>Mr Teo was speaking to some 1,000 Pasir Ris residents at a National Day Observance Ceremony held at Elias Park Primary School. <br><br>Participants
               include members of the Pasir Ris West Grassroots Organisation, teachers
               and students from schools and kindergartens in the area. <br><br>Around 300 took part in a community parade, comprising contingents ranging from uniformed groups to senior citizens. <br><br>Deputy
               Prime Minister and Advisor to Pasir Ris-Punggol Grassroots Organisation
               Mr Teo Chee Hean inspected the parade as the Guest of Honour.<br><br>Guests
               were also treated to cultural performances, including a Silat or Malay 
              martial arts performance and Chinese orchestra pieces, to celebrate 
              Singapore's multi-racial, multi-religious society.<br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>
