              <p><strong>S'pore sets aside nearly S$100m to host year-long APEC meetings</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The government has set aside S$100 million to host the
              year-long series of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings
              in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>The meetings will culminate with a summit on November 14 and 15, attended by leaders from the 21 APEC economies.
              <br> <br> In 2006, the amount spent on hosting the eight-day IMF World Bank meetings in Singapore was over S$100 million.
              <br> <br> The APEC 2009 Organising Committee has to pay special attention to
              details when planning for the mega event where some 10,000 delegates,
              officials and media personnel will be present.
              <br> <br> These details include gifts for the delegates and tea break menus.
              <br> <br>Koh Lin-Net, chair of APEC 2009 Organising Committee, said: "We
              have to manage the attractiveness of the tea break against the rest of
              the meeting. Sometimes, you find that the teh tarik stall out in the
              reception area is so attractive that they don't want to go back to the
              meeting. We have to manage that."
              <br> <br> There have been a series of rehearsals – sometimes into the wee hours of the morning – to ensure clockwork precision.
              <br> <br>"Two weeks ago, when we rehearsed the arrival of 21 convoys to the
              Istana, we started on the basis of 90-second intervals in between
              convoys. Then we go down to discussing that 90 seconds is too much,
              maybe we need to go to 60 seconds. Then we feel 60 seconds is too much,
              we go down to 30 seconds – that's the level of details," said Ms Koh.
              <br> <br>The key meeting of the 21 APEC leaders will be held at the Istana,
              while the ministerial meetings and the APEC CEO Summit will be held at
              the Suntec Convention Centre.
              <br> <br>The organising committee said this arrangement would help to
              minimise inconveniences to the public and ensure the highest level of
              security for the visiting delegations and leaders.
              <br> <br>To manage any demonstrations by civic groups, Ms Koh said the
              recently enacted Public Order Act will be enforced. However, she added:
              "We do not expect civic demonstrations that we see in other meetings
              simply because APEC meetings are less prone to such civil public
              demonstrations."
              <br> <br>Singapore organisers have arranged an advance visit for the APEC
              economies next week to explain arrangements made for the APEC leaders'
              meeting. The trip includes visits to various meeting venues and a
              briefing on the details of the traffic arrangements.
              <br> <br>The organising committee added that there would not be prolonged
              road closures and where possible, lane closures would be implemented
              instead. There will be a dedicated APEC lane which will be closed to
              the public prior to and during the motorcade movement to ensure minimal
              disruptions to normal traffic flow.
              <br> <br>Nonetheless, motorists can expect some changes to the daily
              operations in the Suntec/Marina Bay area, such as route diversions for
              buses and pedestrians, relocation of taxi stands, as well as changes to
              parking facilities. <br> <br> All traffic announcements will be made early to enable motorists to plan alternative routes in advance.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, some 700 officers from 40 government agencies will be
              involved in the organisation of APEC 2009. Among the areas they are
              looking into include security, hospitality, medical and media coverage
              arrangements.
              <br> <br>Some 17,400 personnel from Singapore and Singapore-based companies
              are involved in the physical set up of the various meeting venues,
              providing various services for the meetings and designing attire for
              staff.
              <br> <br>Moreover, 1,800 volunteer ambassadors will be recruited to play
              host to the international delegates and 120 hours of rehearsals have
              been planned.
