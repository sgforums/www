              <p><strong>39-year-old man sets fire to Ang Mo Kio flat before falling to his death</strong></p>
              <p>A 39-year-old Chinese man is believed to have set fire to his flat last night before falling to his death.<br> Â <br> And his two children were also found dead in their flat at Block 543 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10. <br> <br> The Singapore Civil Defence Force or SCDF received a call at around
              9.50pm last night (07/11) about the fire, which had broken out at a 6th
              floor unit. <br> <br> Upon their arrival, SCDF firefighters saw black smoke coming out of the unit. <br> <br> They had to force their way into the flat to put out the fire. <br> <br> When they conducted a search within the unit, they found a 5-year-old
              Chinese boy and a three-year-old Chinese girl inside one of the
              bedrooms. <br> <br> The boy, Savier Ng Wei Yi, and the girl, Cheryl Ng Shi Hui, had no pulse and were not breathing. <br> <br> SCDF officers immediately performed CPR, but they were unable to revive the two children.<br> <br> They were pronounced dead shortly after. <br> <br> A resident who stays on the 11th floor and only wanted to be known as
              Mr Ng, said he went one floor up to alert his neighbours of the fire. <br> <br> That's when he found a man lying on a narrow parapet on the floor. <br> <br> Mr Ng said he asked the man to get down, but his warnings were ignored. <br> <br> "I heard a lot of people screaming and with a loud "bang", I saw a lot
              of tiles falling on the ground. I walked out and saw the man from the
              12th floor, lying on the ground." <br> <br> Another neighbour, Lee Haw Nam, said he saw the police and SCDF
              officers trying to persuade the man to come down from the parapet
              shortly before his death. <br> <br> "When he (fell), we saw a few figures trying to, leaning over the concrete to pull him up. But it was too late."<br> <br> The man, identified as Ng Chee Kiang, was rushed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 12.46am. <br> <br> Neighbours interviewed by MediaCorp were shocked by the death of Ng and his two children. <br> <br> Many described Ng as a friendly man. <br> <br> But some suspected that he could have been facing personal problems. <br> <br> Resident Abdul Manaf said he saw paint splashed on Ng's door on two occasions. <br> <br> "In front of the door you can see the paint. From the loanshark, big
              words saying "pay me my money". Then don't know what Chinese dirty
              words."<br> <br> Another neighbour, Ms Tan, said the deceased and his wife were having marital problems. <br> <br> "I only know that they were about to get a divorce. I would see the husband drinking every day at a nearby coffeeshop." <br> <br> The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p>
