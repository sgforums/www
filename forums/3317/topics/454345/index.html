              <p>Did the man stole or rob the NS man of the rifle?</p>
              <p>Steal means taking something not belonging to him while the owner  is not around.</p>
              <p>Rob mean to physically take something from  another person.</p>
              <p>Technician with a large screwdriver means he is "armed with a deadly weapon".</p>
              <p>Is that part meant to make it look like the NS man is under deadly threat and therefore was robbed of his rifle? And detract from the fact that one day of unarmed combat training in the entire NS stint is of absolutely no use.</p>

              thats my point exactly.
              
              our army, civil defence and police force are mostly conscripted personnel or reservists.  how many will really risk their lives and act hero?

              <p>Well, the soldier was robbed at screwdriver point at the SOC, so yes I reckon his rifle was slung to his back, and it was definitely not loaded.</p>
              <p>The first reaction when getting robbed at weapon point, is to freeze, and follow what the attacker says, because you want to stay alive, not risk dying.</p>
