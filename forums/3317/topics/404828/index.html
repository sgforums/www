              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Beehives have been creating some buzz in the estates 
              in Singapore. One of them was in Woodlands. </span></p>
              <p><span> A MediaCorp News hotline caller saw a one-metre long beehive that was 
              just beginning to form. </span></p>
              <p><span> The caller told Channel NewsAsia that the bees started flying into her 
              flat on Thursday night. Residents called the town council, which removed
               the beehive. </span></p>
              <p><span> Nearby, another small colony of bees had also started to form, but was 
              destroyed by pest controllers. </span></p>
              <p><span> The bee menace has been reported in several estates, including one in 
              Hougang Avenue 8 last Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span> Residents said the swarm of bees appeared within the span of just a few 
              hours. </span></p>
              <p><span> "I didn't know at first, until my neighbour from the 16th floor told me.
               Then I went to see. There were really a lot of bees, like lanterns 
              dangling there." </span></p>
              <p><span> A spokesperson from Aljunied Town Council said he had received feedback 
              from residents about the swarm of bees at 11am that day. </span></p>
              <p><span> And the bees were removed thirty minutes later, using chemical sprays. </span></p>
              <p><span> Margie Hall from the Nature Society of Singapore, said the bees are 
              likely to be honey bees. And they appeared to be treating the staircase 
              landing as a temporary refuge while they sought a permanent home. </span></p>
              <p><span> Margie Hall, honorary secretary, Nature Society (Singapore), said: 
              "They're not inherently aggressive at all, so long as they're allowed to
               go peacefully about their business, they have no intention of stinging 
              everybody, they're not out to get anybody. </span></p>
              <p><span> "But if they get upset, then they will sting people, and they might get 
              upset if people walk into their path of flight." </span></p>
              <p><span> As the bees are congregating in an urban setting, Ms Hall said they can 
              pose a danger to those living around the area. </span></p>
              <p><span> So even though bees, as prime pollinators, are a vital part of the 
              eco-system, Ms Hall said destroying them with chemical sprays may be 
              inevitable. </span></p>
              <p><span> She said: "They're obviously a last resort as you're going to kill and 
              destroy the bees. But how quickly you move to the last resort depends 
              upon how many people you've got around, and how much control you've got 
              over what people do." </span></p>
              <p><span> And her advice to those who encounter huge swarms of bees is to stay far
               away. </span></p>
