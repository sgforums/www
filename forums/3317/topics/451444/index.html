              diversity, even as it grapples with the challenges brought about by 
              globalisation, technology and extremism, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee 
              Hean said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking at the 
              Community Engagement Programme (CEP) dialogue on Saturday morning, he 
              said these three driving forces can have a double-edged impact on 
              Singapore's social cohesion.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The CEP is a national crisis response network of community, business and youth leaders coordinated by the Home Affairs Ministry.<br><br>Into
               its seventh year, the annual CEP dialogue saw the participation of some
               600 community leaders and several ministers including Dr Yaacob 
              Ibrahim, Mr Chan Chun Sing, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin and Mr Lim Swee Say.<br><br>On
               globalisation, Mr Teo said more Singaporeans are now living overseas, 
              and Singapore is also becoming more cosmopolitan with people from many 
              different countries calling it home.<br><br>With many different races 
              and religions living close together in a small, dense city like 
              Singapore, he said differences between the various groups can develop 
              easily into fissures and weaken the country's unity.<br><br>Hence, Mr 
              Teo said Singapore needs to pay extra attention to facilitating the new 
              immigrants who are ready to sink roots here, so that they integrate into
               society more quickly.<br><br>He also urged Singaporeans to do their 
              part to make newcomers feel welcome, and to help them imbibe the values 
              that have made Singapore strong as a society.<br><br>On technology, Mr 
              Teo highlighted how the Internet and social media can help bring people 
              together, but it can also disrupt social order and harmony when used 
              maliciously.<br><br>He said while social media can mobilise active 
              citizens for positive change, the Internet and the anonymity it affords 
              can also embolden people and encourage extreme views.<br><br>"Anonymity 
              on the Internet emboldens people, encouraging them to take on more 
              extreme views than they might otherwise," Mr Teo said.<br><br>"The 
              Internet also amplifies the extreme views, even though they might be in 
              the minority, and virtual mobs form to cheer or jeer, which only help to
               accentuate the differences, polarise and inflame emotions further."<br><br>Mr
               Teo said international terrorism and violent extremism continue to be 
              threats to the world, including Singapore, which remains a target for 
              terrorists.<br><br>But the threat of extremism can also help to rally people together in the fight against terror.<br><br>He
               added that strong community partnerships can help Singapore reduce the 
              opportunities for extremism to take hold of groups or individuals, and 
              to deal with and withstand the divisive effects that violent extremism 
              can wreak on a multi-racial and multi-religious society.<br><br>In view 
              of these driving forces that can have a profound impact on Singapore's 
              national solidarity and social cohesion, Mr Teo said the country's 
              community engagement efforts are even more important today, and in the 
              future.<br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>

                  Nobody is saying that we must errect the Berlin Wall or the Bamboo Curtain surely the DPM must understand. Singaporeans are not that stupid as to think we can live in isolation. BUT  then surely we must also be circumspect as to how we remain open, how we accept  so call "talents" and how we manage expectations of  citizens. BUT being a small nation with  little natural resources and land space, if we let all and sundry rape and plunder us socially economically and otherwise, then it is not globalisation, diversity and liberalisation. It's being damn bloody stupid! And it ain't going to improve the TFR either!

                  overseas, and Singapore is also becoming more cosmopolitan with
                  people from many different countries calling it home.<br>
                  <br>
                  With many different races and religions living close together in a
                  small, dense city like Singapore, he said differences between the
                  various groups can develop easily into fissures and weaken the
                  country's unity.<br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;
                  He also urged Singaporeans to do their part to make newcomers feel
                  welcome, and to help them imbibe the values that have made
                  Singapore strong as a society.<br>
                  <br>
                  On technology, Mr Teo highlighted how the Internet and social media
                  can help bring people together, but it can also disrupt social
                  order and harmony when used maliciously.<br>
                  <br>
                  He said while social media can mobilise active citizens for
                  positive change, the Internet and the anonymity it affords can also
                  embolden people and encourage extreme views.<br>
                  <br>
                  "Anonymity on the Internet emboldens people, encouraging them to
                  take on more extreme views than they might otherwise," Mr Teo
                  said.<br>
                  <br>
                  "The Internet also amplifies the extreme views, even though they
                  might be in the minority, and virtual mobs form to cheer or jeer,
                  which only help to accentuate the differences, polarise and inflame
                  emotions further."<br>
                  <br>
                  Mr Teo said international terrorism and violent extremism continue
                  to be threats to the world, including Singapore, which remains a
                  target for terrorists.<br>
                  <br>
                  But the threat of extremism can also help to rally people together
                  in the fight against terror.<br>
                  <br>
                  He added that strong community partnerships can help Singapore
                  reduce the opportunities for extremism to take hold of groups or
                  individuals, and to deal with and withstand the divisive effects
                  that violent extremism can wreak on a multi-racial and
                  multi-religious society.<br>
                  <br>
                  In view of these driving forces that can have a profound impact on
                  Singapore's national solidarity and social cohesion, Mr Teo said
                  the country's community engagement efforts are even more important
                  today, and in the future.<br>

                  "Hence, Mr Teo said Singapore needs to pay extra attention to
                  facilitating the new immigrants who are ready to sink roots here,
                  so that they integrate into society more quickly." How long did their  ancestors take to sink in roots here ? Most  families take at least  two to three generations at least.  So like instant trees we expect them overnight loyal Pinoys, Burmese  and Prcians become loyal  citizens? Overnight loyalty ? Surely not possible right? It is also an issue of new migrants making the positve attempt at  adapting and assimilating to Singapore and Singaporeans and not the other way around! We were here first hor!

            <div class='col-md body'>Every now and then  you see reports of  some PRs getting themeselves into serious trouble. E.g just a few days ago the New paper reported about this Chinese PRcian who was made Director by the  boss  of some failing company and now faces a mountain of debts. She was over 40 years of age and  was initially the  marketing manager of the company . She was reportedly having to borrow some 11,000 dollars  from her fiance from Malta to get a lawyer's help, and was also currently supporting two teenage children from a previous marriage  etc- now how on earth did such a complex character get a Permanent residency in Singapore,in the first place????</div>

              Many  are coming to the conclusion that  they have to be deprived of their 2/3s majority in the next GE . Still others are so fed up with these unbated  need to grow their GDP   thro new migrants policy, they are prepared to see them wipe out   and to take a chance with  a new slate of people altogether.
