              <p>SINGAPORE - In sentencing a 32-year-old man to death for the 
              murder of a taxi driver, a High Court judge said he found that the 
              prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. <br><br> Chinese national Wang Wenfeng was yesterday found guilty of murdering Mr
               Yuen Swee Hong, 58, inside his taxi in April 2009.<br><br> Justice
               Lee Sieu Kin said: "... The accused's actions after the deceased had 
              died are not inconsistent with the evidence that proves his guilt and 
              they do not constitute any cause for reasonable doubt."<br><br> Justice Lee noted that Wang had even "tried to exploit the situation" 
              that Mr Yuen's wife was in after murdering her husband.<br><br> During his trial earlier this year, the court heard that Wang had called
               Madam Chan Oi Lin, claiming that he had kidnapped Mr Yuen and demanded 
              S$150,000 in ransom even though Wang had already killed the cabby and 
              dumped his body in a forest.<br><br> Mr Yuen was killed in the 
              early hours of April 11, 2009, in Jalan Selimang in Sembawang after a 
              struggle with Wang in his taxi. <br><br> Wang had boarded Mr Yuen's taxi at Sun Plaza in Sembawang with the intention of robbing him. <br><br> The court had heard that the stab wounds Mr Yuen suffered were of 
              such depth that they resulted in heavy bleeding and caused him to lose 
              consciousness within a short time.<br><br> This showed that Wang 
              "could only have done it with the intention to inflict that injury" and 
              that injury "was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause 
              death", said Justice Lee.<br><br> During the murder trial, which 
              was held between March and April, the High Court had also heard about 
              the circumstances leading to the tragic event. <br><br> Wang, a 
              labour agent who had been struggling to make ends meet in Singapore, had
               to leave the country by April 15 in 2009 after his work permit was 
              cancelled.<br><br> He had tried borrowing the money for his flight 
              ticket back to Fujian. When he asked his sister and his wife - who were 
              both here - for money, they could not help him.<br><br> Thinking 
              that robbing a cabby would help him get the money, Wang packed a fruit 
              knife and a pair of cotton gloves in his haversack and walked to Sun 
              Plaza in Sembawang.<br><br> But Wang got nervous and thought of 
              abandoning his quest. He walked along the road without hailing any taxis
               when Mr Yuen drove past, stopped and reversed, and asked him where he 
              wanted to go.<br><br> After Mr Yuen was killed, Wang drove his taxi to a multi-storey carpark, cleaned out the bloodstains there and left.<br><br> Wang was arrested when he turned up at the travel agency two days 
              later (April 13) to collect his flight ticket which he had booked to 
              leave Singapore on April 14. Tanya Fong</p>
