              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Companies in the construction industry are calling 
              for more resources to be set aside to ensure the welfare of foreign 
              workers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They said labour must also be fully utilised for the industry to grow in a sustainable way. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The call comes after
               the National Development Ministry said some 30,000 foreign workers will
               be needed for public housing alone this year - almost double the number
               of last year.<br><br>The Housing and Development Board (HDB) is expected to release some 25,000 Build-to-Order (BTO) units this year.<br><br>This, in a bid to ramp up affordable housing, especially for first-time home owners. <br><br>For the construction industry, this news comes as a mixed blessing, amid an uncertain economic outlook. <br><br>Dr
               Ho Nyok Yong, president of the Singapore Contractors Association, said:
               "This is a good opportunity for our contractors, our members to get 
              more HDB projects. Simple as that. Business opportunity. <br><br>"For 
              construction, especially this year, there are less private projects. 
              This is one of the ways it can help to compensate back some of these 
              shortages."<br><br>To build public housing, the number of foreign workers needed is expected to increase to 45,000 in the next few years. <br><br>Aside
               from the shortage of dormitories to house foreign workers, Dr Ho said 
              there's the question of ensuring that the growth can be sustained. <br><br>Dr
               Ho said: "When gearing up construction for HDB flats, contractors and 
              builders buy a lot of machinery, equipment and tools, and also human 
              resources such as workers, middle management and management. They train 
              them up. <br><br>"Then all of sudden, in the next two years, (if) 
              there's nothing much in terms of volume, all that investment - the high 
              purchase - there's no returns."<br><br>Dr Ho acknowledges some of these resources can be diverted, for example into civil engineering and private housing.<br> <br>"But
               some contractors are only doing HDB, they are the builders, they are 
              very different from those constructing bridges, roads. They're (from) 
              different trades. They might be able to divert some, but not all, and 
              quite a few might suffer from that."<br><br>Labour costs are another concern.<br><br>The foreign worker levy has been going up since 2010 and companies said their costs could rise by about 10 per cent this year. <br><br>Some social activists said this could have an impact on the welfare of workers.<br><br>Jolovan
               Wham, executive director, Humanitarian Organisation for Migration 
              Economics (HOME), said: "When business costs go up, what we've seen is 
              that migrant workers bear the brunt of it.<br><br>"All this is happening
               because employers are worried about their expenses, and they're afraid 
              of having to pay so much and the increase in the levies isn't doing very
               much to improve the situation.<br><br>"We've seen workers who are paid S$1.50 - S$1.60 an hour.<br><br>"These
               are wages that no Singaporean will ever accept for the work that they 
              do. It's disproportionate to their contributions to this country.<br><br>"The
               National Integration Council for example, most of the programmes that 
              they have, and a lot of their resources that are invested are in new 
              Singapore citizens and PRs.<br><br>"But what about migrant workers 
              because there are a million of them here. I think there has to be more 
              public education, to promote communal ties between Singaporeans and 
              migrant workers.<br><br>"We're not going to see many Singaporeans doing 
              these kinds of jobs. We'll have to accept the reality that for certain 
              kinds of industries, like construction for example, a larger number of 
              migrant workers is necessary."<br><br>HDB said there are measures under 
              the Construction Productivity Roadmap launched last year, to moderate 
              the increase in the number of foreign workers needed as higher 
              productivity allows for more to be done with fewer workers.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
