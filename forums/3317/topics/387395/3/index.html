              <p>Instead, it was PAS and Anwar who came across as the voices of moderation and reason.... they put out statements which effectively said '<em>Hey, when you think about it, it's not a big deal at all.....</em>' Certainly their more reasoned approach would lead to greater support for them.</p>
              <p>So, really, by trying to win the support of the masses, all UMNO has done is to get itself kicked in the read end and to drive away support for itself.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>that's the one thing i could not fathom - they allow these protests (knowing full well it would stoke racial sentiments) to go on but clamp down on any other protests/rally, even those organised by groups like the bar council for universal (less sensitive?) issues eg human rights, detention without trail which affects everyone/all races</p>

              <p>As was previously mentioned - they allowed the protests so as to be seen to be pandering to the Malay-Muslim majority. </p>
              <p>Doesn't matter if it sounds dumb so long as they can win lost support. That seems to be their line of thought. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>But as we've seen, they may lose even more support in the long run all thanks to their stupidity. This is ultimate self-pwnage. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>this chap's the fellow that ah badz highlighted.</p>
              <p>what many don't know, is that he's already achieved internet notoriety two years ago and earned himself a fascist label.</p>

              people I don't give a damn, they should have it tattooed on their chest

              had tattoos. So those who are now so adamant on not wanting to be
              buried as a Muslim, or whatever, for whatever reason, they should have
