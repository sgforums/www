              <p><strong>Malaysian Muslim leaders call for racial
                  harmony</strong></p>
              <p><span>By Channel NewsAsia's Melissa Goh |</span> <span>Posted: 12 January 2010 2313 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span>PUTRAJAYA: As authorities move to calm jitters following a
                  series of church attacks in Malaysia, some Muslim leaders including
                  a government minister have called on church leaders to drop their
                  claims over the use of the word 'Allah' in the interest of racial
                  harmony and unity.<br> <br> But religious disputes showed no sign of abating, with another case
                  being highlighted in court on Tuesday.<br> <br> A Christian from Sarawak has challenged the government's order to
                  confiscate compact discs containing the word "Allah".<br> <br> Church groups from the East Malaysian state said they have been
                  using the word for years and feel the government has no right to
                  change they way they been practicing their religion.<br> <br> Pastor Daniel Raut, president, Sidang Injil Borneo Peninsular,
                  said: "We have been using the word 'Allah' ever since we became
                  Christians. Since pre-Merdeka time, there was no problem all these
                  while.<br> <br> "We don't understand why now they ask us not to continue using the
                  word in our worship. My own mother tongue, which is Lumbawang, we
                  use the language in our worship. It's not only Malay, it's our own
                  Lumbawang dialect."<br> <br> The East Malaysian church group, SIB, has a quarter of a million
                  strong members nationwide. Its pastor explains why more services
                  are being conducted in Malay.<br> <br> Pastor Daniel Raut added: "East Malaysians started to come over
                  here to work and study here in the 80s. Now there are so many in
                  the peninsula Malaysia. Because most of them do not speak English,
                  Chinese or Tamil, they can not go to local churches so we have to
                  start BM churches and we are using 'Allah' in our worship."<br> <br> But many in this predominantly Muslim nation are up in arms,
                  insisting that the word 'Allah' be exclusive to Islam.<br> <br> The government has denied that the religious disputes are
                  politically motivated to galvanise the Malay support as claimed by
                  some political analysts.<br> <br> All cabinet ministers, meanwhile, have been told to stop commenting
                  on the issue in a bid to ease tensions. - CNA/vm<br></span></p>

              <p>Funny, I thought "religious harmony" is more appropriate.  It seems that the real divide isn't really the religion but something else. </p>
              <p>IMO, the issue we are looking at is not plainly religious in nature.  It is mishmashed up together with racial tensions.</p>

              <p>I'm definitely jumping the gun here, but I doubt this series of incited attacks are a doubt of their government.  To me, I'd suspect Anwar's fractal coalition instead.  </p>
              <p>There is no doubt that this is a highly politicized issue that is ripe for the plucking. The government has to respond and take a side the debate, and it seems to me that it has to logically pursue a course of action that would win over the majority.  In this case, to see to overthrow the court ruling.  That would provide the non-muslim / malay minority which accounts for the remaining 35% of the population, a reason not to support BN for the next elections.  </p>
              <p>On the other side of the fence, Anwar might be able to bring in the unhappy minorities in a coalition together with his supporters to mount a significant challenge in the next elections.  </p>
              <p>Until then, I think we might see more of such religious racial issues being played up behind the scenes to erode BN's strength.  </p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8447450.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8447450.stm</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Three churches have been attacked in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, ahead of planned protests by Muslim groups.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The administrative offices of one church were destroyed by a firebomb attack and one of the other two churches attacked was slightly damaged.</p>
              <p>Some Muslim groups are angry at a court decision allowing non-Muslims to use the word Allah to refer to God.</p>
              <p>The government relies on the Malay Muslim vote, and will let Muslims march from mosques to churches on Friday.</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- E SF --&gt;</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Najib Razak condemned the church attacks, saying such actions would "destroy our country's harmony".</p>
              <p>"The government will take whatever steps it can to prevent such acts," he said.</p>
              <p><strong>Divided faiths</strong></p>
              <p>The controversy stems from a ban on a Catholic newspaper, The Herald, using the word Allah.</p>
              <p>The Kuala Lumpur High Court struck down the three-year old ban on use of the word Allah - a ruling now the target of planned demonstrations.</p>
              <p>Some major Muslim organisations, including the Islamic political party, PAS, have agreed with the court, saying other Abrahamic religions - Christinaity and Judiasm - may use the word Allah.</p>
              <p>But some vocal groups, including the Muslim Youth Movement, Abim, have cast the use of the word Allah as a surreptitious effort on the part of Christians to try to seduce Muslims away from Islam.</p>
              <p>The argument has continued in the media and the courts for months but had not become violent - until assailants on motorbikes were seen smashing the windows of the Metro Tabernacle Church, a Protestant church in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.</p>
              <p>The ground floor office of the three-storey church was destroyed in a blaze a little after midnight, said Kevin Ang, a church spokesman.</p>
              <p>Kuala Lumpur police Chief Mohamad Sabtu Osman said police had found a wrench, an empty petrol tin and two scorched motorbikes at the scene.</p>
              <p>Separately, Molotov cocktails were thrown into the compounds of two other churches before dawn, causing minor damage in one and none in the other, church officials said.</p>
              <p>The police chief has also urged protesters not to join Friday's planned demonstrations.</p>
              <p>The government has appealed against the court verdict and the High Court has suspended the decision's implementation until the appeal is heard.</p>
              <p>About 60% of Malaysians are Malay Muslims alongside significant Chinese and Indian minorities.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Najib has spoken recently of a "one Malaysia" concept - something analysts now say is under severe challenge.</p>

              <p>i dun believe Allah avocate on this. Violence. I mean kinda of childish lo. Because of one word - use of Allah. So many trouble. Frankly speakly, Other countries are laughing at Malaysia. This is a really 3rd world country.</p>

              <p>Malaysian police say they have arrested seven people in connection with arson attacks on two churches and a Catholic school.</p>
              <p>Seven men were arrested in the northeastern state of Perak where an
              Anglican church, a Catholic church and a convent school were attacked. <br> <br> The authorities believe the men acted spontaneously, and are not part of any organised group. <br> <br> Eight people were arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday in connection
              with investigations into the firebombing of a church earlier this
              month. <br> <br> A total of 16 religious institutions nationwide have been hit by arson and vandalism in recent weeks. <br> <br> Two Muslim prayer halls in the southern state of Johor were the latest
              to be hit yesterday, with one suffering extensive fire damage. <br> <br> The attacks follow a court ruling that allowed a Catholic newspaper to use the word 'Allah' as a translation for 'God'.</p>
