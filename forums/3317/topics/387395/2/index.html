              <p>The wars fought by U.S since end of cold war are fought with the design for strengthening their geopolitical position on the world map in order to secure their status as a global hegemon able to dictate to other states.</p>
              <p>This is a fact.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: small;">A high-ranking military 
                        officer reveals how Defense Department extremists suppressed information and 
                        twisted the truth to drive the country to war:</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: small;">In the spring of 2002, 
                        I was a cynical but willing staff officer, almost two years into my three-year 
                        tour at the office of the secretary of defense, undersecretary for policy, sub-Saharan 
                        Africa. In April, a call for volunteers went out for the Near East South Asia 
                        directorate (NESA). None materialized. By May, the call transmogrified into 
                        a posthaste demand for any staff officer, and I was "volunteered" to enter what 
                        would be a well-appointed den of iniquity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: small;">The education I would receive 
                        there was like an <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/detail/celeb/187146">M. 
                        Night Shyamalan</a> movie -- intense, fascinating and frightening. While the 
                        people were very much alive, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I saw a dead philosophy -- Cold War anti-communism 
                        and neo-imperialism -- walking the corridors of the Pentagon.</strong></span> It wore the clothing 
                        of counterterrorism and spoke the language of a holy war between good and evil...</span></p>

              <p><strong>For the faction that controls the Pentagon, the military industry and
                      the oil industry, the Cold War never ended. It went on 'below the
                      radar' creating a global network of bases and conflicts to advance
                      their long-term goal of Full Spectrum Dominance, the total control of
                      the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. </strong></p>
              <p>Their
                      methods included control of propaganda, use of NGOs for regime change,
                      Color Revolutions to advance NATO east, and a vast array of
                      psychological and economic warfare techniques, a Revolution in Military
                      Affairs as they termed it.</p>
              <p>The events of September 11, 2001 would allow
                      an American President to declare a war on an enemy who was everywhere
                      and nowhere, who justified a Patriot Act that destroyed that very
                      freedom in the name of the new worldwide War on Terror.</p>
              <p>This book gives

              <p><strong>Fifth church attacked in Malaysia in Allah feud</strong></p>
              <div class="bd">
              <div class="content">
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
              – Another church was hit by a firebomb early Sunday, the fifth assault
              in three days of unrest following a court decision that allows
              Christians and other non-Muslims to use "Allah" to refer to God.</p>
              <p>Hundreds
              of worshippers whose parish church was partly gutted in the firebomb
              attack last week gathered at a makeshift prayer hall for their Sunday
              service and called for national unity and an end to violence.</p>
              <p>On
              Sunday, a Molotov cocktail was hurled at the All Saints Church in
              Taiping town in central Perak state early in the morning before it had
              opened, said state police chief Zulkifli Abdullah. He told The
              Associated Press that the building was not damaged but police found
              burn marks on the floor.</p>
              <p>Four churches were hit by gasoline
              bombs on Friday and Saturday. All except the Metro Tabernacle, who
              parishioners moved their services, suffered little damage, and no one
              was hurt. The other three held normal services Sunday.</p>
              <p>The
              unprecedented attacks have set off a wave of disquiet among Malaysia's
              minority Christians and strained their ties with the majority Malay
              Muslims.</p>
              <p>The dispute is over a Dec. 31 High Court decision
              that overturned a government order banning non-Muslims from using the
              word "Allah" in their prayers and literature. The court was ruling on a
              petition by Malaysia's Roman Catholic Church, whose main publication,
              the Herald, uses the word "Allah" in its Malay-language edition. The
              government has appealed the verdict.</p>
              <p>About 9 percent of
              Malaysia's 28 million people are Christian, most of whom are ethnic
              Chinese or Indian. Muslims make 60 percent of the population and most
              of them are ethnic Malays.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, men, women and children
              from the Metro Tabernacle parish assembled in the cavernous, 1,800-seat
              meeting hall of the Malaysian Chinese Association party for the
              service. They lifted their hands and sang "We put all our faith in
              you," and "You are the God of love and peace" during the Sunday service.</p>
              <p>"My
              wife was worried, but we want to be here to support the church," said
              Michael Chew, 40, who came to the service with two children, aged 1 and
              6.</p>
              <p>The service was in English, as are most Christian services
              in mainland Malaysia though some are in Chinese and Tamil languages.
              Such services do not use the word "Allah." Only the Malay-language
              prayers for indigenous tribespeople in the remote states of Sabah and
              Sarawak use "Allah," as they have for decades.</p>
              <p>Rev. Hermen
              Shastri, general secretary of the Council of Churches of Malaysia, said
              Christians won't be intimidated by the attacks, describing them as the
              work of extremist minority among Muslims.</p>
              <p>"What is clear is
              that it is done by extremist groups. It does not reflect the majority
              Muslims in the country. We all have to stand together to stamp out
              terror perpetuated by these extremist groups," he told The Associated
              Press.</p>
              <p>The government contends that making Allah synonymous
              with God may confuse Muslims and ultimately mislead them into
              converting to Christianity.</p>
              <p>Still, government leaders and many Muslims have condemned the firebombings, saying it is un-Islamic to attack places of worship.</p>
              <p>Prime
              Minister Najib Razak visited the Metro Tabernacle church late Saturday
              and announced a grant of 500,000 ringgit ($147,000) for rebuilding it
              at a new location, a major concession in a country where permission is
              rarely given for building new churches or temples.</p>
              <p>The Allah
              ban is unusual in the Muslim world. The Arabic word is commonly used by
              Christians to describe God in such countries as Egypt, Syria and
              Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation.</p>

              <p>With this statement, the way I see it, the Malaysian government itself thinks that Malaysian Muslims are<em> that </em>stupid. Or maybe they're just pandering to the stupidity of the masses in a bid to see itself as being in tune with the majority.</p>
              <p>As I said before, a Muslims of truly strong faith would not intentionally walk into a church, read a limited-issue newsletter and immediately have his faith shaken over a point of semantics.</p>

              <p>Quote from above webstite:<br><br> <span style="color: #000080;">"* The Promise to St. Catherine:<br><br>"This is a message from Muhammad ibn Abdullah, as a covenant to those who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them.<br><br>Verily
              I, the servants, the helpers, and my followers defend them, because
              Christians are my citizens; and by God! I hold out against anything
              that displeases them.<br><br>No compulsion is to be on them. Neither
              are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor their monks from
              their monasteries. No one is to destroy a house of their religion, to
              damage it, or to carry anything from it to the Muslims' houses.<br><br>Should
              anyone take any of these, he would spoil God's covenant and disobey His
              Prophet. Verily, they are my allies and have my secure charter against
              all that they hate.<br><br>No one is to force them to travel or to
              oblige them to fight. The Muslims are to fight for them. If a female
              Christian is married to a Muslim, it is not to take place without her
              approval. She is not to be prevented from visiting her church to pray.
              Their churches are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented
              from repairing them nor the sacredness of their covenants.<br><br>No one of the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world)."<br><br>The
              first and the final sentence of the charter are critical. They make the
              promise eternal and universal. Muhammed asserts that Muslims are with
              Christians near and far straight away rejecting any future attempts to
              limit the promise to St. Catherine alone. By ordering Muslims to obey
              it until the Day of Judgment the charter again undermines any future
              attempts to revoke the privileges. These rights are inalienable.
              Muhammed declared Christians, all of them, as his allies and he equated
              ill treatment of Christians with violating God’s covenant.<br><br>A
              remarkable aspect of the charter is that it imposes no conditions on
              Christians for enjoying its privileges. It is enough that they are
              Christians. They are not required to alter their beliefs, they do not
              have to make any payments and they do not have any obligations. This is
              a charter of rights without any duties!<br><br>The document is not a
              modern human rights treaty but even though it was penned in 628 A.D.,
              it clearly protects the right to property, freedom of religion, freedom
              of work, and security of the person.<br><br>I know most readers, must
              be thinking so what? Well the answer is simple. Those who seek to
              foster discord among Muslims and Christians focus on issues that divide
              and emphasize areas of conflict. But when resources such as Muhammad’s
              promise to Christians are invoked and highlighted it builds bridges. It
              inspires Muslims to rise above communal intolerance and engenders good
              will in Christians who might be nursing fear of Islam or Muslims.<br><br>When
              I look at Islamic sources, I find in them unprecedented examples of
              religious tolerance and inclusiveness. They make me want to become a
              better person. I think the capacity to seek good and do good inheres in
              all of us. When we subdue this predisposition towards the good, we deny
              our fundamental humanity. In this holiday season, I hope all of us can
              find time to look for something positive and worthy of appreciation in
              the values, cultures and histories of other peoples.<br><br>-- Dr.
              Muqtedar Khan is Director of Islamic Studies at the University of
              Delaware and a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and
              Understanding"  Unquote.</span></p>
              <p>Obviously, those who attacked the MY churches are not true Muslims but terrorists masquarading as Muslims.</p>

              <p>True Muslims are bound by our Holy Quran....in it God tells all Muslims that religion is not to be forced unto a person and also among many other things, not to destroy properties.</p>
              <p>A true Muslim fights with his tounge and knowledge; with reason and message of peace...not with violence, anger and hatred coz those are the very traits for which Muslims were told to refrain from as those are the work of the Devil.</p>

I hold out against anything that displeases them.<br><br>No compulsion is to be on them. Neither are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor their monks from their monasteries. No one is to destroy a house of their religion, to damage it, or to carry anything from it to the Muslims' houses.<br><br>Should anyone take any of these, he would spoil God's covenant and disobey His Prophet. Verily, they are my allies and have my secure charter against all that they hate.<br><br>No one is to force them to travel or to oblige them to fight. The Muslims are to fight for them. If a female Christian is married to a Muslim, it is not to take place without her approval. She is not to be prevented from visiting her church to pray. Their churches are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented from repairing them nor the sacredness of their covenants.<br><br>No one of the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world)."<br><br>The first and the final sentence of the charter are critical. They make the promise eternal and universal. Muhammed asserts that Muslims are with Christians near and far straight away rejecting any future attempts to limit the promise to St. Catherine alone. By ordering Muslims to obey it until the Day of Judgment the charter again undermines any future attempts to revoke the privileges. These rights are inalienable. Muhammed declared Christians, all of them, as his allies and he equated ill treatment of Christians with violating God’s covenant.<br><br>A remarkable aspect of the charter is that it imposes no conditions on Christians for enjoying its privileges. It is enough that they are Christians. They are not required to alter their beliefs, they do not have to make any payments and they do not have any obligations. This is a charter of rights without any duties!<br><br>The document is not a modern human rights treaty but even though it was penned in 628 A.D., it clearly protects the right to property, freedom of religion, freedom of work, and security of the person.<br><br>I know most readers, must be thinking so what? Well the answer is simple. Those who seek to foster discord among Muslims and Christians focus on issues that divide and emphasize areas of conflict. But when resources such as Muhammad’s promise to Christians are invoked and highlighted it builds bridges. It inspires Muslims to rise above communal intolerance and engenders good will in Christians who might be nursing fear of Islam or Muslims.<br><br>When I look at Islamic sources, I find in them unprecedented examples of religious tolerance and inclusiveness. They make me want to become a better person. I think the capacity to seek good and do good inheres in all of us. When we subdue this predisposition towards the good, we deny our fundamental humanity. In this holiday season, I hope all of us can find time to look for something positive and worthy of appreciation in the values, cultures and histories of other peoples.<br><br>-- Dr. Muqtedar Khan is Director of Islamic Studies at the University of Delaware and a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding"  Unquote.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Malaysian Muslim leaders call for racial harmony</strong></p>
              <p><span class="update">By Channel NewsAsia's Melissa Goh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 12 January 2010 2313 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>PUTRAJAYA: As authorities move to calm jitters following a series
              of church attacks in Malaysia, some Muslim leaders including a
              government minister have called on church leaders to drop their claims
              over the use of the word 'Allah' in the interest of racial harmony and
              unity.
              <br> <br> But religious disputes showed no sign of abating, with another case being highlighted in court on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> A Christian from Sarawak has challenged the government's order to confiscate compact discs containing the word "Allah".
              <br> <br>Church groups from the East Malaysian state said they have been
              using the word for years and feel the government has no right to change
              they way they been practicing their religion.
              <br> <br>Pastor Daniel Raut, president, Sidang Injil Borneo Peninsular,
              said: "We have been using the word 'Allah' ever since we became
              Christians. Since pre-Merdeka time, there was no problem all these
              while. <br> <br> "We don't understand why now they ask us not to continue using the word
              in our worship. My own mother tongue, which is Lumbawang, we use the
              language in our worship. It's not only Malay, it's our own Lumbawang
              dialect."
              <br> <br>The East Malaysian church group, SIB, has a quarter of a million
              strong members nationwide. Its pastor explains why more services are
              being conducted in Malay.
              <br> <br>Pastor Daniel Raut added: "East Malaysians started to come over
              here to work and study here in the 80s. Now there are so many in the
              peninsula Malaysia. Because most of them do not speak English, Chinese
              or Tamil, they can not go to local churches so we have to start BM
              churches and we are using 'Allah' in our worship."
              <br> <br> But many in this predominantly Muslim nation are up in arms, insisting that the word 'Allah' be exclusive to Islam.
              <br> <br>The government has denied that the religious disputes are
              politically motivated to galvanise the Malay support as claimed by some
              political analysts. <br> <br> All cabinet ministers, meanwhile, have been told to stop commenting on the issue in a bid to ease tensions.       - CNA/vm

              <p><br>actually, all the conflicts are about a grab for political power or resources...</p>
              <p>religion is used as an excuse so that they can have a focal point for their hatred and also for recruitment of foot soldiers..</p>
              <p>mostly, foot soldiers are required to obey order, fight hard, die well.. it is almost a requirement that they be dumb and not ask questions... the best way to manipulate the foot soldiers is by keeping them dumb, and instilling a fanaticism in a religion..</p>
              <p>this has been used throughout history...</p>
              <p>in Malaysia, the Malay chauvanists are shitting themselves and peeing their pants at the same time that education of the masses is eroding their "racial superiority" and their "racial rights".. the easiest way is to start religious fires to disguise their racial agenda...</p>
              <p>sadly, there are enough people out there who cannot see through this bad disguise...</p>
