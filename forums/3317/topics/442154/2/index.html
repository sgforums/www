              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 11px;">Singapore boasts a highly competitive and well-regarded primary and secondary education system, but the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">number of Singaporeans completing a tertiary education is relatively low.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 11px;">Only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">23</span></span></strong> percent of Singaporean students entering primary school complete a degree at a local four-year university.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 11px;">In <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">other knowledge-economies such as Japan's, around 50 percent of students complete a university degree.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 11px;">However, according to Cheryl Chan, Assistant Director of the Planning Division at the Ministry of Education (MOE), the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">government does not plan to encourage more students to get a higher education.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 11px;">The university enrollment rate will continue to be maintained at 20-25 percent because the Singaporean labor market does not need everyone to get a four-year degree, she asserted.<a style="color: #517781;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/02/07SINGAPORE394.html#par10">¶</a>10.</p>

              <p>i wonder how many forummers here have friends from PRC to really know what they say about Singapore ?</p>
              <p>To PRC, the English in Singapore is not Pure.  They say they learn the American English back in China but when they come here, they can't understand the English of Singapore, including those announcement made in NTUC.  To the PRC, Singapore English is not English. They will say it's Singlish (to mock us).</p>
              <p>There are many PRCs in China who have gone to study in Japan, France, USA, Europe countries and their mastery of these languages are superb.  Some PRCs know more than one language.</p>
              <p>I only want to say to PRCs, if you think you are so superb, go and show off to the Whites , not to your own kind.  I have not yet seen how proud PRCs are in front of Caucasians. The PRCs will praise everything of the Whites.  Still an inferiority complex.</p>
              <p>Prove to the Whites that Chinese can be smarter, better and more talented than them. Don't come and ya ya to your own kind. I am sure the wisdom of Chinese can beat that of the Whites.  </p>

              <p>you need to speak like they do to.........blend in and be understood.their accent and your accent is different and cannot be understood easily.</p>
              <p>i agree that is clownish when someone has never spoken proper accent  in that language in question before and he is trying it on the foreigner for the first time in his life.i have come across some singaporeans trying  to impress an american by putting soooooo much effort into trying to sound with an american accent,that resulted in my  sporean  work collague speaking like a thai man speaking in an english accent.my "fake american" colleague suddenly looked like an ass most of the time after that.</p>
              <p>accent and pronounciation r not  easy things to master.its the amateurs who end up looking clownish.and i couldnt agree with u on that.</p>
              <p>so if u need to speak english,speak it properly with the accent that u yourself have calibrated it with your ears and mind over the years.the americans when they heard my english and my  sporean work colleague with the american accent that sounded more like thai english ..the americans noticed a total difference in english standards and found mine easily comparable with their american english back in the usa.they even asked me if i had stayed in the usa and if i had relatives in the usa....,,,,they must really thought i was from the usa  without even trying unlike my sporean work colleague with the fake american accent froim some village in thailand.etc.</p>
              <p>as for my sporean work colleague,the americans thought he was placed in the company by his uncle and thought he came from thailand with little spoken n written english.of course his uncle placed him in that job in order to learn from me.he was badly equipped knowledgewise and only had newbie skills which made me surprised on what he was doing all these years..he must have been selling soya bean drinks b4 entering in the field of robotics,although he was very old and balding.most of the time he would sit on his desk surfing forums and chat rooms instead of doing work.and his basic robotics and bread n butter skills was as bad as his fake american accent.</p>
              <p>its not just simple speaking out a language.accent and pronounciation is very important..one alphabet pronounced out and its confusion paradise making idiots of speaker in question.</p>

              <p>When the PRC Chinese come here, most of them have a singular image of Singapore. That Singapore is entirely Chinese. When they come here they have a culture shock. They were noobs then.</p>
              <p>With the government putting down Singaporeans, and accomodating the foreigners, these foreigners, sepecially the PRCs, now have a sense of pride. The government support them. Thats all that matters to them. The government is king over the citizens here. So why the hell they care what Singaporeans think of them.</p>

              <p>He made use of the left wing to gain power, after he gained power he allied with the british to destroy the left.</p>
              <p>He is a traitor of the left wing movement. He is only after power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The left-wing trade union movement in Singapore lasted only a generation.</p>
              <p>It faced formidable resistance from employers and governments, both colonial and post-colonial, which preferred orderly economic growth to strong, autonomous unions.</p>
              <p>In seeking to establish a political arm, the movement secured political allies which did not share, or even opposed, its vision of labour as an equal partner of capital in the production process.</p>
              <p>Although the unionists were inspired by Marxist concepts, the MCP was an ideologically divergent party aiming to establish a different political system.</p>
              <p>The MCP’s failure to sustain a constitutional strategy also made the unions’ collaboration with it difficult and dangerous.</p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew group in the PAP used the left as a bridge to the Chinese-speaking masses; upon coming to power they quickly eradicated alternative sources of power and moulded labour into a disciplined cog in the industrial economy.</span></span></p>
              <p>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Barisan Sosialis, arguably the only genuine party of labour</span></span> but lacking a clear vision for merger, was<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> smashed by PAP-British-Alliance machinations</span></span> in the creation of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The unions were inexperienced in politics and made mistakes, believing moral leadership and worker solidarity to be sufficient to achieve their aims.</p>
              <p>But their demise was ultimately due to the state’s repressive laws, purges and trials which decimated the leadership and prevented the maturity of the movement, and the maneuvering of government officials and politicians who made them scapegoats for riots and revolts.</p>
              <p>From a global perspective, the labour movement, although it rejected the simple dichotomy of democracy and communism, was a victim of the Cold War and the forces that determined to destroy Marxism.</p>
              <p>The rise and fall of the left-wing unions is an important part of Singapore’s postwar history that has been submerged under the PAP story.</p>
              <p>The Cold War is over, except in Singapore’s history.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The unions’ story belongs to the theme not of communist subversion but of the rise of a people, lifted by youthful idealism and dynamic anti-colonialism. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>In the 1950s and early 1960s, the unionism was part of a larger movement seeking to create a different Singapore from the society the PAP has since built.</p>
              <p>The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">labour movement’s emphasis on social justice and worker solidarity and its willingness to collaborate with other groups on the fringes of society, such as the Chinese school students, cut across ethnic, social and occupational divides and offered hope for genuine democracy.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>It underlined the importance of ends in life other than material achievement and economic growth. The movement brought dignity and self-respect to the working class, besides the tangible gains.</p>
              <p>Its political involvement was crucial for the country’s progress towards nationhood, dashing the timidity that enveloped the island after 1948, and rousing the people, through issues which touched them personally, against the British regime.</p>
              <p>Together with the Chinese student movement, the unions provided the formidable <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">power base for the anti-colonial political parties, the PAP and, briefly, the Barisan. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">left-wing trade union movement bore Singapore out of colonialism into statehood, although it was not to survive it. </span></span></strong></p>

              <p>but then prc chinamen saying people will do worse than them isdue to poor n bad upbringing.no manners.no family.....had they said this in japan or korea they would have been murdered and turned into fertiliser by yakuzas and korean gangsters.</p>
              <p>in my first job after ns:</p>
              <p>the indians from india are no that great either,i remebered one dude demanded my staff card from me when i had to do my job in contamination.i refused  and he complained to management who were sporeans and indian dude got screwed by sporean management.he must thought i was from china and could be eaten to boost his power hungry status.</p>
              <p>the chinese malaysians ,arent exactly angels and some wanted a piece of me on my first day at work.my supervisor and me had a fight with me over  6months...he left the section and was transferred to another place.another kinder malaysian took over his position which was heaven.the fighter supervisor was then posted overseas by company where he got into trouble at airport for an immigration offence..never prepare visa ?the lower educated operators tend to think they are gifts from gods even they are as fat as jabba the hutt and wear miniskirts that reveal their ass cheeks.</p>
              <p>the prc chinamen,were same as the chinese malaysians in one way or the other.but i noticed when someone from china got arrested by spore police in newspaper,they tend to sabotage machines by dripping chemicals into the electrical valves and i had to go there to fix them.i found some are stuck up and have no tolerance to overseas chinese who do not speak the same pudong accent as them.and they would use criminal force to enforce that language problem in singapore.</p>
              <p>the phillipinos are so so.they seem to be ok..some are nasty ,,,,but still ok. they never used much force like the chinamen n indians from india.but then they seem to be asking for too low salary at $2500/mth for double degree holders.</p>
              <p>the above are mainly the people i dealt with on my first job after my national service in the army.</p>

              <p>I dont know about that. i work for an international company and have dealt with collegues in Singapore and I must admit. Somtimes, I barely understood what they were trying to say. Even the air hostess english skills are poor to what their were.</p>

              <p>At the same time, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">debate on the issue of the National Language came to the fore</span></span>.</p>
              <p>It is now<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> conceded that the left wing trade unions under Lim Chin Siong, took a decision early on in support of Malay as the national language</span></span></strong> and at the same time <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">arguing for a reduction in the role of the English language</span></span> and the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> elevation of the languages of the local communities, principally Chinese and Tamil.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Lim’s role in this has been acknowledged by Usman and Samad Ismail and others.</p>
              <p>The<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> left wing support for the use of Malay as the national language and the common lingua franca, created a strong surge of interest for the learning of Malay.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>This momentum was accelerated after 1959, when widespread classes for Malay in night schools, adult education centres and private tuition was widespread and extensive...</p>

              <p>Isnt everything taught in english or did they changed that? I remembered, everything was taught in english and there were periods where students would go study their own languages. Example, the chinese would go have chinese class and the malay went off the study malay and India went off as well for couple of hours a day?</p>
              <p>I use to go in and out of those classes cause I didnt really speak any of those language. So it was like a free periods for me.</p>
