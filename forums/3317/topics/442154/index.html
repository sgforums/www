              <p>Netizens are outraged by a Chinese national's online comment that 
              'Singaporeans will always do worse than us'. The NUS student from China 
              has apparently apologised for the post and claimed that he was merely 
              reposting a friend's words.<br><br>The disparaging remark, which made reference to the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/what_bugs_me/750586/overreacting_football_fan_condemns_thousands.html">Lions' recent losses to the China team</a> in the World Cup qualifier matches, read:<br><br>"There's
               a lesson we can learn from the recent Singapore vs China matches, which
               is applicable when we take our final exams. No matter what, don't give 
              up, because Singaporeans will always do worse than us."<br><br>STOMPer <strong>Angry Stomper</strong> said:<br><br>"‘Healthy Competition’ in Singapore’s education system?<br><br>"Think twice again.<br><br>"The picture says it all."</p>
              <p><br>STOMPer <strong>zong </strong>said:<br><br>"I chanced upon this post while reading through a well-known online forum, Hardware Zone Singapore.<br><br>"I feel that it's really disappointing and demoralizing to us Singaporeans.<br><br>"Although
               many Chinese students have proved that they are significantly smarter 
              and hardworking than many Singaporean students, this does not give him 
              the right to insult our intelligence.<br><br>"I think that he should be sent a severe warning letter to think twice before posting such harsh comments on Singaporeans.<br><br>"These comments will affect the relationship between the Mainland Chinese and Singaporeans.<br><br>"On
               top of that, he should post an apology letter or thread on the forums 
              to apologise for his negligence and carelessness in posting such hurtful
               remarks on Singaporeans."<br><br>STOMPer <strong>antitiong</strong> wrote:<br><br>"First, we offered them a place to study here in Singapore.<br><br>"Now they belittle our academic capability?<br><br>"What's this?<br><br>"They take the opportunity to study here is fine enough, but to make these remarks, it’s like… sarcastic."</p>
              <p>In another online post, the Chinese national explained that he did not 
              agree with the disparaging remark about Singaporeans and that he had 
              removed the status update in 'less than half an hour'.<br><br>In his apology he wrote:<br><br>"I admit that the status update is somewhat insulting to Singaporeans, but I did not agree with the remark.<br><br>"I'm not very good at my studies either, and there are many locals who are better than me.<br><br>"The remark was something that I reposted from a friend's comments. I reposted it because I thought it was interesting.<br><br>"In fact, I removed the status update in less than half an hour.<br><br>"I admit that it is my mistake to have posted something like that.<br><br>"What I did was very stupid.<br><br>"At the same time, I wish to apologise to Singaporeans who felt insulted by the remark.<br><br>"They can scold me and criticise me, it's all my fault.<br><br>"I am truly sorry."<br><br>This is his post in Chinese:<br><br>"æˆ‘æ‰¿è®¤ã€‚é‚£ä¸ªçŠ¶æ€�çš„å†…å®¹æ˜¯å¸¦æœ‰ä¸€å®šçš„è´¬ä½Žæ–°åŠ å�¡äººçš„æ„�æ€� ä½†æ˜¯æˆ‘å¹¶æ²¡æœ‰çœŸçš„èµžå�Œé‚£å�¥è¯�è¯´çš„å†…å®¹ã€‚ <br><br>"æœ¬æ�¥æˆ‘ä¹Ÿä¸�æ˜¯æˆ�ç»©å¾ˆå¥½çš„äºº æ— æ•°ç‰›äººlocalå¤§ç¥žå°¤å…¶æ˜¯csé‡Œçš„å¤§ç¥žéƒ½æ¯”æˆ‘å¼ºäº†ç™¾å€�ï¼Œè·Ÿä»–ä»¬æ¯”èµ·æ�¥æˆ‘å°±æ˜¯ä¸ªå‚»é€¼ã€‚<br><br>"é‚£å�¥è¯�ä¹Ÿä¸�è¿‡æ˜¯ä»Žæœ‹å�‹ç»™çš„å›žå¤�é‡Œçœ‹åˆ°ç„¶å�Žè§‰å¾—å¾ˆæœ‰æ„�æ€�å°±è½¬å�‘äº†ä¸€ä¸‹ã€‚ <br><br>"è€Œä¸”äº‹å®žä¸Šæˆ‘ä¹Ÿåœ¨ä¸�åˆ°å�Šä¸ªå°�æ—¶ä¹‹å†…åˆ æŽ‰äº†é‚£æ�¡çŠ¶æ€�ã€‚ <br><br>"æˆ‘å�Œæ ·ä¹Ÿæ‰¿è®¤ï¼Œé‚£æ ·çš„è¯�è¯´å‡ºæ�¥æ˜¯æˆ‘æ¬ è€ƒè™‘äº†ã€‚ <br><br>"æˆ‘æ‰¿è®¤æˆ‘çš„é”™è¯¯ï¼Œæ˜¯æˆ‘çŠ¯äº†ä¸€ä¸ªå¤§å¤§çš„å‚»é€¼ã€‚ <br><br>"å�Œæ—¶æˆ‘åƒ�æ‰€æœ‰å› ä¸ºæˆ‘è¿™å�¥è¯�æ„Ÿåˆ°äº†ä¾®è¾±çš„æ–°åŠ å�¡äººé�“æ­‰ï¼Œ çœŸçš„ï¼Œå¯¹ä¸�èµ·ã€‚ é‚£æ�¡é“¾æŽ¥é‡Œå¯¹æˆ‘çš„è°©éª‚ä¹Ÿå¥½ï¼Œå¯¹æˆ‘çš„æŒ‡è´£ä¹Ÿå¥½ï¼Œéƒ½æ˜¯æˆ‘è‡ªæ‰¾çš„ã€‚ æˆ‘é�žå¸¸éƒ‘é‡�çš„è¡¨è¾¾æˆ‘çš„é�“æ­‰ã€‚"</p>
