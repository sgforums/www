              <p>For their involvement in a fake degree scam, at least 18 foreign workers
               from China were sentenced earlier this week to jail in Singapore for 
              four weeks each.</p>
              <p>The workers had been found by a local court to have provided forged 
              certificates to obtain work passes to work for T Y Enterprise and Sun 
              Blues Cleaning Maintenance.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that while another 
              10 workers from China will be charged with similar offences on Thursday,
               another nine are being repatriated after being served with warning 
              letters “for providing false information to MOM’s employment 
              inspectors”.<br><br>Arriving in Singapore early last year, the 37 
              Chinese nationals in all had applied for employment and S passes with 
              “university degrees” in hotel management from Jiangsu, Shandong and 
              Henan universities.<br><br>While the workers knew their degrees were 
              fake and had lied in their applications for employment passes, they 
              claimed they had little choice after having paid S$8,000 each to agents 
              in China to land a job here.<br><br>However, the promise of a 
              high-paying job was dashed after they found themselves scrubbing floors 
              and clearing rubbish. It is understood that some of them were farmers 
              back home and had landed jobs as cleaning supervisors.<br><br>The three universities mentioned do not offer a degree in hotel management and that the degrees were fake, <em>The New Paper </em>reported.<br><br>Meanwhile,
               the employers who were involved in hiring the workers, a total of 17 
              men and 1 woman, will be charged in court at a later date.<br><br>One of
               the workers, Liu Demin, 36, had pleaded to the court for leniency when 
              his case was heard on Tuesday, saying that he had paid a substantial 
              amount to the agent.<br><br>Speaking to the court interpreter in 
              Mandarin, he said, “If I did not follow his instructions (about the 
              forged degree certificate), I would not get the money back. I have to 
              support sickly parents and two school-going children.”<br><br>In June 
              this year, the same paper had reported that Liu and another worker, Wang
               Kangxun, 31, had complained about the unusual pay practice adopted by 
              their company.<br><br>It was this issue which shed light to the fake degree scam. <br><br>The
               workers were each paid a monthly salary of S$2,650 which was 
              transferred into their bank accounts, but after payday, they each had to
               return around S$1,600 to a man sent by their employer. They claimed not
               to have known why there were asked to do that.<br><br>For an S pass 
              holder, the worker must have a fixed monthly salary of at least $2,000, 
              and at least a degree or diploma while the minimum salary for Employment
               Pass holders is $2,800.<br><br>While such scams are not new, 
              non-governmental group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) said this is 
              the largest case of employers using workers with fake certificates. Its 
              spokesman alleged that the employers use the scam to get around the 
              dependency ceiling imposed by MOM.<br><br>For making false declaration 
              in a work pass application, the Chinese nationals could have been fined 
              up to $15,000 and/or sentenced up to 12 months’ jail.</p>
