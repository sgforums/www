              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Challenges faced by single-parent families in 
              Singapore is a subject that has been very much in discussion over the 
              past few days.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At the constituency level, grassroots too have been dealing with the problems faced by single-parent families.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The number of cases 
              of single-parent families in need of help are not large, and the cases 
              at the Meet-the-People sessions are often those who need assistance with
               homes and schools.<br><br>"The mother and child would have to move on 
              in life and society has to provide that sort of support for both the 
              mother and child," said Ms Ellen Lee, Member of Parliament (MP) for 
              Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC). <br><br>"If people are important to us, the illegitimate child is also important to us." <br><br>"The
               issue is (if we) should be assisting them to make their life just a 
              little bit easier; (if we) should be looking for ways that the single 
              mum who's never been married has as much assistance in raising her 
              children as another mum is married," said Dr Janil Puthucheary, MP for 
              Pasir Ris-Pungggol GRC. <br><br>Grassroots bodies have several programmes to help single-parent families in need.<br><br>"We
               are working very closely with the community because at the end of the 
              day, we want to have community befrienders who actually befriend these 
              families so that whenever they need help, we are able to activate the 
              national scheme or local scheme," said Dr Teo Ho Pin, MP for Bukit 
              Panjang GRC.<br><br>"We try to ensure that the kids continue to remain 
              in school and the mother has a stable job to ensure that the family 
              continues to be stable," added Mr Zainudin Nordin, MP for Bishan-Toa 
              Payoh GRC.<br><br>The MPs said the ongoing Our Singapore Conversation is
               expected to be a lively platform to discuss future trends in single 
              parenthood.<br><br>"The National Conversation is a very good opportunity
               for us to get a very good feel of the pulse of Singapore society going 
              forward and then that would probably move into the situation where we 
              review policies such as maternity, housing affecting singles and single 
              families," said Mr Desmond Lee, MP for Jurong GRC.<br><br>"There are two
               areas we should focus on: families who have or mothers or fathers are 
              single parents not through choices but through unhappy choices," said Mr
               Hri Kumar Nair, MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC. <br><br>"We should help them and we should not forget that the child's welfare is paramount."<br><br>The dialogues are expected to take place both at the national and local constituency levels. <br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
