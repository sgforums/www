              <p>A Singaporean Standard Chartered banker has been held by authorities in 
              Shanghai, China, on suspicion that she aided one of the bank's clients 
              who allegedly stole millions of dollars from Agricultural Bank of China 
              and fled the country.<br><br>The banker, Wu Yidian Eden, a 31-year-old 
              naturalised Singaporean, has been formally detained since March 6 after 
              several rounds of police questioning. <br><br>Eden and her fiance, Jason
               Tan, were due to marry later this month in Singapore. When Eden 
              notified the police last Tuesday that she would be leaving China for the
               wedding, she was detained on the spot. <br><br>According to a news 
              report, Eden has not been charged with any crime. However, she has not 
              been allowed to talk to a lawyer or to see her family since then. Her 
              fiance said that consular officials from Singapore were expected to 
              visit her this week at a detention center.<br><br>A Singapore-based 
              Standard Chartered spokesperson, Melissa Cheah said the bank was unable 
              to comment on Eden's detention because of the ongoing police 
              investigation, but added that the bank was not being investigated.<br><br>STOMPer IUIU who came across this news online, wrote:<br><br>"I was actually quite surprised that a Singaporean is involved in this case.<br><br>"It wasn't even reported by the local news."</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore banker held in China without lawyer access: fiance</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>BEIJING - Police in China have held a Singaporean banker for two
               weeks without allowing her access to a lawyer after her client 
              allegedly fled the country with millions of dollars, her fiance said 
              Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Eden Wu, who has 
              worked in Shanghai for Standard Chartered's private banking business for
               nine months, was detained on March 6 as she prepared to travel to 
              Singapore for her wedding, Jason Tan told AFP.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Police are 
              investigating one of her clients, who allegedly escaped China with his 
              family with millions in embezzled funds, he said.<br><br>"She is being 
              questioned every day, she can't make phone calls, and she hasn't been 
              allowed to see her lawyer," Tan said, adding that representatives at the
               Singapore consulate and Wu's parents had been able to visit her on 
              Friday.<br><br>"Her mum said she has lost a lot of weight, and that she had dark circles under her eyes," he added.<br><br>Standard
               Chartered confirmed Wu's detention in a statement emailed to AFP, but 
              said the firm was unable to comment due to the police probe. "But we can
               confirm that Standard Chartered is not being investigated," it said.<br><br>A
               spokeswoman for the Communist Party committee in Wuxi city, where Wu is
               being held, also confirmed the detention, saying it was due to "her 
              involvement in a bank issue."<br><br>"We cannot say more about this, as police investigations are not finished," she said. Police refused to comment.<br><br>Tan
               -- an American who works in the United States -- said his fiancee had 
              been cooperating with police in their probe before her detention.<br><br>But
               when Wu informed them she was leaving China for her wedding, police 
              summoned her and took her in, he said, adding authorities had not 
              allowed him to see her because he had talked to journalists and posted 
              information online.<br><br>"They said I could see her if I promised not to post anything on the Internet or talk to the media," he said.<br><br>"I
               was really shocked but I said I couldn't do that, as I feel like if 
              this story isn't told, they will just have free rein to do whatever they
               want to," he said.<br><br>Wu is the latest foreigner working in China to have been detained by police in sometimes controversial circumstances.<br><br>Australian
               national Stern Hu -- who worked for mining giant Rio Tinto -- was 
              detained in 2009 and eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison on 
              bribery and trade secrets charges.<br><br>Xue Feng, a Chinese-born 
              American geologist, was also jailed for eight years last year on state 
              secret charges over the sale of a database on China's oil industry, 
              despite repeated US calls to release him.<br><br>- AFP/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>China releases detained Singapore banker</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SHANGHAI: A Singaporean banker held for almost three months by 
              China after a client allegedly fled the country with millions of dollars
               has been released, according to her fiance and mother.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However Eden Wu, who
               worked in private banking for British bank Standard Chartered in 
              Shanghai when she was arrested on March 6, must remain in China for a 
              year as authorities carry out a global manhunt for the client.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"Eden was released 
              from residential surveillance," her fiance, Jason Tan, said in a blog 
              posting from the United States on Thursday, adding she was released on 
              50,000 yuan (US$7,900) bail.<br><br>"She is also not allowed to leave China for one year," he said.<br><br>"They
               have determined that she has not done anything wrong and have released 
              her, yet they are preventing her from leaving even after holding her for
               79 days."<br><br>Wu's mother confirmed her daughter had been released 
              in the eastern city of Wuxi and they were now together in Shanghai. Wu 
              herself declined to take phone calls.<br><br>"This case has given her and our family much pressure," her mother told AFP.<br><br>Chinese
               media has reported the Chinese banker believed to be the target of the 
              government investigation, Sun Feng, is the subject of a manhunt.<br><br>Sun,
               former head of an Agricultural Bank of China branch in Jiangyin city, 
              fled late last year with more than 100 million yuan illegally raised 
              from friends and relatives, the China Daily newspaper said in March.<br><br>A spokesman for police in Wuxi city, which administers Jiangyin, declined to comment.<br><br>In his blog, Tan criticised Standard Chartered for failing to do more to secure Wu's release.<br><br>"If
               it were not for her job at SC (Standard Chartered), Eden would never 
              have met Sun Feng and would never have been involved in this case," he 
              said.<br><br>In a statement Friday Standard Chartered told AFP: "We 
              still are unable to comment further on Eden's case as this is part of an
               ongoing investigation by the police, but we can confirm that Standard 
              Chartered is not being investigated."<br><br>Wu was the latest foreign national working in China to have been detained by police in sometimes controversial circumstances.<br><br>Xue
               Feng, a Chinese-born American geologist, was also jailed for eight 
              years last year on state secret charges over the sale of a database on 
              China's oil industry, despite repeated US calls to release him.<br><br>Australian
               Stern Hu -- who worked for mining giant Rio Tinto -- was detained in 
              2009 and eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison on bribery and trade
               secrets charges.<br><br>- AFP/wm</span></span></p>

              <p>Sorry to say lah. I dunno why so good to become a naturalised singaporean. A lot of my countrymen migrate to singapore but I am still here because I see no point in being a singaporean power ranger living in HDB, complaining all day about PAP and working like shit - better cheaper faster.</p>
              <p>I live in big house, low cost life - subsidised fuel and sugar and able to buy car without need for COE. Also, I get to work lacksidaisal without having to suffer from singapore work-life culture.</p>
