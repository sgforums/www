              <p><strong>Coach operators and association fined S$1.69m for price fixing</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Sixteen coach operators and the Express Bus Agencies
              Association have been fined a total of S$1.69 million for fixing the
              price of coach tickets. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Competition Commission of Singapore said this has been going
              on for one-way coach tickets between Singapore and destinations in
              Malaysia from 2006 to 2008. <br> <br> The Express Bus Agencies Association, which has about 25 members, said
              some 300,000 travellers used their coaches for trips last year between
              Singapore and Malaysia. <br> <br> The commission said the association and 16 coach operators imposed
              minimum selling prices first fixed at S$25 for one-way coach tickets to
              Kuala Lumpur when some of the association's members were then selling
              their tickets at S$20 or S$23. <br> <br> The prices were revised in March 2006 and ranged between S$22 and S$39. 
              <br> <br> Besides setting minimum selling prices, the Express Bus Agencies
              Association and the 16 coach operators also went about increasing the
              price of tickets by implementing fuel and insurance charges. <br> <br> This was done in 2005 and was reviewed in 2007 and 2008. The commission
              estimates that the coach operators pocketed nearly S$3.65 million
              through these fuel and insurance charges. <br> <br> Teo Eng Cheong, chief executive, Competition Commission of Singapore,
              said: "The members had regular meetings and this topic of minimum
              selling price, and fuel and insurance charge will be discussed. They
              also have a rebate system to track and monitor the sales of these
              coupons and to make sure that members sell sufficient number of
              coupons. <br> <br> "We also have evidence to show that when one company was selling its
              ticket price below the minimum selling price, another company
              complained at the meetings. <br> <br> "We do not object to companies increasing their price because of fuel
              cost increases. What we object to is companies colluded and fixed the
              prices and this was done as a first instance. <br> <br> "We would like to encourage (those) facing with price increases to
              consider ways to improve their productivity or innovate their products
              and services instead of getting together to fix prices - that is
              something we don't want to encourage" <br> <br> The Express Bus Agencies Association argued that it was not aware of
              the Competition Act till the commission started investigating in June
              last year. <br> <br> Sebastian Yap, Express Bus Agencies Association, said: "We learned that
              the law exists that we were not aware. Of course, we will not do this
              again. If we could have known this earlier, it would have been much
              better for all of us." <br> <br> The association added that it has not been profiteering, but covering
              increases in fuel costs. The association and its members have two
              months to pay up their fines or file an appeal. </span></p>
