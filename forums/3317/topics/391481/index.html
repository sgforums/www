              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It has been a week since the casino at Resorts World
              Sentosa (RWS) opened. As of Friday evening, it has attracted more than
              128,000 visitors as well as its fair share of bouquets and brickbats.</span></p>
              <p><span>There were long queues on the first two days of its opening and
              the wait could stretch for as long as two hours. The queues could still
              come back as RWS was expecting a surge in visitors after dinner on
              Saturday night, but they won't be as long.
              <br> <br>Robin Goh, assistant director for communications, RWS, said: "The
              queues have kind of tapered off - for now. These queue lines are still
              here. This being the first non-Chinese New Year weekend, we are
              expecting large queues to come in as well. <br> <br> "So we are going to put them (queue lines) here....just in case we need
              to activate them. This is to make sure that the queues are smooth and
              to make sure that people don't get all over the place."
              <br> <br> Currently, with at least three quarters of the casino opened, RWS insists it is operationally ready. 
              <br> <br> But the 15,000-square-metre casino will not be able to cater to 20,000 people at any one time even when fully opened. 
              <br> <br> There have been calls to add more gaming tables but RWS said this has to be approved by the Casino Regulatory Authority. 
              <br> <br> RWS is also grappling with unhappiness and confusion over the dress code.
              <br> <br> Some visitors were turned away for showing up in slippers, singlets and shorts while others in the same attire were allowed in.
              <br> <br> "Yesterday I wore slippers, can go inside casino. But today, I can't," said a punter.
              <br> <br> "They didn't tell me (what to wear) when I paid the $100 (levy)," said another punter.
              <br> <br>RWS said large signs on the dress code have already been posted
              everywhere including at the entrance of the levy payment counter for
              Singaporeans and Permanent Residents.
              <br> <br> Despite the teething problems, RWS said it will work on the feedback from visitors and iron out the kinks as soon as possible.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) said it
              is too early to assess the social impact brought about by the casino. <br> <br> But the NCPG "has been engaging RWS on the implementation of various
              social safeguards to minimize problem and addictive gambling", said
              NCPG chairman Lim Hock San. <br> <br> He added that the NCPG remains committed to ensuring that stringent
              social safeguards put in place are effective, and continue to be
              benchmarked with best practices in casinos worldwide.
