              <p>NUKUS, Uzbekistan â€“ The drying up of the Aral Sea is one of the
              planet's most shocking environmental disasters, U.N. Secretary-General
              Ban Ki-moon said Sunday as he urged Central Asian leaders to step up
              efforts to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>Once the world's fourth-largest lake, the sea has shrunk by 90
              percent since the rivers that feed it were largely diverted in a Soviet
              project to boost cotton production in the arid region.</p>
              <p>The
              shrunken sea has ruined the once-robust fishing economy and left
              fishing trawlers stranded in sandy wastelands, leaning over as if they
              dropped from the air. The sea's evaporation has left layers of highly
              salted sand, which winds can carry as far away as Scandinavia and
              Japan, and which plague local people with health troubles.</p>
              <p>Ban
              toured the sea by helicopter as part of a visit to the five countries
              of former Soviet Central Asia. His trip included a touchdown in Muynak,
              Uzbekistan, a town once on the shore where a pier stretches eerily over
              gray desert and camels stand near the hulks of stranded ships.</p>
              <p>"On
              the pier, I wasn't seeing anything, I could see only a graveyard of
              ships," Ban told reporters after arriving in Nukus, the nearest sizable
              city and capital of the autonomous Karakalpak region.</p>
              <p>"It is clearly one of the worst disasters, environmental disasters of the world. I was so shocked," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              Aral Sea catastrophe is one of Ban's top concerns on his six-day trip
              through the region and he is calling on the countries' leaders to set
              aside rivalries to cooperate on repairing some of the damage.</p>
              <p>"I urge all the leaders ... to sit down together and try to find the solutions," he said, promising United Nations support.</p>
              <p>However, cooperation is hampered by disagreements over who has rights to scarce water and how it should be used.</p>
              <p>In
              a presentation to Ban before his flyover, Uzbek officials complained
              that dam projects in Tajikistan will severely reduce the amount of
              water flowing into Uzbekistan. Impoverished Tajikistan sees the
              hydroelectric projects as potential key revenue earners.</p>
              <p>Competition
              for water could become increasingly heated as global warming and rising
              populations further reduce the amount of water available per capita.</p>
              <p>Water
              problems also could brew further dissatisfaction among civilians
              already troubled by poverty and repressive governments; some observers
              fear that could feed growing Islamist sentiment in the region.</p>
              <p>Ban also is taking on the region's frequently poor human rights conditions.</p>
              <p>That
              is likely to be an especially tense issue when he meets Monday with
              Uzbek President Islam Karimov, who has led the country since the 1991
              Soviet collapse and imposed severe pressure on opposition and civil
              rights activists.</p>
              <p>The meeting comes less than two weeks after
              the U.N. Human Rights Committee issued a report criticizing Uzbekistan,
              including calling for fuller investigation of the brutal suppression of
              a 2005 uprising in the city of Andijan. Opposition and rights groups
              claim that hundreds were killed, but authorities insist the reports are
              exaggerated and angrily reject any criticism.</p>
