              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Indonesian domestic helper, upset that she had been scolded, mixed her urine into a bottle of milk and fed it to her employer’s four-year-old child.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Ela, who goes by one name, pleaded guilty to one count of mischief on Monday (Jun 6), for mixing her urine into the boy’s milk. She was sentenced to six weeks’ jail.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>A second charge, for mixing her urine into a flask containing the family’s drinking water, was taken into consideration during sentencing.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>She had worked for the family for just five weeks before she decided to trick them into consuming her urine – because she wanted to make the family “listen and be obedient to her”, the prosecutor told the court. Ela was also upset that her employer’s mother-in-law had scolded her.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The court heard that on Oct 16 2015, the child’s mother drank some water from the flask and noticed the water appeared to be yellowish in colour and that it tasted odd. She offered the water to her husband and mother-in-law, both of whom took a sip and agreed that it tasted odd.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The husband kept the flask in his bedroom overnight, and realised the next morning that it smelt pungent, the court heard. The couple asked Ela whether anything had happened to the water, but the maid told them nothing was wrong.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>On Oct 18, he found Ela washing the flask after pouring its contents into the sink. He took her back to the maid agency, where she admitted that she had mixed the family’s drinking water as well as the toddler’s milk with her urine.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>For committing mischief, Ela could have been jailed up to one year and/or fined.</div>

You have to understand all these domestic helpers are from indonesia rural villages whereby such practices are still ongoing. This is not the first time such cases are on news, some are more outrageous or serious. There are also cases of Javanese Black Magic casted on their employers and family by these Indonesia Domestic Workers. Getting good domestic helpers are not easy these days, even with a good agency, you also need a little luck. </strong></span></p></div>
