              <h2>Malaysian student gang-raped in London, seven Russians arrested</h2>
              <p>An 18-year-old Malaysian student has reportedly been gang-raped by 
              several Russian men, including an intelligence officer for the Moscow 
              Police.</p>
              <p>British tabloid <em>The Sun, </em>which first carried the story last Thursday, reported that the girl had attended a party at the prestigious Bellerbys College in Greenwich, South London, where she is studying.</p>
              <p>Quoting sources, the report claimed the girl was drugged and filmed 
              while seven Russian men assaulted her. One of the men has been 
              identified as intelligence officer Oleg Vladimirvich Ivanov, 23, who has
               been charged with the offence.</p>
              <p>The incident was said to have happened early two Sundays ago during 
              the party attended by English language students of the college. The 
              report also stated that police confiscated iPhones, which contained 
              alarming footage of the victim being gang-raped.</p>
              <p>Ivanov and three others identified as Gregory Andreev Melnikov, 22, 
              Norayr Davtyan, 25, and Arnen Simonay, 26, were charged at the Woolwich 
              Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
              <p>All four claimed trial and have been remanded.</p>
              <p>They will appear at Woolwich Crown Court on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Two other suspects were allowed bail while another was released without charges.</p>
              <p>The tabloid report stated that the men claimed to be students, but 
              reliable sources were quoted as saying that Ivanov, who had only been in
               Britain for a week before the alleged gang-rape, worked in the 
              Intelligence Section of the Moscow Police.</p>
              <p>A friend realised something was amiss after the victim staggered into her room.</p>
              <p>“She is distraught. She is very young and it is believed she was 
              given a drug before being defiled,” the report quoted a source as 
              saying.</p>
              <p>When contacted by Malaysian newspaper <em>The Star</em>, two students of the college were reserved in their comments.</p>
              <p>“What we know so far is what everyone has read in the newspaper (<em>The Sun</em>).
               We refuse to talk about the case as we are not allowed to. Please 
              contact our college officials if you want a comment,” said one of them.</p>
              <p>The college officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
