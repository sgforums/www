              <p>Front Page:<br> <em>S'PORE GIRL GIVES BIRTH AT 9<br> -Father was from same primary school, says counsellor<br> -Very unusual case, say doctors<br> -She didn't know she was pregnant until...</em><br> <br> Article:<br> <em>-By time Pri 3 girl finds out she's pregnant, it's<br> <strong>TOO LATE TO ABORT</strong></em><strong><br></strong> <br> WHAT would a 9-year-old girl know about pregnancy? After allm she's
              still a child herself. At 9 when all she should fret about was her
              schoolwork, Jane (not her real name) was alreadying grappling with
              pregnancy, labour pains and yes, morning sickness.<br> <br> You see, this girl was in Primary Three when she was made pregnant by her boyfriend from the same primary school back in 2004.<br> <br> Yes, she was just 8 years old, a Primary Three student in a school here
              in Singapore, according to a Tamil Murasu report on Sunday.<br> <br> And by the time her parents found out, it was already too late for her to abort the baby.<br> <br> The shocking case was mentioned during a seminar about youth
              relationships organised by Tamil cultural group Narpani Peravai and
              Republic Polytechnic last Saturday.<br> <br> Jane, the girl, was an early puberty case, and had already started
              menstruating when she was eight, said counsellor Sheena Jebal from
              Nulife Care &amp; Counselling Services to Tamil Murasu.<br> <br> An early developer, she was about 1.3m tall and quite big-size for a girl her age.<br> <br> She met her boyfriend in school and they had sex freqyently at the girl's house, which was a private property.<br> <br> All this time, the children's parents never suspected a thing.<br> <br> The girl's parents were out and working most of the time.<br> <br> Jane is the only girl in the family.<br> <br> And when she started gaining weight and had morning sickness, she didn't suspect that she was pregnant.<br> <br> She just thought she was sick.<br> <br> Her family, teachers and friends also didn't suspect anything amiss and thought she was just putting on weight.<br> <br> When Jane was in school, her blouse was tucked out so no one could tell if she was pregnant.<br> <br> Her mother - who thought her daughter had a urine infection - took her
              to the doctor, and was horrified to find out that her daughter was
              six-months' pregnant.<br> <br> By that time, it was too late for Jane To abort the baby.<br> <br> Said Ms Jebal: "She gave the child up for adoption soon after giving birth."<br> <br> Her son would be about 3 years old now.<br> <br> Jabe and her boyfriend were subsequently referred to Ms Jebal for counselling.<br> <br> The counsellor did not want to reveal more about the case when The New Paper contacted her.<br> <br> She said it will bring back bad memories for the family and the girl.<br> <br> According to Tamil Murasu however, both of them are from well-to-do families here.<br> <br> Jane is currently taking her PSLE in a regional country but her parents
              are still here. The boy was sent to a Reformative Training Centre soon
              after.</p>
