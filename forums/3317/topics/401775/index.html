              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Lawyers said tweaks to the Casino Control Act may be 
              needed to provide for "special circumstances", such as if an emergency 
              breaks out. </span></p>
              <p><span>This follows an incident when 15 diners were forced to walk 
              through the casino because they found that two lifts - their only exits -
               were out of order.
              <br> <br> The group refused to pay the $100 casino levy.
              <br> <br> The incident happened on May 4. The diners had patronised a Chinese 
              restaurant, Imperial Treasure, at Marina Bay Sands (MBS).
              <br> <br> Responding to MediaCorp, the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) said it 
              is "aware of this incident and is currently looking into the matter".
              <br> <br> It is unclear how many in the group are Singaporeans and permanent 
              residents. But MediaCorp understands none of them have been prosecuted 
              yet.
              <br> <br> The incident raises questions about whether the law provides for 
              exemptions from entry levies.
              <br> <br> One lawyer said the incident may have highlighted a technical breach of 
              the law but the Attorney General's Chambers still has the discretion to 
              decide whether to charge the individuals or penalise Marina Bay Sands.
              <br> <br> By failing to collect the entry levies, Marina Bay Sands would also have
               flouted Section 116 of the Act - which makes them liable to 
              disciplinary action.
              <br> <br> This may come in the form of one or more of the following - cancellation
               or suspension of a casino license; receiving a letter of censure; the 
              variation of the terms of a casino license; or being fined not more than
               $1 million.
              <br> <br> Sunil Sudheesan from law firm KhattarWong said: "Frankly, I do not think
               that CRA would take any action in this case."
              <br> <br> He added that tweaks to the existing laws may be needed to provide for 
              "special circumstances", such as fires. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Event organisers sue MBS</strong></p>
              <p>THE organisers of a prestigious law event held at Marina Bay Sands 
              (MBS) have responded to the integrated resort's (IR) suit by launching a
               counter-claim of their own.</p>
              <p>A group representing the Inter-Pacific Bar Association (IPBA) has 
              said that a conference staged at MBS from May 2-5 was a 'complete 
              disaster', and is claiming unspecified damages.</p>
              <p>In its counter-claim, filed with the High Court on Tuesday, 
              the group said MBS had promised many things in an effort to convince it 
              to hold its annual conference there, and it had agreed to do so based on
               this.</p>
              <p>Instead, many things went wrong during the conference - 
              including instances of water leakage into hotel rooms of some delegates,
               intermittent power failure, and incidents where some guests were locked
               in their rooms - causing the group's reputation to suffer.</p>
              <p>The group, called IPBA 2010 and comprising several prominent
               lawyers, including Mrs Lee Suet Fern and Senior Counsel Lok Vi Ming, is
               also seeking aggravated damages.</p>
              <p>It claims MBS prevented it from backing out of a deal to 
              hold its conference there despite the resort's lack of readiness.</p>
