              who pilfered S$12.2 million from the statutory board over a span of less
               than two years, have pleaded guilty to cheating and money laundering 
              charges.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>41-year-old Koh Seah
               Wee, a former SLA deputy director of its technology and infrastructure 
              department, pleaded guilty to a total of 46 cheating charges involving 
              two statutory boards and nine counts of money laundering.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Koh's 
              then-subordinate and accomplice, 38-year-old Christopher Lim Chai Meng, 
              also pleaded guilty to 41 cheating charges and eight counts of money 
              laundering.<br><br>Their modus operandi was to put up fictitious 
              contracts with IT vendors who eventually did not provide the goods and 
              services to SLA as stated in the contracts. A total of 11 vendors were 
              involved in the scam.<br><br>Meanwhile, the SLA has sued the duo, along 
              with 16 other individuals and firms, to recover the S$12.2 million. The 
              case has been adjourned to November 4.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Former SLA employees jailed for cheating, money laundering</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Two former Singapore Land Authority (SLA) employees were sentenced to imprisonment on Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>41-year-old James Koh Seah Wee was sentenced to a total of 22 years jail for both cheating and money laundering.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>His accomplice, 38-year-old Christopher Lim Chai Meng, was sentenced to 15 years jail, also for cheating and money laundering.<br><br>The former SLA employees had pleaded guilty to pilfering S$12.5 million from government coffers.<br><br>Koh
               and Lim rendered bogus invoices through various IT firms for fake 
              maintenance services and goods that were never needed or delivered.<br><br>The
               fraud was uncovered in June when investigations showed a number of 
              irregular payments worth some S$12 million within SLA's Technology and 
              Infrastructure Department. The payments took place place between January
               2008 and March 2010.<br><br>Justice Tay Yong Kwang told the court that 
              offences involving public funds committed against public institutions 
              have to be dealt with sternly as they undermine good administration.<br><br>He
               said financial crimes like these often have repercussions beyond the 
              immediate facts of the case. He added that new and more stringent checks
               may also have to be introduced to try to prevent a repeat of such 
              cheating. This, he said, would result in unnecessary increased costs in 
              time, manpower and even infrastructure.<br><br>Justice Tay said a clear 
              distinction had to be drawn between those who break the law for the 
              first time, and those who had been flouting it for years and were 
              charged for the first time. He added Koh and Lim were not novices in 
              crime and were skilled at avoiding detection.<br><br>While the judge 
              singled out Koh as naturally bearing more blame, being the more senior 
              officer and having cheated three public bodies while working within 
              them, he did not diminish Lim's role, who cheated only one public body, 
              saying the duo relied on each other for the deception.<br><br>Lawyer 
              Subhas Anandan, who represented Lim Chai Meng, said: "I think the 
              sentence is fair and our client has told us he is not appealing, I think
               he's accepted the sentence."<br><br>Justice Tay said he did not agree 
              with the prosecution's description of Koh and Lim as "highly 
              sophisticated criminals", saying they did not try to camouflage their 
              huge cash reserves.<br><br>He called both Koh and Lim's purchase of 
              super fast cars, like the Lamborghini and Ferrari, "egoistic acts". He 
              said they were carelessly inviting questions about their new-found 
              wealth and were hardly "sophisticated money launderers".<br><br>Both Lim and Koh assisted in police investigations, and some S$9 million in money and assets have been recovered so far.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ac</span></span></p>
