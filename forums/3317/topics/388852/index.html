              <p><strong>Efforts to curb radicalism must continue, say security experts</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Efforts to curb radicalism must continue to prevent
              radical groups from dominating the religious discourse in the region. </span></p>
              <p><span>That's the hope of security experts who are featured in a new Channel News Asia documentary series entitled Misguided. 
              <br> <br> Its producers also interviewed former Jemaah Islamiyah members in Indonesia.
              <br> <br> Ngruki is a small village in Solo that looks like any other in
              Indonesia. Of late Ngruki has been in the spotlight, for this is where
              the Al-Mukmin Pesantren, an Islamic boarding school is located.
              <br> <br> A number of people linked to the school have been implicated in terrorist attacks.
              <br> <br>It was also in Ngruki that the crew of Misguided met ex JI member
              Farihin who in the name of jihad had fought in Afghanistan and Poso, in
              Indonesia.
              <br> <br> Farihin said: “In 2000, I volunteered to fight in Poso. I attacked two Christian villages.”
              <br> <br> Yusoff is another ex-JI member who was just released from a 10-year jail sentence for possessing firearm and explosives.
              <br> <br> For Yusoff, he heeded the call of jihad by fighting alongside the MILF in Philippines.
              <br> <br>Both are examples of ex-JI members who were once influenced by
              radical ideology to a point where armed struggle is seen as legitimate.
              <br> <br>Associate Professor Kumar Ramakrishna, S Rajaratnam School of
              International Studies, explained: "To me, the centre of gravity of this
              conflict is the ideology, for these individuals who get sucked into
              this particular radical movement." <br> <br> Singapore itself is not immune to radical ideology as seen from various arrests that have taken place here involving JI members.
              <br> <br> For the first time, the producers were given access to film actual
              evidence gathered by security agencies from detained JI members.
              <br> <br>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng stressed in an interview for
              this documentary on the importance of Singaporeans remaining vigilant.
              <br> <br>He said: "The terrorism that we face today takes on a different
              shape this time round it is a group of people making use or misusing
              religion to perpetuate their cause. We have to adopt a more holistic
              plan to counter the problem. We must not allow such groups like the
              Al-Qaeda JI and many others to misuse the religion to affect our social
              fabric." <br> <br> He also stressed that the terror threat will not diminish after the demise of Noordin Top and Azahari Hussin.
              <br> <br> The four part documentary series entitled "Misguided" airs every Friday 8.30pm on Channel NewsAsia starting on Friday. </span></p>
