              <p>THE Singapore Navy has received indications a terror group is 
              planning attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Malacca, a key shipping
               lane for world trade, a Singapore shipping body warned on Thursday.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Navy recommends ships using the strait between
               Indonesia and Malaysia strengthen onboard security measures, the 
              Singapore Shipping Association (SSA) said in an advisory to shipowner 
              members.</p>
              <p>'This does not preclude possible attacks on other large 
              vessels with dangerous cargo,' the SSA said in the advisory seen by 
              Reuters.</p>
              <p>Singapore is the world's top container shipping port and 
              biggest ship refuelling hub. An attack that closed the Strait of Malacca
               or the port even temporarily could have a disproportionate impact on 
              global trade. Neither Singapore's Ministry of Defence nor navy could 
              comment immediately. The SSA's executive director Daniel Tan declined to
               give further details.</p>
              <p>Up to 80 per cent of China's oil imports and 30 per cent of 
              its iron ore imports pass through the Strait of Malacca - a narrow, 
              congested waterway between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.</p>
              <p>'The threat should be taken seriously as it comes from the 
              Singapore Navy and has been shared with the shipping community,' said Mr
               Rohan Gunaratna, a Singapore-based expert on radical groups who has 
              written a book on Al-Qaeda.</p>

              <p><strong>Alert levels raised in response to warnings of terror attacks in Malacca
               Strait</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said 
              all alert levels have been raised for the shipping community as well as 
              in security measures in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>He was responding to a question in Parliament about the recent 
              security alert in the Malacca Strait issued by the Republic of Singapore
               Navy (RSN).
              <br> <br> On Thursday, the RSN issued an alert saying it received indications that
               a terror group is planning attacks on oil tankers in the narrow 
              waterway between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.
              <br> <br> Mr Wong said: "As a result, the various security agencies have been 
              working very closely with one another, including the RSN and also our 
              foreign liaison partners. We are also working very closely with the 
              shipping community and the Singapore Shippers Association has put out an
               alert to all its members."
              <br> <br> Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean said the RSN took action - stepping up 
              the frequency of patrols around Singapore waters.
              <br> <br> The Maritime Security Task Force has also been coordinating a 
              whole-of-government response with agencies such as the Police Coast 
              Guard and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.
              <br> <br> Mr Teo said: "As this issue illustrates, threats to maritime security 
              continue to be real and immediate. Countering this threat requires a 
              multiplicity of effort - by governments acting alone and in cooperation 
              with one another.
              <br> <br> "In our immediate region, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand 
              have been conducting coordinated patrols to enhance the security of the 
              Malacca Strait. Through these Malacca Strait patrols, the littoral 
              states have continued to work together to combat maritime threats in 
              this important body of water."
              <br> <br> For the early detection of maritime threats and to coordinate response, 
              Singapore has also set up the Information Fusion Centre at the Changi 
              Command and Control Centre.
              <br> <br> Mr Teo said this will "help to further enhance Singapore's position as a
               maritime security hub".
              <br> <br> The centre has been purpose-built to collate and analyse information 
              shared among an international network of partners, to facilitate timely 
              and effective responses to maritime threats.
              <br> <br> So far, six countries have stationed liaison officers at the centre. Mr 
              Teo said more countries are expected to do so in the coming months.
              <br> <br> Beyond threats at sea, the terror threat remains very real for 
              Singapore. Mr Wong said that is because the appeal of extremist and 
              terrorist ideology is very much alive. Terrorist tradecraft and methods 
              are also evolving.
              <br> <br> So Singapore has undertaken measures to harden its security, from the 
              land checkpoints to the seas. High-risk targets such as the integrated 
              resorts (IRs) have also been hardened.
              <br> <br> To enhance response capacity for the IRs, the Marina Bay Neighbourhood 
              Police Centre is already operational. The Fire Station will be 
              operational next year.
              <br> <br> However, Mr Wong stressed that the most important asset is still people.
               That is where initiatives like the Community Engagement Programme to 
              strengthen the community's crisis response come into play.
              <br> <br> The Ministry of Home Affairs has piloted a Threat-Oriented Passenger 
              Screening Integrated System (TOPSIS) to train non-security communities, 
              such as airport check-in counter staff to identify suspicious 
              passengers.
