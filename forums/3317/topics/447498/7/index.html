              <p><strong>Chinese MOE scholar Sun Xu has been fined $3,000 and required to perform three months of community service</strong> by the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+university+of+singapore&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;vm=r&amp;cs=bz">National University of Singapore</a> (NUS) for <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/poreans-outraged-over-prc-scholar-dog-072146916.html">calling Singaporeans "dogs"</a> on his microblog.<br><br>The NUS on Monday also <strong>revoked the engineering student's scholarship benefits </strong>for his final semester.<br><br>An
                   NUS spokesperson said: “Mr Sun’s undergraduate scholarship benefits 
                  have been terminated for the final semester as his behaviour was 
                  unbecoming of a scholarship holder. Hence, <strong>he is required to pay back 
                  about $8,200 </strong>for the first tranche of this semester’s scholarship 
                  benefits, which had been disbursed to him."<br><br><strong>"Each undergraduate 
                  scholarship, which covers school fees and accommodation, costs between 
                  $18,000 to $25,000 per year. </strong>Under the terms of Mr Sun’s undergraduate 
                  scholarship, he is required to work in a Singapore-based company for up 
                  to 6 years. <strong>The full length of service obligation still applies to Mr 
                  Sun.</strong>"<br><br>"The University, which is administering the scholarship, has conveyed these details to Mr Sun," she said.<br><br>Sun had been <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/chinese-scholar-sun-xu-faces-nus-disciplinary-board.html">called before the school's disciplinary board</a> on 13 March after he came under a heavy online backlash following his "there are more dogs than
                  humans" in Singapore post on his personal Weibo microblog. 
                  <br><br>In an email circulated on Monday to NUS students, Prof Tan Eng 
                  Chye, deputy president of academic affairs and provost, said the board 
                  "has ruled that his remarks were improper, insensitive and disrespectful
                   to the community. The remarks had also stirred up considerable unease, 
                  distrust and ill-will within and beyond the university community."<br><br><strong>The
                   Board of Discipline (BOD), comprising senior academics as well as 
                  representatives of the NUS Students’ Union, meted out the punishments as
                   "his behaviour was unbecoming of a scholarship holder.</strong>" NUS is the 
                  administrator of his scholarship.</p>
              <p>Prof Tan added that Sun has been counselled and is deeply sorry.<br><br>At 2pm on Monday, Sun posted another public apology on his Facebook page, accepting the NUS Board of Discipline's decision.<br><br>"My
                   last month has been filled with great regrets and remorse. My comments 
                  were disrespectful and inappropriate, and I am very sorry for making 
                  those comments... I just want to say again that I am deeply sorry. 
                  Please accept my sincere and heartfelt apologies," he wrote. <br><br>In 
                  an ongoing Yahoo! poll, 39 per cent of respondents felt the punishments 
                  were too lenient, while 35 per cent said they were too little, too late.</p>

              <p>He 
                  didn't mention Singaporeans per se; it could have been an unpleasant

                  could be a result of the way young people write. They could be 
                  expressive in how they describe things</strong>, which someone who's older might 
                  not appreciate.<strong> And of course, the slang and the things he used is very 
                  Shanghainese. I think it's quite colloquial, likewise I think there are 
                  some young-speak which I don't understand. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Even his comment about the 
                  dogs - it might not literally mean that, it might mean something else</strong>, even though it is definitely not something positive.</p>
              <p><strong>We (also) need to reflect, are we the way that they described?</strong>” "</p>

              <p>True, but let's not get too carried away by emotion.</p>
              <p>The punishment is certainly quite hefty, especially when you consider that everyone thought that he would get away with nothing more than a warning letter.</p>
              <p>The A*Star scholar who went naked in Holland V broke the law outright, and she got hit with nothing more than a small fine. </p>
              <p>A certain MP (you all know who) insulted Malays and Indians, and all he got was a scolding from his fellow MPs, if that. It can be argued that the MP's remarks were more damaging and divisive to our social fabric since it targeted specific racial groups. This PRC kid's remarks on the other hand were directed at Singaporeans in general.</p>
              <p>Not saying that I would complain at having this fella expelled and deported. I'm just saying that he got more than a slap on the wrist.</p>

              <p>For those of you who think his punishment is that light, please

              <em>wasn't</em> criminal. Yeah, he p*ssed off a lot of
              Singaporeans, but at least it was a remark that targeted
              Singaporeans in general and not specific racial or religious groups
              (in which case, the remarks would have been far more damaging, and
              the Racial Harmony or Sedition Acts could've been tossed at

              <p>Prof Tan added that Sun has been counselled and is deeply sorry.<br><br>At 2pm on Monday, Sun posted another public apology on his Facebook page, accepting the NUS Board of Discipline's decision.<br><br>"My last month has been filled with great regrets and remorse. My comments were disrespectful and inappropriate, and I am very sorry for making those comments... I just want to say again that I am deeply sorry. Please accept my sincere and heartfelt apologies," he wrote.<br><br>In an ongoing Yahoo! poll, 39 per cent of respondents felt the punishments were too lenient, while 35 per cent said they were too little, too late.</p>
