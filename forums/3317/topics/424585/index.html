              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Divorces among Muslims in Singapore have gone down by
               some 17 per cent over the last five years, while divorces amongst 
              minors have decreased by 26 per cent during the same period.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Minister in Charge 
              of Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim told the House during the budget 
              debate on Malay-Muslim issues that the community has also seen progress 
              in education and employment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Efforts to foster strong marriages and families among the Malay-Muslim community have seen results.<br><br>Preliminary figures show that the number of divorces stands at 1626 last year, down from some 1944 in 2006.<br><br>The
               community also gained some ground in tackling the issue of marriages 
              involving minors. Marriages involving minors dropped some 35 per cent 
              since 2006.<br><br>The INSPIRASI hubs operated by PPIS Family Service 
              Centre (West) and the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) that 
              helped minor couples saw positive results in its efforts. Last year, 
              more than 40 per cent of the 307 couples who attended premarital 
              counselling at the INSPIRASI hubs either delayed or cancelled their 
              marriage.<br><br>Dr Yaacob said the situation is improving but the community must not rest on its laurels.<br><br>A
               recent study on Muslim marriages by the Community Development, Youth 
              and Sports Ministry revealed that five in 10 divorces involved those who
               were 21 to 29 years old at the point of marriage. 25 per cent of female
               divorcees and eight per cent of male divorcees were below 21 years at 
              the point of marriage.<br><br>He called for greater moral courage to bring attention to cases that otherwise fall through the cracks.<br><br>"Families
               should not hesitate nor be embarrassed to seek help when necessary. I 
              am confident that with more feedback, further public outreach and 
              improvement of existing hardware, we can continue to bring down the 
              numbers of divorces, minor marriages and dysfunctional families," said 
              Dr Yaacob.<br><br>About three in 10 Malay-Muslims in Singapore are below the age of 19 years old.<br><br>Turning
               to the educational attainment of youths, Dr Yaacob said it has been 
              improving. Figures provided by the Education Ministry showed that Malay 
              students have made the greatest improvement over the past 10 years in 
              their performance at the GCE A-Level Examinations.<br><br>The proportion
               of Malays aged 15 and over with at least post-secondary qualifications 
              has doubled from 18 per cent in 2000 to 36 per cent in 2010.<br><br>Dr 
              Yaacob urged more young people to step forward to bring the community to
               greater heights. But other than developing young talents, he said it is
               also crucial to reach out to vulnerable youths before they succumb to 
              negative influences. MENDAKI will be launching an Engagement Programme 
              for Boys (EPB) this month. The EPB will pilot with 100 secondary boys 
              from various schools, providing them with a platform to continue their 
              education, engage in enriching activities, and develop wholesome values.<br><br>The
               community was also forthcoming when it came to training and employment.
               About 12,700 training places under MENDAKI's Job Steady Programme were 
              taken up in last year. MENDAKI's Job Ready programme also assisted about
               3,700 job seekers in re-employment.<br><br>During the debate, several MPs also raised the issue of integration. Dr Yaacob said integration is a continuous process.<br><br>"Progress
               by all communities, including Malay/Muslims, has been good. There will 
              occasionally be hiccups and sometimes feelings are hurt when 
              perspectives differ on sensitive issues that we hold dear. But we should
               not let such hiccups hold us back. In my considered view, today our 
              integration and mutual confidence between races and religions is 
              stronger, more resilient and more mature than it was a decade ago, 
              before 9/11," said Dr Yaacob.<br><br>He added: "In pursuing integration,
               we reaffirm our Singaporean Muslim Identity which encapsulates our way 
              of life, and our aspirations to be open, forward looking and successful 
              community. Our Prime Minister has stated clearly the government's 
              appreciation for the Malay-Muslim community's efforts, and its strong 
              support for these efforts. I am therefore confident that the community 
              will continue to work closely with the government and other communities 
              to strengthen our national cohesion."<br><br>Dr Yaacob said under 
              Islamic Religious Council's leadership, mosques have been active members
               of the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs), hosting 
              inter-faith dialogues on mosque grounds.<br><br>He said such sessions have helped build understanding and respect among various religious communities.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
