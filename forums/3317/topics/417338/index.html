              <p>SINGAPORE : A 23—year—old man was slashed at Yishun Ring Road on Wednesday evening.</p>
              <p>Police said three suspects — aged 13, 15 and 18 — have been arrested in connection with the incident.</p>
              <p>The incident occurred at the void deck of Block 362, Yishun Ring Road.</p>
              <p>The victim was apparently attacked by two youths who, according to witnesses, were on a motorcycle.</p>
              <p>The victim fled the scene, leaving a trail of blood along the way till the nearby Block 343 at Yishun Ave 11.</p>
              <p>There, he sought help from a resident on the second floor.</p>
              <p>Goh Gerard Kelvin said: "So he came up all the way here...I controlled his blood pressure...I (asked him what happened), and he said ’somebody chopped my hand’."</p>
              <p>Other residents said the victim was not alone.</p>
              <p>Iskandar Zulqarnain said: "When I come down, I saw a lot of teenagers and one guy (was covered with) blood. I was shocked."</p>
              <p>Police said they received a call about the incident at 5.50pm.</p>
              <p>The victim had injuries to his head and arms, and was taken to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.</p>

              <p>why are our soldiers so soft? </p>
              <p>why are the younger generation so yaya nowadays?</p>
              <p>some parents yell and shout at teachers and principals without reason.  they dont even bother to set a good example in the school.  they pamper and over protect their children.</p>
              <p>the military and teachers cant do anything to these people nowadays without receiving a complaint.  so who can teach them?  parents? parents who are always working?</p>

              <p>IMHO, law is there, it can be tightened till breaking pt..but if there are no enforcers, then what's the pt of law?</p>
              <p>to these people, already, the media has made it so public, but they turn a blind eye, cause they may know, law is law, but until someone acts, the law is just words..</p>
              <p>yes, parents play an impt role, but it has to be collective, schools, parents, society, authorities, all have a part to play.</p>
