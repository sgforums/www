              <p>SUICIDE rates in Singapore dropped to their lowest level in nine
              years, to 8.76 per 100,000 residents, last year. The actual number of
              suicides last year also fell - to 364, a five-year low.</p>
              <p>The numbers are well below that of other Asian countries such as
              South Korea (24 per 100,000), Japan (23.1 per 100,000) and Hong Kong
              (18.6 per 100,000). Experts credit government policies and closer
              interaction among various volunteer groups for keeping numbers down.</p>
              <p>Dr Chia Boon Hock, a psychiatrist in private practice who has been
              studying suicide data for 40 years, said the attention paid by the
              Government to issues of mental health, and policies that help the needy
              and elderly, have helped bring the suicide rate down.</p>
              <p>Efforts to keep people employed are another key factor, he said,
              noting that unemployed people are much more likely to decide to end
              their lives: Data from 2000 to 2004, for example, showed that suicide
              rates among the jobless here were about 20 times higher than among
              those who had work.</p>
              <p>The work done by volunteer groups is another key factor, said Ms
              Christine Wong, executive director of suicide prevention group
              Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), which released the figures on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Over the last two years, she said, SOS had been conducting training
              sessions for the staff of various voluntary welfare organisations, and
              this has resulted in better working ties with these groups. 'They were
              more aware of our work and would refer more cases to us,' she said.</p>
              <p>The group is also working more closely with the police to counsel
              the desperate, and is helping more people now. She said the police
              referred 218 people who attempted suicide to SOS from April 2007 to
              March last year. In the 12 months following that, it saw 256 such
              cases, a 17 per cent increase.</p>
              <p>Ms Wong said that support from grassroots groups, such as financial
              aid given by the community development councils, also helps provide
              vital relief for people struggling to cope with money woes.</p>
              <p>Going forward, SOS said it would work with more companies and
              recruit more volunteers to continue raising awareness of its suicide
              prevention efforts.</p>
              <p>Dr Chia, however, warned that although the suicide rate fell last
              year, the economic downturn, which bit Singapore hard towards the end
              of last year and early this year, may lead more people to decide to end
              their lives.</p>
