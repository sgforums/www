              <p><strong>Jackson 'best father' ever, daughter tells the world</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Michael Jackson's young
              daughter, Paris, stepped out of the shadows Tuesday to pay moving
              tribute to the late star saying: "Daddy has been the best father you
              could ever imagine."</p>
              <p>The 11-year-old, speaking for the first time in public, fought back
              tears as she addressed millions of people around the world watching the
              ceremony, and hit back at all the gossip about their strange family
              life.</p>
              <p>"Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you
              could ever imagine. And I just wanted to say I love him so much," she
              told the hushed audience, before breaking down in tears.</p>
              <p>After
              tributes from Jackson's brothers, Jermaine and Marlon, Paris said she
              wanted to talk and struggled only slightly with adjusting the
              microphone to her height.</p>
              <p>"Speak up," her aunt Janet Jackson said
              softly, as Paris, dressed in a simple black dress, with a white
              waistband and holding a black clutch bag, bade her father a public
              goodbye.</p>
              <p>Paris Katherine and her brothers, Prince Michael, 12,
              and Prince Michael II, seven, had joined a host of stars on the stage
              at the end of the long tribute singing along to "We are the World."</p>
              <p>It
              was the first time the world had caught more than just a fleeting
              glimpse of the three youngsters, as Jackson, 50, always fiercely
              shielded his children from the public limelight.</p>
              <p>His former wife
              of three years, Debbie Rowe, is the mother of the two eldest children,
              while the third also known as "Blanket" was born in 2002 to a surrogate
              whose identity has never been made public.</p>
              <p>After being thrust
              into the spotlight from the age of five, Jackson went to extreme
              lengths to protect his children such as covering their faces in veils
              or masks whenever they were in public.</p>
              <p>And they have not been seen since his mysterious death on June 25 from an apparent cardiac arrest.</p>
              <p>But
              the three children joined other members of the Jackson clan at the Los
              Angeles Staples Center ceremony Tuesday, sitting between their
              grandparents Katherine and Joe Jackson just in front of the 14-karat
              gold casket bearing the body of their father.</p>
              <p>At times Paris
              dissolved into tears as star after star spoke of Jackson's legacy to
              the world, while her youngest brother played with a Michael Jackson
              doll on his lap.</p>
              <p>But she stood and applauded as civil rights
              leader Al Sharpton addressed the children directly and said fiercely:
              "There weren't nothing strange about your daddy."</p>
              <p>"It was strange
              what your daddy had to deal with, but he dealt with it," Sharpton said,
              his voice rising in the rich cadence of a sermon.</p>
              <p>Temporary
              custody of the children has so far been granted to Katherine Jackson,
              in line with the terms of Jackson's will, which also names pop diva
              Diana Ross as a back-up guardian.</p>
              <p>But Rowe, who signed away her
              parental rights to her two children in 2001, has vowed to fight for
              them in what could presage a bitter legal battle, even though they are
              believed to have had little contact over the years.</p>
              <p>"I want my
              children," Debbie Rowe told NBC television's local network in Los
              Angeles last week, adding she was willing to submit to any testing,
              including DNA, to prove she was the biological mother of Prince Michael
              and Paris.</p>
              <p>Her lawyer Eric George later appeared to dial back on
              his client's comments, saying in a conference call no final decision
              had been made.</p>
              <p>A custody hearing has now been set for Monday.</p>

              <div class="body imp" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Angered by negative comments about Michael Jackson made by New York Republican Representative Peter King, a group of Michael Jackson fans have created a campaign to raise money for the Democratic nominee in the upcoming election in King's district.</div>
              <div class="body">The fans became outraged after a video posted on YouTube showed Rep. King referring to Michael Jackson as a "pervert... low-life... and pedophile." <br><br>"Congressman Peter King is at again, this time defaming the late Michael Jackson..." <a href="http://www.actblue.com/page/jacksonfansagainstking"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the page reads</span></span></a>. "As Rick Sanchez noted on CNN, Michael Jackson was acquitted of the charges against him. Peter King ought to let Jackson rest in peace, and focus on the needs of his constituents. As we mourn the loss of an American legend, political grandstanding is not what we need right now!" <br><br>In the video, King says that the media is obsessed with Michael Jackson and as a result, other people, such as soldiers, firefighters, and teachers do not get the respect and attention they deserve. <br><br>"All we hear about is Michael Jackson."

              <p><strong>Jackson 'riddled' with needle marks: reports</strong></p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) – Michael Jackson's body was riddled with needle
              marks when he died, indicating possible use of a powerful sedative at
              the center of the investigation into his death, US media reported
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>CNN and ABC News both cited unidentified sources involved in the probe as saying multiple track marks and several <span id="lw_1247078397_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">collapsed veins</span> were discovered after Jackson's body was examined following his death on June 25.</p>
              <p>The marks on Jackson's body "could certainly be consistent with the
              regular IV use of a drug, like Diprivan," CNN quoted the source as
              saying.</p>
              <p>Several bottles of Diprivan, the brand name for the potent sedative
              propofol, were reportedly found at Jackson's home after his death.</p>
              <p>Diprivan is commonly used to induce unconsciousness in hospital patients ahead of major surgery.</p>
              <p>Experts say there is no conceivable reason why Jackson could have had
              the drug at his home and that it should only be administered by a
              trained anesthesiologist.</p>
              <p>Last week a nutritionist who worked with Jackson earlier this year told
              CNN in an interview the star had pleaded with her to acquire Diprivan.</p>

              focus on the needs of his constituents. As we mourn the loss of an
              American legend, political grandstanding is not what we need right
              now!"<br> <br> In the video, King says that the media is obsessed with Michael
              Jackson and as a result, other people, such as soldiers,
              firefighters, and teachers do not get the respect and attention
              they deserve.<br> <br> "All we hear about is Michael Jackson." King says. "Let's knockout

              <p>I can't stand the lobsided raves about MJ.</p>
              <p>Saw the BBC and ITV news specials while I was overseas... the celebrities and other hired fawners &amp; hanger-ons were gushing about him with nary a mention of his faults. One black female guest was talking about how people shouldn't judge him for his faults (drug addiction, plastic surgery addiction, low self esteem, child molestations, frivolousness with money etc. etc.) and that he should be remembered for his achievements only.</p>
              <p>What a load of bollocks. By claiming how great he is, you're already judging him. So judge the bad as well, dammit.</p>
              <p>This is the typical Western culture where so long as you are rich and famous, you can get away with anything. Yet the Brits always bitch and complain that the rich (aka Premier football stars) always get off easily when they break traffic rules (eg. speed limits). This is the same permissive Western culture where the likes of Kate Moss and Pete Doherty do cocaine etc. but always make a mockery of the law by skipping serious jail time - purely on the basis of their celebrity status.</p>
              <p>True, his musical genius and singwriting/singing talents are undeniable. But one cannot just rave about the good while ignoring everything else. You can't practice selective myopia with regards to the character flaws that contributed to his downfall (disintegrating nose anyone???). MJ was somebody who thought that he could  do anything he wanted to alter reality with limitless amounts of cash.</p>
              <p>If nothing else, he should be a cautionary tale for all young folks about how not to lead their lives. Traditional values rule.</p>

              <p>LONDON – Two British Sunday newspapers said <span id="lw_1247408009_0" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">LaToya Jackson</span> believes her <span id="lw_1247408009_1" class="yshortcuts" style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">brother Michael Jackson</span> was murdered by a group of conspirators trying to get hold of his fortune.</p>
              <p>LaToya Jackson said she knows who is responsible for her brother's death and is determined to see them brought to justice, the <span id="lw_1247408009_2" class="yshortcuts">News of the World</span> reported.</p>
              <p>According to the published interviews with The News of the World and The <span id="lw_1247408009_3" class="yshortcuts">Mail on Sunday</span>, she did not name any of the people she believes were involved and did not offer any evidence to support her claim that foul play was involved in the singer's <span id="lw_1247408009_4" class="yshortcuts">sudden death</span> on June 25.</p>
              <p>"I feel it was all about money," she was quoted as saying by the News of the World. "Michael was worth well over a billion in <span id="lw_1247408009_5" class="yshortcuts">music publishing</span> assets and somebody killed him for that. He was worth more dead than alive."</p>
              <p>She reportedly said the conspirators used powerful prescription drugs to keep <span id="lw_1247408009_6" class="yshortcuts" style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Michael Jackson</span> submissive and under control and also kept him away from his family.</p>
              <p>She also claimed, the newspapers reported, that roughly $2 million (1.23 million pounds) worth of cash and jewelry was taken from Michael Jackson's rented mansion and has not been accounted for.</p>
              <p>LaToya Jackson also was quoted as saying her brother did not want to perform the 50 <span id="lw_1247408009_7" class="yshortcuts">London</span> shows he had agreed to, but was pressured into that agreement.</p>
              <p>The shows, to <span id="lw_1247408009_8" class="yshortcuts" style="background: #dceeff; cursor: hand; color: #000; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">mark Michael Jackson</span>'s return to concert performing, had been scheduled to begin Monday at London's 02 Arena.</p>
              <p>Officials are waiting for the return of toxicology reports before determining the cause of Michael Jackson's death.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Jackson family says concert plans too much for him</strong></p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES - Michael Jackson's father said the King of Pop was not
              ready perform 50 shows in London, in a TV interview that aired the day
              the singer was scheduled to start his long-awaited comeback.</p>
              <p>Joe Jackson told ABC News that his son told him that he only agreed
              to perform 10 shows in London, but that the concert promoter booked
              more shows to bring the total to 50.</p>
              <p>"I was worried about his health, because all the shows that I'm
              seeing, no artist can do that many shows back to back like that," Joe
              Jackson told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Monday. "So I knew
              Michael couldn't do all those shows without some rests in between."</p>
              <p>In
              a statement, Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of concert
              promoter AEG Live, acknowledged on Monday that the number of shows was
              originally lower, but said Jackson had agreed to perform more.</p>
              <p>"Our original agreement with Michael Jackson called for 31 shows," Phillips said.</p>
              <p>When
              the response to the initial announcement of 10 shows was so
              overwhelming, AEG Live went to Jackson's then advisor, Dr. Tohme Tohme,
              and asked if the singer would be willing to do more, Phillips said. The
              first show was scheduled for July 13 with the remainder were spread out
              until February 2010.</p>
              <p>Tohme told AEG Live that Jackson would
              perform 50, and Jackson himself said he was motivated to embark on a
              record-setting run of concerts, Phillips said.</p>
              <p>The singer, 50,
              had previously passed a lengthy physical head of his first live concert
              series in 12 years and was rehearsing in Los Angeles the day before his
              death.</p>
              <p>Jackson died of cardiac arrest on June 25, after he stopped breathing and paramedics were called to his Los Angeles home.</p>
              <p>In
              a separate interview, Michael Jackson's sister, La Toya Jackson, told
              British newspaper The Daily Mail that her brother was "murdered" by a
              conspiracy of people around him.</p>
              <p>La Toya Jackson said she
              believes her brother was overworked to rehearse and prepare for the
              concert series, and that he was intentionally separated from his family.</p>
              <p>After the L.A. Coroner examined Jackson's body, his family ordered a second, private autopsy on the singer.</p>
              <p>"He
              had needle marks on his neck and his arms and more about those will
              emerge in the next few weeks," La Toya Jackson told the Daily Mail.</p>
              <p>"I
              cannot discuss that any further as I may jeopardize the investigation,"
              she said. "I can, however, say that I have not changed my mind about my
              feeling that Michael was murdered."</p>
              <p>La Toya Jackson also said her
              suspicions were raised by medical equipment, including oxygen tanks and
              a stand with a cord hanging down, in a room at her brother's home.</p>
              <p>Media
              reports have said that the dangerous sedative Diprivan -- normally used
              in hospitals by anesthesiologists -- was found at the singer's home.</p>
              <p>Los
              Angeles police have revealed few details of their investigation, and
              the L.A. Coroner said it will release the results of its autopsy within
              weeks.</p>

              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>LONDON - A SENSATIONAL new book, being rushed to publishing, has
              claimed that Michael Jackson had a number of gay lovers, said media
              reports on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>According to biographer, Ian Halperin, 'virtually everybody' in
              Jackson's inner circle knew he was gay, reported The Sun newspaper.</p>
              <p>Halperin told The Sun newspaper in Britain how he interviewed two
              of Jackson's alleged male lovers, with one claiming the pop star would
              sneak out of his home dressed as a woman for late night rendezvous.</p>
              <p>Halperin says he interviewed many people for his book, Unmasked:
              The Final Years of Michael Jackson, and was repeatedly told the pop
              star was gay.</p>
              <p>'Virtually everybody has told me,' the author told the newspaper.
              'Even those who are his most ardent defenders, people who maintain he
              is innocent of the molestation charges, insist that he is homosexually
              inclined.'</p>
              <p>One unnamed source is quoted in Halperin's book as saying Jackson's
              lovers included a waiter, aspiring actor and construction worker.</p>
              <p>'Michael would leave the house in disguise, often dressed as a
              woman, and would go to meet his boyfriend at a motel that was one of
              (Las) Vegas's grungiest dives,' the source said.</p>
              <p>'Michael was broke. He struggled to put food on the table for his children. It was all he could afford then.'</p>
              Jackson had repeatedly denied being gay before his sudden death in late June. -- AAP</div>

              <p><strong>Promoter mulls Michael Jackson tribute concert in Britain</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LONDON (AFP) - - The promoter of Michael Jackson's
              planned comeback concerts in London said Tuesday he was in talks with
              the late pop star's brothers and sisters about a one-off tribute show.</p>
              <p>The president of promoters AEG Live, Randy Phillips, said he was
              "confident" of making a decision this week about whether a show would
              go ahead on Jackson's birthday on August 29.</p>
              <p>Jackson had been
              preparing for a string of sold-out concerts called "This Is It" at
              London's O2 arena before his sudden death late last month.</p>
              <p>"The
              number one item I'm discussing is presenting "This Is It" the
              production, hopefully with the Jacksons and maybe Janet, and other
              artists," Phillips told BBC 6 Music radio station.</p>
              <p>"We have to
              make some hard decisions this week otherwise it will be too late to
              even contemplate doing anything on (the) 29th," he added.</p>
              <p>Phillips
              said he had also held negotiations with Kenny Ortega, the director of
              hit movie "High School Musical", who had been directing Jackson's
              concerts.</p>
              <p>"What we're thinking about is one massive tribute
              that's broadcast around the globe. We've opted to go to broadcast
              television, either cable/satellite, or traditional broadcast," he said.</p>
              <p>Hundreds
              of fans have gathered outside the O2 Arena in the British capital this
              week to mark what would have been the start of Jackson's 50 planned
              concerts.</p>
              <p>AEG Live have said they will offer a full refund to all
              fans who were due to attend. Alternatively, ticket holders can send off
              for their specially designed tickets to keep as memorabilia.</p>
