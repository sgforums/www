              <p><strong>Police treating Jackson's death as homicide: report</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - The Los Angeles Police
              Department is treating Michael Jackson's death as a homicide and is
              focusing on doctor Conrad Murray, entertainment website TMZ.com
              reported on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The pop icon's family has spoken of "unanswered questions"
              concerning Murray's role in the final hours of Jackson's life. Murray's
              lawyers insist he has been cleared of wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>TMZ, citing
              "multiple" law enforcement sources, said "the evidence points to the
              anesthesia Propofol as the primary cause of Jackson's death."</p>
              <p>Law
              enforcement sources told TMZ there was already "plenty of powerful
              evidence" pointing to Murray, 51, as the person who administered the
              drug, whose brand name is Diprivan, to the "King of Pop."</p>
              <p>The evidence, TMZ said, includes items found in Jackson's rented mansion, including Propofol, an IV stand and an oxygen tank.</p>
              <p>The
              drug is used to induce unconsciousness in hospital patients ahead of
              major surgery and experts say it should only be administered by a
              trained anesthesiologist.</p>
              <p>The LAPD has already had "multiple
              conversations with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office,
              even though the case has not yet been formally presented to the
              district attorney, the celebrity website said.</p>
              <p>The report came
              after the Los Angeles County Coroner's office subpoenaed the
              superstar's dermatologist Arnold Klein on Tuesday, seeking "additional
              medical records" from the physician's Beverly Hills office.</p>
              <p>Investigators
              have been scrutinizing the possible role of drugs in the death of
              Jackson, who died on June 25 aged 50 after suffering an apparent
              cardiac arrest at his home in Los Angeles.</p>

              <p><strong>New video shows Jackson's head catching fire</strong></p>
              <p class="first">NEW YORK (AFP) - - A US entertainment magazine has
              released never-before-seen footage of Michael Jackson's hair catching
              fire while filming a commercial in 1984, an accident it said led to an
              addiction to painkillers.</p>
              <p>Jackson was filming the advert for Pepsi when fireworks were
              exploded too early, causing the superstar to suffer severe burns as his
              hair and scalp were engulfed in flames, according to the video Us
              Weekly magazine released on its website Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The "King of
              Pop," who died on June 25 from cardiac arrest at the age of 50, at
              first keeps dancing apparently unaware that his head is on fire. Still
              images of the accident have already been released but the video had
              never been shown publicly before.</p>
              <p>"He was never the same after the accident," Us Weekly said.</p>
              <p>"To
              relieve the second and third-degree burns on his scalp and body (and
              later to help him tolerate multiple surgeries on the scorched spot on
              his head), Jackson was prescribed several medications -- which kicked
              off his addiction to painkillers and obsession with plastic surgery,"
              the magazine quoted sources as saying.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles police said
              Wednesday they were investigating Jackson's death, but would not
              confirm it was being treated as a homicide investigation, as reported
              by entertainment website TMZ.com.</p>
              <p>TMZ, citing "multiple" law
              enforcement sources, said "the evidence points to the anesthesia
              Propofol (Diprivan) as the primary cause of Jackson's death."</p>

              <p><strong>Hollywood eyes Michael Jackson movie: report</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - A Hollywood movie made using
              footage of Michael Jackson rehearsing for his planned series of
              comeback concerts could hit theaters by the end of this year, US media
              reports have said.</p>
              <p>Daily Variety reported that Sony Pictures studio was close to
              agreeing a 50-million-dollar deal for worldwide rights to nearly 80
              hours of footage showing pop icon Jackson rehearsing before his death.</p>
              <p>The
              report said AEG Entertainment, the company which owns the material and
              had been behind Jackson's proposed series of concerts in London, had
              screened the footage to Hollywood studio executives last week.</p>
              <p>Variety
              reported that Kenny Ortega, the choreographer for Jackson's new "This
              Is It" concerts and the director of hit film "High School Musical," was
              expected to direct the movie.</p>
              <p>So far only a brief snippet of Jackson's concert rehearsals have been revealed to the public.</p>
              <p>Footage
              released on July 2 showed Jackson practicing a song-and-dance routine
              at Los Angeles's Staples Center two days before his death, supporting
              accounts he had been in good health.</p>
              <p>Associates of Jackson have
              described the 50-year-old pop star as being in good form, including at
              another rehearsal the day before his death.</p>
              <p>Jackson collapsed and
              died on June 25 at his rented Los Angeles mansion. A final cause of
              death has not been revealed as coroner's await the results of
              toxicology tests.</p>

              <p><strong>Doctor gave Jackson drug that killed him: CNN</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Michael Jackson's doctor
              administered the powerful drug police believed killed the music
              superstar, CNN quoting a source with knowledge of the investigation
              reported.</p>
              <p>Doctor Conrad Murray has become the focus of the probe into
              Jackson's death amid reports that bottles of the potent anesthetic
              propofol were found at the star's mansion after his tragic June 25
              demise.</p>
              <p>A report on CNN's website did not give further information and a
              spokeswoman for Murray's legal team refused to comment. A spokesman for
              the Los Angeles Police Department also declined to comment.</p>
              <p>Jackson's
              cause of death has been deferred pending the outcome of toxicology
              tests following a June 25 post mortem. Those test results could be
              released later this week.</p>
              <p>The report comes just days after
              federal agents and detectives swooped without warning on Murray's
              Houston office, revealing for the first time in a search warrant that
              Jackson's death was being treated as possible manslaughter.</p>
              <p>Propofol
              is used in hospitals to induce unconsciousness in patients ahead of
              major surgery. Experts say it should only be administered by a trained
              anesthesiologist and there could be no reason for it to be in Jackson's
              home.</p>
              <p>Lawyers for Murray said in a statement last week the doctor
              was keen to assist authorities in their investigation and was preparing
              for a third meeting with police after two earlier interviews.</p>
              <p>"The coroner wants to clear up the cause of death, we share that goal," attorney Ed Chernoff said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Murray
              is currently in Las Vegas, his legal team said, and Chernoff insisted
              that "based on Dr Murray's minute-by-minute and item-by-item
              description of Michael Jackson's last days, he should not be a target
              of criminal charges.</p>
              <p>"Dr Murray was the last doctor standing when
              Michael Jackson died and it seems all the fury is directed toward him,"
              Chernoff said.</p>
              <p>"Dr Murray is frustrated by negative and often
              erroneous media reports, he has to walk around 24-7 with a bodyguard.
              He can't operate his practice."</p>
              <p>In the immediate aftermath of
              Jackson's death, friends of the singer's family said the clan had
              "unanswered questions" regarding Murray.</p>
              <p>"They (the family) are
              suspicious of this doctor and they have real reason to be because any
              other doctor would say 'Here's what happened in the last hour of his
              life and I was there. I gave him some medicine,'" family friend and
              civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said.</p>
              <p>"(Murray) owes it to
              the family and to the public to say, 'These were the last hours of
              Michael's life and here's what happened.' That's a reasonable
              expectation."</p>

              <p>Inside, on the top floor, the scene was less elegant, according to a law enforcement official.</p>
              <p>Clothes
              and other items were strewn about and handwritten notes stuck on the
              walls. One read: "children are sweet and innocent." And no one working
              in the house was allowed upstairs to clean up the mess.</p>
              <p>The
              description of Jackson's private sanctum provides a glimpse into how
              the pop star was living in the weeks before he died. The official, who
              spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing,
              also told The Associated Press on Monday that Jackson's personal doctor
              administered a powerful anesthetic to help him sleep, and authorities
              believe the drug killed the pop singer.</p>
              <p>Authorities arrived at
              the singer's house after his death to find a chaotic scene. The
              temperature upstairs was stiflingly hot, with gas fireplaces and the
              heating system on high because Jackson always complained of feeling
              cold, the official said.</p>
              <p>The singer's bedroom was a mess, with items seemingly thrown about and some 20 handwritten notes stuck on the walls.</p>
              <p>A porcelain girl doll wearing a dress was found on top of the covers of the bed where he slept, the official said.</p>
              <p>The
              official said Jackson regularly received propofol to sleep, relying on
              the drug like an alarm clock. A doctor would administer it when he went
              to sleep, then stop the intravenous drip when he wanted to wake up. On
              June 25, the day Jackson died, Dr. Conrad Murray gave him the drug
              through an IV sometime after midnight, the official said.</p>
              <p>Murray's
              lawyer, Edward Chernoff, has said the doctor "didn't prescribe or
              administer anything that should have killed Michael Jackson." When
              asked Monday about the law enforcement official's statements he said:
              "We will not be commenting on rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources."</p>
              <p>In
              a more detailed statement posted online late Monday, Chernoff added
              that "things tend to shake out when all the facts are made known, and
              I'm sure that will happen here as well."</p>
              <p>Toxicology reports are
              still pending, but investigators are working under the theory that
              propofol caused Jackson's heart to stop, the official said. Jackson is
              believed to have been using the drug for about two years and
              investigators are trying to determine how many other doctors
              administered it, the official said.</p>
              <p>Murray, 51, has been
              identified in court papers as the subject of a manslaughter
              investigation, and authorities last week raided his office and a
              storage unit in Houston. Police say Murray is cooperating and have not
              labeled him a suspect.</p>
              <p>Using propofol to sleep exceeds the drug's
              intended purpose. The drug can depress breathing and lower heart rates
              and blood pressure. Because of the risks, propofol is supposed to be
              administered only in medical settings by trained personnel.</p>

              <p>Police have raided the Las Vegas home and office of Michael Jackson's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray.</p>
              <p>They seized cell phones and a computer hard drive, according to Dr Murray's lawyer.</p>
              <p>He said that authorities were looking for "medical records relating to Michael Jackson and all of his reported aliases."</p>
              <p>It's the second raid on the physician's offices in less than a week.</p>
              <p>The probe into Jackson's sudden death has focused increasingly on Dr Murray.</p>
              <p>Dr Murray was at the pop star's side when he died late last month.</p>
              <p>Investigators appear to have homed in on Jackson's use of
              prescription drugs, and Dr Murray's possible involvement in providing
              the anesthetic - propofol.</p>
              <p>Media reports have suggested that the late singer used numerous
              aliases over the years to get hold of a range of powerful prescription
              drugs.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson chef recalls doctor's role, final days</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES - On the day Michael Jackson died, his
              personal chef says her first hint of something amiss was when his
              doctor didn't come downstairs to get the juices and granola he
              routinely brought the King of Pop for breakfast each morning.</p>
              <p>Kai Chase, a professionally trained chef hired by Jackson to
              maintain a healthy food regimen, recalled the singer's final days in an
              interview with The Associated Press. She also spoke about the role of
              his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, who is now the focus of a
              manslaughter investigation.</p>
              <p>Chase said Tuesday that she had
              gotten used to seeing Murray coming and going from the mansion. The
              doctor usually arrived about 9 or 9:30 p.m. and would go upstairs to
              Jackson's room, and she said she would not see him again before she
              left _ sometimes late in the evening _ but understood he was staying
              the night.</p>
              <p>In the morning, when she arrived for work, Chase said
              she would see the doctor coming down the steps carrying oxygen tanks.
              When Murray didn't come downstairs the morning of June 25, "I thought
              maybe Mr. Jackson is sleeping late," Chase said.</p>
              <p>"I started
              preparing the lunch and then I looked at my cell phone and it was noon.
              About 12:05 or 12:10 Dr. Murray runs down the steps and screams, 'Go
              get Prince!' He's screaming very loud. I run into the den where the
              kids are playing. Prince (Jackson's oldest son) runs to meet Dr. Murray
              and from that point on you could feel the energy in the house change.</p>
              <p>"I walked into the hall and I saw the children there. The daughter was crying. I saw paramedics running up the stairs."</p>
              <p>At
              that point, Chase said, the small group that was gathered _ the
              children, their nanny, a housekeeper and Chase _ held hands and began
              to pray. As paramedics raced up to the room, Chase recalls, "We were
              all praying, 'Help Mr. Jackson be O.K.'</p>
              <p>"Then everyone was very quiet."</p>
              <p>At
              about 1:30 p.m. she said security guards told her and other staff to
              leave the property because "Mr. Jackson was being taken to the
              hospital."</p>
              <p>When she came outside, she said, ambulances were in the courtyard and a crowd had gathered.</p>
              <p>Chase,
              37, who has cooked for other celebrities and comes from a show-business
              family, was hired by Jackson in March, let go in May, then returned on
              June 2. She said the pop star's focus was on fresh, healthy food for
              him and the children.</p>
              <p>She said she prepared meals for the family
              and occasionally for Murray. She said Jackson was in training for his
              upcoming shows in London and told her: "You have to take care of me."</p>
              <p>On
              most days, she said, Murray would bring Jackson the special fruit juice
              drinks Chase prepared for him, followed by granola with almond milk.
              For lunch, Jackson would eat with the children from a menu that
              included such things as spinach salad and chicken.</p>
              <p>Murray
              sometimes joined them for dinner, which might be a seared ahi tuna. She
              said the doctor conferred with her about the 50-year-old pop singer's
              food and made sure that he ate.</p>
              <p>The only oddity was the oxygen
              tanks. Chase said she never asked about the purpose of the oxygen and
              she saw no sign that Jackson was on drugs or was in failing health.</p>
              <p>"Normally in the morning, he would bring oxygen tanks from upstairs downstairs, one in each hand," she said.</p>
              <p>Authorities
              searched Murray's Las Vegas home and medical office Tuesday as part of
              an investigation that included raids last week of his clinic and
              storage in Houston.</p>
              <p>With toxicology reports pending,
              investigators are working under the theory that the powerful anesthetic
              propofol caused Jackson's heart to stop, a law enforcement official
              told The Associated Press. Murray told investigators he regularly
              administered the drug to help Jackson sleep, and had done so sometime
              in the early morning of June 25, according to the official, who spoke
              on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.</p>
              <p>Propofol
              is supposed to be administered only in monitored medical settings by
              trained personnel; the official told AP that Murray left the bedroom
              and returned to find the star unresponsive. Police have said Murray is
              cooperating and have not labeled him a suspect, and his lawyer, Edward
              Chernoff, has said the doctor "didn't prescribe or administer anything
              that should have killed Michael Jackson."</p>
              <p>Like Murray, Chase said
              she was hired to accompany Jackson to London for his comeback concerts
              and the request was personally made to her by his 12-year-old son,
              Prince Michael II.</p>
              <p>"Prince said, 'Daddy wants me to tell you he
              wants you to go to London with us,'" she recalled. "I said, 'Tell your
              daddy that I'm pleased and honored."</p>
              <p>She said she had already
              filled out paperwork and submitted a copy of her passport to the
              Jackson staff and expected to leave for London on July 3.</p>
              <p>On June 23, she said Jackson told her: "I'm packed and I'm ready to go." Two days later, he was dead.</p>
              <p>It
              was the end of her dream job and an idyllic time in Chase's life, a
              time that had begun in March with a call from Jackson's assistant,
              Michael Williams. She was told that "a client" wanted her services as
              personal chef but she was not told the client was Jackson until she was
              hired.</p>
              <p>"I couldn't believe it," she said. "I asked him if I was on 'Candid Camera.' I said, 'Am I being punked?'"</p>
              <p>She
              said Jackson had seen her resume which included jobs cooking for Macy
              Gray and Jamie Fox as well as catering a fund raiser for President
              Barack Obama. She said he also knew she was from a multiracial
              background and her godfather was Redd Foxx.</p>
              <p>But before she started she had to pass muster with three other people: the Jackson children.</p>
              <p>"I
              came to the house and the first people I met were the kids. They
              started interviewing me," she said. "They told me: 'We're into healthy
              eating.'"</p>
              <p>When they approved her, she went to work and "we developed a really great bond."</p>
              <p>Most
              days, she said, Jackson made a point of having both lunch and dinner
              with the children, Prince, 11-year-old Paris and 7-year-old Prince
              Michael II, known as Blanket, and each meal was preceded by Paris
              saying grace. After weeks of healthy food, she said she wrote Jackson a
              note with a suggestion:</p>
              <p>"I said, 'What about doing comfort-food
              Saturdays? We could do barbecued chicken and corn on the cob, maybe
              Mexican food or soul food.'" She said he loved the idea, but as the
              concerts approached, healthy eating returned full time.</p>
              <p>"He said, 'I'm a dancer,' and he wanted food that would not make him cramp up while he was dancing."</p>
              <p>She now treasures little notes she received from the children and from Jackson and a present he gave her.</p>
              <p>"One
              day he handed me a little gift bag and said, 'This is for you from me
              and the children.' He had given me an iPod Touch because the children
              told him I still had a Walkman. It had the 25th anniversary 'Thriller'
              album loaded on it."</p>
              <p>She said she has visited with the children
              since Jackson's death and they are doing well. "They have so many
              cousins to play with."</p>
              <p>As for Chase's future, she said Jackson
              encouraged her to write a cookbook and she has written one tentatively
              titled, "Fit for a King." It includes recipes she cooked for Jackson
              and the story of the time she worked for him.</p>
              <p>"He was an inspiration to me," she said.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson mother gets custody, Rowe gets visits: report</strong></p>
              <div class="bd">
              <div class="content">
              <p>NEW YORK - Michael
              Jackson's mother will get custody of the late pop star's three children
              after reaching a agreement with her son's ex-wife Debbie Rowe, a lawyer
              for Katherine Jackson told CBS News on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Rowe will
              have "meaningful visitation rights" with her two biological children
              with Jackson -- Prince Michael, 12, and Paris, 11 -- U.S. television
              networks CBS, ABC and NBC reported.</p>
              <p>The biological mother of Jackson's third child, Prince Michael II, 7, also known as Blanket, has never been revealed.</p>
              <p>Jackson's mother, Katherine, 79, was granted temporary custody of the children after his death on June 25.</p>
              <p>"It's
              an agreement, an agreement for the best interests of the children. This
              is not a money deal. This is not about money," Londell McMillan,
              Katherine Jackson's attorney, said in a an interview on CBS News' "The
              Early Show."</p>
              <p>"All of the parties are resolved. There is no
              situation better for these children than for them to be raised and
              reared in the loving care of Mrs. Katherine Jackson," he said.</p>
              <p>A
              court hearing in Los Angeles on custody of the children is scheduled
              for Monday. Jackson said in his 2002 will he wanted his mother to care
              for the children if he died.</p>
              <p>The "Thriller" singer left his
              estate, valued at $500 million in an attachment to his will, to a
              family trust that benefits his children, his mother and charities.</p>
              <p>"That
              estate is worth, in my estimation, a couple of billion dollars,"
              McMillan said, referring to the value of the estate if it achieves its
              potential earnings. "You hear $500 million. Don't buy it."</p>
              <p>The
              coroner's report on the cause of the singer's death is still awaiting
              toxicology and other test results. His burial arrangements have not
              been announced.</p>

              <p><strong>New Michael Jackson songs on missing hard drives</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES - Another thriller is developing in the complex afterlife of Michael Jackson.</p>
              <p>His sister LaToya has taken possession of computer hard drives that
              contain a trove of unreleased songs he recorded with A-list singers
              such as Ne-Yo, Akon, and will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas, according to
              Rolling Stone magazine.</p>
              <p>The drives were in the "Thriller"
              singer's rented Holmby Hills, Calif., mansion when he died suddenly in
              June. Hours afterward, the family descended on the house to claim all
              its contents, and LaToya grabbed the drives, Rolling Stone said,
              quoting the late singer's manager, Frank DiLeo.</p>
              <p>"They backed up
              trucks, removing everything," DiLeo was quoted as telling the magazine
              in its issue that hits newsstands on Friday. "They thought Michael
              owned it all, so they took even the rented furniture. That's who's
              going to run his estate?"</p>
              <p>Jackson's will gave 40 percent of his
              estate to his 79-year-old mother, Katherine, who wants more control and
              has raised doubts about the pair of high-powered executors currently
              overseeing his business affairs.</p>
              <p>In a follow-up interview with
              Reuters, DiLeo said he was "pretty sure" the hard drives were at the
              family's Hayvenhurst compound in Encino, Calif.</p>
              <p>"The estate lawyers will send out letters" to recover the drives so that the contents can be logged, DiLeo added.</p>
              <p>An email sent to a representative for LaToya Jackson was not answered, and a family spokesman was not immediately available.</p>
              <p>A
              spokeswoman for will.i.am said the singer did not have duplicates of
              his work with Jackson. Representatives for Akon and Ne-Yo either could
              not be reached or had no information.</p>
              <p>DiLeo told Rolling Stone
              that there were at least 100 songs -- including many recorded at
              Jackson's 1980s peak -- that were never released, including a few
              "sensational" tracks that were left off "Bad," the 1987 follow-up to
              his blockbuster "Thriller."</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson allies deny Oliver! star paternity link</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Sources "very close" to Michael
              Jackson's family denied claims by former British child acting star Mark
              Lester that he could be the biological father of the singer's daughter
              Paris, People magazine reported.</p>
              <p>Lester, who played Oliver Twist in the 1968 film musical "Oliver!"
              told the News of the World: "I gave Michael my sperm so that he could
              have kids -- and I believe Paris is my daughter."</p>
              <p>The 51-year-old
              Briton, who was a friend of Jackson and is godfather to all three of
              his children, said he was willing to take a paternity test to establish
              whether or not he is the father of 11-year-old Paris.</p>
              <p>But People,
              citing sources close to the King of Pop's family, said Lester has never
              claimed to be Paris's father, although they acknowledged he had donated
              sperm to Jackson, who died on June 25 aged 50.</p>
              <p>"They twisted his
              words around. He's not claiming to be the father of Paris Jackson," one
              source told the magazine, which specializes in news about entertainment
              stars.</p>
              <p>The family's lawyer Londell McMillan downplayed the
              reports, saying "these are just merely claims with no legal standing
              whatsoever."</p>
              <p>The probate court, he added, has no reason to go
              against its finding that Jackson was the father to Paris, Prince
              Michael, 12, and Prince Michael II, 7.</p>
              <p>The birth mother of the
              two eldest children is former nurse Debbie Rowe, and the youngest, who
              is known as "Blanket," was conceived by a surrogate whose identity has
              not yet been revealed.</p>
              <p>Lester "has known Michael (Jackson) for
              many years and his children play with Michael's children," Brian Oxman,
              a long-time family friend and former lawyer told the magazine, saying
              Lester had never hinted he was Paris' father.</p>
              <p>Marc Schaffel,
              another Jackson associate, said the pop star made Lester godfather to
              all three of his children at a small, private ceremony in October 2003
              when they were baptised.</p>
              <p>Lester says Jackson first told him he
              was desperate to be a father in 1996. Both were then aged 37 and Lester
              already had three children.</p>
              <p>Lester suggested the donation and
              Jackson agreed, with the arrangements being made through a Harley
              Street clinic in February of that year.</p>
              <p>Eight months later,
              Jackson announced he had married nurse Debbie Rowe and three months
              later, the couple revealed the birth of Prince.</p>
              <p>Paris was born just over a year later, in April 1998.</p>
