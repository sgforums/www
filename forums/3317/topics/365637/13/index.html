              <p><strong>Coroner completes Michael Jackson autopsy</strong></p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES - Coroners have completed the autopsy report on the body
              of pop star Michael Jackson, but details remained under wraps on Monday
              as police probe the cause of the singer's death and his prescription
              drug use.</p>
              <p>A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said detectives requested
              the autopsy, which includes toxicology tests, remain sealed until their
              investigation was finished. He could not say when it would be completed
              and declined to offer more details.</p>
              <p>Some media outlets reported that the "Thriller" singer's body has
              now been buried at the Forest Lawn cemetery in Los Angeles, but that
              could not immediately be confirmed through a family spokesman. A
              cemetery spokesman declined to comment.</p>
              <p>Police are looking into why the 50-year-old singer died suddenly of
              cardiac arrest on June 25. Numerous media reports have said officials
              are focused on Jackson's use of a powerful anesthetic called propofol
              to sleep. Police and federal agents have raided several offices of
              Jackson's doctors as part of their probe.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the judge overseeing the singer's will said he had
              approved several business deals, including a $60 million agreement with
              Columbia Pictures to make a movie from video of the King of Pop's
              rehearsals for a series of concerts that had been set to take place in
              London this past July.</p>
              <p>Those shows were dubbed "This Is It" by Jackson, and the movie will
              be similarly titled. Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp's Sony
              Pictures Entertainment, said the film, due to be in theaters on October
              30, will have performances and behind-the-scenes video of Jackson
              preparing for the concerts. Some of it will be shown in movie theaters
              in 3-D.</p>
              <p>The judge also agreed to the re-issuance of the singer's autobiography, "Moonwalk," currently planned for October.</p>
              <p>Lawyers
              spent much of Monday in court wrangling over merchandising deals still
              being planned and a traveling exhibition of Jackson memorabilia that
              concert promoter AEG Live, which had backed the London concerts, wants
              to mount.</p>
              <p>RESURGENT POPULARITY</p>
              <p>Attorneys for Jackson's
              mother, Katherine, said they had concerns about the involvement of AEG
              in deals struck with the executors of the pop star's estate.</p>
              <p>Judge
              Mitchell Beckloff said he could not approve the deals for the traveling
              exhibition and merchandising rights until he appoints an attorney to
              represent the interests of Jackson's three minor children, who along
              with Katherine Jackson are beneficiaries of the estate.</p>
              <p>As a result, he put off his decision on whether to approve the two deals until August 17.</p>
              <p>An
              attorney for AEG Live, which spent as much as $30 million preparing for
              the comeback concerts, had argued that to help recoup its investment it
              needed to move quickly to take advantage of the resurgence in the
              singer's popularity.</p>
              <p>Several of the "Thriller" singer's albums,
              for instance, have returned to the top of the music charts in recent
              weeks, whereas before his death his CD sales had languished.</p>
              <p>"The
              longer we wait, the more time passes, frankly the less interest there
              will be on the part of the public to come see the exhibit," said Kathy
              Jorrie, an attorney for AEG Live.</p>
              <p>Jackson's "Number Ones" CD,
              originally released in 1993, is the second-best selling album of 2009
              in the United States, with sales this year of 1.4 million copies,
              according to tracking firm Nielsen SoundScan. Only Taylor Swift's 2008
              release "Fearless," with 1.5 million copies sold so far this year,
              stands in the way.</p>
              <p>Jackson was said to be as much as $500 million
              in debt when he died, but the value of his estate was reported to be as
              high as $1 billion given his part ownership in a music catalog and his
              control of his own songs.</p>
              <p>Jorrie told the judge that attorneys
              for his mother have demanded AEG Live give the estate its rehearsal
              video, something that AEG is not willing to do. AEG is owned by
              reclusive Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz.</p>

He gave up most of his assets for charity and all his life, he fought for equality of the African Americans, AIDS victims, Against Drug Abuse, Against Abortion, Against Child Labor and secretly channelled his properties for the hungry children of the world.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">However, he wasn't peace at heart. He always think of himself as a child trapped inside a man's body.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">Being Peter Pan is all his dream, never to grow up, forever a child.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">That inspires him to build Neverland - a heaven for children.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">Children of all ages and races are welcomed to Neverland. MJ had so much love to give.<br><br>However, he made a mistake which he didn't know of the consequences. He saw the peaceful life his brother, Jermaine Jackson (Muhammad Abdul Aziz), had as a Muslim - true, Jermaine faced so much pressure that he moved to Bahrain.<br><br>In 1989, MJ made a press conference which shocked the world, "I have seen the Islam in the life of my brother, I have read the books about Islam. And I'd love to someday feel the calmness and peace of Islam...."<br><br>Since that, MJ's life was never the same again.<br>He was accused of so many accusations against child molestation. MJ was not someone who can deal with much pressure as he is a 'delicate child'. All the extortion and black mail followed after that. Everything he did was being seen as wrong in the eyes of the Media. All these are to influence his fans to hate MJ. If he is hated, then he would not be influencial anymore.<br><br>For several years, he stayed in England. Getting motivation from a long time friend, Cat Stevens, who had converted into Islam - named Yusuf Islam. From him, MJ learnt how Yusuf had survived being Muslim. He made friends with a song writer, Zain Bhikha too, who wrote a song titled, "GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH", which he wanted MJ to sing whenever he is ready.<br><br>Following his trial, MJ withdrew to Bahrain, where he was the special guest of Sheik Abdullah bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the son of Bahrain’s King. It was then that Michael began to give conversion more “serious thought.”<br>MJ stayed in Bahrain for approximately 3 years. He studied Islam, the prayers and learn to read the Koran (al-Quran).</span></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">Finally, he came back to Los Angeles and in November 2008 MJ had formally converted to Islam in a ceremony at a close friend’s house in Los Angeles.<br>He perform Haj with the King of Bahrain and son on December 2008.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br>He had a hidden agenda when he wanted to make a final comeback. He annouced in a Press Conference on March 2009, "This will be my final concert. I'll see you all in July...."<br><br>He planned that during his concert, he would announce that this is the FINAL concert as he wouldn't be performing anymore. He will declare that he is a Muslim and will only sing with Yusuf Islam and Friends.<br>At the end of the concert, he will be singing the song, "GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH" with Yusuf Islam. That is the reason why he chose London as his final concert venue instead of the USA. It was because he thought he could escape the USA's extortion, and that he could perform with Yusuf Islam who is in England.<br><br>At 12.30am, 25th June 2009, he hugged his production manager and said, "After rehearsing for 2 months, I am finally ready for the Concert..."<br>Before leaving to sleep, he waved at his dancers, "It was a good night everyone. I'll see you all tomorrow..."<br>The next thing... He was pronouced dead at 2.26am....<br><br>When 911 was called, there are so much questions asked.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">It is as if they didn't know who MJ is and where he lived.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">The questions asked are more towards to delay time.<br>The hospital said the Autopsy result can only be obtained after 2 months - very illogical as even the worst African technology could obtain results in less than 2 weeks.<br><br>MJ's family members opt for second private autopsy as they started to feel something fishy is going on.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">The result came out in about 4 days - MJ was drugged with high dosage of anaesthetic - drug that brings about a reversible loss of consciousness, if used to much could stop the heart from beating.<br><br>Another result which was not aired in the media was, MJ's stomach was empty of this drug, but his blood were filled with it - same case as the death of Marilyn Monroe.<br>The private doctors also found many needle marks, afraid to be forced injections given to MJ on his bed.<br><br>In CNN Live after a week, Barack Obama was interviewed. And he said, "I love MJ, I grew up listening to his songs. It is a great loss, but rest assured that there is no conspiracy in his death..."<br>Now, why must a President made such statement before the official autopsy result came out? How would he know that there is no conspiracy without the post-mortem result? Seems like someone is afraid of his shadows.<br><br>MJ was known to the world as a person who is against drug abuse. Why must he be addicted to drugs then? If he wanted to commit suicide, why rehearse for his concert? And why will he want to see his dancers the next day?<br><br>Enough about his death. I am sure people around the world is not stupid anymore. These supreme power can fool us during the Marilyn Monroe conspiracy, Martin Luther King and Princess Diana.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">But in this MJ's case, they left too many loopholes for those who think...!!</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br>MJ left us with this unfinished studio-recorded song, GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">You can download this song here:</span></span> <a><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"></span></a><a></a><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;">/file/ahb80ff/n/Micheal_Jackson_-_Give_Thanks_To_Allah_mp3</span></span><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Sylfaen; font-size: 13.5pt;"> <br><br>MJ's family was about to give him a Muslim burial with the help of The Brotherhood of Islam. But, the CIA showed up at Neverland's door - blackmailed them that if they do so publicly, Katherine (MJ's mother) would be pulled off from MJ's 3 children's custody as well as MJ's Estates. Instead, they'll hire Debbie Rowe for the purpose, and the court will be in their favour. So much for democracy and fairness...<br><br>Finally, they agreed to let MJ have a Muslim Burial in Neverland. But on condition, must show to the public a Christian Memorial Service, as to prove to the world that MJ was never a Muslim.<br><br>So, Staples Centre was just a normal show. That's why the coffin was closed and sealed.<br><br>MJ was buried days earlier. The Gold Coffin was empty. They were about to bury the Coffin according to Christianity formalities in Hollywood - as in their deal with the USA Government.<br><br>These happened, because the USA is afraid of the rising numbers of Muslims in the world.<br><br>(Sheikh Ha**d)<br>The Brotherhood of Islam<br>Buletin of Bahrain</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Judge okays Jackson deal, burial planned</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES - A judge on Monday approved a deal for
              the sale of Michael Jackson merchandise, but delayed making a decision
              on a traveling exhibition dedicated to the King of Pop, amid objections
              from the singer's mother.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff, who is
              overseeing matters related to Jackson's estate, approved the deal
              between the co-executors of Jackson's will and Bravado International
              Group, a division of Universal Music Group owned by Vivendi SA.</p>
              <p>But Beckloff postponed until Friday a decision on whether to approve
              concert promoter AEG Live's plans for a traveling exhibition of Jackson
              memorabilia. He did so amid objections from attorneys for Jackson's
              mother, Katherine, who said the planned exhibition may not bring enough
              money to the estate.</p>
              <p>On August 7, Beckloff approved a deal between Jackson's estate, AEG
              Live and Columbia Pictures, a division of Sony Corp, for a movie to be
              released October 30 using footage from the pop star's final rehearsals.</p>
              <p>The executors of Jackson's will, longtime attorney John Branca and
              music executive John McClain, have said the deals will generate
              millions of dollars for the estate.</p>
              <p>Separately, Michael Jackson's father said his son's body will be
              buried at a Los Angeles cemetery on August 29, which would have been
              his 51st birthday, the New York Daily News reported on Monday.</p>
              <p>Joe Jackson told a Daily News reporter the plan was finalized in recent days.</p>
              <p>Media reports last week said Jackson, who died June 25 of cardiac
              arrest, was buried in a private ceremony in early August. But those
              reports were based on unnamed sources and never confirmed by Jackson
              family representatives.</p>
              <p>A Jackson family spokesman did not return calls seeking comment
              Monday, nor did a spokesman at Los Angeles' Forest Lawn cemetery, where
              Joe Jackson said his son would be buried.</p>
              <p>A public memorial for the singer was held in July, but there was
              never an official confirmation the "Thriller" singer was buried after
              the event.</p>
              <p>The reason behind Jackson's cardiac arrest remains a mystery. The
              Los Angeles County Coroner's office has completed its autopsy report
              but its findings remain sealed until police conclude their
              investigation.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles police are looking into the role prescription drugs may
              have played in Jackson's death and the actions of doctors who were
              treating him in the weeks before he died.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Jackson's doctor posts video</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES - The doctor who was with Michael Jackson
              when he died and is now the center of a manslaughter probe posted a
              short video Tuesday thanking his supporters.</p>
              <p>In the one-minute video, posted on YouTube, a weary-looking Dr.
              Conrad Murray thanks friends and patients and refers to his two
              interviews with Los Angeles police detectives. It was the first time
              Murray had spoken publicly since Jackson died June 25.</p>
              <p>"I have
              done all I could do," a solemn-sounding Murray says as he looks into
              the camera. "I told the truth and I have faith the truth will prevail."</p>
              <p>The video was recorded last week at a private residence in Houston, said Miranda Sevcik, the spokeswoman for Murray's lawyer.</p>
              <p>After
              Jackson died, Murray received death threats, hired a body guard and was
              forced into seclusion at his Las Vegas home, Sevcik said. He also has
              received many calls from patients, former patients and strangers
              offering him support.</p>
              <p>"Because of all that is going on, I am
              afraid to return phone calls or use my e-mail," Murray says. "I
              recorded this video to let all of you know that I have been receiving
              your messages ... Your messages give me strength and courage and keep
              me going. They mean the world to me."</p>
              <p>Since Jackson's death, Murray has not worked and has closed his Las Vegas practice.</p>
              <p>The
              doctor was in dire financial shape when he signed on with Jackson
              earlier this year at $150,000 a month, owing at least $780,000 in
              judgments and outstanding payments.</p>
              <p>Sevcik said the only reason
              Murray made the video was to address supporters, but she added Murray
              told her he misses being able to work.</p>
              <p>"He says he wants to get
              back to work, he really does genuinely care about the people he works
              with," Sevcik said. "He has to just wait, he's in limbo."</p>
              <p>Gregory
              D. Lee, a retired supervisory agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency,
              said he thought Murray wanted to improve his image.</p>
              <p>"This doctor
              has been demonized," Lee said. "This is an attempt to humanize him and
              possibly sway any potential jury pool out there."</p>
              <p>Murray told
              investigators he administered Jackson a powerful anesthetic along with
              multiple sedatives in the hours before the singer died, a law
              enforcement official told The Associated Press. Investigators think
              Murray left the room where Jackson was sleeping for a few minutes to
              make phone calls and returned to find the pop icon not breathing.</p>
              <p>The official requested anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.</p>
              <p>The
              Los Angeles coroner's office has said it has completed its work
              determining Jackson's cause of death but won't be releasing results
              until the police investigation is complete.</p>

              <p><strong>Coroner says Jackson died from lethal dose of propofol</strong></p>
              <p>HOUSTON - Pop star Michael Jackson died from a lethal dose of the
              powerful anesthetic propofol given in a cocktail of drugs, leading
              authorities to suspect his doctor of manslaughter, court documents
              showed on Monday.</p>
              <p>The "Thriller" singer suffered cardiac arrest and died on June 25 at
              age 50. Since then, an investigation by state and federal agencies have
              focused on Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal doctor who was at his
              bedside the day he died.</p>
              <p>The findings, contained in a warrant to
              search Murray's home and offices, paint a picture of an insomniac pop
              star who could not sleep without heavy medication. Jackson sought out
              propofol -- routinely used to sedate patients and anesthetize them
              before surgeries such as a colonoscopy -- and called it his "milk."</p>
              <p>"The Los Angeles Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner, Dr. ," according to a warrant to search Murray's offices issued by California.</p>
              <p>The
              document was unsealed and released by the Harris County District Clerk
              in Houston, where Murray has an office. U.S. agents raided the office
              on July 22.</p>
              <p>In an affidavit seeking the warrant, Houston police
              officer E.G. Chance said U.S. agents had gathered "items constituting
              evidence of the offense of manslaughter that tend to show that Dr.
              Conrad Murray committed the said criminal offense."</p>
              <p>Murray's attorney, Ed Chernoff, was not available to comment.</p>
              <p>In
              a statement, a representative said Jackson's family has "full
              confidence in the legal process, and commends the ongoing efforts of
              the L.A. County Coroner, the L.A. District Attorney and the L.A. Police
              Department."</p>
              <p>Murray, who was with Jackson on June 25
              administering drugs to ease the pop star to sleep, gave him a range of
              medication including a 25-milligram dose of propofol via an intravenous
              drip at 10:40 a.m. PDT, the state search warrant said.</p>
              <p>Jackson
              was "very familiar" with propofol and referred to it as his "milk"
              because of its milky appearance, the warrant said. Murray, who had been
              treating Jackson for about six weeks leading up to his death, was
              worried that Jackson was addicted to propofol. Murray was trying to
              wean him off the drug by giving him smaller doses, it said.</p>
              <p>Jason
              Hymes, an assistant clinical professor at the University of Southern
              California who is not associated with the case, said the drug was a
              true anesthetic. "You administer it to somebody and then operate on
              them ... This concept of giving somebody a general anesthetic for sleep
              disturbance strikes me as just bizarre and astoundingly inappropriate."</p>
              <p>In
              the early hours of June 25, Murray also gave Jackson doses of
              anti-anxiety medications Valium and Ativan and sedative Versed, the
              filing said.</p>
              <p>Jackson went to sleep after Murray gave him the
              propofol, and Murray stayed by his side for about 10 minutes, then left
              "to go to the restroom and relieve himself," the search warrant said.</p>
              <p>Murray was out of Jackson's room for about 2 minutes and when he returned, Jackson was no longer breathing, the warrant said.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Jackson's death homicide: coroner</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Michael Jackson's death was
              declared a homicide by Los Angeles coroners on Friday as they revealed
              the singer had a lethal cocktail of six different drugs in his body
              when he died.</p>
              <p>Ending several weeks of feverish speculation following Jackson's
              sudden death in Los Angeles on June 25, the county coroner's office
              issued a brief statement ruling that the superstar's death was unlawful.</p>
              <p>The statement said that while "acute intoxication" from the powerful
              anesthetic propofol was the primary cause of death, Jackson, 50, had
              also suffered from the effects of other drugs in his system.</p>
              <p>As well as propofol, powerful drugs including lorazepam, midazolam,
              diazepam, lidocaine and ephedrine were found in Jackson's body.</p>
              <p>The coroner's statement said police investigators and public
              prosecutors had ordered that the full toxicology report concerning
              Jackson be withheld until further notice.</p>
              <p>Jackson's family welcomed the findings.</p>
              <p>"The Jackson family again wishes to commend the actions of the
              coroner, the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies, and looks forward
              to the day that justice can be served," the family said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The coroner's announcement will fuel speculation that authorities
              are likely to charge Jackson's personal physician Conrad Murray in
              connection with the death. Cardiologist Murray was the last person to
              see Jackson alive.</p>
              <p>A lawyer for Murray issued a barbed statement to Friday's announcement, saying the coroner's release "contains nothing new."</p>
              <p>"For two months we have been hearing the same information, usually
              from leaks out of the coroner's office," attorney Ed Chernoff said in a
              statement.</p>
              <p>"One has to wonder why the coroner felt compelled to release anything at all if the police investigation is not yet complete."</p>
              <p>According to court documents unsealed in Houston, Texas, on Monday,
              multiple drugs were administered to Jackson by Murray in the hours
              before his death.</p>
              <p>Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran "reviewed
              the preliminary toxicology results and his preliminary assessment of
              Jackson's cause of death was due to lethal levels of propofol."</p>
              <p>Murray administered propofol and other drugs to Jackson -- at the
              star's insistence -- to treat his insomnia, but was worried Jackson had
              developed an addiction and "tried to wean Jackson off of the drug," the
              affidavit said.</p>
              <p>Propofol is a powerful anesthetic used to induce
              unconsciousness in patients undergoing major surgery in hospital.
              Medical professionals say it should never be used by private
              individuals at home.</p>
              <p>The affidavit unsealed on Monday revealed
              that Murray confessed to investigators two days after the star died
              that he had been giving Jackson 50 milligrams of propofol nightly
              during the six weeks prior to the event.</p>
              <p>As part of their
              investigation, police and federal agents have already raided Murray's
              offices in Las Vegas, Nevada and Houston, Texas, as well as a Las Vegas
              pharmacy that provided the drugs.</p>
              <p>Murray told investigators he
              was not the first doctor to administer propofol to the King of Pop, who
              referred to the drug as his "milk," LAPD detective Orlando Martinez
              wrote in the affidavit, citing the cardiologist.</p>
              <p>Medical experts
              said the cocktail of drugs apparently given to Jackson was extremely
              dangerous and police would need to determine whether administering it
              was tantamount to medical negligence.</p>
              <p>"If all of these drugs...
              are also shown, this would be a classical case of acute combined drug
              toxicity," forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht told CNN.</p>
              <p>Jackson is
              to be buried at a cemetery in Glendale, California on September 3, his
              family announced last week. They had originally planned to bury him on
              Saturday -- the day he would have turned 51.</p>

              <p><strong>Poignant final farewell as Jackson laid to rest</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Michael Jackson has been laid to
              rest in a glittering gold coffin adorned with a crown after family and
              friends saluted the tragic "King of Pop" in a poignant farewell.</p>
              <p>More than two months after the singer died from a drug overdose,
              around 200 mourners gathered outdoors Thursday at a picturesque
              cemetery on a warm summer evening to celebrate the singer's life.</p>
              <p>Jackson's children -- Prince Michael 12, Paris, 11, and
              seven-year-old Prince Michael II, otherwise known as "Blanket" --
              placed a crown on their father's flower-laden coffin before the service
              got under way.</p>
              <p>Unpredictable to the last, Jackson was late for
              his own funeral, his ornate casket set down before mourners more than
              90 minutes after the service had been scheduled to start at 7:00 pm
              local time (0200 GMT).</p>
              <p>Jackson's brothers -- all dressed
              identically in black suits and each wearing a solitary white glove in
              tribute to the pop icon -- served as pallbearers as the coffin was
              removed from the hearse.</p>
              <p>His children reportedly left notes in their father's coffin reading "Daddy we love you, we miss you."</p>
              <p>Mourners
              made spontaneous tributes to Jackson in a service held beyond the
              prying eyes of hundreds of media personnel gathered outside the Forest
              Lawn Memorial Park, home to a who's who of late Hollywood legends.</p>
              <p>Soul
              legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn "His Eye Is on the Sparrow,"
              while lyricist Clifton Davis belted out his hit song "Never Can Say
              Goodbye."</p>
              <p>Following the ceremony, Jackson's brothers carried
              their sibling's casket into Forest Lawn's imposing Great Mausoleum,
              followed by guests.</p>
              <p>"Michael Jackson reached his final resting
              place tonight at 9:43 pm (0443 GMT) in The Great Mausoleum at Glendale
              Forest Lawn Memorial Park," a statement from the Jackson family read
              after the service.</p>
              <p>"The Jackson Family wishes to once again thank
              all of Michael's fans around the world for their generous outpouring of
              support during this terribly difficult time."</p>
              <p>Earlier, a convoy headed by six Rolls Royce luxury limousines transported Jackson's family to the cemetery.</p>
              <p>Other
              guests included Hollywood icon Elizabeth Taylor, actor Macaulay Culkin
              and outspoken rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton, who posted on
              micro-blogging site Twitter during the service.</p>
              <p>"What MJ went
              through was so unfair, yet he succeeded," Sharpton said. "In the end,
              he was the biggest artist ever. He faced the headwinds but he made it."</p>
              <p>But there was no sign of soul singer Diana Ross, who was named as a back-up guardian to Jackson's children in the singer's will.</p>
              <p>Invites issued to guests urged mourners to celebrate Jackson's life.</p>
              <p>"We loved him, we laughed with him, we sang with him. We danced with him. But on this day, we celebrate him," the invite read.</p>
              <p>The mausoleum housing Jackson is also home to Hollywood icons Clark Gable, Jean Harlow and Carole Lombard.</p>
              <p>Other stars buried elsewhere at Forest Lawn include Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart, Spencer Tracy and Walt Disney.</p>
              <p>Thursday's
              service contrasted with the lavish public memorial held at the Los
              Angeles Staples Center in July, which was attended by 20,000 fans and
              beamed live around the world to an estimated audience of one billion.</p>
              <p>Police
              had cordoned off the neighborhood surrounding the cemetery after
              earlier urging fans to stay away from the event. Police helicopters,
              sniffer dogs and plain-clothes officers patrolled the 300-acre
              (120-hectare) cemetery, on the lookout for any fans trying to gatecrash
              the service.</p>
              <p>But die-hard fans were undeterred and waited outside
              the perimeter. One group of devotees held up a banner reading: "King of
              Pop Michael Jackson Gone Too Soon."</p>
              <p>Jackson's delayed funeral
              followed months of speculation about the exact cause of his death and
              reported divisions within the singer's family about where he should be
              buried.</p>
              <p>Elder brother Jermaine had said he wanted the star to be
              interred at his Neverland Ranch estate north of Los Angeles. Jackson
              fled the property in 2005 after being acquitted on child molestation
              charges.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles coroners said last week that Jackson's death
              was being treated as a homicide and revealed that he had six drugs in
              his body when he died, including the powerful anesthetic propofol.</p>
              <p>The
              coroner's announcement fueled speculation that authorities may charge
              Jackson's personal physician, Conrad Murray, in connection with the
              death.</p>
              <p>Jackson, one of the most influential figures in pop music
              history whose four-decade career included the highest-selling album of
              all-time -- "Thriller" -- had been preparing for a July concert
              comeback at the time of his death.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">Michael Jackson (MJ) was known as the most loving person in the world. He gave up most of his assets for charity and all his life, he fought for equality of the African Americans, AIDS victims, Against Drug Abuse, Against Abortion, Against Child Labor and secretly channelled his properties for the hungry children of the world.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">However, he wasn't peace at heart. He always think of himself as a child trapped inside a man's body.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">Being Peter Pan is all his dream, never to grow up, forever a child.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">That inspires him to build Neverland - a heaven for children.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">Children of all ages and races are welcomed to Neverland. MJ had so much love to give.<br><br>However, he made a mistake which he didn't know of the consequences. He saw the peaceful life his brother, Jermaine Jackson (Muhammad Abdul Aziz), had as a Muslim - true, Jermaine faced so much pressure that he moved to Bahrain.<br><br>In 1989, MJ made a press conference which shocked the world, "I have seen the Islam in the life of my brother, I have read the books about Islam. And I'd love to someday feel the calmness and peace of Islam...."<br><br>Since that, MJ's life was never the same again.<br>He was accused of so many accusations against child molestation. MJ was not someone who can deal with much pressure as he is a 'delicate child'. All the extortion and black mail followed after that. Everything he did was being seen as wrong in the eyes of the Media. All these are to influence his fans to hate MJ. If he is hated, then he would not be influencial anymore.<br><br>For several years, he stayed in England. Getting motivation from a long time friend, Cat Stevens, who had converted into Islam - named Yusuf Islam. From him, MJ learnt how Yusuf had survived being Muslim. He made friends with a song writer, Zain Bhikha too, who wrote a song titled, "GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH", which he wanted MJ to sing whenever he is ready.<br><br>Following his trial, MJ withdrew to Bahrain, where he was the special guest of Sheik Abdullah bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the son of Bahrain’s King. It was then that Michael began to give conversion more “serious thought.”<br>MJ stayed in Bahrain for approximately 3 years. He studied Islam, the prayers and learn to read the Koran (al-Quran).</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">Finally, he came back to Los Angeles and in November 2008 MJ had formally converted to Islam in a ceremony at a close friend’s house in Los Angeles.<br>He perform Haj with the King of Bahrain and son on December 2008.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;"><br>He had a hidden agenda when he wanted to make a final comeback. He annouced in a Press Conference on March 2009, "This will be my final concert. I'll see you all in July...."<br><br>He planned that during his concert, he would announce that this is the FINAL concert as he wouldn't be performing anymore. He will declare that he is a Muslim and will only sing with Yusuf Islam and Friends.<br>At the end of the concert, he will be singing the song, "GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH" with Yusuf Islam. That is the reason why he chose London as his final concert venue instead of the USA. It was because he thought he could escape the USA's extortion, and that he could perform with Yusuf Islam who is in England.<br><br>At 12.30am, 25th June 2009, he hugged his production manager and said, "After rehearsing for 2 months, I am finally ready for the Concert..."<br>Before leaving to sleep, he waved at his dancers, "It was a good night everyone. I'll see you all tomorrow..."<br>The next thing... He was pronouced dead at 2.26am....<br><br>When 911 was called, there are so much questions asked.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">It is as if they didn't know who MJ is and where he lived.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">The questions asked are more towards to delay time.<br>The hospital said the Autopsy result can only be obtained after 2 months - very illogical as even the worst African technology could obtain results in less than 2 weeks.<br><br>MJ's family members opt for second private autopsy as they started to feel something fishy is going on.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">The result came out in about 4 days - MJ was drugged with high dosage of anaesthetic - drug that brings about a reversible loss of consciousness, if used to much could stop the heart from beating.<br><br>Another result which was not aired in the media was, MJ's stomach was empty of this drug, but his blood were filled with it - same case as the death of Marilyn Monroe.<br>The private doctors also found many needle marks, afraid to be forced injections given to MJ on his bed.<br><br>In CNN Live after a week, Barack Obama was interviewed. And he said, "I love MJ, I grew up listening to his songs. It is a great loss, but rest assured that there is no conspiracy in his death..."<br>Now, why must a President made such statement before the official autopsy result came out? How would he know that there is no conspiracy without the post-mortem result? Seems like someone is afraid of his shadows.<br><br>MJ was known to the world as a person who is against drug abuse. Why must he be addicted to drugs then? If he wanted to commit suicide, why rehearse for his concert? And why will he want to see his dancers the next day?<br><br>Enough about his death. I am sure people around the world is not stupid anymore. These supreme power can fool us during the Marilyn Monroe conspiracy, Martin Luther King and Princess Diana.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">But in this MJ's case, they left too many loopholes for those who think...!!</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;"><br>MJ left us with this unfinished studio-recorded song, GIVE THANKS TO ALLAH.</span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">You can download this song here:</span></span> <a rel="nofollow"></a><a rel="nofollow"></a><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;">/file/ahb80ff/n/Micheal_Jackson_-_Give_Thanks_To_Allah_mp3</span></span> <span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Sylfaen;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Sylfaen;"><br><br>MJ's family was about to give him a Muslim burial with the help of The Brotherhood of Islam. But, the CIA showed up at Neverland's door - blackmailed them that if they do so publicly, Katherine (MJ's mother) would be pulled off from MJ's 3 children's custody as well as MJ's Estates. Instead, they'll hire Debbie Rowe for the purpose, and the court will be in their favour. So much for democracy and fairness...<br><br>Finally, they agreed to let MJ have a Muslim Burial in Neverland. But on condition, must show to the public a Christian Memorial Service, as to prove to the world that MJ was never a Muslim.<br><br>So, Staples Centre was just a normal show. That's why the coffin was closed and sealed.<br><br>MJ was buried days earlier. The Gold Coffin was empty. They were about to bury the Coffin according to Christianity formalities in Hollywood - as in their deal with the USA Government.<br><br>These happened, because the USA is afraid of the rising numbers of Muslims in the world.<br><br>(Sheikh Ha**d)<br>The Brotherhood of Islam<br>Buletin of Bahrain</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Jackson mum, children get $86,000 per month</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - – Michael Jackson's
              mother and children are receiving more than 86,000 dollars every month
              from the late pop star's estate, according to court documents.</p>
              <p>Under
              allowances approved by Los Angeles Superior Court judge Mitchell
              Beckloff, Jackson's mother Katherine is paid a monthly sum of 26,000
              dollars while the singer's three children receive 60,000 dollars.</p>
              <p>The allowances were confirmed at a hearing in August but the amounts were only disclosed on Thursday.</p>
              <p>The
              administrators of Jackson's estate had requested a special allowance
              for the star's mother, noting that the 79-year-old's only other source
              of income was her pension.</p>
              <p>Jackson, 50, died on June 25 after
              consuming a lethal cocktail of powerful prescription drugs. His death
              is being treated as a homicide.</p>
              <p>Jackson, one of the most
              influential figures in pop music history whose four-decade career
              included the highest-selling album of all-time, "Thriller," had been
              preparing for a July concert comeback at the time of his death.</p>

              <p><strong>AP Exclusive: Autopsy shocker: Jackson was healthy</strong></p>
              <div class="bd">
              <div class="content">
              <p>LOS ANGELES – Michael
              Jackson's arms were covered with punctures, his face and neck were
              scarred and he had tattooed eyebrows and lips, but he wasn't the sickly
              skeleton of a man portrayed by tabloids, according to his autopsy
              report obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
              <p>In fact, the Los
              Angeles County coroner's report shows Jackson was a fairly healthy
              50-year-old before he died of an overdose. His 136 pounds were in the
              acceptable range for a 5-foot-9 man. His heart was strong with no sign
              of plaque buildup. And his kidneys and most other major organs were
              normal.</p>
              <p>Still, Jackson had health issues: arthritis in the
              lower spine and some fingers, and mild plaque buildup in his leg
              arteries. Most serious was his lungs, which the autopsy report said
              were chronically inflamed and had reduced capacity that might have left
              him short of breath.</p>
              <p>However, according to the document, the lung condition was not serious enough to be a direct or contributing cause of death.</p>
              <p>"His
              overall health was fine," said Dr. Zeev Kain, chairman of the
              anesthesiology department at the University of California, Irvine, who
              reviewed a copy of the autopsy report for the AP. "The results are
              within normal limits."</p>
              <p>Kain was not involved in the autopsy. The full autopsy report has not been released publicly, but the AP obtained a copy.</p>
              <p>Jackson
              died at his rented Los Angeles mansion June 25 after his personal
              physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, administered the anesthetic propofol and
              two other sedatives to get the chronic insomniac to sleep, court
              documents state. Propofol, normally a surgical anesthetic used in
              operating rooms, acts as a respiratory depressant and requires constant
              monitoring,</p>
              <p>Murray told police he left the room to use the
              bathroom and phone records show he also made calls for 47 minutes
              around the time Jackson encountered problems. When Murray realized
              Jackson was unresponsive, he began frantic efforts to revive him, but
              Jackson never regained consciousness and was declared dead at the
              University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center.</p>
              <p>The
              coroner's office announced last month that Jackson's death was a
              homicide caused by "acute propofol intoxication," with the other
              sedatives listed as a contributing factor. They said the standard of
              care for administering propofol was not met and the recommended
              equipment for patient monitoring, precision dosing and resuscitation
              was missing.</p>
              <p>Murray is the target of what Los Angeles police
              term a manslaughter investigation. The decision on criminal charges
              will come from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
              Murray has been interviewed twice by police.</p>
              <p>Except for a
              brief video posted to YouTube, Murray has not spoken publicly since
              Jackson's death. In the video, he said: "I told the truth and I have
              faith the truth will prevail." Murray's attorney, Edward Chernoff,
              previously has said nothing Murray gave Jackson "should have" killed
              him.</p>
              <p>Jackson was declared dead a little more than two hours
              after paramedics were called. Evidence of the desperate struggle to
              save the star were evident on his body. He had chest bruising and
              cracked ribs from CPR, and a mechanical device known as a balloon pump
              was inserted into his heart to try to restart it, according to the
              autopsy report.</p>
              <p>Jackson's body was taken by helicopter to the
              coroner's office where the following morning Chief Medical Examiner
              Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran and Dr. Christopher Rogers carried out an
              extensive review and ordered a toxicology screening to look for drugs
              in his system.</p>
              <p>Aside from propofol and the sedatives, the only
              substances found in his system were the local anesthetic, Lidocaine,
              sometimes used to numb injection sites and ephedrine, a commonly used
              resuscitation stimulant.</p>
              <p>No other drugs _ legal or otherwise _ were detected, nor was any alcohol.</p>
              <p>Kain
              said he was surprised that three other sedatives, known as
              benzodiazepines, were present with propofol. Anesthesiologists
              sometimes mix one "benzo" with propofol to help put a patient under,
              but using three increases the danger for the patient.</p>
              <p>"People
              don't mix the benzodiazepines together because they interact with each
              other and increase the risk of respiratory arrest," Kain said, adding
              it was likely Jackson first stopped breathing and then suffered cardiac
              arrest.</p>
              <p>The autopsy findings cut off a potential defense for
              Murray _ that Jackson hid serious pre-existing conditions that
              increased the risk of death from the drugs he willingly took. Even if
              he did hide a condition such as his weakened lungs, a prosecutor could
              argue Murray should have detected the condition before administering
              drugs, said Michael Brennan, a clinical law professor at the University
              of Southern California who specializes in criminal defense.</p>
              <p>"A
              doctor has some obligation to know what his patient's physical
              condition is," Brennan said. "The doctor is going to try to
              substantiate whatever the patient told him ... and not simply rely on a
              patient's descriptions of his physical condition."</p>
              <p>At the time
              of his death Jackson was preparing for a series of comeback concerts in
              London. Rehearsals were rigorous and there were questions about whether
              Jackson would be physically able to hold up.</p>
              <p>But aside from
              his lungs, the autopsy report did not identify any serious physical
              problems that might have limited Jackson's ability to perform. It also
              provided details about his physical state from head to toes.</p>
              <p>He
              had a 3/4-inch scar behind his left ear and another apparent scar
              behind his right ear. He had a scar beside each of his nostrils and
              another, 4-inch scar on his right shoulder. He had a pair of additional
              scars about 3-inches long at the base of his neck and smaller scars on
              his arms and wrist. He also had a small scar near his navel and a
              2-inch scar on the right-hand side of his abdomen.</p>
              <p>Kain said
              most of the scars appeared to be from plastic surgery though others,
              like a scar on the knee, could have been from a medical procedure.</p>
              <p>The
              medical examiner found numerous punctures on both arms and on a knee
              and ankle. The leg punctures could have been from intravenous therapies
              not described in the autopsy report, Kain said.</p>
              <p>Jackson had
              several tattoos, all them cosmetic, including dark tattoos in the areas
              of both eyebrows and under his eyes, and a pink tattoo around his lips.</p>
              <p>He
              was going bald at the front of his head, with his remaining hair
              described as short and tightly curled. The bald part of his scalp was
              darkened with what appeared to be a tattoo stretching across the top of
              his head from ear to ear.</p>
              <p>The coroner found depigmentation of his skin around his chest, abdomen, face and arms.</p>
              <p>The coroner also found Jackson was actively producing sperm.</p>
