              <p>i dunno the last few times i looked at him, something told me that he will not live for long.    Never expect he gone so soon.   At least, he still left with good stuff for people to remember him.   </p>
              <p>think i more sad when pavarotti died.   i cried so pathetically when watching his funeral.</p>

              <p>Only when he died, people start remember him. But when he is alive, say a lot of bad things about him. Human..... haiz.</p>
              <p>Really love his mv and songs. Thriller, black or white, remember the time, earth song, etc mv, wow..... so many good songs. His MV and songs is always so good and always give me a surprise. Always make me want listen to his songs and watch his MV again and again. No one can replace the King of Pop. Goodbye Michael.</p>

              <p>I do enjoy some of his songs, but wouldn't consider myself a fan. It's his personality that I'm more interested in. Every person worth a damn in history had eccentricities. Otherwise you're just mediocre; part of the crowd.</p>

              <p>Just like everywhere around the world, fans in Michael Jackson's
              fans in Singapore have expressed shock and grief over the death of the
              King of Pop.</p>
              <p>"Oh I think it's sad because I grew up with his music and I have
              friends who were like crazy over him, going to his concerts and all
              that. Basically to me it represents the passing of an era. He's such a
              legend and an icon, a pop icon. For him to suddenly die like that, it's
              shocking. It's quite a pity that he died at 50 years old. It's a great
              loss. The impact is there. It's definitely a big, big loss to the music
              world. Well it's better to remember the great moments and the great
              songs and the great music that the person has left us with."</p>
              <p>Online, tribute pages quickly sprung up on social networking sites.</p>
              <p>For many, it was a day they would not soon forget.</p>
              <p>Record shops reported an increase in MJ memorabilia sales.</p>
              <p>Michael Jackson was massively popular in Singapore.</p>
              <p>His concert here in 1993 was sold out and is still fondly remembered by those who attended.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore fans mourn passing of pop legend Michael Jackson</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: In Singapore, the passing of Michael Jackson was met with shock and disbelief.
              <br> <br> Michael Jackson last visited Singapore in 1996 where hordes of fans
              crowded outside the Raffles Hotel for a glimpse of their idol.
              <br> <br> And when he finally appeared at the window, it was a brief but telling moment about the elusive superstar.
              <br> <br> Michael Jackson was an undisputed musical icon for many despite being known as "Wacko Jacko" for his often bizarre behaviour.
              <br> <br> News of his sudden death from cardiac arrest was met with disbelief.
              <br> <br> Online, tribute pages quickly sprung up on social networking sites.
              <br> <br> For many, it was a day they would not soon forget.
              <br> <br>Record shops reported an increase in Michael Jackson memorabilia
              sales and on auction website eBay, some were quick to cash in on
              demand. <br> <br> Michael Jackson last performed in Singapore in August 1993. It was a
              sell-out concert at the National Stadium that showed the crowd of
              thousands just why he was the King of Pop. <br> <br> For many here, it would have been a real dream to see Michael Jackson grace the stage once more. </span></p>

              <p>Only when he died, people start remember him. But when he is

              <p>Really love his mv and songs. Thriller, black or white, remember
              the time, earth song, etc mv, wow..... so many good songs. His MV
              and songs is always so good and always give me a surprise. Always
              make me want listen to his songs and watch his MV again and again.
              No one can replace the King of Pop. Goodbye Michael.</p>

              <p>Heal the World is a tad too drama, mellow and over played on radio. But then again which track by MJ isn't. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I prefer songs like Scream, Black or White, Bad, Billie Jean etc, more feisty and more king of pop!</p>
