              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Jackson death stuns world, spotlight on role of drugs</span></strong></p>
              <p>Michael Jackson's autopsy is to get underway as attention turned to the possible role of drugs in the King of Pop's death</p>
              <p>But Los Angeles Coroner's spokesman Ed Winter indicated that a final
              verdict into Jackson's death would probably not be issued until the
              results of toxicology tests were known, a period that could take
              several weeks.</p>
              <p>Jackson lawyer Brian Oxman said he and family members voiced concerns over the star's use of drugs,</p>
              <p>as he prepared for a gruelling series of comeback concerts in London designed to relaunch his career.</p>
              <p>Celebrity website TMZ.com -- which broke the news of Jackson's death
              on Thursday -- reported that the star had been administered an
              injection of the powerful painkiller Demerol about an hour before he
              lost consciousness.<br> <br> Family members told TMZ the dosage was "too much."</p>
              <p>TMZ reported that police were searching for Jackson's physician.</p>
              <p>But the Los Angeles Police Department would not immediately confirm the report.<br> <br> Jackson collapsed suddenly at his rented mansion in Los Angeles on
              Thursday and was rushed to hospital by paramedics before being
              pronounced dead.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Michael Jackson death still unsolved after autopsy</span></strong></p>
              <p>US doctors have completed an autopsy on the body of Michael Jackson</p>
              <p>But they could not immediately determine what killed the "King of Pop"</p>
              <p>Los Angeles County Coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey said the cause of death has been deferred,</p>
              <p>which means that the medical examiner has ordered additional testing
              such as toxicology and other studies which could take four to six weeks.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr Harvey said that there was no indication
              of any external trauma or indication of foul play to Jackson's body</p>
              <p>Jackson was in full cardiac arrest when paramedics arrived at his
              rented mansion in Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon with his personal
              physician trying desperately to revive him.<br> <br> The 50-year-old pop superstar was rushed to nearby UCLA Medical Center,
              where he was pronounced dead without regaining consciousness.</p>
              <p>Celebrity website TMZ.com, citing an interview with an unidentified "close member" of the Jackson family,</p>
              <p>reported that the entertainer was injected with Demerol, a narcotic
              painkiller, about half an hour before he went into cardiac arrest.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson feared dying like Elvis: Lisa Marie Presley</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Michael Jackson told ex-wife
              Lisa Marie Presley he feared dying young like her "King of Rock 'N'
              Roll" father Elvis.</p>
              <p>In a blog on her MySpace page titled "He Knew", Lisa Marie, who was
              married to Jackson for just under two years between 1994 and 1996, said
              her ex-husband had once confided his fear of dying suddenly.</p>
              <p>"Years ago Michael and I were having a deep conversation about life in general," Presley wrote.</p>
              <p>"I
              can't recall the exact subject matter but he may have been questioning
              me about the circumstances of my Father's Death. At some point he
              paused, he stared at me very intensely and he stated with an almost
              calm certainty, 'I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the
              way he did.'"</p>
              <p>Jackson's sudden death Thursday from an apparent cardiac arrest
              triggered an outpouring of grief that has evoked comparisons with the
              1977 death of Elvis at the age of 42.</p>
              <p>Presley also used her blog
              to hit out at the constant swirl of rumor and speculation surrounding
              her marriage to Jackson, which some critics derided as a public
              relations stunt designed to burnish the star's image after 1993
              allegations of child abuse.</p>
              <p>"I am going to say now what I have never said before because I want the truth out there for once," Presley said.</p>
              <p>"Our
              relationship was not 'a sham' as is being reported in the press. It was
              an unusual relationship yes, where two unusual people who did not live
              or know a 'Normal life' found a connection, perhaps with some suspect
              timing on his part. Nonetheless, I do believe he loved me as much as he
              could love anyone and I loved him very much," Presley wrote.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to 'save him' I wanted to save him from the inevitable which is what has just happened."</p>

              <div>
              <p>Michael Jackson's doctor in under increasing scrutiny in relation to the pop music icon's death.</p>
              <p>Dr Conrad Murray was questioned by Los Angeles Police for 3 hours today.</p>
              <p>His lawyer said he's not a suspect in the case, and was just helping police as a witness.</p>
              <p>Dr Murray was with the singer when he collapsed at his rented mansion 2 days ago.</p>
              <p>There've been reports about the 50-year-old's reliance on
              prescription medications, as well as him being injected with the
              narcotic painkiller Demerol shortly before he went into cardiac arrest.</p>
              <p>Veteran US politician and activist Reverend Jesse Jackson, who's
              been serving as a spokesman for the singer's family, revealed that
              family members were angered by lingering questions surrounding
              Jackson's death.</p>
              <p>He added that they were focusing their attention on the role of Dr Murray, whom the singer had employed just last month.</p>
              <p>An official autopsy conducted on Friday failed to determine what killed the pop star.</p>
              <p>Results from toxicology tests carried out are expected to take up to six weeks.</p>
              <p>The Jackson family has ordered its own private autopsy in a bid to find out the cause of death.</p>
              <p>The singer's body is being held at an undisclosed mortuary.</p>
              <p>Funeral plans have not been announced.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson family order new autopsy as anger mounts</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - The family of Michael Jackson
              ordered a second autopsy of the tragic pop icon as associates told of
              mounting anger over "unanswered questions" surrounding the superstar's
              death.</p>
              <p>Jackson's family members were huddled at their compound in Los
              Angeles, where they have gathered since the most famous member of their
              clan died suddenly on Thursday at age 50 after suffering an apparent
              cardiac arrest.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles police on Saturday conducted a second
              interview with doctor Conrad Murray, the only person with him when he
              collapsed. A spokeswoman for the cardiologist said he "clarified some
              inconsistencies" over the death.</p>
              <p>But the spokeswoman, Miranda Sevcik, added: "Investigators say the
              doctor is in no way a suspect and remains a witness to this tragedy."</p>
              <p>Frustrated by the lack of hard information, the family requested a
              second autopsy on Jackson's body which was being kept at an undisclosed
              location, officials and local media reports said.</p>
              <p>Late Saturday, The Los Angeles Times reported the autopsy had been completed but there was no word on the findings.</p>
              <p>"We
              don't like what's going on," family patriarch Joe Jackson told People
              magazine. The Jacksons later issued a statement to fans describing the
              death as "one of the darkest moments of our lives."</p>
              <p>The Los Angeles Coroner's office said Friday a preliminary autopsy
              on Jackson was inconclusive and a final cause of death would not be
              known until exhaustive toxicology tests are completed in "six to eight
              weeks."</p>
              <p>According to The Times, which cites Pennsylvania forensic
              pathologist Cyril Wecht, the coroner's office probably kept Jackson's
              brain even after his body had been released to the family in order to
              conduct a neuropathology test.</p>
              <p>This test could reveal whether the
              singer's brain had been damaged by drug abuse and whether he had
              suffered overdoses in the past, the paper said.</p>
              <p>Joe Jackson separately told Fox News that Michael Jackson's three
              children -- whom the pop star fiercely protected -- were in "fantastic"
              spirits at the musical clan's compound.</p>
              <p>Veteran US politician and
              activist Reverend Jesse Jackson -- who is not related to the family --
              told ABC television's Good Morning America he had spent Friday
              counseling the family.</p>
              <p>And he revealed that family members were
              angered by lingering questions surrounding Jackson's death and were
              focusing their attention on the role of Murray, whom the singer had
              hired just last month.</p>
              <p>"They (the family) are suspicious of this doctor and they have real
              reason to be because any other doctor would say 'Here's what happened
              in the last hour of his life and I was there. I gave him some
              medicine,'" Jesse Jackson said.</p>
              <p>"He owes it to the family and to
              the public to say, 'These were the last hours of Michael's life and
              here's what happened.' That's a reasonable expectation."</p>
              <p>Friends
              and associates of Jackson took to the airwaves to voice anger over the
              role of advisers and physicians that surrounded the star.</p>
              <p>New age guru and Jackson confidante Deepak Chopra -- a qualified cardiologist -- told CNN bluntly: "I think drugs killed him."</p>
              <p>Anger was also beginning to be seen amongst fans who have gathered
              around the globe in their thousands to pay tribute to Jackson in what
              have been largely joyous celebrations of his life.</p>
              <p>On the
              Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, fans queued again on Saturday
              for the right to file past Jackson's star set in the sidewalk.</p>
              <p>Deborah Canton, 46, sobbed inconsolably as she slammed the "evil people" who she accused of driving Jackson to his death.</p>
              <p>"The
              guy would never hurt a fly but all of these evil people would do
              everything to destroy him just to get his money," she said. "I don't
              think he wanted to live anymore."</p>
              <p>In New York large crowds formed outside the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem, where Jackson launched his career in 1969.</p>
              <p>Black Entertainment Television (BET) was quickly reworking its
              annual awards show on Sunday, turning it into a tribute to the
              superstar credited with helping bridge racial divides.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile
              revelers at Britain's Glastonbury music festival sported T-shirts with
              slogans like "Michael Jackson RIP" and "I was at Glasto when Jacko
              died", while graffiti paying tribute to "The King of Pop" adorned tents.</p>
              <p>Jackson's
              death has sent fans scrambling to stock up on his music, and British
              chart officials said a compilation album was likely to go to the top of
              the charts on Sunday.</p>
              <p>While Jackson ruled the charts and dazzled
              audiences with dance moves like the "moonwalk" in the 1980s, his
              once-stellar career was overshadowed by his startling physical
              transformation and multiple allegations of child abuse.</p>
              <p>He lived
              as a virtual recluse following his 2005 acquittal on charges of child
              molestation and plotting to kidnap his young accuser.</p>
