              <p>Whatever  the final autopsy results reveal, it was greed that killed
              Michael Jackson. Had he not been driven – by a cabal of bankers,
              agents, doctors and advisers – to commit to the gruelling 50 concerts

              <p>During
              the last weeks and months of his life, Jackson made desperate attempts
              to prepare for the concert series scheduled for next month – a series
              that would have earned millions for the singer and his entourage, but
              which he could never have completed, not mentally, and not physically.</p>
              <p>Michael knew it and his advisers knew it. Anyone who caught even a
              fleeting glimpse of the frail old man hiding beneath the costumes and
              cosmetics would have understood that the London tour was madness. For
              Michael Jackson, it was fatal.</p>

              <p>A lawyer for Michael Jackson's doctor says the physician did not inject the singer with painkillers.</p>
              <p>There've been reports saying that the pop icon was injected with Demerol shortly before he went into cardiac arrest.</p>
              <p>But the lawyer says Dr Conrad Murray found the star unconscious in his rented mansion and tried to revive him.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles police said they do not consider the doctor a suspect after questioning him for a second time.</p>
              <p>A second autopsy ordered by Jackson's family is said to have been completed.</p>
              <p>There was no word on the findings.</p>
              <p>An official autopsy conducted last week failed to determine what killed the star.</p>
              <p>A family friend told Reuters news agency that the family is planning a funeral that could take place on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>She added that Michael Jackson could be buried at his famous Neverland ranch in California.</p>
              <p>Michael Jackson's sudden death at the age of 50 has triggered a global outpouring of grief.</p>
              <p>Music retailer HMV says there's been an 80-fold increase in demand for his music after his death.</p>
              <p>It saw the biggest one-day rise in sales seen for any artists, including Elvis Presley and John Lennon.</p>

              <p><strong>Some 100 fans turn up at Michael Jackson’s memorial in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Fans of international pop star Michael Jackson are still reeling from the news of his death.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, a special memorial was held at Hong Lim Park in honour of the King of Pop on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Some 100 people showed up even before the candle light vigil started.</p>
              <p>Some came with flowers and gifts. Others paid tribute by making some typical Michael Jackson moves.</p>
              <p>The event was organised by three friends, two of whom are waiting to enter university and the other is a polytechnic student.</p>
              <p>They came up with the S$1,500 needed for the sound system and projector. And they are willing to go further.</p>
              <p>Vikneswaran,
              co—organiser of the Michael Jackson Memorial, said: "So far, there’s no
              news of his funeral yet, but as soon as it’s out, we are definitely
              planning a trip to wherever his funeral is."</p>
              <p>A diversity of Michael Jackson’s fans turned up at the vigil.</p>
              <p>"Very young, he left this world. Goodbye," said a monk.</p>
              <p>"I
              first saw the news on TV, I was shocked and I cried all day. My mother
              said, ’don’t cry’ but my mom cried as well," said a Chinese woman.</p>
              <p>"His concert in 1993, I went and saw him. He’s my idol for a long, long time. He’s fantastic," said another woman.</p>
              <p>"My friend and I really love him, you know... He’s Michael Jackson!" said an American girl.</p>
              <p>Many
              at the vigil said Michael Jackson was a huge part of their childhood.
              Even though he’s gone, they said, his music will live on forever.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson set for final journey to Neverland: report</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Michael Jackson's body will make
              a poignant final journey to Neverland Ranch, it was reported Tuesday,
              fueling speculation that the sprawling fantasy retreat could become a
              permanent memorial to the tragic pop icon.</p>
              <p>A 30-car motorcade reportedly plans to escort the body on Thursday
              to the King of Pop's 1,050-hectare (2,600-acre) estate, a monument to
              Jackson's obsession with childhood that once included a fairground and
              a private zoo.</p>
              <p>CNN and the celebrity news website TMZ.com,
              quoting police sources, said the Jackson family planned a public
              viewing on Friday -- which could draw a crush of fans to the isolated
              ranch north of Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>Jackson's death at the age of 50 last
              week has sparked a worldwide outpouring of tributes which continued on
              Tuesday with crowds gathering at New York's famous Apollo Theater for a
              celebration of the star's life.</p>
              <p>Friday's public viewing could be an indication that the Jackson family has permanent plans for Neverland.</p>
              <p>Santa
              Barbara County officials said Tuesday they had received no formal
              notification of a memorial but said departments were "preparing to
              accommodate a large event" if a request for a Neverland funeral was
              made.</p>
              <p>Some fans say the star should be buried at the ranch and
              want it to be transformed into a shrine similar to Elvis Presley's
              Graceland.</p>
              <p>Neverland was named after the fantasy island of Peter Pan, Jackson's inspiration who refused to grow up.</p>
              <p>But
              the estate fell into disrepair after becoming the alleged crime scene
              in Jackson's 2005 trial on child molestation charges. Jackson vacated
              the property following his acquittal and never lived there again.</p>
              <p>The
              estate was reportedly on the verge of foreclosure before Jackson's
              death as his extravagant lifestyle and mounting personal and legal
              problems took their toll on his finances.</p>
              <p>The long-term fate of Neverland has been one of the myriad legal issues arising from Jackson's sudden death.</p>
              <p>A
              judge on Monday gave Jackson's 79-year-old mother, Katherine, temporary
              control over his estate including Neverland and the rights to songs of
              the Beatles. She was also named temporary guardian of his three
              children.</p>
              <p>The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Jackson
              drafted a will in 2002 that divided his estate between his mother, his
              three children and one or more charities.</p>
              <p>Conspicuously absent
              was his father, Joe Jackson, who groomed his nine children into musical
              sensations but had an uneasy relationship with his son.</p>
              <p>Michael
              Jackson said the family patriarch, a steelworker, would beat him when
              he missed a note and humiliate him, leading to the pop star's fragility
              and obsession with childhood.</p>
              <p>Joe Jackson said Monday that he and his wife were ready to be supportive parents to the pop star's three children.</p>
              <p>"This
              is where they belong," Joe Jackson, also 79, told reporters after the
              decision. "We're going to take care of them and give them the education
              they're supposed to have."</p>
              <p>Jackson's former wife of three years,
              Debbie Rowe, is the mother of the two eldest children -- Prince
              Michael, 12, and Paris, 11. The third, seven-year-old Prince Michael
              II, was born in 2002 to a surrogate whose identity has never been made
              public.</p>
              <p>It remains unclear where the star would ultimately be
              buried. The family has hesitated at funeral plans after authorizing a
              second autopsy to determine how he died.</p>
              <p>The Los Angeles Times
              reported that police detectives are seeking to identify and interview
              "multiple doctors" who treated Jackson in the years before his death.</p>
              <p>Attention
              has so far focused on the role of Jackson's doctor Conrad Murray, who
              was with the star just before his death last Thursday.</p>
              <p>Lawyers
              for Murray and law enforcement sources have said he is not suspected of
              wrongdoing and has co-operated with the investigation.</p>
              <p>On Monday,
              coroner's office investigators removed several plastic bags of
              medication from Jackson's rented mansion in Holmby Hills, described as
              "additional medical evidence."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile the organizers of a
              series of Jackson's planned comeback concerts in London revealed
              Tuesday that video footage of his rehearsals existed and could be
              released to the public.</p>
              <p>The president of promoters AEG Live,
              Randy Phillips, told Sky News television that video of the pop legend's
              performances would disprove rumors that he was incredibly frail before
              his death.</p>
              <p>"We may at some point release some footage of him in rehearsal that would totally refute that," he said.</p>

              <p>I think some of us had.   I am one of them.  But that aside.   Death is death.   No matter how we crack joke or hate the person, death is death, a different matter.</p>
              <p>Personally, i would like to see michael live longer.    Don't know if this is a good idea.    from wwhat we know he is not a happy person.   The media person from taiwan said may b it is better off for michael to leave as it is a relief for him.</p>
