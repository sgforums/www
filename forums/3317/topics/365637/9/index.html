              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>LOS ANGELES - A LOS Angeles dermatologist who treated Michael
                  Jackson for years has been reported by US media as the biological
                  father of the superstar's elder son and daughter.</p>
              <p>The US Weekly reports in its upcoming issue, which hits newsstands on
                  Thursday, that Dr Arnold Klein is the man who fathered Prince and
                  Paris. A source also told TMZ.com Jackson was not the biological father
                  of any of his children and Debbie Rowe is not the biological mother
                  either. TMZ said she was just a surrogate that was well paid for her
                  services. Jackson has another son, Blanket, seven.</p>
              <p>Reports said Dr Klein, 64, is wanted for questioning by the LAPD
                  regarding drugs he may have prescribed to the late singer. Jackson was
                  reportedly seen regularly at Dr Klein's Beverly Hills office in recent
                  months.</p>
              <p>'He is the dad,' says a Jackson insider to US Weekly magazine. 'He
                  and Debbie signed an agreement saying they would never reveal the
                  truth.'</p>
              <p>According to published reports, Dr Klein's patients besides Jackson
                  have included Cher, Elizabeth Taylor, and Dolly Parton. US Weekly said
                  though neither Rowe nor Jackson ever confessed to their kids' true
                  lineage, she did admit in 2002 that she carried his children as a
                  personal favour (and would not confirm that the marriage was ever
                  consummated).</p>
              <p>In a statement, Dr. Klein's attorney Richard L. Charnley told
                  Entertainment Tonight: 'Dr Klein is aware of media reports connecting
                  him to Michael Jackson. Because of patient confidentiality Dr Klein
                  will make no statement on any reports or allegations. Out of respect
                  for his patients...Dr. Klein asks that the media not contact his
                  patients nor interfere with their medical treatments. Like millions of
                  Michael's fans around the world, Dr Klein is saddened by Michael's
                  death and extends his condolences to Michael's family.'</p>
              <p>A lawyer for Rowe said reports that she is not the biological mother are false.</p>
              <p>'We refuse to be drawn into addressing the various rumors and
                  speculation swirling in the media,' said Rowe's attorney Marta Almli.
                  "The vast majority of what is out there is untrue. Particular hurtful
                  and insidious is the most recent rumour - which is entirely false -
                  concerning the maternity of the children. Ms. Rowe is the biological
                  mother of the two oldest children.'</p>
              <p>In his seven-year-old will filed on Wednesday in a Los
                  Angeles court, Jackson gave his entire estate to a family trust and
                  named his 79-year-old mother Katherine and his children as
                  beneficiaries. The will also estimates the current value of his estate
                  at more than US$500 million (S$724 million).</p>
              <p>Katherine Jackson was appointed their guardian, with entertainer
                  Diana Ross, a longtime friend of Michael Jackson, named successor
                  guardian if something happens to his mother.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson fans told to stay away as tickets up for grabs</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Fans heading to Los Angeles for
              Michael Jackson's memorial extravaganza were urged to stay away on
              Friday as organizers said tickets for the event would be allocated by
              an online lottery.</p>
              <p>Pop icon Jackson's sudden death on June 25 sparked a worldwide
              outpouring of grief and hundreds of thousands of devotees are expected
              to descend on Los Angeles for Tuesday's memorial at the Staples Center.</p>
              <p>However
              in a clear attempt to deter large numbers of ticketless fans from
              besieging the venue and creating a logistical nightmare, city officials
              said Friday the entire area would be put on lockdown.</p>
              <p>"If you do
              not have a ticket ... not only will you not be allowed at these venues,
              you will not be allowed in this area," Los Angeles Police Department
              chief Earl Paysinger said.</p>
              <p>The warning came as officials revealed
              tickets for the event would be distributed via an Internet lottery,
              with fans registering at the Staples Center's website to enter a draw
              from Friday onwards.</p>
              <p>Some 11,000 tickets would be made available
              for the event inside the main venue while an additional 6,500 tickets
              would be distributed for fans watching a live feed at the neighboring
              Nokia Theater. Within minutes of the draw being announced the Staples
              Center website had crashed.</p>
              <p>No information about where Jackson would be buried or what Tuesday's service would comprise was given.</p>
              <p>The
              Jacksons earlier quashed the idea of a public viewing and private
              service at the singer's Neverland Ranch, which posed headaches due to
              its remote location in ritzy Santa Barbara wine country.</p>
              <p>However,
              Jackson's elder brother Jermaine said he would still like the pop
              legend to be buried at Neverland, a tribute to Jackson's fascination
              with childhood that in its heyday had giraffes, tigers and a private
              amusement park.</p>
              <p>"I feel his presence because this is his
              creation," Jermaine Jackson told CNN in an interview Thursday. "I
              really feel this is where he should be rested because it's him," he
              said. "It's serene."</p>
              <p>As planning for Tuesday's memorial
              continued, legal battlelines were drawn over the fate of Jackson's
              offspring, with ex-wife Debbie Rowe declaring she planned to seek
              custody of the star's eldest two children.</p>
              <p>A court hearing is
              scheduled next Monday to determine who will administer Jackson's
              estate, and another hearing is set for July 13 to discuss the
              guardianship of the singer's three children.</p>
              <p>Rowe, who has
              remained largely silent since Jackson's death, told NBC television she
              would seek custody of Prince Michael, 12, and Paris, 11.</p>
              <p>"I want my children," Rowe was quoted as saying in a 90-minute phone interview with the station. "I am stepping up. I have to."</p>
              <p>Rowe,
              who was married to Jackson between 1996 and 1999, was omitted from a
              2002 will filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday in which
              Jackson named his 79-year-old mother Katherine Jackson as guardian.</p>
              <p>Jackson's
              mother was on Monday appointed temporary guardian of the two children
              and their seven-year-old sibling, Prince Michael II or "Blanket," who
              was born to an unidentified surrogate mother.</p>
              <p>Rowe filed a petition in 2001 to give up her parental rights but later reversed her decision and secured visitation rights.</p>
              <p>Rowe's lawyer Eric George later told reporters in a conference call Thursday no final decision had been made.</p>
              <p>The investigation into Jackson's death has zeroed in over the star's possible role of prescription medications.</p>
              <p>A
              law enforcement source confirmed to the Los Angeles Times that
              propofol, powerful sedative commonly used as a general anesthetic, had
              been found by investigators at Jackson's home.</p>

              <p>Platform: Sega Genesis and Sega Master System<br>Year: Early 1990's</p>
              <p>Michael Jackson Moonwalker for the Sega Genesis and Master System won't win many awards for the most imaginative gameplay. The game features the player as Michael Jackson going through various side-scrolling stages and rescuing children who were abducted by Mr. Big (and yes, that's the plot as well). The gameplay is very reminiscent of other Sega side-scrollers of the time, such as Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, except that you are in the role of Michael Jackson rather than a ninja.</p>
              <p>The hook here is that the action, backgrounds and music are all representative of Michael Jackson's music and videos. For example, in the first round, the player rescues children in Club 30 while Smooth Criminal plays in the background. The next set of the boards are the streets, and the music switches to Beat It. You defeat your enemies by performing various dance moves and poses that Michael himself performs (such as the hip thrust, spin, and, of course, moonwalk) and by kicking/throwing magic dust/power at your foes. You can also spin in place for a length of time, and depending on when you stop, Michael will either throw his hat boomerang style and destroy his enemies, or he'll start dancing, which causes all of the onscreen enemies to dance as well. After the dance ends, the enemies are destroyed because they couldn't keep up with Michael (no, I'm not making that up).</p>
              <p>Each of these moves, however, causes you to give up part of your life bar to perform them. Michael's life bar is representative of how much magic power he possesses. The bar starts blue, but turns to yellow and then red as he takes hit from his enemies or from using the hat toss/dance attack outlined above. As a nice touch, the distance your attacks cover decreases the lower the bar is, which means you need to be closer to an enemy to destroy them if the bar is yellow than if it is blue. The life meter is replenished a little each time Michael saves a child.</p>
              <p>As a side note, Michael can also catch a comet that falls from the top of the screen (triggered by rescuing the correct child first on a level). If this happens, Michael becomes a robot and can fly around the screen destroying enemies for a set period of time. Once all the children on the board are rescued, Bubbles (Michael's pet chimp) will jump onto your shoulders and direct you to the end stage confrontation. Each stage has a final challenge (either a bunch of enemies sent at you at once or a single enemy that is hard to defeat). Once these enemies are defeated, you move to the next stage.</p>
              <p>There are some flaws. For one, the third set of boards are an obvious homage to the Thriller video, but the music is not Thriller (I believe it's "You're Another Part of Me," but I could be wrong). It wouldn't be an issue, except that you battle zombies for three boards to music that seems out of place. The end confrontation is odd as well, with the gameplay shifting to a space battle (I have no idea why, but it is different), and while I think the designers were creative in some aspects, the gameplay does get repetitive.</p>
              <p>If all of this sounds ridiculous, it is. However, the game is fun for a little while. The enemies are varied, from the gangsters inhabiting Club 30 to the street punks in stage 2 or dogs and zombies that litter other boards. Some of the end stage confrontations are tough, and the children you need to rescue are not always out in the open, requiring you to open doors, trunks of cars, and windows to find them. It isn't an overly difficult game (powered it up last night for the first time in years and made it about halfway before losing a man), but it was fun for a short time. If you're going to get it, get the Genesis version. The music is much clearer and distinct with the advanced sound properties of the Genesis over the SMS (though it is background instruments only, no lyrics). Don't expect to spend tons of time replaying it, but as a novelty game worth powering up just for kicks, there are a lot worse out there than this. </p>

              <p><strong>Jackson fans told to stay away as tickets up for grabs</strong></p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Fans heading to Los Angeles for Michael Jackson's memorial extravaganza were urged to stay away on Friday as organizers said tickets for the event would be allocated by an online lottery.</p>
              <p>Pop icon Jackson's sudden death on June 25 sparked a worldwide outpouring of grief and hundreds of thousands of devotees are expected to descend on Los Angeles for Tuesday's memorial at the Staples Center.</p>
              <p>However in a clear attempt to deter large numbers of ticketless fans from besieging the venue and creating a logistical nightmare, city officials said Friday the entire area would be put on lockdown.</p>
              <p>"If you do not have a ticket ... not only will you not be allowed at these venues, you will not be allowed in this area," Los Angeles Police Department chief Earl Paysinger said.</p>
              <p>The warning came as officials revealed tickets for the event would be distributed via an Internet lottery, with fans registering at the Staples Center's website to enter a draw from Friday onwards.</p>
              <p>Some 11,000 tickets would be made available for the event inside the main venue while an additional 6,500 tickets would be distributed for fans watching a live feed at the neighboring Nokia Theater. Within minutes of the draw being announced the Staples Center website had crashed.</p>
              <p>No information about where Jackson would be buried or what Tuesday's service would comprise was given.</p>
              <p>The Jacksons earlier quashed the idea of a public viewing and private service at the singer's Neverland Ranch, which posed headaches due to its remote location in ritzy Santa Barbara wine country.</p>
              <p>However, Jackson's elder brother Jermaine said he would still like the pop legend to be buried at Neverland, a tribute to Jackson's fascination with childhood that in its heyday had giraffes, tigers and a private amusement park.</p>
              <p>"I feel his presence because this is his creation," Jermaine Jackson told CNN in an interview Thursday. "I really feel this is where he should be rested because it's him," he said. "It's serene."</p>
              <p>As planning for Tuesday's memorial continued, legal battlelines were drawn over the fate of Jackson's offspring, with ex-wife Debbie Rowe declaring she planned to seek custody of the star's eldest two children.</p>
              <p>A court hearing is scheduled next Monday to determine who will administer Jackson's estate, and another hearing is set for July 13 to discuss the guardianship of the singer's three children.</p>
              <p>Rowe, who has remained largely silent since Jackson's death, told NBC television she would seek custody of Prince Michael, 12, and Paris, 11.</p>
              <p>"I want my children," Rowe was quoted as saying in a 90-minute phone interview with the station. "I am stepping up. I have to."</p>
              <p>Rowe, who was married to Jackson between 1996 and 1999, was omitted from a 2002 will filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday in which Jackson named his 79-year-old mother Katherine Jackson as guardian.</p>
              <p>Jackson's mother was on Monday appointed temporary guardian of the two children and their seven-year-old sibling, Prince Michael II or "Blanket," who was born to an unidentified surrogate mother.</p>
              <p>Rowe filed a petition in 2001 to give up her parental rights but later reversed her decision and secured visitation rights.</p>
              <p>Rowe's lawyer Eric George later told reporters in a conference call Thursday no final decision had been made.</p>
              <p>The investigation into Jackson's death has zeroed in over the star's possible role of prescription medications.</p>
              <p>A law enforcement source confirmed to the Los Angeles Times that propofol, powerful sedative commonly used as a general anesthetic, had been found by investigators at Jackson's home.</p>

              <p>it saddens me to read articles posted by the starbloggers on stomp, criticising him and all even after his death. even if they weren't fans of him, they have no right to utter the words "good riddance" or call him names.</p>

              <p>its comforting to know that MJ is now in peace, safe from the ruthless hollywood paparazzi and the people who believe the child molestation allegations.</p>

              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>LOS ANGELES – More than 1.2 million people have now registered to get tickets for <span id="lw_1246780245_0" class="yshortcuts">Michael Jackson's memorial service</span> next week.</p>
              <p>Only 11,000 tickets will be given out for the Tuesday service at <span id="lw_1246780245_1" class="yshortcuts">Staples Center</span> in <span id="lw_1246780245_2" class="yshortcuts">downtown Los Angeles</span>. Another 6,500 tickets will be given away for the Nokia Theater overflow section next door.</p>
              <p>The only way to get tickets is to register for free at <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ap/ap_on_en_mu/storytext/us_michael_jackson/32595926/SIG=10q9uvcjb/*http://staplescenter.com"><span id="lw_1246780245_3" class="yshortcuts"><span style="color: #0058a6;">staplescenter.com</span></span></a>. After 6 p.m. Saturday, 8,750 names will be randomly selected to receive two tickets each.</p>
              <p>Notifications will go out on Sunday.</p>
              <p>City officials are preparing for massive crowds. Assistant Police Chief Earl Paysinger says anywhere from a quarter-million to 700,000 people may try to reach the arena, even though a wide area around Staples Center will be sealed off to those without tickets.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1246780245_4" class="yshortcuts">City Councilwoman Jan Perry</span> strongly urged people to stay home and watch the memorial on TV. The ceremony will not be shown on Staples' giant outdoor TV screen and there will be no funeral procession through the city.</p>
              <p>No details were given about the actual memorial events, which come as the nation's second-largest city struggles with a $530 million <span id="lw_1246780245_5" class="yshortcuts">budget deficit</span>. Perry said the cost of police protection for "extraordinary" events like the memorial is built into the Police Department's budget, but she still solicited help for "incremental costs."</p>
              <p>Last month, donations covered about $850,000 of the city's $1 million cost for the <span id="lw_1246780245_6" class="yshortcuts" style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Los Angeles Lakers' NBA championship</span> parade. Critics had blasted the idea of using city money when it is considering layoffs to close its budget gap.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson fans prepare for farewell service</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Police renewed appeals for
              Michael Jackson fans to stay away from the pop icon's memorial service
              after 1.6 million devotees scrambled for tickets to the event.</p>
              <p>Los Angeles Police Department assistant chief Jim McDonnell urged
              ticket-less fans seeking to pay tribute to Jackson at Tuesday's 10:00
              am service to watch the event on television.</p>
              <p>"Stay home -- stay somewhere with a television, with air conditioning, with a friend," McDonnell told reporters.</p>
              <p>The
              appeal came after 1.6 million people entered an online lottery hoping
              to be among 8,750 registrants to win tickets for the service at the
              Staples Center arena and a neighboring arena, where the event will be
              shown on giant screens.</p>
              <p>Fans from around the world have been
              arriving in Los Angeles since the service was announced and there had
              been fears of logistical chaos if hundreds of thousands of people took
              to the streets.</p>
              <p>McDonnell said that while he believed fans received the message, authorities would be able to cope with large crowds.</p>
              <p>"Los
              Angeles is used to big events," McDonnell said. Around 1,400 extra
              officers are expected to be deployed, according to law enforcement
              sources.</p>
              <p>Organizers AEG on Sunday began notifying the lucky few who successfully applied for tickets, which are all free.</p>
              <p>No details of what Tuesday's service will involve have been
              revealed, but organizers say the 90-minute event will be a celebration
              of the life of Jackson, who died on June 25 at age 50 of an apparent
              cardiac arrest.</p>
              <p>The organiser told the New York Daily News the service would likely feature performances from stars but would be restrained.</p>
              <p>"It will be a celebration of Michael's life (but) we're not approaching it as a TV show," Ken Ehrlich was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>"In
              the future, there may be a tribute to Michael Jackson. This is really a
              memorial service. It's not going to have all the bells and whistles. We
              want to keep it low-key.</p>
              <p>"People who are watching it, both live
              and on TV, can expect to see people who have played a role in his life,
              who will both be reminiscing about him and speaking to the impact he's
              made," he added.</p>
              <p>No details of where Jackson will be buried have been released.</p>
              <p>As
              preparations for Tuesday's memorial continued, investigators probing
              the circumstances of Jackson's mysterious death are reportedly looking
              at the role of five doctors who prescribed drugs to the star.</p>
              <p>US
              media, citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said investigators
              found the powerful sedative Propofol amongst a variety of prescription
              medications at Jackson's home.</p>
              <p>"Numerous bottles" of Diprivan --
              the brand name for Propofol -- were found at the star's home, an
              unidentified source told the Los Angeles Times.</p>
              <p>Propofol is
              commonly used in hospitals to induce unconsciousness in patients before
              major surgery. Healthcare experts say it should never be used at home
              and should only be administered by trained anesthesiologists.</p>
              <p>Los
              Angeles coroners have said a final cause of Jackson's death will not be
              revealed until exhaustive toxicology tests from his autopsy are
              completed.</p>
              <p>Associates of Jackson and his family have repeatedly
              accused unidentified medical professionals of acting as "enablers" by
              making prescription drugs readily available.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the legal
              wrangling over Jackson's estate gets underway on Monday when two men
              named as the executors of a 2002 will drawn up by Jackson appear in
              court for a probate hearing in Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>The hearing at the
              Los Angeles Superior Court comes after Jackson's 79-year-old mother
              Katherine was awarded temporary control of her son's assets last week
              before the will surfaced.</p>
