              <p><strong>Jackson set for final journey to Neverland: report  : </strong>AFP - <span>Thursday, July 2</span></p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Michael Jackson's body will make a poignant final journey to Neverland Ranch, reports said, amid fresh revelations about the tragic pop icon's agonizing dependence on powerful prescription medication.</p>
              <p>Citing unidentified sources, the celebrity news website TMZ.com said Tuesday the drug Propofol was found at Jackson's rented mansion following his death Thursday of cardiac arrest at the age of 50.</p>
              <p>"There is no conceivable way this drug can be properly prescribed for home use," a source told the website, which described as an "extremely dangerous and potent" substance only available to medical personnel.</p>
              <p>Earlier, a former nurse who cared for Jackson told CNN Tuesday the star pleaded with her to provide him with Diprivan -- the brand name for Propofol in the last months of his life.</p>
              <p>Cherilyn Lee, a health practitioner with more than 20 years experience, said she had refused his request for the drugs.</p>
              <p>Lee also revealed that a member of Jackson's staff sought the drug four days before the singer's death only to be rebuffed.</p>
              <p>"I told him this medication is not safe," Lee said. "He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.'"</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, CNN and TMZ.com said the Jackson family planned a public viewing on Friday -- which could draw a crush of fans to the isolated Neverland Ranch north of Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>A 30-car motorcade reportedly plans to escort the body on Thursday to the King of Pop's 1,050-hectare (2,600-acre) estate, a monument to Jackson's obsession with childhood that once included a fairground and a private zoo.</p>
              <p>A worldwide outpouring of tributes to the music legend continued with crowds gathering at New York's famous Apollo Theater for a celebration of the star's life.</p>
              <p>Friday's public viewing could be an indication that the Jackson family has permanent plans for Neverland.</p>
              <p>Santa Barbara County officials said Tuesday they had received no formal notification of a memorial but said departments were "preparing to accommodate a large event" if a request for a Neverland funeral was made.</p>
              <p>Some fans say the star should be buried at the ranch and want it to be transformed into a shrine similar to Elvis Presley's Graceland.</p>
              <p>Neverland was named after the fantasy island of Peter Pan, Jackson's inspiration who refused to grow up.</p>
              <p>But the estate fell into disrepair after becoming an alleged crime scene in Jackson's 2005 trial on child molestation charges. Jackson vacated the property following his acquittal and never lived there again.</p>
              <p>The estate was reportedly on the verge of foreclosure before Jackson's death as his extravagant lifestyle and mounting personal and legal problems took their toll on his finances.</p>
              <p>The long-term fate of Neverland has been one of the myriad legal issues arising from Jackson's sudden death.</p>
              <p>A judge on Monday gave Jackson's 79-year-old mother, Katherine, temporary control over his estate including Neverland and the rights to songs of the Beatles. She was also named temporary guardian of his three children.</p>
              <p>The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Jackson drafted a will in 2002 that divided his estate between his mother, his three children and one or more charities.</p>
              <p>Conspicuously absent was his father, Joe Jackson, who groomed his nine children into musical sensations but had an uneasy relationship with his son Michael.</p>
              <p>Lawyers for the Jackson family said Tuesday they had seen the will, which could be filed in court on Wednesday, according to reports.</p>
              <p>The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, reported that police detectives are seeking to identify and interview "multiple doctors" who treated Jackson in the years before his death.</p>
              <p>Attention has so far focused on the role of Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, who was with the star just before his death last Thursday.</p>
              <p>Lawyers for Murray and law enforcement sources have said he is not suspected of wrongdoing and has cooperated with the investigation.</p>
              <p>On Monday, coroner's office investigators removed several plastic bags of medication from Jackson's rented mansion in Holmby Hills, described as "additional medical evidence."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the organizers of a series of Jackson's planned comeback concerts in London revealed Tuesday that video footage of his rehearsals existed and could be released to the public.</p>
              <p>The president of promoters AEG Live, Randy Phillips, told Sky News television that video of the pop legend's performances would disprove rumors that he was incredibly frail before his death.</p>
              <p>"We may at some point release some footage of him in rehearsal that would totally refute that," he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackson family spokesman: Memorial plans under way</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES - A Jackson family spokesman says a public
              memorial for Michael Jackson is in the works, but it won't be held at
              the late pop star's Neverland Ranch.</p>
              <p>No further details are provided in the statement issued Wednesday by family spokesman Ken Sunshine.</p>
              <p>The
              public relations firm Sunshine, Sachs &amp; Associates has been
              retained by the family and says it will announce those plans shortly.</p>
              <p>THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.</p>
              <p>LOS
              ANGELES (AP) _ Michael Jackson's 7-year-old will was filed Wednesday in
              a Los Angeles court, giving his entire estate to a family trust while
              making his mother the guardian of his children and cutting out his
              former wife Debbie Rowe.</p>
              <p>Court documents estimated the current value of his estate at more than $500 million.</p>
              <p>It
              names his mother, Katherine Jackson, 79, as a beneficiary of the trust
              and the guardian of Jackson's children, who are also named as
              beneficiaries of the trust.</p>
              <p>It also names entertainer Diana Ross
              as a successor guardian for the children and their estates if something
              happens to Katherine Jackson.</p>
              <p>Ross introduced the Jackson 5 on
              the Ed Sullivan Show in the late 1960s and was instrumental in
              launching their career. She was a lifelong friend of Michael Jackson.</p>
              <p>Jackson's
              longtime lawyer John Branca and John McClain, a music executive and a
              family friend, are named in the will as co-executors.</p>
              <p>In a
              statement, Branca and McClain said: "The most important element of
              Michael's will is his unwavering desire that his mother, Katherine,
              become the legal guardian for his three children. As we work to carry
              out Michael's instructions to safeguard both the future of his children
              as well as the remarkable legacy he left us as an artist we ask that
              all matters involving his estate be handled with the dignity and the
              respect that Michael and his family deserve."</p>
              <p>The executors moved
              quickly to take control of all of Michael Jackson's property, going to
              court Wednesday to challenge a previous ruling by the judge that gave
              Katherine Jackson control of 2,000 items from Neverland.</p>
              <p>Superior
              Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said Katherine Jackson will retain
              authority over the items until another hearing set for Monday.</p>
              <p>Beckloff urged attorneys from both sides to try to reach a compromise soon.</p>
              <p>"I would like the family to sit down try to make this work that we don't have a difficult time in court," the judge said.</p>
              <p>An
              effort to bury Michael Jackson at Neverland Ranch fizzled, and it
              appears more likely a funeral and burial will take place in Los
              Angeles, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated
              Press. The family has the final say.</p>
              <p>Authorities in Santa Barbara
              County had been preparing for tens of thousands of fans to descend on
              the 2,500-acre ranch after media reports said a public viewing would
              take place later this week.</p>
              <p>But the person, who is not authorized
              to speak for the family and requested anonymity, said nothing was
              planned for Neverland, at least through Friday.</p>
              <p>A private memorial service for family and friends could take place at the ranch, most likely after the funeral.</p>
              <p>"The
              family is aware a Neverland burial is not possible. They are expected
              to make decisions about whatever funeral and memorial service" will
              take place, the person said.</p>
              <p>Heavy construction equipment and
              workers were seen passing through the wrought-iron gates of Neverland
              on Tuesday. The property is about 120 miles northwest of Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>At
              once a symbol of Jackson's success and excesses, Neverland _ nestled in
              the hills of Santa Barbara County's wine country _ became the site of a
              makeshift memorial after his death Thursday.</p>
              <p>The will, dated July
              7, 2002, gives the entire estate to the Michael Jackson Family Trust.
              Details of the trust will not be made public.</p>
              <p>California's
              attorney general, who oversees charitable donations from estates, is
              also named as a person who must be notified. It suggests some of the
              trust's proceeds could go to charity, although which ones might benefit
              was not clear.</p>
              <p>The documents said Jackson's estate consisted
              almost entirely of "non-cash, non-liquid assets, including primarily an
              interest in a catalog of music royalty rights which is currently being
              administered by Sony ATV, and the interests of various entities."</p>
              <p>One
              of Jackson's most lucrative assets is his stake in the massive Sony-ATV
              Music Publishing Catalog, which includes music by the Beatles, Bob
              Dylan, Neil Diamond, Lady Gaga and the Jonas Brothers, and is estimated
              to be worth as much as $2 billion. The five-page will is signed by
              Jackson, and each paragraph includes Jackson's scrawling initials.</p>
              <p>Jackson,
              who died June 25 at age 50, left behind three children: son Michael
              Joseph Jr., known as Prince Michael, 12; daughter Paris Michael
              Katherine, 11; and son Prince Michael II, 7. Rowe was the mother of the
              two oldest children; the youngest was born to a surrogate mother, who
              has never been identified.</p>
              <p>Katherine Jackson was granted
              temporary guardianship Monday of Jackson's three children. A judge held
              off on requests to control the children's estates.</p>
              <p>Rowe, who was
              married to Jackson in 1996 and filed for divorce three years later,
              surrendered her parental rights. An appeals court later found that was
              done in error, and Rowe and Jackson entered an out-of-court settlement
              in 2006.</p>
              <p>Neither Rowe nor her attorneys have indicated whether she intends to seek custody of the two oldest children.</p>
              <p>Funeral plans have not yet been announced.</p>
              <p>Members
              of Jackson's family met Tuesday with officials from the Los Angeles
              police and California Highway Patrol about funeral services. But
              "details are still pending," according to Fran Clader, a spokeswoman
              for the patrol. The patrol would need to be consulted if the body was
              moved from Los Angeles to Neverland.</p>
              <p>It was unclear whether
              Jackson could be legally buried at the ranch. The state's health and
              safety code makes interring any uncremated remains outside of a
              cemetery a misdemeanor. Cremated remains can be kept in a home or
              private mausoleum outside a cemetery.</p>
              <p>It was not possible to rule
              out that Jackson's body might return to the ranch, either for the
              private service or a burial sometime in the future, if the family can
              get the go-ahead from state and local officials.</p>
