              <p><strong>Court delays ruling on payout to ex-poly student with brain damage</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : A former polytechnic student who suffered brain 
              damage in a road accident in 2004 has yet to know how much more money 
              she would be entitled to.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is because the 
              Court of Appeal needs more time before coming to a decision as it said 
              its ruling would have a significant impact on future cases involving 
              payouts over loss of future earnings.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However, she was still awarded S$75,000 on Friday as an initial payment.<br><br>In
               2004, then 17-year-old Teo Ai Ling suffered brain damage and other 
              physical disabilities, including being blinded in one eye, after being 
              hit by a motorcycle.<br><br>The former Ngee Ann Polytechnic student was later awarded S$492,000 by the High Court in February for loss of future earnings.<br><br>Judicial
               Commissioner Steven Chong, who delivered the earlier High Court 
              judgement, had said there was "no hard-and-fast rule that students with 
              no employment at the time of the accident" could not claim for loss of 
              future earnings.<br><br>In court on Friday, the central issue was 
              whether Ms Teo should be awarded a lump sum, as is the current practice,
               or should she be awarded provisional damages.<br><br>This means that 
              she would be awarded part of the money first, then if her condition 
              deteriorates years later, she could seek further claims. But it would 
              still have to come before the court to determine if this was agreeable.<br><br>Justice
               Chao Hick Tin - one of the three judges present - decided to reserve 
              judgement to allow time for further discussion as the decision would 
              have a bearing on similar cases.<br><br>Defence lawyer Madan Assomull, 
              who represents the insurance company, was in favour of awarding Ms Teo 
              provisional damages as this would allow her to "come back to get another
               bite of the cherry".<br><br>Ms Teo's lawyer, Mr Tang Gee Ni, however 
              argued for damages to be paid out in full as his client's medical 
              condition had stabilised. <br><br>He said Ms Teo did not obtain her 
              diploma in business studies due to her condition and now works as a data
               entry officer. She also had to shelve plans to enter the food business.<br><br>Justice
               V K Rajah called Ms Teo a "remarkable young lady" and said it could be 
              in her interest to seek provisional damages, where she could return at a
               later date to assess further claims.<br><br>- TODAY/al</span></span></p>
