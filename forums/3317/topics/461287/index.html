              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the government 
              will continue to help seniors age gracefully and with peace of mind.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Joining some 1,200 
              seniors in his Teck Ghee division's Active Ageing night, Mr Lee said 
              staying active is the best way to keep healthy, both physically and 
              mentally.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said the Teck 
              Ghee Active Ageing night is part of the National Wellness programme, 
              started two years ago, to keep elderly Singaporeans active through 
              various activities.<br><br>Mr Lee said the response has been very good, with nearly 200,000 seniors taking part in the programme.<br><br>Within the Teck Ghee division alone, almost 5,000 seniors are involved.<br><br>And Mr Lee's advice to them is to take advantage of all government schemes to stay healthy.<br><br>He
               said: "We have the Community Health Assist scheme so if you need to see
               a GP or you need to see a dentist, you can go to a GP or a dentist and 
              you can get your treatment subsidised, you don't have to go to a 
              polyclinic. <br><br>"We have the Seniors' Mobility Fund to help pay for 
              equipment so it can help you to get around whether it's a ramp, whether 
              it's a wheelchair, whether it's a special walking stick, which gives you
               support and this evening we have 14 residents who are receiving help 
              from the Seniors' Activity Fund and will be receiving wheelchairs and 
              other walking aid devices.<br><br>"If you are not sure whom to help, 
              then please call, come to see us at the grassroots, we will help you, or
               come to my MPS, or come to the Agency for Integrated Care which is done
               by the Ministry of Health and we have many programmes to support our 
              seniors. <br><br>"So don't worry, take care of yourself, eat healthily, 
              exercise, and you'll be able to enjoy yourself and grow old well in Ang 
              Mo Kio and I think all over Singapore too."<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

Traffic congestion, cannot solve. High housing prices, cannot solve, inflation, cannot solve. Can only solve future problems? Very tekong. By that time, u not around. N no need to be responsible. Yr job is not to solve current issues? Oh, sry. I dun know.

              <p>LHL is soo out of touch. And enough of the pity giving to act so generous.</p>
              <p>when he go visits other first world countries on tax payers dime, what exactly did he learn with regards to senior living and retirement planning ? Obviously NOTHING. He go there to walk walk, but not much see see.</p>
              <p>give our seniors walking aid so they can walk themselves , cannot walk then give them wheel chairs to push themselves around ? What a coffee pantry joke. </p>
              <p>Tell LHL to sit himself in a wheelchair for one week... No one to push him around, see how far he can go. The ridiculous amount of stairs and ramps to no where will keep him stranded in his own home.</p>
              <p>singapore is not wheels friendly. </p>
              <p>And hello... There's such a thing call electric scooters for the old people ...didn't he see those zipping around Disney World during his US visit recently  </p>
