However, to the surprise of the trailer driver, he heard faint banging noises coming from inside.<br><br>When the container was opened, the stench from the decomposing body was so strong that dock workers had to move away from it.<br><br>The deceased man was in his 40s, and was pronounced dead by paramedics at about 8:50pm, said a police spokesman.<br><br>Chinese evening paper Lianhe Wanbao reported that, from the state of decomposition, he could have been dead for more than four days.<br><br>There was nothing else in the container apart from the two men.<br><br>The other man, who is in his 20s, was taken to Alexandra Hospital and is assisting police with investigations.</p></div>
