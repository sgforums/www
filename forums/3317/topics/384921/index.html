              <p><strong>N level results out </strong></p>
              <p>The 'N' level results are out! <br> <br> And some 71 percent of Normal Academic students have done well enough to be promoted to Secondary 5 Normal Academic. <br> <br> This year's cohort of students is the first batch of Normal Academic
              students to come under a revised promotion criteria for progression to
              Sec 5. <br> <br> Previously, students had to obtain an aggregate not exceeding 10 points
              for their best three subjects and a Grade 5 or better in English to be
              promoted to Secondary 5 Normal Academic. <br> <br> But now, they have to obtain an aggregate not exceeding 19 points in
              English, Mathematics and their best three subjects, and a Grade 5 or
              better for both English and Mathematics to be promoted. <br> <br> The promotion criteria was revised to align it more closely with the admission requirements to the polytechnics.<br>  <br> MOE says that despite the revised criteria, the number of students
              eligible for promotion to Secondary 5 Normal Academic are comparable to
              previous years. <br> <br> This year's top students scoring an aggregate of 6 each are: <br> <br> Pheeraphat Chew from Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road); Yuhanis Kadis
              from Bedok Green Secondary; and Hazel Cheok from Paya Lebar Methodist
              Girls' School. <br> <br> As for the Normal Technical course, the top students are: <br> <br> Lee Li Yi from Bendemeer Secondary; Cheryl Chong from Paya Lebar
              Methodist Girls' School; and Goh Jia Hui from Yishun Town Secondary. <br> <br> They've each scored 6 As.<strong><em> <br> <br> </em></strong>Almost all the students from the Normal (Academic) course were awarded the N-level certificate this year. <br> <br> As for the Normal (Technical) course, some 97 percent were awarded the certificate. <br> <br> This certificate is awarded to students who obtain a pass grade of Grade D or better in at least one subject.<br> <br> The students received their results at 2.30pm today</p>
