              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : It is all hands on deck for staff at Singapore's two
               integrated resorts to handle the thousands of visitors over the Lunar 
              New Year holiday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Resorts World 
              Sentosa has come up with a special lump sum payment for staff, over and 
              above the overtime pay they will get for putting in extra hours during 
              this festive period.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>MediaCorp understands that more than 3,000 staff stand to benefit from this one-off payment.<br><br>There is more to the two integrated resorts at Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa than just the casinos.<br><br>Marina
               Bay Sands said the first day of the Lunar New year saw more than 
              235,000 visitors passing through the different attractions of the 
              sprawling complex, including the shopping mall and the food and beverage
               outlets.<br><br>A spokesman for Marina Bay Sands added that The Shoppes
               at Marina Bay Sands was the one of the few retail destinations that 
              opened throughout the Lunar New Year. <br><br>He added that the grand 
              dining options at celebrity chef restaurants and fine-dining Chinese 
              restaurants boasting traditional fare over the festive period also made 
              Marina Bay Sands a destination of choice.<br><br>The Sands SkyPark, 200 
              meters above ground, with breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline 
              and the fireworks displays over the weekend, was another popular venue 
              for visitors from Singapore and around the world.<br><br>Meanwhile, Resorts World Sentosa said that nearly 150,000 people have visited its attractions over the Lunar New Year holidays.<br><br>At
               Resorts World Sentosa, every effort has been made to encourage as many 
              staff as possible to return during the long Lunar New Year holidays, to 
              ensure that all operations proceed smoothly. <br><br>One such programme 
              is called the X'tras Programme where corporate staff, nearly 500 of 
              them, have volunteered to come back and ensure that all operations 
              proceed with clockwork precision.<br><br>Resorts World Sentosa said 
              employees have been highly motivated by the large crowds and they have 
              all turned up on time to ensure that the various outlets function 
              effectively.<br><br>Last year's experience in handling the crowds has also been useful, especially in planning for the dietary needs of visitors.<br><br>Roger
               Linehard, senior vice president for food &amp; beverage and rooms at 
              Resorts World Sentosa, said : "We planned over the last two months based
               on the history we had when we opened last year. Second, we knew we are 
              going to be full from the hotels, 100 per cent occupancy. We know that 
              we run the Universal Studios Singapore (USS) full and the casinos as 
              well, so we have split up the food and beverage component into three 
              components - the casino component, the USS component and the hotel 
              component.<br><br>"The hotels have been very successful. We do nearly 
              500 breakfast in every restaurant. We do one to one and a half turn for 
              lunch and at least two turns for dinner in our Chinese restaurant up to 
              three and a half turns. And the Universal Studios - with the amount of 
              crowds that we have now - we will do at least 20,000 meals, just in 
              Universal Studios alone."<br><br>Separately, the casinos at both the integrated resorts saw bigger crowds turning up on the second day of the Lunar New Year.<br><br>Resorts World Sentosa believes the eateries near its casino would have catered to at least 25,000 visitors on Friday.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
