              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has admitted the 
              government did not have 20/20 foresight, resulting in problems with 
              inadequate infrastructure in the country.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking at the "Singapore Perspectives" conference on governance organised by the Institute of Policy Studies on Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Acknowledging the 
              problems of insufficient housing and inefficient transportation network,
               Mr Lee pointed out that the government was blind-sided by the outcome 
              of some international events.<br><br>He elaborated that in 2000 and 
              2001, the 9/11 terrorism attack on the United States plunged countries 
              into recession. Singapore dealt with a slow economy with minimum 
              population growth and local housing prices went down.<br><br>But by 2005 and 2006, Mr Lee said the mood changed and the economy started picking up.<br><br>So,
               he said, the government did what it thought would have been appropriate
               then. It decided to make up for lost time by growing the population and
               boosting the economy.<br><br>He acknowledged that infrastructure like housing and transport didn't keep up with that growth.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said: "I decided that we should try and make up for lost time 
              because you want the economy to grow. You want Singapore to make 
              progress and you don't know how long the sun is going to shine. As it 
              turned out, the sun remained shining for longer than we expected. So the
               population grew faster than we expected, our infrastructure didn't keep
               up.<br><br>"Should we have given ourselves more buffer and said let's 
              build and be ready? I think in retrospect, clearly we could have done 
              more. Could we have predicted that we would have five years where the 
              economy would grow brilliantly and our population would increase so 
              rapidly? I don't think we could easily have said that.  <br><br>"Should 
              we then have said, 'I didn't plan for this infrastructure, let's tell 
              the businesses to go away and let's forget about the growth, we don't 
              need the IRs, we don't need these extra jobs, we just stay where we 
              were'. I think that would be very risky. So we went ahead.<br><br>"The 
              strains showed up. It's quite instructive how they showed up. They 
              didn't show up gradually, progressively but quite suddenly. When the 
              global financial crisis came at the end of the decade, 2007/2008, we 
              expected to go for a very deep dive. <br><br>"In fact in one quarter, we
               had minus 10 percent growth. Nobody talked about house prices, there 
              was no shortage. HDB - we watched the market every day, the resale 
              market was dead but we did the right thing with our Jobs Credit and 
              other measures. We avoided a bullet, the world economy recovered faster 
              than expected.<br><br>"In the middle of 2009, the wind changed...those 
              of you in business, you would remember that in the course of two weeks, 
              during one or two private property launches, somehow the wind changed. 
              It's like the spring breeze touched your face and the market was off. By
               August, we were thinking of measures to cool things down and we've been
               trying to cool things down ever since. <br><br>"So we lacked that 20/20
               foresight. Next time, we will try to do better, certainly to have a 
              bigger buffer and not to cut things so fine. But I think it's very 
              difficult to know, 10 years from now, how many you will need. <br><br>"Even
               if you know how many persons there will be in Singapore, you can't say 
              how many houses they will need. Will they buy it? Or will they say, 'oh,
               I'm not certain because the economy is not looking good or the politics
               are not certain, well, I'll hold off'? But when the market goes up, it 
              goes up with a vengeance and we've paid the political price, we learn 
              from it."  <br><br>In the 90-minute question and answer session, Prime 
              Minister Lee also tackled a number of issues which included whether the 
              wide-ranging social nets in Singapore would encourage citizens to become
               more dependent and if Singapore needs more space for discussion.<br><br>Mr
               Lee is of the view that the government needs to do more but he wants 
              the government to be helping from behind the scenes, as opposed to 
              Singaporeans expecting the government to jump in all the time.<br><br>On
               why there is still a need to moderate social space involving social 
              media, for example, Mr Lee said the online community in particular is 
              not moderating itself.<br><br>Extreme views are put out and responses and disapprovals are also extreme. So  this cannot be left to itself.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said: "We don't believe the community in the social space, 
              especially online, moderates itself. It doesn't happen anywhere in the 
              world. <br><br>"You have views going to extremes and when people respond
               to their views, they may respond in an extreme way, and when people 
              decide to disapprove of something which was inappropriate, the 
              disapproval can also happen in an extreme way. <br><br>"It's in the 
              nature of the medium, the way the interactions work and that's the 
              reason why we think it cannot be completely left by itself."<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>the white paper all the jazz also no use. say what results will only show 20 years later but still have to relyon labor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dont they get it. we not asking for foreign labor to scrap. what we ask is to have a hand in the final reiew after companies submit their request for foreign labor approval. some companies their HR and bosses is anyhow choose 1. if gahmen have a final say and audit on that, we wont have any tom dick harry cuming ehre to crowd our places and at the same tiome dont add to productivity at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>play us for a ride just in case 20 yrs is a long time. we urge people to decide properly during GES or any BEs and the curren trend of lettying good oppositions a chance to run TCs and mess in prliament is still a safe gurad.</p>

              <p>my stand on foreign labor should be known to most who frequent this forum now. pinoy cheenas all should abit by one standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we need foreign talent, but we do not yearn for them. they should be mainatain at a certain small efficient percentage against our local population and worforce. they should be mainatain at a small efficient percentage that will not stress and burden our aging popualtion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>newborn true blu sgreans babies should be the only and feasible solutions to our aging popualtion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if we do that, all these fast rash, forced infusion of foreign 'cultures' will slowly erode and stay at a small efficient healthy percentage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you cannot force such a thing into our society and ask us to eccept them in just decades. it takes centuries, and when the time is ripe it will still only be and should be our minority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>cheena and pinoy culture should not be our main dish, it shallnot oversahdow us. all these cultures will only be desert or side dishes.</p>
