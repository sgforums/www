              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">SYDNEY — Then-Australian leader<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Kevin Rudd told the United States it should be prepared to use force against China "if everything goes wrong"</span></span></strong>, a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks reveals.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">In wide-ranging talks with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Rudd also described Chinese leaders as "paranoid" about Taiwan and Tibet, and said that<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> his push for a new Asia-Pacific body was designed to contain Chinese influence.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The State Department cable detailing a March 2009 conversation over lunch between Rudd, who was then prime minister, and Clinton in Washington states that the Australian leader described himself <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">a "brutal realist on China".</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">It said Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking former diplomat who was once posted to Beijing, argued for "multilateral engagement with bilateral vigour" in China.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">He called for "integrating China effectively into the international community and allowing it to demonstrate greater responsibility, all while also preparing to deploy force if everything goes wrong", the cable states.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Rudd, now Australia's foreign minister, has not commented on the cable.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But Attorney-General Robert McClelland said the leak would not affect growing ties with China, which has become Australia's largest trading partner as it imports natural resources to feed its booming economy.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"We have a very strong relationship with China ... and that arrangement will continue," McClelland told journalists.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">There was no immediate response from Beijing.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Australia has a robust relationship with China, Rudd said Monday, and would not contact Beijing over the cable.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Meanwhile, WikiLeaks has also released a secret list of key infrastructure sites around the world whose loss or attack by terrorists, according to the State Department, could "critically impact" US security.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The February 2009 cable from the State Department requested overseas US missions to list infrastructure and key resources around the globe "whose loss could critically impact the public health, economic security and/or national and homeland security of the United States".</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">It lists undersea cables, key communications, ports, mineral resources and firms of strategic importance in countries ranging from Austria to New Zealand.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">It said Washington wanted China to take greater responsibility in global economics, build a better social safety net for its citizens, and a better regulatory framework for the goods it manufactures.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But Clinton also questioned the challenges arising from Beijing's growing economic clout, asking: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"How do you deal toughly with your banker?" China is the single biggest holder of US Treasury debt.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Rudd reviewed Chinese leaders for Clinton, saying<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">President Hu Jintao "is no (predecessor) Jiang Zemin" and opining that Hu's likely successor Xi Jinping could rise above his colleagues, thanks in part to his family's military connections.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">On Taiwan, Rudd said the feelings of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chinese leaders were "sub-rational and deeply emotional" while hardline policies on Tibet were designed to send messages to other ethnic minorities.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Rudd told Clinton he had urged China to agree to a "small 'a' autonomy" deal with the Dalai Lama on Tibet but that he saw little prospect of this idea succeeding.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rudd also revealed that the thinking behind his ambitious "Asia-Pacific Community" was mostly to ensure Chinese dominance in the region did not result in "an Asia without the United States".</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Pakistan and Afghanistan were also discussed at the lunch, according to the memo, one of some 250,000 US cables being released by the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Rudd said Australia would be prepared to offer special operations and counterinsurgency help to Pakistan should it be requested, noting that success in war-torn Afghanistan would unravel if Pakistan fell apart.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The Australian government has previously condemned the release of all the cables and said it would support any US law enforcement moves against WikiLeaks, founded by Australian-born hacker Julian Assange.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Independent lawmaker Andrew Wilkie, whose support is critical to the government's narrow majority in parliament, said it was likely Rudd was posturing.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Following the advice in the memo was an "inconceivable notion", said Wilkie, a former intelligence analyst turned Iraq war whistleblower.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 19.1667px;"> In 2008 and 2009, the US embassy issued an extraordinary series of scathing assessments of Rudd’s performance, centring on his attitude to China. While the full story is yet to come out, the WSWS noted in the aftermath of the coup that “Washington’s increasingly aggressive stance towards Beijing was undoubtedly a major factor in the recent political upheavals in Canberra.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 19.1667px;">The cables also shed light on the role being played by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The prime beneficiary of the coup against Rudd, Gillard is functioning as nothing but a mouthpiece for the Obama administration. Lining up with right-wing forces in the US that have vilified WikiLeaks’ editor Julian Assange, and called for his “assassination”, the Australian prime minister has joined the fray by declaring “illegal”, without a shred of evidence, the publication of the documents and by supporting US threats to prosecute Assange.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;">Excerpts from the latest cables have been published today by the <em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Sydney Morning Herald</em> and <em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Age</em> newspapers. They cover a two-year period in which the US was becoming increasingly preoccupied with countering the rise of China as a rival world power. Not yet published are cables from 2010, in the period immediately leading up to Rudd’s ousting. But what has so far been revealed makes clear that as far as Washington was concerned, the Australian government’s primary responsibility was to function as an obedient junior partner in the anti-China containment strategy, providing military and diplomatic support as demanded. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Much of the US embassy’s anger with Rudd derived from his various foreign policy initiatives that were not first devised in Washington, or at least vetted by American officials.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;">The leaked cables describe a series of “foreign policy mistakes”. One is a December 2008 review of Rudd’s first year in office, authored by US ambassador to Australia, Robert McCallum. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The diplomat declared that Rudd’s diplomatic “missteps” were due to his tendency to make “snap announcements without consulting other countries or within the Australian government”.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;">The ambassador went on to point out that the Labor government’s “significant blunders” began on February 5, 2008, when then foreign minister Stephen Smith (now defence minister) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">announced that Australia would not support further strategic “Quadrilateral” dialogue between Australia, the US, Japan and India.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;">The Quad had first met in May 2007 and held joint naval exercises, together with Singapore, in the Bay of Bengal in September 2007. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unsurprisingly, Beijing was hostile to the four-nation alliance that was obviously geared towards limiting Chinese hegemony in East Asia. The Chinese government labelled the Quad an “Asian NATO”.</span></span></strong> Stephen Smith’s announcement that Australia was withdrawing from the group was issued at a joint press conference with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi. Smith openly referred to China’s concerns with the four-party alliance, but claimed that “the United States has indicated a similar disposition in recent weeks [i.e., not to continue the Quad] and I think that’s been welcomed by all concerned”.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;">The US ambassador had a very different understanding. The leaked cable states that the Labor government’s announcement was made “without advance consultation” with Washington.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;">The document illustrates that just 10 weeks after the Labor Party was elected to office, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Washington had significant doubts over whether Rudd could be regarded as a dependable ally in its drive to contain China’s challenge to US dominance of the Pacific region.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>

The American ambassador privately derided the initiative, saying it was launched “without advance consultation with either other countries (including South-East Asian nations, leading Singaporean officials to label the idea dead on arrival) or within the Australian government (including with his proposed special envoy to promote the concept, veteran diplomat Richard Woolcott)”.</p>

The Australian prime minister also urged the use of “force” in the event that “everything goes wrong”. The latest WikiLeaks’ material indicates that well before this discussion there was considerable scepticism within the State Department about Rudd’s stance on China.</p>

This initiative, the US diplomat wrote, was “rolled out … during a photo-op heavy trip to Japan … His Japanese hosts were given insufficient advance notice and refused a request for a joint announcement”. McCallum noted that Rudd did not consult any of the nuclear-armed states on the UN Security Council, and that Russia had lodged a formal protest. One of Rudd’s staffers had provided the US embassy with a few hours’ advance notice of the announcement, “but without details”.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>

The diplomatic agent concluded that Rudd’s “haphazard, overly secretive decision-making process” would continue to generate foreign policy problems.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>

As prime minister, Rudd had resisted US government and military suggestions that more Australian forces be deployed to Central Asia. Washington’s response to this may well be detailed in further leaked cables, yet to be made public.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>

One of the most powerful American military chiefs, head of the US Pacific Command Admiral Bob Willard, is now touring the country to identify defence bases where American forces will be stationed. These bases, effectively new joint US-Australia facilities, will no doubt play a key role in any American confrontation with China.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>

Beazley opposed the Howard government’s suggestion that Australia could stay out of a US-China war triggered by Taiwan. “In the event of a war between the United States and China, Australia would have absolutely no alternative but to line up militarily beside the US,” the Labor leader declared. “Otherwise the alliance would be effectively dead and buried, something that Australia could never afford to see happen.”</span></span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em; padding: 0px;"> </p>

The Australian Attorney-General is doing everything he can to help a US investigation clearly directed at framing Australian citizens and shipping them to the US... The Gillard government is trying to shoot the messenger because it doesn’t want the truth revealed, including information about its own diplomatic and political dealings.”</p>
