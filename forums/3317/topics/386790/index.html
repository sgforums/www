              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Familiar franchise brands are slowly re-entering the Singapore market, years after pulling out. </span></p>
              <p><span>American casual dining is making a comeback in Singapore. TGI
              Friday's has returned after it closed up shop during the Asian
              Financial Crisis in 1997, along with several other international
              franchise brands in the F&amp;B and retail sectors.
              <br> <br>Andrew Reddy, managing director, Chaswood Resources, said: "There
              was an unknown factor during the financial crisis. It was new to every
              businessman in this part of the world. However this crisis made most
              governments in Asia and especially in Singapore, prepare the people
              well and they have prepared themselves well."
              <br> <br>But the Malaysia-based operator said Asia is a fast-growing market
              and it's hoping its success in Malaysia and other regional countries
              will be repeated in Singapore. <br> <br> Over the years, Singapore has become a more cosmopolitan city with more
              Singaporeans increasingly becoming exposed to different cultures and
              foods from around the world. And that's why some franchise operators
              said now is the time to make a re-entry into the Singapore market.
              <br> <br> Burger joint Wendy's is another American outlet that's back in town.
              <br> <br> The franchise is owned by Kopitiam and opened at Lau Pa Sat Market in mid-December.
              <br> <br> 90 pe rcent of the menu is the same as can be found in the US.
              <br> <br> But there have been a few adjustments to suit Asian tastebuds.
              <br> <br>Jeffrey Lim, director, Kopitiam Management, said: "There is some
              tweaking in terms of the shrimp sandwich because the shrimp sandwich is
              something we brought in from the Malaysian franchise and that has been
              tweaked according to the tastebuds of Singaporeans."
              <br> <br> The company is planning to open a second Wendy's at Jurong Point by March 2010.
              <br> <br> Both outlets will be converted to 24 hour operations while TGIF is hoping to have at least three outlets in Singapore by 2012.
              <br> <br>The franchise operator of Dunkin Donuts, another brand making a
              re-entry into the Singapore market, has plans to open another 20
              outlets within the next 3-5 years.
              <br> <br> Another Malaysian-based franchise operator has reopened a new Dominos Pizza with more outlets slated for launch soon.
              <br> <br> The two operators are hoping the launch of the two integrated resorts will help boost their business. </span></p>
