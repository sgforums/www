              <p><span>SINGAPORE : In weeks to come, community clubs will be handling one
               of their most expensive events, the National Day dinners. </span></p>
              <p><span> At some community centres (CCs), these are large-scaled events that draw
               about 2,000 residents. </span></p>
              <p><span> According to some Members of Parliamant (MPs), the costs run up to a 
              five-figure sum. </span></p>
              <p><span> However, they are quick to add that much of the cost is offset by the 
              tickets residents buy to attend the sit-down dinner. </span></p>
              <p><span> While Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew was reported in The Straits Times to 
              have said earlier this month that CCs spent "so much money" to put up a 
              tent - money he would not have spent - MPs whom MediaCorp spoke to 
              shared the ways CCs managed their expenditure and what they spend on 
              when holding community events. </span></p>
              <p><span> South West District Mayor Amy Khor said community functions at the two 
              CCs in her district cost from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, 
              but would exceed $10,000 for very large scale events like the New Year 
              countdown or National Day dinner. </span></p>
              <p><span> A Bursary presentation for 300 participants, for example, could cost 
              about $1,800 to hire chairs and photography, as well as provide light 
              refreshments. </span></p>
              <p><span> But dinners cost more as they need performances and better sound system,
               for instance. </span></p>
              <p><span> Dinners are the main expense, agreed North West District Mayor Teo Ho 
              Pin. </span></p>
              <p><span> At Bukit Panjng CC, which holds up to 50 events annually, a Chinese New 
              Year dinner has about 60 tables. </span></p>
              <p><span> A 50-table dinner could cost under $15,000, with each table costing 
              about $200 and the remaining expenses going to peripherals such as 
              marketing and entertainment. </span></p>
              <p><span> Residents buy tickets for about $20, said Dr Teo. </span></p>
              <p><span> But for the National Day dinner, which requires nearly 200 tables, 
              tentage - which costs under $10,000 - is needed as the CC is too small. </span></p>
              <p><span> While he did not have figures on annual spending on events, Dr Teo said 
              the CC has "many new events" and participation increases by 10 to 20 per
               cent annually. </span></p>
              <p><span>For example, more residents attending the Hari Raya celebrations 
              have also expanded the scale of the celebrations from a buffet to a 
              50-table dinner.
              <br> <br> While the proportion of spending on events, compared to other expenses 
              have remained the same over the years in Dr Khor's CCs. 
              <br> <br> In "real dollar terms", Dr Khor said spending has increased because her 
              CCs are organising more larger-scale activities not only for bigger 
              crowds, but also a "more sophisticated and affluent population". 
              <br> <br> These events include countdowns and family days. 
              <br> <br> "We have organised more activities to promote integration of new 
              citizens and dialogue sessions with residents to get feedback," she 
              added.
              <br> <br> Other than dinners, CCs also chalk up costs when they provide drinks, 
              goodie bags, but these are "not significant costs", said MP Hri Kumar 
              for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.
              <br> <br> According to the People's Association (PA) 2008/09 annual report, 6,000 
              new immigrants participated in at least one grassroot activity in 2008, 
              compared to 3,000 the year before.
              <br> <br> The Community Development Councils, in collaboration with partners, 
              organised and funded about 1,300 programmes and activities in 2008, 
              compared to 940 in 2007.
              <br> <br> This attracted some 1 million residents in 2008, compared to 918,000 in 
              2007.
              <br> <br> However, MPs also stressed the various ways they manage costs.
              <br> <br> One obvious way would be getting sponsors for the tentage and lucky draw
               prizes.
              <br> <br> "It is rare to have paid performances," said MP Hri Kumar, adding that 
              for paid performances, a lower fee is often negotiated.
              <br> <br> And for dinners, including the National Day dinners, "we try to get 
              decent food, decent performances but always on a negotiated basis so 
              that costs are not high," he said.
              <br> <br> The CC also tries to organise activities indoors, instead of renting 
              tentage. 
              <br> <br> "But we always have to balance the attractiveness of the programme and 
              cost of organising it," Dr Khor added. 
              <br> <br> Dr Khor and Dr Teo noted that CCs try to maximise the use of tentage by 
              sharing it with other groups or organising more than one community event
               over the weekend.
              <br> <br> When contacted, the PA said: "The Grassroots Organisations organise a 
              wide variety of activities/programmes for residents ... Our grassroots 
              leaders (GRL) are always mindful of how much they spend on their 
              programmes, keeping costs as low as possible."
              <br> <br> "Most grassroots events are self-funded as GRLs raise money to run their
               programmes," added PA.
              <br> <br> Last year, PA spent $18,398 in subsidies and contributions, including 
              those to CCs, compared to $25,920 in 2008.
              <br> <br> It spent $55,958 on activities and projects last year, compared to 
              $52,777 in 2008. </span></p>
