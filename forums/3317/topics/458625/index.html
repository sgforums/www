              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said 
              that the country will stick to its policy of encouraging traditional 
              families.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He made this point at a television forum hosted by Channel NewsAsia to discuss the country's future on Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The forum, called "A
               Conversation With PM Lee", also involved Education Minister Heng Swee 
              Keat, and Members of Parliament Indranee Rajah and Dr Intan Azura 
              Mokhtar.<br><br>The Singaporeans at the forum were a diverse mix - entrepreneurs, students, housewives and even new citizens.<br><br>The
               forum was not so much about getting immediate answers from the panel, 
              but rather it was a chance to air their views and aspirations about 
              Singapore, in a no-holds barred discussion.<br><br>One of those at the 
              forum, fashion designer Jo Soh, said: "If I can't find a husband that I 
              want to marry, why can't I have a child as a single woman? Or why can't 
              de-facto couples be recognised? Why can't de-facto couples have children
               and still have the same access to subsidies and rights?"<br><br>It was a question that prompted PM Lee to ask for a straw poll on the issue -  should non-married couples have children?<br><br>The vote was split almost equal - 46 per cent voted "yes" and 54 per cent said "no".<br><br>While
               it took Mr Lee by surprise, he underlined the fact that Singapore 
              society has benefited from sticking to a policy of encouraging 
              traditional families.<br><br>He said: "There have been some significant 
              advantages to our society to aim for that norm because a kid brought up 
              by a single mother or single father, I think, is at a disadvantaged in 
              many ways, (in terms of) resources, guidance, stability of the family 
              background.<br><br>"We are not static but society is evolving and I 
              think the norms will evolve. We can't prevent it from changing but we 
              also don't want it to just go wherever the latest fashion is."<br><br>The panel also stressed though that it was not about penalising single parents.<br><br>MP
               for Tanjong Pagar GRC Indranee Rajah, said: "There really is nothing 
              wrong about being a single parent or having diversity. The challenge in 
              Singapore is we have different people with different viewpoints and how 
              does the government manage that. So the point is you have to move fairly
               carefully on how you signal it.<br><br>"What the government does is not
               intended to penalise those who are not married but to actually help 
              those who are married and looking at additional expenses. So hopefully 
              we can look at it from that viewpoint. It's not meant to be a penalty 
              but at the same time as society evolves, we can examine how it's going 
              and how we can move as a society."<br><br>The conversation also delved 
              into Singapore's future and the need to define what the country is 
              aiming for over the next two to three decades. <br><br>Mr Lee said: "We 
              never arrive, you see. We're always on a journey. If you have arrived, 
              you fall off the bicycle. We have to keep on moving and aiming for 
              something which is in front of you, which is worthwhile."<br><br>He also acknowledged that consensus building will not be easy, but what is needed is a shared purpose. <br><br>Mr
               Lee said: "There will be many dreams and many aspirations among 
              Singaporeans, there has to be a certain shared purpose and identity. 
              We're all Singaporeans, that is something which distinguishes us, so we 
              recognise one another, we feel together.<br><br>"But we have different 
              things that we may like to do. You may want to teach, you may want to be
               in social enterprise, you may want to be in the arts or in music, or 
              you feel passionately about building your business.<br><br>"I think the 
              special thing about Singapore is that whichever aspirations you have, 
              you have a chance of achieving it here. Your child, son and daughter 
              also ought to have more of a chance of making it over here."<br><br>Another question asked during the forum was whether Singaporeans feel that the next generation will have a better future? <br><br>70 per cent of the audience responded affirmatively.<br><br>Education
               Minister Heng Swee Keat, who heads the committee that is facilitating 
              the national conversation about Singapore's future, felt it was an 
              encouraging sign.<br><br>He said: "I'm actually quite optimistic when I 
              hear from all of you. When you talk about values, many of you have 
              expressed aspirations about the Singapore that you want.<br><br>"If many
               of us speak up about the sort of issues that we have just discussed, I 
              think our sense of common purpose will come together. I'm hoping that in
               the coming weeks and months, we will have a rich and meaningful 
              conversation among Singaporeans about where we want to go."<br><br>The forum was an interactive dialogue which saw Singaporeans expressing their views freely.<br><br>This
               is just the start of the Singapore Conversation. Many more of such 
              dialogues will be rolled out over the next few months involving 
              Singaporeans from all walks of life. Some will be in different 
              languages, some in smaller settings and some also away from the media 
              glare, to facilitate a free flow of conversation.<br><br>On his Facebook
               page, Mr Lee said that the discussion was lively and often intense, and
               that participants made many eloquent arguments and useful proposals. He
               also said that it was a good start to the national conversation.<br><br>The full video of the forum is available on </span><a class="path" href="http://channelnewsasia.com/conversations">channelnewsasia.com/conversation</a><span>.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
