              </p><h1 class="headline node-title">Putin on terrorism: ' to forgive the terrorists is up to God but to send them to him is up to me'</h1>
              <p>Known for his hardline stance and strong public remarks, Russian 
              President Vladimir Putin's latest quotable quote has been making the 
              rounds on social media.</p>
              <p>A tweet by Ms Remi Maalouf, a news anchor with television channel 
              Russia Today, highlights Mr Putin's colourful take on terrorism: "To 
              forgive them is up to God, but to send them to him is up to me."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks on Nov 13 which killed at least 129 people, Russia and France agreed to <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/france-russia-bombard-isis-as-attacks-spark-unlikely-alliance">coordinate their military</a> and security services against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants in Syria.</p>
              <p>Mr Putin, speaking to his top military officials, had vowed merciless
               retaliation for the attacks, as warplanes from both countries unleashed
               bombs on the ISIS stronghold of Raqa earlier this week.</p>
              <p>"It's necessary to establish direct contact with the French and work with them as allies," he said.</p>
              <p>The urgency of the unusual alliance was also due to Tuesday's revelation that <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-says-plane-crash-was-result-of-terrorist-act">ISIS was responsible</a> for planting a homemade bomb that ripped apart a Russian passenger jet over Egypt on Oct 31.</p>
              <p>That incident <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/russian-civilian-plane-crashes-in-sinai-egypt-pm">claimed the lives of all 224 people</a> on board, most of whom were Russians returning home from a vacation.</p>
              <p>Mr Putin responded by saying it was one of the bloodiest acts in 
              modern Russian history, vowing that the effort to bring ISIS to justice 
              would be relentless.</p>
              <p>"We will search for them everywhere wherever they are hiding. We will
               find them anywhere on the planet and punish them," he added.</p>

              <h1 class="post-title entry-title">Fox News, twitterdom and social media duped by fake Putin quote</h1>
              <p>Yesterday,  Russian television news anchor Remi Maalouf tweeted:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>#Putin : to forgive the terrorists is
               ip to God but to send them to him is up to me #ISIS #Syria #Moscow 
              pic.twitter.com/hmTdvnb25C</em><br> <em>— Remi Maalouf (@RemiMaalouf)</em></p>
              <p>The too-good-to-be-true quote struck a chord with many in the wake of the horrific attacks in Paris. Among them was <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/2015/11/17/putin-forgive-terrorists-god-send-them-him-me">Fox News</a>.
               Fox re-posted this content from a website called Barstool Sports, a 
              reputable website that currently has other important news pieces at the 
              top of its feed, such as “<a href="http://www.barstoolsports.com/iowa/better-know-a-camel-toe-337/">Better Know A Camel Toe</a>” and “<a href="http://www.barstoolsports.com/newyork/guess-that-ass-464/">Guess that Ass</a>“.</p>
              <p>Remi Maalouf later revealed she had seen the quote posted on Facebook
               and then tweeted it. The quote might be fake, but the insight into how 
              the media operates is quite genuine. I am not surprised this would fool a
               lot of people, but professional news organizations should know better 
              because this isn’t the first time this fake quote has been falsely 
              attributed to someone. All it took to know this was 10 seconds of 
              Googling.</p>
              <p><strong>Did anyone really say this? </strong></p>
              <p>Probably not. Snopes.com has <a href="http://www.snopes.com/military/norman.asp">previously reported </a>this
               quote being attributed to General Norman Schwarzkopf in 2001. He never 
              had said it (until prompted to later during an interview, anyway). The 
              quote famously appears in the 2004 film <em>Man of Fire</em>, said by Denzel Washington’s character:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which should have made it a more obvious fake. It is not certain 
              where this quote originated. Snopes speculates it dates back to the 
              80’s:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It’s possible the current “arrange the meeting” quote is a
               misremembering of a pithy saying common to ROTC training in the 1980s: 
              “Your enemy’s duty is to die in defense of his country. Your duty is to 
              see that your enemy does his duty.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This will almost surely pop up again, attributed to new generations of perceived badasses.</p>
