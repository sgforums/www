              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Employers have shown strong support for the principle of Singaporeans as the core of the workforce.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They have also strongly backed the idea of giving Singaporeans more opportunities for training and development.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Their views were 
              summed up in an interim update on a consultation exercise by the 
              Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP).<br><br>The 
              stakeholder consultation follows Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's call 
              at this year's National Day Rally for tripartite partners to develop 
              guidelines on fair employment opportunities for Singaporeans. <br><br>Since
               then, the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and National 
              Trades Union Congress (NTUC) have been holding consultation sessions 
              with their stakeholders, partners and communities.<br><br>The TAFEP 
              shared the feedback from the public, employers and job intermediaries, 
              such as job boards and staffing agencies, in its interim update report 
              released on Friday.<br><br>The report said that while employers support 
              Singaporeans as the core of the workforce, they have also raised 
              concerns over the need to comply with additional control measures, such 
              as additional administrative hurdles and tests before a Work Pass is 
              approved.<br><br>Employers have stressed that it is important to strike the correct balance between Singaporeans and foreign employees.<br><br>As
               for union leaders, TAFEP said many support guidelines for fair 
              employment and responsible recruitment practices that will give 
              Singaporeans even better opportunities in recruitment and career 
              development.<br><br>They want safeguards to ensure that cheaper foreign labour does not undercut and lower the wages of locals.<br><br>At the same time, they want to see a Singaporean core workforce nurtured at all levels.<br><br>The
               report added that union leaders also feel it is important that the 
              revised guidelines recognise and incentivise companies that hire 
              Singaporeans first.<br><br>They feel that this will encourage more 
              employers to make the reasonable efforts needed to provide fair 
              employment opportunities for Singaporeans.<br><br>As for feedback from 
              the public, the call is for employers to show they have put in 
              considerable effort and time to look for a Singaporean worker through 
              advertisements and interviews before hiring a foreigner.<br><br>Many 
              also want employers to show that no eligible Singaporean has applied for
               that position, as well as ensure that human resource personnel are 
              Singaporeans.<br><br>At the same time, employers should make plans for 
              "skills transfer to locals" and for orientation and integration of new 
              foreign arrivals.<br><br>TAFEP and its partners will continue to monitor
               feedback and consider those that are reasonable and practical to frame 
              the guidelines which are likely to be released by the fourth quarter of 
              this year.  <br><br>The consultation process continues until October 24.<br><br>The public can share views and suggestions at </span><a class="path" href="http://www.fairemployment.sg/">www.fairemployment.sg</a><span><br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
