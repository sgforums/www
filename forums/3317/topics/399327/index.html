              <p>STOMPer Smart Sherlyn came across Foyce's facebook 
              post, where she announced that she may be getting married soon. The 
              STOMPer remembers her breaking up not long ago.<br><br>The STOMPer said 
              in an email to us today (May 14):<br><br>"Who is marrying Foyce Le Xuan?<br><br>"Saw
               this on facebook.<br><br>"Foyce once again proudly announced on 
              facebook she may be getting married real soon. Another friend of her 
              commented that she had just broken up.<br><br>"She replied yes and it's 
              someone else she's getting married to. Followed by her show-off comment 
              saying that the man gave her a real big diamond ring.<br><br>"Now we can
               understand why she is so happy, and can't wait to agree to the 
              marriage, though she just broke up not long ago - MONEY!"</p>

              <p><strong>Foyce Le: Call me a gold-digger, I don’t care</strong></p>
              <p>29-year-old singer-actress Foyce
               Le, better known as one of the women involved in the Jack
               Neo scandal, is making headlines again.</p>
              <p>Le announced that she would be getting married on her Facebook page 
              two weeks ago. However, the identity of her would-be suitor remains 
              a mystery.</p>
              <p>In an interview with <em>The New Paper, </em>Le revealed that the 
              marriage proposal she expects on her birthday on Tuesday  comes barely a
               month after they began dating.</p>
              <p>She tells <em>TNP, </em>“I won’t call him my boyfriend because we’ve 
              never been together. He’s a decisive man who has told me he wants to 
              marry me.”</p>
              <p>All that she revealed about Mr. A, her 30-year-old, 1.73m tall mystery 
              man, is that he is an oil tycoon’s son who owns a high-end jewellery 
              store on Orchard Road, has “three houses on Newton Road and owns many 
              cars”.</p>
              <p>Le did not hesitate to tell the paper that she was attracted by his 
              wealth and “high social status”.</p>
              <p>The two had lost touch with each other until earlier this year when 
              Le made the headlines for claiming local director Jack Neo made advances
               on her six years ago. In the midst of the saga, Mr. A found her on 
              Facebook and sent her a message.</p>
              <p>And so began their whirlwind month-long romance. Then just two weeks 
              ago, he told her he would propose with a rare pink diamond ring on her 
              birthday.</p>
              <p>So why would she think of marrying someone she’s only been seeing for
               a month?</p>
              <p>“I definitely would enjoy being a <em>tai tai</em> (lady of luxury). 
              Yes Mr. A is very suited for me. We enjoy the same kind of lifestyle,” 
              she told the paper.</p>
              <p>She also reveals that previous boyfriends dumped her because of her 
              “princess-like” behaviour.</p>
              <p>“I expect my boyfriend to wait for me and pick me up from work often.
               Perhaps this is what guys mean when they complain that I am too 
              ‘princess-like’. I also like to dress up and be wined and dined at nice 
              places,” she explains.</p>
              <p>And yet, the singer-actress has no qualms about 
              appearing materialistic.</p>
              <p>She says<em>, </em>“I know a lot of people will say that I’m a 
              gold-digger but I don’t care. I have very high expectations of my 
              partner. Let’s just say I’ve been wanting to get married for a very long
               time.”</p>
              <p>This is not the first time Le has made headlines. During the recent 
              scandal earlier this year involving film-director Neo, she claimed he 
              was invited by her then J-Team boss to a hotel room in 2004.</p>
              <p>Some accused her of cashing in on the scandal to gain fame. She also 
              filed a police report in the wake of the scandal, claiming her life had 
              been threatened.</p>

              <p><strong>Foyce Le: Call me a gold-digger, I
              don’t care</strong></p>
              <p>29-year-old singer-actress Foyce Le, better known as one of the
              women involved in the Jack Neo scandal, is making headlines
              again.</p>
              <p>Le announced that she would be getting married on her Facebook
              page two weeks ago. However, the identity of her would-be suitor
              remains a mystery.</p>
              <p>In an interview with <em>The New Paper,</em> Le revealed that
              the marriage proposal she expects on her birthday on Tuesday 
              comes barely a month after they began dating.</p>
              <p>She tells <em>TNP,</em> “I won’t call him my boyfriend because
              we’ve never been together. He’s a decisive man who has told me he
              wants to marry me.”</p>
              <p>All that she revealed about Mr. A, her 30-year-old, 1.73m tall
              mystery man, is that he is an oil tycoon’s son who owns a high-end
              jewellery store on Orchard Road, has “three houses on Newton Road
              and owns many cars”.</p>
              <p>Le did not hesitate to tell the paper that she was
              attracted by his wealth and “high social status”.</p>
              <p>The two had lost touch with each other until earlier this year
              when Le made the headlines for claiming local director Jack Neo
              made advances on her six years ago. In the midst of the saga, Mr. A
              found her on Facebook and sent her a message.</p>
              <p>And so began their whirlwind month-long romance. Then just
              two weeks ago, he told her he would propose with a rare pink
              diamond ring on her birthday.</p>
              <p>So why would she think of marrying someone she’s only been
              seeing for a month?</p>
              <p>“I definitely would enjoy being a <em>tai tai</em> (lady of
              luxury). Yes Mr. A is very suited for me. We enjoy the same kind of
              lifestyle,” she told the paper.</p>
              <p>She also reveals that previous boyfriends dumped her
              because of her “princess-like” behaviour.</p>
              <p>“I expect my boyfriend to wait for me and pick me up from work
              often. Perhaps this is what guys mean when they complain that I am
              too ‘princess-like’. I also like to dress up and be wined and dined
              at nice places,” she explains.</p>
              <p>And yet, the singer-actress has no qualms about
              appearing materialistic.</p>
              <p>She says<em>,</em> “I know a lot of people will say that I’m a
              gold-digger but I don’t care. I have very high expectations of my
              partner. Let’s just say I’ve been wanting to get married for a
              very long time.”</p>
              <p>This is not the first time Le has made headlines. During
              the recent scandal earlier this year involving film-director Neo,
              she claimed he was invited by her then J-Team
              boss to a hotel room in 2004.</p>
              <p>Some accused her of cashing in on the scandal to gain fame. She
              also filed a police report in the wake of the scandal,
              claiming her life had been threatened.</p>
