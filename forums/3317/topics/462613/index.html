              <p>its not logical to return them to ocean now easp when their numebrs are small and they stand a chance of getting poached by those cheena hunters. better to breed them and increas their population before releasing their numbers consistantly back to the sea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they are intelligent animals, i can saybetween humans and the lesser mamals and animals and insects on earth. if theyr are understree=ss i am sure they will show and humans can easily understand them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after all if they are treated well fed and they perform their job why not? they are just like humans getting loging pay with food for doing tasks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unlike humans like cheenas who give them lodging and pay still complain say their country can offer them better. then just fuck off lah? that one no one force them they can return to south cheena sea anytime man.</p>

              <p>we can release them to the ocean. being intelligent theywill call for helop if they cant adapt. when we say relase them its not just like release tortise to xiao guilin. releasing domestic anaimals back to the wild we have to tag them and monitor them. that's whyi say increas etheir numebrs then release some of them to see whre they go how they adapt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>out jurong bird park. they release lots of breed birds to the wild. many of them can be seen flying all ove rthe island, surviving and hunting for food on their own. whenever they cant they will flock bak to jBP becasye they know they can somehow scvage for foo dthere. a lot of these birds areflying all over JPBP, at uncaged areas. that;s why next time take a look wehn you see some birds, they feet they have tags from JBP conservation unit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>acres can strike and voice their concern, but they have to submit a propoasal how to do it right should the dolphins be released.</p>

              <p>why the birds released to the wild are to maintain our own singapore eco system, really. we know we need the brids to maintain the food chain, and some of the birds used to be endanagered and with our actions we actually brought them back to the healthy numbers winthin singapore.</p>
              <p>for dolpins, what i am looking at to return are not those that have been put to captivity, AND trained for entertainment purposes. what i say ACRES need to do is to have a seaparet place to keep and breed them, then return to the sea. dolphins with high inteleigent do not see humans as what other naimals sees them. that's why you hear news of people getting rescued by dolphins in the sea.</p>
              <p>ACRES problem as with all caharity animal welfare groups - are money and funds, to run the place pay rental, to feed the anaimals and all other expenses. worse are the increasing land prices of palces and the gahmen ever shifting their decision to take over lands increase rental.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for RWS thera re in bad luck, SCREs and most people kows withi=out shark, lossing them in great numbers tipping the balance in quick time, means no humans anymore. do i need to google and tell everyone wbout this? i can do it in my next post. now hungry like zombie lookin for food.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pandas, - except eat and sleep i dont see a need for them. maybe you can help google and give us some information about their usefulness. pandas i dont care anyone say anyshit. they represent cheenaland, just like the lazy hungry waiting to be feed cheenas like that.</p>

As harvests had been poor that year, Lord Erne offered his tenants a ten percent reduction in their rents. In September of that year, protesting tenants demanded a twenty five percent reduction, which Lord Erne refused. Boycott then attempted to evict eleven tenants from the land. <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #0645ad; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" title="Charles Stewart Parnell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stewart_Parnell">Charles Stewart Parnell</a>, in a speech in <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #0645ad; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" title="Ennis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennis">Ennis</a> prior to the events in Lough Mask, proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. While Parnell's speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was first applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated — his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference" style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #0645ad; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; white-space: nowrap; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></span><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: sans-serif; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);   -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"> </span></p>

John O'Malley of County Mayo to "signify ostracism applied to a landlord or agent like Boycott". <em>The Times</em> first reported on November 20, 1880: “The people of New Pallas have resolved to 'boycott' them and refused to supply them with food or drink.” The <em>Daily News</em> wrote on December 13, 1880: “Already the stoutest-hearted are yielding on every side to the dread of being 'Boycotted'.” By January of the following year, the word was being used figuratively: "Dame Nature arose....

              <p class="infuse">Willy was never really free. The killer whale star of the Hollywood movie <em>Free Willy</em> had to be cared for by humans even after he was released and he never successfully integrated with his wild kin. Researchers now say attempts to return him to the wild were misguided.</p>
              <p class="infuse">"We believe the best option for [Willy] was the open pen he had in Norway, with care from his trainers," says <a href="http://www.biology.au.dk/malene.simon.cv.da"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">Malene Simon</span></span></a> of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, who participated in efforts to reintegrate the cetacean in the wild and is lead author of the study. "He could swim as much as he wanted to, had plenty of frozen herring – which he was very fond of – and the people that he was attached to kept him active."</p>
              <p class="infuse">The killer whale, whose real name was Keiko, died in December 2003, at about 26 years old. Despite efforts to integrate him with wild killer whales in Iceland towards the end of his life, he proved unable to interact with them or find food.</p>
              <p class="infuse">"While we as humans might find it appealing to free a long-term captive animal," the researchers say in the paper, "the survival and well-being of the animal may be severely impacted in doing so." The only cetaceans that have successfully been returned to the wild have been young and only kept in captivity for short periods.</p>
              <p class="infuse">The team's comments contradict those made by members of the <a href="http://www.keiko.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">Free Willy-Keiko Foundation</span></span></a>, who declared in 2003 that his case had challenged the perception that whales cannot be returned to the wild. But Simon's account of Keiko's last few years shows just how unsuccessful his release was.</p>
              <h3 class="crosshead">Public pressure</h3>
              <p class="infuse">Keiko was born into a wild group of killer whales, also called orca, in Icelandic waters. He was captured in 1979 at about two years old and spent over a decade in a small tank in a Mexican amusement park, isolated from others of his species.</p>
              <p class="infuse">It was during this time, in 1993, that Keiko made animal stardom when he "played" a leading role in the hit film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106965/"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">Free Willy</span></span></em></a>, which tells the story of a boy who befriends and eventually releases a captive orca.</p>
              <p class="infuse">The film's success engendered an international letter-writing campaign, Free Keiko, which sought to release him into the wild. "There was a strong public pressure to release Keiko to the wild, preferably to his 'family' group in Iceland," say the researchers.</p>
              <p class="infuse">Yielding to this pressure, <a href="http://sgforums.com/article/mg15821393.000-icelands-most-famous-film-star-returns-home.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">Keiko's owners transferred him to Iceland</span></span></a> and in the summers of 2000 and 2001, he was trained to follow a boat out into the open water where wild orcas were feeding.</p>
              <h3 class="crosshead">Going hungry</h3>
              <p class="infuse">In 2002, he was fitted with tracking devices, and once again led out to join the wild orcas. This time, his trainers would hide below deck when Keiko approached in an attempt to minimise human contact. But lacking the necessary social skills, Keiko at first mostly floated motionless at the surface, facing towards the wild pods several hundred metres away.</p>
              <p class="infuse">After 10 days, he returned of his own accord to his penned-off area in a nearby bay. Vets extracted a sample from his stomach – the transparent, slimy liquid they found suggested Keiko had not fed.</p>
              <p class="infuse">Two days later he was led back out to sea. Again he didn't feed, although he did start to make dives. The tracking devices showed that he spent most of his time above 4 metres, and most of his dives were less than 26 metres. In contrast, wild orcas spend most of their dive time between 50 and 75 metres.</p>
              <p class="infuse">He was seen diving among the wild orcas only once, on 30 July 2002. And after physical contact at the surface, Keiko swam away, seeking out human company on the tracking boat.</p>
              <h3 class="crosshead">Crowded out</h3>
              <p class="infuse">Keiko managed to migrate to Norway for most of August, arriving in apparently good health. However, his film-star status and love of humans were to bring to an end his stint in the wild.</p>
              <p class="infuse">"When Keiko arrived in Norway, he actively sought out human company, swimming to boats and people," say the researchers. "After a few days, he became inactive, staying near a small boat, possibly to avoid the large and steadily increasing crowd of people now seeking his attention."</p>
              <p class="infuse">"At that time there was a crowd of people very close to Keiko," says Simon. "All the kids of the town wanted to touch him and swim with him." Local authorities forbade people from approaching or touching him, and his trainers – who thought he may have caught an infection from his human admirers – took him to live in a new open pen.</p>
              <p class="infuse">Keiko's activity levels increased to previous levels, thanks to regular trips with his carers outside the bay. A year after his failed migration, Keiko died at the age of 26 or 27, apparently of pneumonia.</p>

              <p>my point is - to keep them safe and breed them, then return them to the sea wher ethey belong. however this process is not easy, money being one of th major factor.</p>
