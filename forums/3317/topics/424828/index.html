              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Two days ago, I received a frantic call from my 
                  wife who is on holiday overseas, saying that her handbag containing her 
                  mobile phone had been stolen. <br><br> Immediately, I called M1 to 
                  ask for her phone line to be suspended. I was asked to provide my wife's
                   name, phone number, address, postal code, IC number - to all of which I
                   gave the correct reply. Then, I was asked her date of birth. When I 
                  said I could not really remember, I was told my desperate request could 
                  not be acceded to. Weren't the correct replies I gave earlier sufficient
                   for them to act?<br><br> As the last straw, I was told to call my wife to ask for her birth date. How could I, when her phone had been stolen! <br><br> I hung up the phone and am now waiting for the phone bill to come.</p>

              <p>I see two problems here:</p>
              <p>1. He forgot his wife's birthday? Dang, he sure is in a world of trouble once she gets back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>2. Can't he just call his in-laws? Or failing which, his wife's colleagues? Or check his wife's birth cert or something? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>1. M1 might have been a little anal (they could've asked another security question or something), but then again, asking for the subscriber's birth date isn't too unreasonable, either.</p>
              <p>2. Not being on holiday with her is still plausible, considering that he might be too caught up with work commitments to go overseas.</p>
              <p>3. Him not remembering her birthday is utterly unforgivable. What makes it worse is that there are many reasonable alternatives (I've already listed out a few) for him to get his wife's birthday.</p>
              <p>All I can say is, want to complain in the national newspapers also, he should at least use his head first.</p>

              <p><strong>Sounds like Sinktel.</strong></p>
              <p>Sinktel Operator: No sir, you cant reactivate your mobile line as there is an outstanding charge on your account.</p>
              <p>Me: I don't owe you any money.</p>
              <p>Sinktel Operator: There is an outstanding of $250</p>
              <p>Me: No, are you checking the correct account?</p>
              <p>Sinktel Operator: You defaulted on payment for your ADSL line.</p>
              <p>Me: What nonsense! I owe Sinktel $0. Tell me which month was the $250 for.</p>
              <p>Sinktel Operator: It was an early termination charge for your ADSL.</p>
              <p>Me: You are supposed to REACTIVATE my ADSL the last time, and also waive off any charges because <strong>the fools in Sinktel lost my change of billing address letter</strong>. I submitted the changes for my change of billing address for my ADSL line and my mobile TOGETHER. I did not receive my bill because your idiots at Sinktel failed. When the last time they called me, I had already told them over the phone to reactivate the ADSL line and also paid the outstanding even though they did not bill to my new house. I even had them promise to update my billing address for my ADSL. Tell me what is my billing address on your screen.</p>
              <p>Sinktel Operator: *mumbles old billing address*.</p>
              <p>Me: It is still the FREAKING OLD ADDRESS. It is Sinktel's fault, so rectify the problem and reactivate my mobile now.</p>
              <p>Sinktel Operator: You have to call the billing department during office hour so that they can check into this issue.</p>
              <p>Me: I call them with WHAT? I owe Sinktel $0 and they cannot reactivate my mobile line, and STILL NEED me to call them during office hours? I work in a call centre and CANNOT call you during office hours.</p>
              <p>Note: Many godzillion years ago.</p>
              <p>The outcome of the story? I terminated my mobile and ADSL.</p>

              <p>sometimes i relli dunno isit human error or system fault<br><br>i emailed to the green to ask about how to terminate my green pipe like must i go down personally or can do over the fone and whether need to return modem or watever dong dong<br>i use email bcos no hurry as there is some buffer b4 the red pipe comes<br>and i hate waiting on the line before a human being can tok to me<br>however, i received no response at all after 10 days</p>
              <p>so, when my red pipe is up, i terminated my green pipe over fone and the CSO assured me tt it will be done within 24hrs. <br><br>and then a couple of days later, i got email reply tt there will be a rep to contact me with regards to my green pipe termination <br>(and oso an apology for late reply bcos they are overwhelmed by emails. too many ppl compraining??)</p>
              <p>about 2 days later another CSO called.... <br>i said i oredi terminated the previous week, over the fone (bcos the email respond is taking way too long)<br>he say it's not reflected in the system. <br>then i say then it's your system's problem. i oredi terminated. and dont dare charge me pro-rated for these few days. <br>so the guy say he will check agn and got the cheek to ask me why i wanna terminate green pipe. so i said, precisely bcos of such service. bye bye.<br>and when i got the last bill, they are relli kind to waive of the entire month's fees. <br>but tt does not mean i think they are good and will re-consider them in future.</p>
