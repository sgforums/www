              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">SINGAPORE: Singapore's former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said the claim in a cable released by Wikileaks in which <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">he had "characterized Islam as a 'venomous religion'", is false.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">Mr Lee on Monday issued a statement following the release by Wikileaks of a cable by the US Embassy in Singapore reporting on the visit of Senator Hillary Clinton to Singapore in July 2005.<br><br>He added that that he looked up Ministry of Foreign Affairs' filenote of the meeting and nowhere does it record him describing Islam as "venomous", nor did he say anything which could have given that impression in his meeting with Senator Clinton.<br><br>In the statement, Mr Lee said he did talk about extremist terrorists like the Jemaah Islamiyah group, and the jihadist preachers who brainwashed them.<br><br>He said that they are implacable in wanting to put down all who do not agree with them.<br><br>He added that their Islam is a perverted version, which the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Singapore do not subscribe to.<br><br>Mr Lee said he also pointed out that Singapore Muslim leaders are rational, and that the ultimate solution to extremist terrorism was to give moderate Muslims the courage to stand up and speak out against radicals who have hijacked Islam to recruit volunteers for their violent ends.</span></p>

              SUBJECT: VISIT BY SEN. CLINTON TO SINGAPORE (JULY 5-7) 
               
              Classified By: Amb. Franklin L. Lavin.  Reasons 1.4 (b)(d) 
               
              <a id="par1" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par1">Â¶</a>1. (C) Summary: Singapore's senior leadership discussed the 
              challenges of combating Islamic terrorism, the need for 
              moderate Muslims to speak out, and the importance of success 
              in Iraq in meetings with visiting Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 
              (D-NY).  GOS leaders told the Senator that cross-Strait 
              relations were calmer than last year.  While China did not 
              want a collision with the United States, it could not allow 
              Taiwan to pursue independence.  At the same time, they urged 
              the United States to continue to play a major role in Asia 
              since it was the only country capable of balancing China's 
              rising power.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong encouraged the 
              U.S. military to be more engaged with its regional 
              counterparts.  PM Lee also reviewed Singapore's border 
              controls and immigration policies.  End Summary. 
               
              <a id="par2" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par2">Â¶</a>2. (U) Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) visited Singapore 
              from July 5-7.  She was accompanied by staff member Huma 
              Abedin.  The Senator met with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 
              Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan 
              Yew on July 5.  Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) also participated 
              in the three meetings. 
               
              Islamic Radicalism and Iraq 
              --------------------------- 
               
              <a id="par3" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par3">Â¶</a>3. (C) The problem of Islamic terrorism would not be easily 
              extirpated, observed MM Lee.  While Muslims in Southeast Asia 
              were traditionally moderate and tolerant, they had been 
              affected by radicalism emanating from Middle East and the 
              spread of wahhabism from Saudi Arabia.  Singapore's Muslim 
              leaders were rational and educated in English and the GOS 
              kept a limit on madrassah-based education.  He stressed that 
              moderate Muslims had to be encouraged to stand up and speak 
              out against radicalism.  They needed confidence that they 
              could win.  We could get to the tipping point, noted MM Lee, 
              but he didn't know how long it would take. 
               
              <a id="par4" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par4">Â¶</a>4. (C) MM Lee said Islamic terrorists would continue to use 
              violence until shown that their methods would not succeed. 
              If they were successful in Iraq, they would try to topple 
              secular governments in other countries, such as Indonesia. 
              PM Lee said Singapore supported U.S. efforts in Iraq; it was 
              important to get the Iraqi government working, with a 
              security force that could take over from U.S. forces and fend 
              for itself. 
               
              <a id="par5" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par5">Â¶</a><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">5. (C) Asked by Rep. Rangel how organized terrorists were 
              internationally, MM Lee responded that orthodox Islam was a 
              powerful force capable of recruiting volunteers for terrorist 
              groups.  He noted Singapore's experience in 2001 and 2002 in 
              dealing with Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist plots in Singapore 
              and characterized Islam as a "venomous religion." </span></span></strong>
               
              Democracy and Islam 
              ------------------- 
               
              <a id="par6" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par6">Â¶</a>6. (C) SM Goh told the Senator that democracy and Islam were 
              compatible.  It was necessary, however, to first carry out 
              economic and social reforms to prepare the ground for 
              democracy -- such as empowering women and encouraging 
              education.  Democracy was not just elections.  He noted that 
              some Middle Eastern countries had been looking at Singapore 
              as a model for economic development.  Many of these countries 
              also preferred the "Singapore model" of democracy to that of 
              the United States, given the ruling People's Action Party's 
              consistent electoral success.  MM Lee questioned the wisdom 
              of pushing hard for greater democracy in Egypt.  He urged a 
              more gradual political opening to avoid ending up with a 
              government like in Iran.  Do not be dewy-eyed about the 
              situation, he admonished, since one man, one vote would put 
              the radicals in charge of Egypt. 
               
              Cross-Strait Relations 
              ---------------------- 
               
              <a id="par7" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par7">Â¶</a>7. (C) SM Goh commented that cross-Strait relations were 
              calmer than last year, due to the joint U.S.-Japan security 
              statement in February, China's Anti-Secession Law, and the 
              visits by Taiwan opposition leaders to China.  The PRC 
              leadership had become more flexible and subtle in its 
              approach to Taiwan, SM Goh argued.  President Hu Jintao was 
              more patient about Taiwan and was willing to put the issue 
              aside for a decade or more. 
               
              <a id="par8" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par8">Â¶</a>8. (C) China had no interest in a collision with the United 
              States, according to MM Lee.  The PRC wanted peace and 
              stability so it could concentrate on promoting economic 
              growth, which was critical to the regime's legitimacy.  The 
              one issue they could not overlook was Taiwan.  While China 
              supported the status quo, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) 
              would continue its build up to dominate the Taiwan Strait to 
              deter the United States from getting involved in any 
              cross-Strait conflict. 
               
              U.S. Role in Asia 
              ----------------- 
               
              <a id="par9" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par9">Â¶</a>9. (C) All three GOS leaders urged the United States to 
              continue to play a major role in Asia.  MM Lee commented that 
              the United States was the only power capable of balancing the 
              rising power of China.  SM Goh observed that India had to 
              become more involved in the region as well to balance China. 
              Singapore wanted all outside powers to be active in Asia so 
              that "no dominant country could call the shots for its 
              neighbors." 
               
              <a id="par10" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par10">Â¶</a>10. (C) Noting that he had attended the Army Command and 
              General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, PM Lee urged the 
              U.S. military to be more engaged with its counterparts in the 
              region, especially Indonesia and Pakistan.  The Indonesian 
              Armed Forces (TNI) had been cut off for a long time.  The 
              United States was fortunate to have invested in the right 
              friend in President Yudhoyono, according to PM Lee. 
               
              Regional Situation 
              ------------------ 
               
              <a id="par11" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par11">Â¶</a>11. (C) The regional situation had improved over the last 
              year, according to SM Goh.  Indonesia had conducted 
              successful elections and President Yudhoyono understood the 
              West and could reach out to it.  He was a decent man who was 
              taking action against corruption, but the problem was endemic 
              in Indonesia.  In Malaysia, the change in prime minister was 
              for the better.  SM Goh commented that former PM Mahathir 
              enjoyed fighting with everyone.  The long-term problem was 
              what type of Islam would dominate in Malaysia.  He expressed 
              concern that a more radical version of Islam was gaining 
              ground and forcing moderates to take more extreme positions. 
               
              Border Controls and Immigration 
              ------------------------------- 
               
              <a id="par12" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par12">Â¶</a>12. (SBU) Asked about Singapore's border control system, PM 
              Lee said it helped that Singapore was an island.  While some 
              people were able to sneak into the country, it was far easier 
              to control than the Rio Grande.  Rep. Rangel noted that 
              Singapore's sanctions for illegal immigrants were different 
              than in the United States and PM Lee noted that they were 
              caned and then deported.  Employers and landlords of illegal 
              immigrants also faced sanctions.  The GOS was experimenting 
              with biometrics to speed up the entry process, especially for 
              the tens of thousands of people entering from Malaysia every 
              day. 
               
              <a id="par13" style="color: #517781;" href="http://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/07/05SINGAPORE2073.html#par13">Â¶</a>13. (SBU) While unemployment was 3.9 percent, there were many 
              jobs that Singaporeans no longer wanted to do, such as in 
              construction and domestic positions, observed PM Lee.  The 
              GOS allowed in some 200,000 workers in these fields.  The 
              GOS, however, did not want these workers to "establish roots" 
              in Singapore and encouraged turnover.  At the same time, the 
              GOS was trying to attract skilled workers, notably scientists 
              and engineers, to come and stay in Singapore.  They were 
              needed to help offset Singapore's low birth rate and to help 
              the country develop new industries, such as its emerging 
              biotechnology sector.</pre>

              <div class="story-intro">
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;"><strong>SINGAPORE's outspoken former leader Lee Kuan Yew has denied calling Islam a "venomous religion" after leaked US diplomatic cables set off a furore in the multiracial city-state.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">One of hundreds of cables from the US embassy in Singapore released last week by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks had Lee as describing Islam as a "venomous religion" in a 2005 meeting with then senator Hillary Clinton.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">"This is false," the 87-year-old Lee, Singapore's founding prime minister and elder statesman, said in a statement.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">Lee said that he looked up a foreign ministry note of the meeting, and "nowhere does it record me describing Islam as 'venomous', nor did I say anything which could have given that impression".</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">"I did talk about extremist terrorists like the (Southeast Asian) Jemaah Islamiyah group, and the jihadist preachers who brainwashed them. They are implacable in wanting to put down all who do not agree with them," he said.</p>
              </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">"So their Islam is a perverted version, which the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Singapore do not subscribe to." During the meeting, another US lawmaker in Clinton's party had asked Lee about "how organised terrorists were internationally", according to the leaked cable signed off by then US ambassador to Singapore Frank Lavin.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">It said Lee "responded that orthodox Islam was a powerful force capable of recruiting volunteers for terrorist groups".</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">"He noted Singapore's experience in 2001 and 2002 in dealing with Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist plots in Singapore and characterised Islam as a 'venomous religion'."</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">Singapore has a predominantly Chinese population with minority races including Malays, who are mostly Muslim, making up 13.4 percent of its population of five million.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;">The small Southeast Asian nation's closest neighbours geographically are mainly Muslim countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Lee's comments sparked a furore among Singapore's online community, which now plays a large part in shaping public debate in the city-state, where newspapers are perceived to be pro-government.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;"><strong>"LKY (Lee Kuan Yew) should not make general and sweeping statements like that," Lee Rou Xuan, a Singaporean citizen, wrote on the Facebook page of the blog site The Online Citizen. "He should have taken a greater effort to find out more or maybe his million-dollar-paid ministers should have given him some good advice."</strong></p>
              <p style="padding-right: 40px;"><strong>Sonny Pereira, another Facebook user, said the former leader's remarks were seditious. "This is serious! He ought to (feel) shame in public and the Arab world for what he said. This is sedition!" Pereira wrote.</strong></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know his background...</span></span></strong> I'm saying these things because they are real, and if I don't think that, and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy." - SM Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times, September 19, 1999 on Malays in the Singapore Armed Forces</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? How does telling a Malay bus driver that he should support the party of his Malay director (UMNO) and the Chinese bus conductor to join another party of his Chinese director (MCA) - how does that improve the standards of the Malay bus driver and the Chinese bus conductor who are both workers in the same company?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up?<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> You let people in the kampongs believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place in 1967 (the year Malay would become the national and sole official language in Malaysia). </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." — Lee Kuan Yew in the <a class="extiw" style="color: #3366bb; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; padding: 0px;" title="w:Parliament of Malaysia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Malaysia">Parliament of Malaysia</a>, 1965 </span></p>
