              <p>That is documented in another leaked cable: how he has stepped in to overshadow LHL, and a gag was suspected when he turned voters off in the 2006 election.</p>
              <p>Quote:</p>
              <p>10. (C) For PM Lee, the election was an opportunity missed.The PAP could have run on its superior policies, experience,and candidates and eschewed the old-schoolhit-them-when-they-are-down tactics.  Its candidates could have asked voters if they wanted to be governed by someone(James Gomez) who didn't even live in Singapore instead oflaunching a phony attack that extended to opening a"criminal" investigation as the defeated candidate was tryingto return home to Sweden.  Instead, the PAP's hardball tactics -- vintage Lee Kuan Yew -- cost them some votes andcontradicted the PM's stated interest in a more open society.</p>
              <p>11. (C) While the MM's abrasive style may appeal to older "heartland" Singaporeans, it does not work well with younger, better-educated voters.  He appeared a cranky and sour oldman and was only a liability to the PAP's campaign.  Theextensive reporting in the government-controlled press mayhave backfired for the PAP as voters found the vindictiveness against Chee and his party distasteful and tired of theoverwrought Gomez affaire.  The MM's role in the 2006 election may have accelerated Singaporeans' reaching an emotional turning point.  Many of the younger voters do notrecall Singapore's early, precarious days.  They are less willing to accept the PAP's fundamental premise that opposition and choice lead inexorably to disunity and chaos.</p>

              <p>basically this: we remember what the MIW did for us.. but this does not mean the whole country owes them forever, especially when they are making shit decisions which are obviously self-serving over and over again</p>
              <p>the country is much more important than petty things like loyalty to a political party which will not hesitate to sell you down the river for gains.. and is much more important than petty things like gratitude...</p>
              <p>they may seem important and may actually be important.. but the country as a whole, the people of the nation, is so very important that it overshadows all these things, and compared to the nation, they are petty and inconsequential</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">SINGAPORE: Singapore's former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has cautioned Singaporeans from turning the current political divide into a national divide.<br><br>Speaking to some 1800 undergraduates at a dialogue held at the Nanyang Technological University,<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Mr Lee acknowledged that one thing which will change in Singapore, and which has already happened, is the political divide.</span></strong><br><br>He said as long as the political divide does not degenerate into a national divide, it would not have much impact on the growth of the country.<br><br>But Mr Lee warned that if the political divide turned into constant bickering, like what is happening between the Democrats and Republicans in the United States, then Singapore will become just "another ordinary country".<br><br>Turning to the future, the founding father of modern Singapore stressed that his worry is whether Singaporeans would have the best people in the best jobs.<br><br>That is because if Singapore veers away from the meritocratic system which has brought the nation to where it is today, then Mr Lee said the country's performance will drop.</span></p>
