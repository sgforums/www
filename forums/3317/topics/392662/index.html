              <div class="content">
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) - â€“ Singapore, Malaysia
              and Indonesia have increased patrols in the Malacca Strait after
              Singapore warned that a terrorist group was planning attacks on the
              waterway, officials said Thursday.</p>
              <p>Maritime authorities said
              they had warned ships plying the Malacca Strait and Singapore straits
              to take precautions after Singapore warned of a threat to attack oil
              tankers and other vessels in the strategic lane.</p>
              <p>"Indonesia
              will step up security in the Malacca Strait. We'll not only send more
              personnel there, but those with expertise," Sagom Tamboen, a spokesman
              for Indonesia's military told AFP in Jakarta.</p>
              <p>"We'll be
              coordinating with Malaysia and Singapore. We'll increase vigilance and
              also anticipate possibilities of attacks and share any information," he
              added.</p>
              <p>Isa Munir, a top Malaysian marine police offer, said
              the authorities had received information on Sunday that "Islamic
              activists were trying to do some havoc" in the Malacca Strait.</p>
              <p>While the threat "is not specific" Malaysia was taking it seriously, said Isa, the marine police operations force commander.</p>
              <p>"We
              have stepped up sea patrols and air surveillance. We advise ships to
              ply close to Malaysian waters. If they are in Malaysian waters, then we
              can provide security and ensure their safety," Isa told AFP in Kuala
              Lumpur.</p>
              <p>"Yesterday, we deployed two aircraft."</p>
              <p>Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia already carry out joint anti-piracy patrols in the area.</p>
              <p>The
              Singapore Shipping Association said in an advisory to members seen by
              AFP it had been alerted by the Singapore Navy about "an indication that
              a terrorist group is planning attacks on oil tankers in the Malacca
              Strait."</p>
              <p>It said "this does not preclude possible attacks on other large vessels with dangerous cargo."</p>
              <p>"The
              terrorists' intent is probably to achieve widespread publicity and
              showcase that it remains a viable group," the navy said in its advisory.</p>
              <p>Noel
              Choong, head of the International Maritime Bureau's piracy reporting
              centre in Kuala Lumpur, said the threat covered both the Malacca and
              Singapore straits.</p>
              <p>He said the maritime watchdog had received
              information about the threat two days ago from a "foreign government
              agency" which it did not identify.</p>
              <p>"We passed this information
              to the relevant authorities in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia... We
              do not know what is the level of threat," he told AFP.</p>
              <p>"In
              view of the current threat, we advise ships to maintain a 24-hour
              lookout when passing through the Malacca Strait and the Singapore
              Strait."</p>
              <p>The Singapore Navy warned shipping operators that the
              militants could use small vessels such as dinghies and speedboats to
              attack oil tankers, emulating attacks by Somali pirates off the Horn of
              Africa.</p>
              <p>Pirates and robbers have also used small fishing
              vessels to board ships during previous attacks in the Malacca Strait,
              the navy said.</p>
              <p>Analysts have said that the Malacca Strait is a
              prime target because more than 30 percent of global trade and half the
              world's oil shipments pass through the narrow waterway.</p>
              <p>"If
              the Singapore Navy is providing this information, it should be taken
              very seriously," said John Harrison, a maritime security expert at the
              S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"Certainly,
              we do know that there has been a long-term concern about terrorism in
              the Malacca Strait but the threat level remains fairly low," Harrison
              told AFP.</p>
              <p>"That said, it was very prudent for the Singapore
              Navy to pass this warning along because it keeps the threat level where
              it is."</p>
              <p>While the navy did not name any group, Harrison said
              the Southeast Asia-based Jemaah Islamiyah militant group or Osama bin
              Laden's Al-Qaeda network could not be ruled out.</p>
              <p>"JI would
              certainly be one of the groups. We have not seen any public evidence
              indicating they have the capability to operate but that does not mean
              they are not developing them," he said.</p>
