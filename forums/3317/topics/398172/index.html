              <p>A STOMPer is irked that he still gets reminder letters 
              for payment from Starhub due to an ex-employee who has left the country.
                On top of that, Starhub is saying that if payment is not made, they 
              will take legal action.<br><br>In an email, the STOMPer said:<br><br>"This
               issue have been going on although we have told them many many times 
              that this foreign worker no longer work for us and has gone back to 
              china. Thus, they are going to take action against if we do not pay. 
              this letter has been sending to my house because his work permit is 
              under my parents home.<br><br>"The staff did told me they have told the 
              management but letter is still coming forward. although we can afford to
               pay the bill , but what for? I think its not worth it because he has 
              gone back to china and can't be located.<br><br>"I hope the management 
              could reply on this. Thanks."</p>

              <p>no, they will engage a lawyer. and that lawyer will do the same as what starhub did, ask you to pay. as long as you maintain your stand and cont not to pay, they won't do anything further, unless your bills add up to $100k or something lar.</p>
              <p>but then, starhub will then blacklist you, informing both singtel and M1 about what you did, so next time when you want a new line, you're almost certain to be rejected.</p>

              <p>But then again, if you guys think on Starhub's position, your customer owe money then claims that he should not pay because althought it's registered to his address, he don't actually own the bill amount. Like that fair to Starhub? I thought if you want to take responsibility for someone's actions, such as being a guarantor, you have to take the full responsibilities and not shrink away the moment the debtor runs away? I don't work for Starhub but I am thinking in a neutral point of view.</p>
              <p>Just because he post on stomp and make a big fuss doesn't always mean the person is correct. The same theory someone shout louder at meeting doesn't mean he is smart nor correct.</p>

              <p>Why did Starhub open the account for the PRC?</p>
              <p>They must have got some sort of a surety.</p>
              <p>Just because the PRC do not speak a word of English, does not mean they are stupid. They always skip the last payment. Be it rent or any other bills.</p>
              <p>Pay in advance is the way to deal with them.</p>

              <p>You are wrong to think that they will not take legal action. Starhub is a
               big company and they have their own legal department to do such jobs 
              and they will definetly sue you if not they waste money employ so many 
              lawyers for what</p>

              <p>They will carry out legal actions, it's basically against the contract when one doesn't pay their cell phone bills and legal actions are the norm for emphasizing the terms in the contract</p>
