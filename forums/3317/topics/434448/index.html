              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Education Minister Heng Swee Keat said his ministry 
              will be focusing on three outcomes: values, social and emotional 
              competencies, as well as new skills in thinking such as being more 
              globally aware.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Heng was speaking
               during his visit to Gongshang Primary School on Saturday morning where 
              he was gathering feedback on what needs to be done to improve the 
              education system.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He also shared his views during the seminar with parents.<br><br>According to Mr Heng, the input from the seminar will help shape the direction that he is charting for the education system.<br><br>"I'm
               looking at how we can better support our school leaders, our teachers 
              in delivering this education, and how we can also bring in parents as 
              part of this very important process."<br><br>During the seminar, some 
              parents voiced their concerns over students with financial difficulties 
              might be left behind and can't afford study aids such as computers.<br><br>Others
               wanted to know how they can secure their children's place in their 
              school of choice during the annual Primary One Registration Exercise.<br><br>While
               this was going on, many parents were unaware that the education 
              minister was sitting at the back of the hall listening and taking notes.<br><br>Midway through the seminar, Mr Heng made his presence felt as he addressed the issues that were raised up.<br><br>Mr
               Heng said: "First criteria is really proximity. If you have a school 
              nearby, that is the best because you really don't want the child to be 
              travelling a long distance. Having said that, schools are very well 
              resourced. MOE provides facilities to all the schools.<br><br>"We 
              centrally post teachers and principals to the schools and we ensure that
               there's a certain standard in all our primary schools. The fact that so
               many of you are here today is very encouraging. It shows that as 
              parents, you care a lot about the education of your children. And this 
              is a very important value in Singapore."<br><br>Mr Heng said his visit was to get a real sense of what is happening in the schools.<br><br>"I
               did not want to disrupt the interaction. I try to spend a lot of time 
              on the ground interacting with our school principals, with our teachers 
              and with our students because this is where the teaching and learning 
              take place."<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
