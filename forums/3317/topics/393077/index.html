              <p><span class="time">March 4, 2010</span></p>
              <p>According to Shin Min Daily yesterday, two Singapore men committed suicide on the same day by jumping off their flats.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The first suicide victim is a taxi-driver by the name of Mr Lim who jumped from his 15 storey kitchen windows at Taman Jurong.</p>
              <p>He had lived with his wife and children in the HDB unit where the suicide occurred.</p>
              <p>Neighbors described him as slightly plump and friendly to his neighbors.</p>
              <p>It was reported that he was under alot of stress due to financial difficulties.</p>
              <p>The second victim is a 30 year old Mr Quan who leapt off from 14 storey at a HDB flat at Holland Drive to his death.</p>
              <p>He was wearing a white shirt and blue short pants when this tragedy took place.</p>
              <p>It is suspected that financial reasons may be a cause too.</p>
              <p>Despite being Asia’s second richest country after Japan, Singapore has few social welfare benefits for its citizens though it is able to lose billions of dollars of its reserves in failed overseas investments.</p>
              <p>The competition has worsened lately with the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore who depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are allowed to compete directly with Singaporeans for jobs and there are no minimum wage or retrenchment benefits for local workers.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s octogenarian leader Lee Kuan Yew said during an interview with the National Geographic magazine that it is a “good thing” tha the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants as they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” than locals.</p>
              <p>For those Singaporeans who have fallen too far behind in the rat-race as they are not hard-driving enough, suicide may remain the last resort for them.</p>

              <p>   Asia second richest country in terms of its pple's wealth or in terms of its minister's wealth ? Whats the use of a filthy rich minister who doesn't help its own pple ? Just like india govt never bother to help its own poor pple . Only bother about other issues . Inviting foreigners to compete direct with its own pple is like rearing a rat to eat their own rations . End of the day when the foreigners leave sg , its their own pple who have to pick up the pieces . Foreigners work hard ? I beg your pardon , i have seen many different attitudes of foreigner trying to make more money in ways that they can work free labour , do their superiors job etc , u name it they do it and even blindly accuse their own colleague of trying to sabo them in their work . I myself have such an indian colleague whom do all these and more. China pple are very good in talking their way out of accusations and responsibilities . And msians .... well i have heard 1 KL tamil lady saying " i come sg is just for the money , once i earn enough money i will go back to KL , who wants to stay in such a place ." I even have msian colleague after getting their sg pink ic after serving the army here regret his decisions .</p>
              <p>   Of course i am not saying all of them are the same pattern , i have seen good ones also . But end of the day its always easier to see a bad foreigner then a good one . And lets take a look at recent ambassador case . Frankly i really think that the ambassador will walk freely in his own country even though he killed 2 pple in sg .</p>

              <h1>2 Singapore men committed suicide on 3 March 2010 due to
              financial distress</h1>
              <div>
              <div>
              <p><span>March 4, 2010</span></p>
              <p>According to Shin Min Daily yesterday, two Singapore men
              committed suicide on the same day by jumping off their flats.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The first suicide victim is a taxi-driver by the name of Mr Lim
              who jumped from his 15 storey kitchen windows at Taman Jurong.</p>
              <p>He had lived with his wife and children in the HDB unit where
              the suicide occurred.</p>
              <p>Neighbors described him as slightly plump and friendly to his
              neighbors.</p>
              <p>It was reported that he was under alot of stress due to
              financial difficulties.</p>
              <p>The second victim is a 30 year old Mr Quan who leapt off from 14
              storey at a HDB flat at Holland Drive to his death.</p>
              <p>He was wearing a white shirt and blue short pants when this
              tragedy took place.</p>
              <p>It is suspected that financial reasons may be a cause too.</p>
              <p>Despite being Asia’s second richest country after Japan,
              Singapore has few social welfare benefits for its citizens though
              it is able to lose billions of dollars of its reserves in failed
              overseas investments.</p>
              <p>The competition has worsened lately with the relentless influx
              of foreigners into Singapore who depressed the wages of ordinary
              Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of
              public housing and led to an overall decline in the standards of
              living.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are allowed to compete directly with Singaporeans for
              jobs and there are no minimum wage or retrenchment benefits for
              local workers.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s octogenarian leader Lee Kuan Yew said during an
              interview with the National Geographic magazine that it is a “good
              thing” tha the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants as
              they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” than locals.</p>
              <p>For those Singaporeans who have fallen too far behind in the
              rat-race as they are not hard-driving enough, suicide may remain
              the last resort for them.</p>

              <p>It is not within our expectation to pay the Ministers millions to be worst off than third world country.    Are we allowed to set KPI for them?</p>
