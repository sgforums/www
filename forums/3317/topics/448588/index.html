              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A teenage Indonesian has been sentenced to 10 years' jail for strangling her elderly employer.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Vitria Depsi Wahyuni, 19, could have been put behind bars for 20 years or given life imprisonment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>She pleaded guilty in February to culpable homicide in the death of 87-year-old Sng Gek Wah in November 2009 at Farleigh Avenue.<br><br>Vitria committed the crime in the Serangoon Gardens estate just five days after she started working for Madam Sng.<br><br>The accused came to Singapore with a passport that identified her as Fitriah.<br><br>She had lied that she was 24 years old when she was only 16.<br><br>On November 25, 2009, Vitria waited for the Mdm Sng to fall asleep before attempting to smother her with a pillow at about 10pm.<br><br>But Mdm Sng woke up, put up a struggle with the maid and fell to the floor.<br><br>Vitria then tried to silence her by strangling her.<br><br>The accused got angry and struck the victim's forehead with a vase.<br><br>Subsequently, Vitria pretended to run out of the house to seek help.<br><br>She managed to hail a taxi.<br><br>The driver called the police.<br><br>During the police investigations, Vitria told officers that Mdm Sng fell by herself.<br><br>But the police later found that the maid had strangled the elderly woman with her hands.<br><br>Justice
               Choo Han Teck pointed out that the High Court could put Vitria away for
               life, but said the circumstances and mitigating factors warranted a 
              jail term of not more than 10 years.<br><br>The prosecution, which had 
              argued that the offence was premeditated and described the attack as 
              "brutal and savage", had pressed for a jail term of 20 years.<br><br>But
               Vitria's lawyer Mohamed Muzammil Mohamed argued that a jail term of 
              between eight and 10 years was appropriate as his client was young and 
              immature at the time of the offence.<br><br>Vitria is said to have an IQ of 63, which is below average.<br><br>The
               defence lawyer said she could not cope with the frequent nagging and 
              scolding by Mdm Sng, who was said to have often called the maid 
              'stupid'.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
