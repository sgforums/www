              <p><strong>Singapore is Asia's most liveable city: survey</strong></p>
              <p>SYDNEY, April 28 - Vienna has beaten Zurich to be crowned the place
              with the best quality of living in an annual survey in which European
              cities dominated the top 10.</p>
              <p>Management consultancy Mercer said Vienna scored the highest for
              overall quality of living in the 215-city survey after improvements in
              Austria's political and social environment, knocking the Swiss city of
              Zurich into second position.</p>
              <p>Third in the list came another Swiss
              city, Geneva, followed by Vancouver, Canada, and Auckland, New Zealand,
              in shared fourth place.</p>
              <p>Baghdad, Iraq, came last despite slight improvements in its infrastructure and moves to encourage investment.</p>
              <p>Three
              German cities made the top 10 -- Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt --
              with the list rounded out by Bern in Switzerland and Sydney, Australia.</p>
              <p>The
              highest U.S. ranking in the 2009 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey was
              Honolulu which came 29th while Washington and New York remained in
              positions 44 and 49 respectively.</p>
              <p>London came 38th in the list
              which is designed to help governments and companies formulate
              international packages for their employees.</p>
              <p>"As a result of the
              current financial crisis, multinationals are looking to review their
              international assignment policies with a view to cutting costs," said
              Slagin Parakatil, senior researcher at Mercer, in a statement.</p>
              <p>"Many
              companies plan to reduce the number of medium to long-term
              international assignments and localise their expatriate compensation
              packages where possible though the hardship allowance, based on quality
              of living criteria, will remain an essential component of the package."</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore
              was the top-scoring Asian city, coming in 26th which was up six places
              from a year ago due to its growing importance as a financial centre and
              its wide range of international and private schools.</span></p>
              <p>Beijing moved up three places to 113, boosted by improvements in public transport facilities from the Olympics last August.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore
              also came first in a separate ranking based on city infrastructure,
              which examined standards of electricity, water, telephone, mail, public
              transport, traffic congestion and the range of international flights
              from local airports.</span></p>
              <p>Singapore was followed in the infrastructure rankings by Munich, Copenhagen, and Tsukuba in Japan. Again, Baghdad came last.</p>
              <p>The
              rankings, based on a point-scoring index in which New York is the base
              city with 100, are based on 39 quality-of-life determinants such as
              political stability, schooling, recreation, housing and natural
              environment.</p>
              <p>In Central and South America, San Juan in Puerto Rico retained the highest ranking at 72 followed by Montevideo at 79.</p>
              <p>"Political
              and security issues, and the incidence of natural disasters, continue
              to hinder the improvement of quality of living in the region. Shortages
              of consumer goods have also contributed to a decline in quality of
              living in some cities," said Parakatil.</p>

              <p>i read the same report in the newspaper in australia and it says the respondents are expatriates.</p>
              <p>i agree singapore has done everything possible to make itself attractive to the expats. as a foreigners coming to sgp; with the kind of amenities thrown at you, you would rate singapore highly too. the citizens still get the short end of the deal though.</p>
              <p>in australia, it makes sense that sydney is ranked higher than melbourne in this survey as sydney is the commercial hub of australia. expatriates will naturally pick sydney as it is more tailored for them. i have been to sydney many times, and no way is it more live-able than melbourne. this has nothing to do with me living in melbourne though....</p>

              <p>this news should be taken with a pinch of salt . SG came tops in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASIA</span></strong> because it is the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most developed in the region.   </span> </strong>And such statistics are biased in favour of businesses. I am seriusly laughing at the report , the most liveable city in the world where when u get old , u start picking cardboards? Cars costing 2-3x more than anywhere else in the world and almost 3/4 of the population could not get into university?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like always, external statistics show a different story when u compare with internal statistics.</p>
