              <p>Is the law not strong enough to convict them or are they really innocent? Lucky maybe.</p>
              <h1>1) Trolley-bag murder charge against businessman dropped</h1>
              <p>A businessman originally accused of murder was given a 
              discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the Sentosa trolley-bag 
              murder that occurred last year.</p>
              <p>Teo Boon Leng, 45, was in remand since April 2011. No reason was given for the discharge.</p>
              <p>Teo's lawyers are calling for a full acquittal, reported The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>A discharge not amounting to an acquittal means Teo can be charged if
               new evidence is brought up, while full acquittal means Teo cannot be 
              charged again for the same offence.</p>
              <p>Teo was originally charged with killing Mr Dylan Wong Teck Siong in a
               fifth-floor unit at the Caribbean at Keppel Bay condominium.</p>
              <p>Wong's body was found stuffed in a trolley bag floating off Sentosa.</p>
              <p>The bag containing Wong's body was discovered by two foreign 
              construction workers near the shore, close to a worksite on the west 
              side of Resorts World Sentosa.</p>
              <p>The workers, a Myanmar national and an Indian national, took the bag ashore and alerted their supervisor, who called the police.</p>
              <p>Wong's body was found clothed and curled in a foetal position. No identification papers were found.</p>
              <p>Teo and Wong are believed to have been in a relationship.</p>
              <p>The prosecution tendered 15 new charges against Teo.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times reported that the charges include: - Using Mr Wong's mobile phone to transmit false messages<br>- Depositing the trolley bag containing Mr Wong's corpse at the sea<br>- Having drug utensils for drug-taking<br>- Failing to report Mr Wong's death to the police as soon as practicable</p>
              <h1>2) Water Tank Murder discharged over maid's death faces 5 new unrelated charges</h1>
              <p>A Bangladeshi cleaner was granted a discharge not amounting to an 
              acquittal yesterday over the death of an Indonesian maid, whose body was
               found in a water tank. But the cleaner faces new charges not related to
               the murder.<br><br>Repon Mostafa, 29, had been charged with the murder 
              of Ms Ruliyawati, 30, on the rooftop of Block 686B Woodlands Drive 73 in
               May last year. He now faces five new charges not related to the murder,
               including three for trespassing on the rooftop of Block 686B last year.
               The other two charges relate to possessing an obscene film and eight 
              uncertified video files containing films in his mobile phone.<br><br>District
               Judge Lim Tse Haw ordered Mostafa to be remanded after he failed to 
              raise $5,000 bail. His case was adjourned to July 24 for his lawyer Ram 
              Goswami to take instructions from his client. Yesterday’s decision to 
              grant the discharge to Mostafa, who has been in remand for a year, left 
              lawyers mystified as to what had led to the turn of events.<br><br>His 
              lawyer told The Straits Times that Mostafa had denied the murder and 
              informed the police that the maid had told him many times that she 
              wanted to die because of personal problems. It emerged in his claims to 
              his lawyer that the maid had used a five-inch folding knife, which she 
              had brought, to slash herself on the stomach at the rooftop. She did 
              this, he said, to scare him into giving her the keys to the water tank. 
              He pulled away the knife and was cut in his hand. He gave her the keys, 
              saying he was afraid.<br><br>He also claimed she wanted to have sex. 
              When he refused, she cut herself on her right thigh, so he yielded out 
              of fear. After they had sex, she used his T-shirt to wipe the blood from
               her wounds. She then climbed up the water tank, and when he tried to 
              stop her, she used the knife to take a swipe at his arms.<br><br>She 
              unlocked and lifted the cover and asked him to follow, threatening to 
              kill herself if he did not. He followed her down the ladder into the 
              tank where the water level was up to her neck and up to his chest. She 
              asked him to die with her but he refused. He tried to climb out and call
               the police but she held him back. She kept her head under the water 
              several times. He pulled her up several times but got tired and let go. 
              He later found her motionless body.<br><br>Subsequently, his foreman arrived at the scene and the police were called.</p>
              <h1>3) S'porean student Tiwary acquitted of double murder</h1>
              <p>An appeals court in Australia has acquitted Singaporean student Ram 
              Puneet Tiwary, who was twice convicted of murdering his two flatmates in
               Sydney.<br><br> The 33-year-old has spent more than eight years behind bars and will likely go free. <br><br> Tiwary was accused of murdering fellow Singaporeans Tay Chow Lyang
               and Tony Tan Poh Chuan in 2003. The two were stabbed and clubbed to 
              death with a baseball bat. <br><br> All three were studying at the University of New South Wales at the time.<br><br> Tiwary was convicted of both murders in 2006 and given a life sentence without parole. <br><br> He successfully appealed, but faced a retrial in 2009. He was 
              again found guilty, and this time, handed a jail term of 48 years.<br><br> Tiwary has maintained his innocence, claiming he was asleep at the time of the brutal attacks.<br><br> But prosecutors said Tiwary killed his flatmates over money he owed in rent, said to be more than US$5,000.<br><br> The appeals court is expected to reveal the reasons for the acquittal at a later date.</p>

              I guess the prosecution could not prove beyond reasonable doubts that these suspects committed murder so they have to be granted a discharge. Well, only god and they themselves know the answer.
              
              They will be punished one day if indeed they were the murderers.

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LESTER KONG<br></strong>MALAYSIA CORRESPONDENT</p>
              <p><br>KUALA LUMPUR - For the second time in a month, a Malaysian court is sparking public outrage by deciding not to jail a statutory rapist - citing youth and good behaviour.</p>
              <p>  "Where is the seriousness of obeying the law? We're supposed to protect the child," Mr James Nayagam, who is with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, told The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>  Mr Nayagam said the decisions were the lightest sentences ever given in Malaysia for those convicted of statutory rape. Consent, he said, should not be a factor in the cases as the girls were below the age of consent.</p>
              <p>  On Aug 8, former national bowler Noor Afizal Azizan had his five-year jail sentence reduced to a RM25,000 bond (S$10,000) for good behaviour, after he was convicted of raping his 13-year-old girlfriend in June 2009. Noor Afizal, now 22, was 18 at the time of the crime.</p>
              <p>  Yesterday, Chuah Guan Jiu (below), 22, a Penang electrician found guilty of raping his 12-year-old girlfriend twice last year, had his sentence reduced to a RM25,000 bond for good behaviour.</p>
              <p>  In both cases, the judge cited consent between the couples and the young ages of the male accused. The age of consent for women in Malaysia is 16 years.</p>
              <p>  Sexual intercourse with an underage girl is punishable with up to 20 years' jail and whipping.</p>
              <p>  "We need a clearer understanding on the legal provisions of statutory rape," said Ms Ivy Josiah, executive director of Women's Aid Organisation. "Where do we draw the line for children consenting to sex?"</p>
