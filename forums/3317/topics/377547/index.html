              <p><span>SINGAPORE : National service for new arrivals and ideas to help
              integrate permanent residents and new citizens with Singaporeans were
              some of the issues discussed with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during
              his hour-long dialogue with women professionals on Thursday.
              <br> <br> The dialogue was attended by representatives from 25 women's organisations.
              <br> <br>Besides raising several issues, they also spoke of their
              experiences. These concerned Singapore's education system, national
              service for new citizens, and benefits enjoyed by citizens and
              permanent residents.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "I have to have a clear distinction between citizens,
              and non-citizens and between citizens who do NS and citizens who have
              not done NS. And that is what we have tried to do. That is why every
              few years we have a RECORD Committee, and we have to make a clearer
              distinction between the citizens and the PRs.
              <br> <br>"When it comes to education fees, we have widened the difference
              between citizens and PRs and we will continue to widen (it). Similarly
              healthcare, in our hospitals, PRs pay significantly more than citizens
              in all classes of wards, and that also gradually we will widen.
              <br> <br>"And then between the PRs and the foreigners, we have another clear
              differentiation in treatment. So I cannot make it completely flat
              because intrinsically it is not comparable. <br> <br> "But I can redress some of this sense of 'not quite fair', and we can
              do more of these measures. But I cannot stop people bringing the people
              in, and unfortunately I cannot do away with NS."
              <br> <br> Some mothers suggested that national service be broken up, instead of two years at a go.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee responded: "It is better to have the two years as one block
              and compact it. From the SAF point of view, it is better because two
              years as one block, I am genuinely making full use of the soldier...
              train, go on course, become a specialist or officer, posted to a unit,
              train to operate a unit and become a proper operational which can
              actually deploy and fight and then ORD. If I do it three months here,
              six months there, I am just pretending to have a battalion."
              <br> <br>Mr Lee stressed that the challenges faced by Singapore - be it the
              economic crisis or population shortfall - cannot be solved by the
              government alone. All Singaporeans must unite to tackle them together. </span></p>
