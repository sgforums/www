              <p><strong>Singapore man kills child over cigarettes: court</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) - – A Singaporean man has
              gone on trial charged with murdering his 23-month-old daughter in a fit
              of rage after he caught her playing with his cigarettes, court
              officials said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Sallehan Allaudin, 26, is accused of
              fatally beating his daughter Nikie in January ahead of her second
              birthday, causing her to die of a ruptured vein. If convicted, he could
              face death by hanging.</p>
              <p>The High Court was told Monday that
              Sallehan, who had just returned home with his wife with a present for
              Nikie, went berserk after seeing the toddler had torn up and scattered
              his cigarettes, the Straits Times reported Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Sallehan has pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>
              <p>His
              wife, Rozanah Mohamed Yusoff, 24, used a mannequin to show the court
              how Sallehan allegedly kicked and stomped on their daughter in the
              kitchen, the newspaper said.</p>
              <p>The couple, who have two younger
              daughters, called for an ambulance when Nikie started bleeding from the
              nose, but she died of her injuries, according to the report.</p>
              <p>"I
              did not go into the kitchen to stop my husband as I thought that was
              the way he wanted to discipline Nikie," the wife was quoted as saying
              by the newspaper.</p>

              <p><strong>Toddler likely injured when she was kicked on stamped on</strong></p>
              <p>A forensic pathologist told the High Court that toddler, Natalie Nikie
              Alisyia Sallehan most likely suffered a vein rupture when she was being
              kicked and stamped on. <br> <br> On day seven of her father's murder trial, Dr Teo Eng Swee, the doctor
              who conducted the autopsy, said kicking and stamping would generate
              forces to cause the rupture, the fatal injury. <br> <br> In most cases, patients who suffer this condition die without regaining consciousness. <br> <br> Children also do not tolerate these injuries as well as adults. <br> <br> The 23-month-old girl was assaulted on January 6 at her home in Boon
              Lay after her father flew into a rage when he found out his eldest
              daughter had destroyed his cigarettes. <br> <br> Dr Teo dismissed suggestions by defence lawyer N. Kanagavijayan that
              the girl's past injuries could have contributed to the ruptured vein. <br> <br> The father Sallehan Allaudin, who's 27, faces the death penalty if found guilty of the murder. <br> <br> He has admitted to Police that he slapped her face and punched her body because he was upset. <br> <br> However, his wife Madam Rozanah Mohamed Yusoff testified that she saw
              him kick and stamp on his daughter in the kitchen at the time of the
              incident. <br> <br> Sallehan, a former cleaner, sat emotionless in the dock seemingly
              undisturbed by the graphic autopsy pictures of his daughter displayed
              in court. <br> <br> The trial continues tomorrow when Sallehan will take the witness stand to give his side of the story.</p>

              <p><strong>Accused denies stamping and kicking baby</strong></p>
              <p>In the continuing murder trial of Sallehan Allaudin, the accused denied stamping on or kicking his daughter. <br> <br> Taking the stand for the first time, Sallehan however admitted that he had slapped and punched his two-year-old daughter. <br> <br> Speaking through an interpretor at the High Court today, the
              27-year-old said he had hit Natalie Nikie Alisyia on the arm - in a fit
              of anger - to "discipline" her for ruining his cigarettes on 6th
              January. <br> <br> But Sallehan accused his wife, Madam Rozanah Mohamed Yusoff, of hitting their daughter with a broom. <br> <br> The former cleaner demonstrated on a mannequin how he had allegedly seen his wife attack the child because she was "upset". <br> <br> Madam Rozanah denied earlier during the trial this ever happened, when the defence lawyer had questioned her. <br> <br> She had claimed that she was the one who stopped Sallehan from kicking and stepping on Nikie. <br> <br> The couple's accounts continued to differ, as the accused testified that they had gone into the bedroom after the attack. <br> <br> They panicked when Nikie collapsed in the kitchen moments later. <br> <br> She was breathless and bleeding from the nose. <br> <br> Sallehan claimed that Madam Rozanah told him to not get her "involved", as they had two other children to care for. <br> <br> An emotional Sallehan said that he had told his wife that he would bear the consequences since he loved her and the children. <br> <br> Nikie was rushed to the National University Hospital but doctors could not save her. <br> <br> Sallehan said he fell to the floor when he heard that Nikie had died because he had no intention to kill his daughter. <br> <br> The accused faces the death penalty if found guilty. <br> <br> The trial continues.</p>

              <p><strong>Dad's motives under scrutiny</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A day after he implicated his wife for the murder of
              their two-year-old daughter, Sallehan Alauddin's motives came under
              scrutiny. </span></p>
              <p><span>His claims on Wednesday, his first day on the stand in his
              ongoing murder trial, contrasted with the night of his arrest, when he
              omitted any involvement of his wife in his police statement. <br> <br> This, even though they had fought a few days before their daughter's
              death on Jan 6. At the time, Sallehan suspected his wife was having an
              affair. <br> <br> A disbelieving Deputy Public Prosecutor Winston Cheng asked: "If it's
              true that you've been having marital problems, then why cover up for
              her (until now)?" <br> <br> The accused retorted: "Why is this incredible to believe? I was thinking of the children."  
              <br> <br> The couple have two other children, aged one year and two months respectively.  
              <br> <br> More details emerged on Thursday about the couple's relationship. Madam
              Rozanah Mohamed Yusoff, 24, did not love him as much as before,
              Sallehan claimed. <br> <br> Since he was remanded, she had also not been visiting him much in
              prison. Her last visit was on Aug 12, but several months earlier, Mdm
              Rozanah, who is unemployed, told him she could not visit him anymore
              because her boyfriend did not approve. <br> <br> But this was no motivation for his change of heart in his testimony,
              Sallehan told the court through an interpreter. He said he decided to
              come clean only on the advice of his lawyer N Kanagavijayan on Oct 8,
              before the trial started. <br> <br> "It's with a heavy heart that I implicate my wife ... my lawyer said
              it's better I tell the truth because I was facing the death penalty,"
              he said. <br> <br> The accused said he did not initially mention his wife's assault on
              Natalie Nikie Alisyia with a broomstick because they had made "a deal"
              that he would shoulder the blame. <br> <br> He said: "If we both went to jail, there would be no one else to take care of the children."  
              <br> <br> Sallehan, who is admitting to have only slapped and punched Nikie, is
              accused of causing her death by stamping on and kicking her. <br> <br> The trial continues. </span></p>
