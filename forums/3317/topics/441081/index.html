              <p>Singapore's founding leader Lee Kuan Yew is fighting a neurological 
              disease that is making it difficult for him to walk steadily, his 
              daughter revealed.</p>
              <p>Lee, who turned 88 in September, suffers from 
              sensory peripheral neuropathy, his physician daughter Lee Wei Ling, 
              director of the National Neuroscience Institute of Singapore, wrote in 
              her weekly Sunday Times newspaper column.</p>
              <p>"In my father's case, 
              sensory peripheral neuropathy has caused the conduction of sensation 
              from his legs to his spinal cord to be impaired. This makes his walking 
              unsteady, as many Singaporeans have already noticed," she wrote.</p>
              <p>The
               column, which deals with a wide range of issues, is closely followed 
              for glimpses into the private life of Singapore's most influential 
              family.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is the columnist's elder brother.</p>
              <p>Lee
               Kuan Yew retired from the cabinet after general elections in May but 
              continues to travel overseas and remains a member of parliament, a post 
              he has held since 1955. He served as prime minister from 1959 to 1990.</p>
              <p>"His
               day-to-day condition now fluctuates. On some days he is fairly steady 
              and on other days his balance is poor. The problem is limited to the 
              sensory nerves outside his central nervous system," his daughter wrote.</p>
              <p>"His
               brain and muscles are working normally. But being deprived of sensation
               from his legs means he finds it a challenge to balance. Thus his 
              unsteady walk," she said.</p>
              <p>The patriarch, however, is determined to
               fight the disease and now practises walking on a treadmill at home 
              three times a day without fail.</p>
              <p>"I have no doubt my father will fight this disease for as long as he thinks he can contribute to Singapore," his daughter said.</p>
              <p>"I think with medication and simple precaution, he can continue to be of service to his country and the world."</p>

              <p><strong>Former MM Lee says he will contribute to S'pore as long as he is able to</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's former minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew said 
              he will continue to contribute to Singapore as long as his health 
              permits.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Tree Planting Day celebrations at Buona Vista Court on Sunday evening.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee also urged residents to contribute to build a cohesive Singapore.<br><br>Tree
               Planting Day is something Mr Lee has observed these past 40 years, and 
              still does even though he's now 88 years old. Tree Planting Day started 
              in 1971 and since then, the first Sunday in November has been set aside 
              for the islandwide campaign.<br><br>Reporters asked Mr Lee to comment on
               his daughter's revelation in the Sunday Times, that he is suffering 
              from sensory peripheral neuropathy, which makes his walking unsteady, 
              hence he has to walk slowly.<br><br>"We learn to adjust. It started two 
              years ago when I was 86, and at 86 many of my contemporaries are either 
              on wheelchairs or are not around. So I am grateful to be still around at
               86, although less steady than before," said Mr Lee. <br> <br>"But as 
              you see, one learns to adjust and I take steps which are wider apart to 
              maintain a sound balance. I have no doubt at all that this has not 
              affected my mind, my will nor my resolve. People in wheelchairs can make
               a contribution. I still got two legs, I will make a contribution," he 
              added.      <br><br>And Mr Lee spoke of how the leaders and the people 
              have worked together to build the nation, by transforming shanty towns 
              into clean and pleasant HDB estates.  <br><br>The new blocks at Buona 
              Vista Court at Holland Drive was built by HDB as replacement flats for 
              residents in Holland Village under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment 
              Scheme (SERS).<br><br>The flats were completed in Nov 2010 and since then, residents have moved into their new flats. <br><br>Mr
               Lee said the government has done its best to provide good housing and 
              community facilities. It's now the role of the people to play their part
               in bringing the community together and contribute towards a harmonious 
              nation.<br><br>"I encourage all of you to come forward to serve and 
              build this community together, grow this new community together. 
              Together, we can build a better home, a more cohesive community and 
              stronger nation for all," said Mr Lee. <br><br>HDB said support for the 
              SERS programme in the Buona Vista Court has been encouraging with 
              residents liking the location, transportation and estate facilities 
              most.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
