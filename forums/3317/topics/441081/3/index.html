              <p>Yes we are thankful for his past contribution.   You bear in mind LKY is not the only one contributing to Singapore.   Why do you only concentrate on LKY contributing and ignore others?   Why so blind? Look at  other countries which are doing well, they do not have LKY.</p>
              <p>He did it more for personal  reasons, he indulges in fame, money, recognition, power , dictationship.      He never hesitate to use unkind words against the people who feed him.   A very ungrateful evil dictator.   Please do not be so one sided and shallow to see only the surface.   For a man who admits he jailed his opponents without trial is not worth the respect.   </p>
              <p>Tell us, when is running a country easy?   He admitted it is easy for him to manage Singapore because of the small size, if given a big country he will not make it.    </p>

              <p>You are thankful for his contribution, but yet slapped him with a quick death? Contradiction. Are you thankful for your parents' effort for building a good family environment for you, and then when they are old and sick, you ask them go die faster? I did not ignore other politicians contribution, but this is the subject of MM Lee KY, and the abuse he received here in spite of his whole life's dedication.</p>
              <p>People are always comparing, this is normal. But why didn't you compare with poorer countries? Have you ever seen on tv how primitive some of their lives are? Not enough to eat? Rapes and violence and murders? If you think you are suffering in Singapore, I do not believe, because you are still educated, have a job, and there are medical centres for you. All these are provided by who? The government who most of us voted to lead us, THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE. If you think you can do a better job, step right up! Dun just use your mouth (or rather, your keyboard).</p>
              <p>I do not gain anything by gaining sides. I just wish to knock some sense into those who are ungrateful and didn't realize that they are living in a world where others dream of living.</p>

              <p>Others?   bear in mind you porlumpar of LKY not everyone from the third world is dreaming of Singapore.    Even the PRC who work in Singapore don't think well of Singapore, they will return after they earn enough money here.</p>
              <p>Just mind your own business to stop pointing fingers if others are sharp to see the ills of LKY when you are blind.      If you want to por his lumpar do it yourself, no need to involve us and slam us when we are not poring LKY's lumpar like you do.     LKY always claim all credit to himself.   </p>
              <p>You are stucked up there, no employer in the world will keep basing on the past performance of the staff to give annual appraisal.     It does not mean he contributed in the past, now he can take us for granted by using his words against the hand that feed him.   </p>
              <p>PORLUMPAR LA YOU!     </p>
              <p>YOU expect people to be blind to only focus on his past contributions and all his evildoings are to be ignored like you do, no way will people do as you expect.  Dream on  hahahha</p>

              <p><br>don;t worship him like a god. what he did in the old days probably wasn't luck but probably was in the minds of others who may also want to contribute but do not have the chance to be in his place and shoes to execute it, if its not tom, or dick, it should be harry. some policies wasn't that sound either, if one is more predictive and with a wider further vision - to have a one child policy, no more than 2 children policy. dejavu - sounds familair? if we have made more babies, do we need to rely of foreign - ahem - 'talents' now, an excuse some one made up? politician serve and scarifice - and he is rewarded with the big fat salary - higher than the president of USA already.</p>

              <p>It's true that someone will have to do the job if its not him. But definitely not any ordinary Tom, Dick or Harry. I guess most people who take up that heavy responsibility will either fail or give up halfway. But he has been persevering there for more than 40 years already. Yes, his wealth is undeniable. But think of the CEO of the company you are working in, driving big fancy cars, living in huge mansion. Rich also. That's because he got the ability and opportunity. Can't LKY enjoy some of these as one of the country's leader too? Cannot expect him to be poorer than one of us right?</p>
              <p>He is no God of course, I dun worship him. The 2-child policy was made in 1972, which is 40 years ago. How can anyone predict what can happen in 40 years time? Now is 2011, what's the vision for 2051? Quite impossible to tell.</p>
              <p>What I mean is, its no easy to make big decisions for millions of people. Some decisions can be wrong, or can be right, I think things may be more complicated than that. I may be naive, or easy to fool. But I just see that our lives in Singapore is good, is ok, and that's the bottom line. And I feel sore seeing people cursing at an elder to die. :(</p>

If you can name one country where everyone is rich, tell me, I will take a rocket there immediately. How many kids nowadays cannot afford to go to school?

              Please do not mistake me for some pseudo acct that you might assume another forumer created to support his point.
              
              I'm just saying why penalise an old man who had to made tough choices for the sake of his country? Yes he's made bad moves that send ripples to our generation, but what about the good moves? 
              
              BTW I ain't a PAP supporter, proven with my nullified vote. But I disagree with the way people critisize and even curse an old man to his death for his mistakes when he's made good choices for the nation as well..
