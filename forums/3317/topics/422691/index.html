              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Just one year after opening its first casino, 
              observers said Singapore looked set to overtake South Korea and 
              Australia this year, to become the second-largest Asia-Pacific casino 
              market behind traditional leader Macau.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"Singapore has made a
               dramatic entry to the casino gaming market," financial consultancy 
              PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report estimating Singapore's casino 
              gaming market at $2.8 billion in 2010.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It predicted that 
              Singapore would overtake South Korea and Australia this year to become 
              the second-largest Asia-Pacific casino market behind traditional leader 
              Macau.<br><br>"In 2011, with a full-year's operation for both resorts, 
              we expect revenues to reach $5.5 billion, growing to $8.3 billion by 
              2014," it said.<br><br>The first casino opened in Malaysian-controlled 
              Resorts World Sentosa on February 14, 2010, with US-based Las Vegas 
              Sands following two months later as the world economy was still clawing 
              itself out of recession.<br><br>Resorts World Sentosa also boasts 
              Southeast Asia's first Universal Studios theme park, while Marina Bay 
              Sands has become an architectural icon with its three curving towers 
              topped off by a "SkyPark" shaped like a sleek ocean liner.<br><br>Thanks
               in large measure to the casino complexes, tourist arrivals in Singapore
               last year hit 11.6 million, breaking by far the previous record of 10.3
               million set in 2007.<br><br>Most of the visitors came from the 
              Asia-Pacific region, with mainland China, Australia, Indonesia and India
               together accounting for 53 per cent.<br><br>Tourist spending helped 
              fuel Singapore's 14.7 per cent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 
              2010, making it Asia's fastest-growing economy, after a 1.3 per cent 
              contraction in 2009.<br><br>Meanwhile, concerns of gambling addiction continue to worry civic and church groups. <br><br>"Definitely
               with the opening of the casinos, we have seen an increase in gambling 
              addicts seeking help," said Tan Lye Keng, executive director of One Hope
               Centre, a Christian welfare organisation for gambling addicts.<br><br>Mr Tan told AFP that S$100 entry levy imposed on Singaporean citizens and permanent residents failed to deter gamblers.<br><br>The government had introduced measures such as the Family Exclusion Orders (FEO) to curb gambling addiction.<br><br>Families can apply for problem gamblers to be banned from entering the casino premises.<br><br>In January, the National Council for Problem Gambling (NCPG) cut the process of FEO application by four weeks.<br><br>Later
               that month, the National Addictions Management Service said it would 
              develop self-help manuals to help problem gamblers too shy to seek 
              assistance. It said it hopes this would give addicts confidence to turn 
              to professionals for help. <br><br>But the resorts have also created 
              thousands of new jobs for Singaporeans, and tourists rave over 
              non-gambling attractions like Universal Studios.<br><br>"Visitor 
              arrivals have really come in stronger and I think that's a direct 
              spinoff from having the IRs on shore," Barclays Capital senior regional 
              economist Leong Wai Ho told AFP.<br><br>He said the resorts were 
              contributing in the region of 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of GDP, with the 
              potential for that to increase to 0.7 per cent in the near future.<br><br>"That's
               only when both casinos, both IRs are up and running fully, so we're not
               there yet actually. Contributions to date have been significant, but I 
              think the potential is for more to come," he said.<br><br>In the latest 
              financial statement issued by parent company Las Vegas Sands, Marina Bay
               Sands was shown to have raked in $1.02 billion in revenues from its 
              casino operations in 2010. <br><br>Resorts World Sentosa declined to 
              disclose specific casino revenue numbers, but its total revenue stood at
               $1.53 billion for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2010.<br><br>Las
               Vegas-based casino industry analyst Jonathan Galaviz estimated casino 
              revenue constitutes "at least 60 per cent" of the total for Resorts 
              World Sentosa.<br><br>"Tourism is a critical economic component for Singapore's economy," Galaviz told AFP.<br><br>"The
               exercise of legalising casino gaming, in the context of integrated 
              resort development, has turned out to be a successful endeavour."<br><br>But Galaviz cautioned that Singapore should not get carried away by the success of the casino-powered resorts.<br><br>"I
               believe from a public policy perspective, that Singapore should protect
               itself from gaining the perception by the outside world that it is a 
              casino-centric country," he said.<br><br>"For example, the financial 
              sector in Singapore needs Singapore to be known as a stable, serious, 
              and very ethical place for doing business," he added.<br><br>-AFP/CNA/wk</span></span></p>
