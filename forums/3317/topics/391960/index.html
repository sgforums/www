              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A five-year-old boy has become the latest - and one
              of the youngest - person to die from the Influenza A (H1N1) virus here. </span></p>
              <p><span>He was admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and was said to have caught the virus from his uncle.
              <br> <br> The boy was in critical condition over the Lunar New Year holidays.
              <br> <br> It is not clear when he died, as KKH was unable to provide details at press time.
              <br> <br> It is also not known if his uncle has recovered.
              <br> <br> The death is possibly the first since the Ministry of Health (MOH)
              downgraded its H1N1 flu alert status from yellow to green on February
              12.
              <br> <br> Before this, the youngest reported H1N1 victim in Singapore was a two-year-old boy, who died in November last year.
              <br> <br>MOH stopped reporting H1N1 fatalities after the virus was treated
              as part of the seasonal flu strains circulating in the community. <br> <br> As of September, the number of H1N1 deaths stood at 18. 
              <br> <br> According to the latest figures from MOH, the prevalence of H1N1 among patients with influenza-like illness was 28 per cent. 
              <br> <br> Overall, there are no signs of a significant rise in influenza activity in Singapore, reported the ministry. 
              <br> <br> Last week, a daily average of 2,799 patients sought treatment at
              polyclinics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs), compared with
              2,421 the week before.
              <br> <br>The weekly number of polyclinic attendances for ARIs has also
              largely been below the epidemic level since early August last year. <br> <br> But the official advice for those who have yet to get immunised is to
              get their jabs. As of early January, more than half a million vaccines
              remain uncommitted. </span></p>
