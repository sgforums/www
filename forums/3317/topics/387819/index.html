              <p>Mon, Jan 11, 2010<br> AsiaOne</p>
              <p><strong>By The AsiaOne Techbot</strong></p>
              <p>There are about 20 to 30 online brothels serving the Singapore
              'market', featuring photos and information of a few hundred call girls.</p>
              <p>In a report by Chinese evening daily, Lianhe Wanbao, the call girls
              hail from quite a few countries, including China, Thailand, the
              Philippines, Malaysia and even Russia and India.</p>
              <p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td>
              
              
               
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
               </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              Each
              call girl has a photo and 'complete' information of her vital stats.
              Some of the profiles will also state whether the call girls provide
              'extra' or 'different' services.</p>
              <p>The Lianhe Wanbao report also observed that most of the comments and
              language used on the websites were full of jargon and codes. Most
              visitors not in the know would find it difficult to understand these
              messages.</p>
              <p>It was also understood from the report that the online profiles and
              pictures may have been uploaded either by pimps or by people who
              received fees from the call girls themselves.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There are an estimated 20 to 30 such websites that cater to the Singapore 'market', the report said.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Online brothels replacing Geylang's pimps</p>
              <p><strong>By Teh Joo Lin, The Straits Times, Monday 11 Jan 2010</strong></p>
              <p>PROSTITUTES have largely retreated from the Geylang streets with daily anti-vice sweeps, but they are appearing elsewhere - on the Internet.</p>
              <p>At least seven websites are openly hawking Thai and Chinese prostitutes, a sign that pimps are increasingly tapping technology to sell sleaze beyond the red-light district.</p>
              <p>The online brothels trouble counsellors who fear they make it far too easy for people - especially the young and uninitiated - to pay for sex.</p>
              <p>Dr Carol Balhetchet, director of youth services at the Singapore Children's Society, said: "The scary part is prostitution has come to your doorstep - and it's not just available to adults."</p>
              <p>One website displays photographs of 11 foreign prostitutes in come-hither poses on the homepage. They have names such as Kiwi, Ice and Cream, and their biodata and vital statistics are listed below their pictures.</p>
              <p><br>For example, Kiwi is 24 and 1.68m tall with a 25-inch waist. She is "already in town"; her services are available at $120 for 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>Traditionally, customers have to go to brothels in Geylang. Pimps brief them on their latest offerings while they take their pick.</p>
              <p>Websites pimping for prostitutes started appearing a few years ago. With them, deals can be closed remotely with a few mouse clicks and SMSes.</p>
              <p>It starts with the customer registering on the website. After this, he tells the pimp - via SMS - who he is interested in and his preferred time slot.</p>
              <p>To help him make his choice, the customer relies on the photos and "field reports" posted by previous patrons, who get 10 per cent to 20 per cent discounts for their next sessions if they post testimonials.</p>
              <p>After the pimp - his mobile phone number is also listed on the website - replies, all that remains is for the customer to visit the designated hotel room at the appointed time. The prostitute is paid in cash after the transaction.</p>
              <p>A middle-aged customer said the online brothels are a convenient and discreet outlet since there is no longer a need to venture to the red-light district. The hotels - budget hotels in Bugis, Lavender and Little India - all fall outside the Geylang area.</p>
              <p>Geylang was the scene of daily raids by anti-vice authorities for most of last year. The police did not provide enforcement figures for the past 12 months.</p>
              <p>The brothels are still operating, but streetwalkers are now few and far between. Back in 2007, for example, so many prostitutes crowded the streets on some nights that it was difficult to drive through.</p>
              <p>While Geylang residents are happy at the improvement, pimps and owners of shops and hotels have complained of a dip in business there. There are also concerns that the prostitutes have moved elsewhere to ply their trade.</p>
              <p>A pimp said: "We're going to starve to death already. The China girls have all gone to Pearl's Centre."</p>
              <p>Islandwide, about 5,050 foreign women were arrested for vice activities in 2008, compared to 5,400 in 2007.</p>
              <p>To queries on the Geylang enforcement, a police spokesman said: "Police conduct regular islandwide enforcement operations against vice."</p>
              <p>Asked about the online brothels, the spokesman would only say: "Police will investigate reports made and take action if any offence is disclosed."</p>
              <p>The police did not say whether anyone has been arrested in connection with the online brothels.</p>
              <p>Dr Balhetchet said there should be more safeguards on the Internet to protect the young from such websites.</p>
              <p>She said: "The scary part about the young is, they want to experiment. Now, they don't need to go to Geylang...Prostitution can be more gypsy-like...In that sense, it's risky."</p>
