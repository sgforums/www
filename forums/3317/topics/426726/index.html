              <p>WE NOTE that Mr Philip Wong had written on the same subject ('Clear 
              career path for low-paid Singaporeans'; Tuesday) to the Ministry of 
              Manpower (MOM) earlier to which we had replied.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong's suggestion to abolish the S-Pass is untenable as businesses
               that require their skills will no longer invest in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Fewer jobs will be created and this will backfire on Singaporean workers.</p>
              <p>S-Pass holders help plug the gaps in the manpower pool and 
              are necessary to help grow the economy as well as help provide critical 
              services to Singaporeans in occupations such as nurses, teachers and 
              technicians.</p>
              <p>To encourage companies to hire better-qualified S-Pass 
              holders with the right skills for the jobs, we have reviewed and 
              recalibrated the eligibility criteria for S-Pass over the past few years
               so that only better qualified and more experienced applicants will be 
              issued the pass.</p>
              <p>The recent announcements on the increase in the levy on 
              S-Pass holders and the tightening of the levy tiers are aimed at 
              moderating the demand for S-Pass holders.</p>
              <p>As for Mr Wong's proposal to increase the number of sources 
              of Work Permit holders, he may wish to note that China is already an 
              approved source of Work Permit holders.</p>
              <p>However, adding more sources of Work Permit holders as 
              suggested by Mr Wong will merely add to the pool of low-cost and 
              low-skilled workers in Singapore and may instead impede ongoing efforts 
              to help the very group of Singaporeans which the Government and Mr Wong 
              both wish to help.</p>
              <p>Besides workers, businesses like Mr Wong's should also do 
              their part to press on with the productivity improvements and redesign 
              their jobs to attract more Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>To help low-skilled and low-income workers, the Government 
              has invested heavily in developing our Continuing Education and Training
               framework, and will continue to strengthen outreach efforts and lower 
              training barriers.</p>
              <p>Low-wage workers can benefit from Workfare, which provides 
              an income supplement as well as offers enhanced training support. This 
              will help to improve the employability of low-wage Singapore workers by 
              arming them with better skills so that they can take on better jobs and 
              enjoy higher wages.</p>
