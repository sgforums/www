              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">SINGAPORE:
              Singapore and the United States reaffirmed the excellent and
              long-standing bilateral defence ties between the two countries when
              Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen met his US counterpart Leon
              Panetta at the Pentagon on Thursday.<br><br>The
              two countries also underscored the shared belief that a strong US
              presence in the Asia Pacific enhances regional stability and
              security.<br><br>In
              a joint statement after their meeting, both ministers said they
              recognised the value of the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus and
              the Shangri-La Dialogue as important forums to build the confidence
              and mutual understanding needed to address regional security
              challenges. <br><br>Dr
              Ng, who is on his first official visit to Washington DC, welcomed Mr
              Panetta's commitment to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue this
              year. <br><br>Both
              sides also recognised the importance of practical cooperation -- such
              as military exercises and exchanges -- among regional militaries,
              which complements the role of dialogue in building trust and
              confidence in the region.<br><br>During
              the meeting, Mr Panetta and Dr Ng discussed a wide range of defence
              and security issues, including a proposal for the US to deploy up to
              four littoral combat ships to Singapore.<br><br>The
              warships will be deployed on a rotational basis and will not be based
              in Singapore.<br><br>The
              ministers noted that the deployment of the warships signals US
              commitment to the region and enhances its ability to train and engage
              with regional partners.<br><br>Both
              sides also noted the substantial progress made in deepening bilateral
              defence cooperation since the signing of the Strategic Framework
              Agreement (SFA) in 2005.<br><br>Dr
              Ng and Mr Panetta also agreed to increase the complexity of existing
              bilateral exercises, such as Exercise Commando Sling, to enhance
              interoperability and promote greater cooperation between both armed
              forces. <br><br>Additionally,
              the US and Singapore will enhance joint urban training opportunities
              through the use of Singapore facilities, such as the Murai Urban
              Training Facility.<br><br>The
              US and Singapore will continue to explore additional joint
              initiatives to further operationalise the SFA and facilitate US
              engagement in the region.<br><br>Earlier
              in the day, Dr Ng delivered a speech to an audience of officials and
              strategic thinkers at an event organised by Washington DC-based
              think-tank, the Center for a New American Security.<br><br>In
              his speech, Dr Ng emphasised the importance of evolving a regional
              security architecture for the Asia-Pacific region that brings
              together all key stakeholders in the region, and accommodates their
              interests and aspirations. <br><br>Stable
              military-to-military relationships were needed to maintain peace in
              the region. <br><br>Dr
              Ng said, "It is vital to evolve a regional security architecture
              which accommodates all stakeholders and rising aspirations.
              Relationships marked predominantly by strategic rivalry will increase
              the risks of friction and conflict. We must therefore engage in ways
              to increase understanding and confidence among defence
              establishments." <br><br>Dr
              Ng also noted the importance of the US' continuing role in
              maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, but raised
              concern about the potential for confrontation with China.<br><br>"As
              the balance of the world's strategic and economic weight shifts
              towards the Pacific, it is vital to evolve a regional security
              architecture, which accommodates all stakeholders and rising
              aspirations," Dr Ng said.<br><br>"Relationships
              marked predominantly by strategic rivalry will increase the risk of
              friction and conflict."<br><br>US
              officials also rejected the notion that the US is trying to contain a
              rising China.<br><br>Jon
              Huntsman, former US ambassador to Singapore and China, said, "It's
              rounding out our long-term regional security interests, which first
              and foremost is aimed toward keeping the sea lanes open for the free
              flow of trade and commerce.<br><br>"That
              has been a primary objective for many decades and when that is done
              right, all nations in the region prosper," he added.<br><br>Dr
              Ng will also meet with Secretary of the Air Force Michael B Donley
              and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan W Greenert, while he
              is in Washington DC <br><br>Thereafter,
              Dr Ng will visit the Republic of Singapore Air Force Peace Carvin V
              F-15SG fighter detachment at Mountain Home Air Force Base in
              Idaho.<br><br>-

              the Sino-US relations is a battle of power dominance rather than to achieve balance of power on the surface...
              
              it is important for China to continued her struggle to become world economic superpower...it has to be after years of communistic entrapment giving ways to US-Japan coalition decades ago....and this had done greater harm to Asia's door of economic opportunities..... and the rise of China has broken down all these power shifts and become the one country to be feared by the rest of the world...it has given more economic opportunities and save the world, particularly Europe, from near brink of global financial failure...
              
              While both countries had large trade bilateral relations, it is important to sustain peace between the two power blocs...any major conflict at this moment does not do the world any good...China must find ways to assure their peaceful rise, while US must assure with greater trust and faith...both are important military strategic partners Asia cannot do without....
