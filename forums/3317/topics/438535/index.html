              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) has reported a 58
               per cent jump in the number of complaints filed against doctors last 
              year, compared to the year before. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>To address the 
              problem, the council will review its Ethical Code and Guidelines, which 
              is expected to be finalised by the first quarter of next year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The SMC revealed 
              this at the Second Physician's Pledge Affirmation Ceremony attended by 
              380 doctors at the National University of Singapore.<br><br>Some 152 complaints were filed last year compared to 96 in 2009.<br><br>14
               cases were referred for disciplinary inquiries, while 11 cases were 
              issued letters of warning and 51 were issued letters of advice.<br><br>Common complaints among patients include professional negligence, incompetence and communication issues.<br><br>The
               SMC noted that a review of its Ethical Code and guidelines is therefore
               timely, especially since the role of doctors is now more complex, and 
              the public, more demanding.<br><br>The Ethical Code represents the 
              fundamental tenets of conduct and behaviour expected of doctors 
              practising in Singapore. It is also a guide to all practitioners as to 
              what SMC regards as the minimum standards required of them when carrying
               out their professional duties and responsibilities.<br><br>Professor 
              Tan Ser Kiat, president of SMC, said: "There are many reasons - one is 
              of course advancing technological demands and he must be more 
              knowledgeable. Second and an equally important factor is the increasing 
              demands and expectations of the public.<br><br>"From my experience, some
               of these demands and expectations are unrealistic and therefore we have
               to try to resolve that. We all know that medicine is unlike nuclear 
              physics where one plus one is always equal to two.<br><br>"The practice 
              of medicine is based on experience and outcomes, and no two patients are
               identical. So the doctor may do his best but the outcome may not 
              necessarily be what the patient is looking for".<br><br>Another problem is a surge in the number of advertisements, particularly those for lifestyle-related medical services.<br><br>Last
               year saw a 41 per cent increase in the number of such cases being 
              investigated for contravening the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics 
              (Publicity) Regulations, compared to the year before. A total of 155 
              cases were investigated last year.<br><br>The Ministry of Health said a 
              lot of the complaints had to do with consumers who said they were 
              influenced by advertisements to undergo unnecessary medical procedures. 
              These are usually aesthetic treatments.<br><br>The ministry said that 
              for this year alone, 124 healthcare licensees have been disciplined for 
              making misleading statements. These statements include claims that they 
              have the "best medical care available" or branding themselves as 
              "Singapore's No. 1 clinic".<br><br>Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said: 
              "Although there is now easier access to medical information, the 
              information needs to be contextualised and individualised. Information 
              needs to be translated by a doctor into the right treatment for the 
              right patient.<br><br>"Patients remain vulnerable and still need a 
              doctor whom they can trust to help them make sense of all the 
              information they receive."<br><br>Medical practitioners said communication is key.<br><br>The Health Ministry added the higher number of complaints could also be due to the presence of a larger pool of doctors here.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
