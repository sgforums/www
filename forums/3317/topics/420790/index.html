              <p>Well-known Singaporean plastic surgeon Martin Huang is in the spotlight again.</p>
              <p>This time, a 17-year-old girl is suing the surgeon for pain, 
              suffering, extreme mental distress and trauma arising from photographs 
              taken of her without her underwear before an operation. Her mother filed
               the lawsuit on her behalf last month.</p>
              <p>The clinic, The Specialist Surgery &amp; Laser Centre, where Dr Huang is a director, has been named as the second defendant.</p>
              <p>Both the clinic and Dr Huang have denied the allegations in their defence, filed on Monday, reported <em>The New Paper</em>. It’s not the first time Dr Huang has hit the headlines. In 2009, Dr Huang was fined $5,000 by the Singapore Medical Council and censured for professional misconduct over a cell-therapy treatment he performed.</p>
              <p>In this latest case, the girl, who is not named, visited Dr Huang’s 
              clinic with her mother and younger sister on Nov 29 last year. She 
              wanted to get a scar revision and contouring of underlying fat on her 
              left upper thigh.</p>
              <p>Her mother signed a consent form, acknowledging photographs may be taken as part of confidential medical records.</p>
              <p>An hour later, the girl was brought to an operating room where she 
              removed her clothes and put on disposable underwear, a medical gown and 
              an overcoat.</p>
              <p>She was soon informed photographs would be taken, and after some 
              discussion, she was allowed to wear her bra but a nurse removed her 
              underwear. During the 20-minute process which involved Dr Huang, a 
              nurse, another female staff member and a photographer, the girl said she
               “felt that her privacy had been completely violated”.</p>
              <p>A total of seven photos were taken of her upper thigh and 
              surrounding area. No pictures of the girl’s face or upper body were 
              taken. But she claims that Dr Huang and the nurse did not bother to 
              explain or reassure her why she had to remove her underwear for the 
              photo-taking process.</p>
              <p>She said she felt humiliated, afraid and confused after the surgery and recounted the incident to her mother over the phone.</p>
              <p>She claimed to have suffered severe mood swings and was depressed for
               a few days after the incident. She said she had to seek post-operative 
              care at another clinic.</p>
              <p>She also claimed the consent form did not state that full nudity was 
              involved and that Dr Huang had failed to treat her in a professional 
              manner, abused his position of trust as her doctor and was negligent in 
              performing his duty of care.</p>
              <p>She further alleged Dr Huang and clinic staff had committed trespass to her by way of assault and battery.</p>
              <p>The girl is also seeking a court order for the delivery of all the 
              photos in documentary and electronic form and for the photos to be 
              deleted from the computer database.</p>
              <p>No amounts were specified in the lawsuit but damages sought include 
              medical expense claims and transport expenses to another clinic, said <em>TNP</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>WHO TO BELIEVE?</strong></p>
              <p>In their defence, Dr Huang and the clinic said the girl and mother 
              “expressly consented” to the photo-taking of the scare and surrounding 
              area.</p>
              <p>Dr Huang and the clinic denied the allegations of negligence, battery
               and assault. They claimed the girl’s pain, mental distress and trauma, 
              if any, were caused by what happened between the girl and her parents 
              after the operation.</p>
              <p>They claimed the girl appeared comfortable while waiting in the 
              operating room. Dr Huang said he explained that photos of her lower 
              torso and thigh would have to be taken to document her pre-operative 
              condition and to assist in the post-operative analysis.</p>
              <p>It was his standard practice to request she remove her clothes so the
               photographer could take photos of the scar. They claimed to have told 
              her the photos would be taken quickly.</p>
              <p>Dr Huang and the clinic claimed the photo-taking was uneventful and 
              the girl “voluntarily positioned herself” as instructed. The session 
              took less than three minutes and the girl’s face was not photographed, 
              they said.</p>
              <p>The girl apparently was “cheerful” during and immediately after the 
              procedure. She looked pleased and said goodbye to Dr Huang before she 
              left the room.</p>
              <p>However, according to Dr Huang, she became “increasingly upset” in a 
              subsequent phone conversation with her mum. She then told a nurse her 
              mother was upset her underwear had been removed, to which the latter 
              replied that it was standard procedure and part of the medical 
              management for her condition.</p>
              <p>After the girl again spoke to her parents on the phone and appeared 
              upset, the nurse took over and spoke to them. But they refused to accept
               the explanation for the removal of the underwear.</p>
              <p>When she left, the teen “was clearly upset by what her parents had 
              said to her, and how she should answer to her parents’ accusations,” 
              they alleged.</p>
              <p>Plastic surgeons told Yahoo! Singapore it is standard procedure to take photos of patients.</p>
              <p>Dr Woffles Wu said, “It’s 100 per cent neccessary to take photographs
               of any body part that is being operated on. And if it’s at the thigh 
              and groin area, you have to remove the panties.”</p>
              <p>He will not perform procedures on patients who refuse to take photos.
               “It protects us and the client as well. In case of a dispute, the photo
               is there for evidence of what has or hasn’t been done.”</p>
              <p>To prevent miscommunications, Dr Wu said, “You have to discuss things with patients thoroughly before hand”.</p>
              <p>He added, patients also have to be “mature” to accept that results 
              may not be as discussed since plastic surgery is an “inexact science”.</p>
              <p>Perhaps there should have been clearer explanation in this situation,
               said Dr Ivor Lim. He agreed that ”plastic surgeons always take 
              photographs of the patient” to asses pre- and post-operation results.</p>
              <p>But Dr Lim will defer to patients’ request if they insist on not being photographed. </p>
              <p>Last year, the Consumers Association of Singapore received four cases
               of feedback regarding unsatisfactory results from plastic surgery. 
              There were no cases in 2009, and six in 2008.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The practice of <em>"photo-taking before and after"</em> cosmetic surgery is to ensure protections to both parties. It acts as a legal evidence if there's any dispute... It's wildly practice in the industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway.. probably that girl wasn't brief correctly prior to the phototaking, that's why she feels photo-taking is invasive..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Admin staff is at fault because they do not understand the importance of communicating this clearly to the clients... (the mother and daughter). Only when they fully understood every clause in the document, then they can sign the doc...</p>
              <p>The client (both mother and daughter) is at fault too.. Before signing onto that line, the client must understand every clause.. that includes the photo-taking..</p>
