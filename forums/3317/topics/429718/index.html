                                      in time, the PAP is far more approachable than it was

              <p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maybe in the past,
                                      there were issues to be resolved and, of course, there was no time

              <p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Retrenchment is good

              <p>************************* Tin Pei Ling interview as new
                                      candidate *************************<br> Interviewer: <strong>What’s your greatest regret? What’s the first
                                      thing you wanted to do after you became a
                                      candidate?<br></strong></p>
              <p>Tin Pei Ling: <strong>The greatest regret is that I didn’t
                                      manage to bring my parents to Universal Studios before then,
                                      because I, I foresee that in the upcoming days, it will be very
                                      busy.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Er.. and because I have been in the grassroots, I
                                      understand that the schedule for MPs.. the commitment is very
                                      high.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>So er.. at the moment, I’m not sure whether er.. when..
                                      how soon can I bring my parents to Universal Studio because I did
                                      promise them that I want to bring them there.. cos my mom is like,
                                      quite excited over it.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>So, um, I, I guess er, when there is a time, I
                                      would, I would like to bring them.. there. Actually all this time
                                      my.. my parents are very important to me. So...I must say I’m glad
                                      that before this, I managed to bring them to Italy.. where my..
                                      it’s somewhere that my father has always dreamed of going. So after
                                      so many years of er.. working so hard to raise the family, I
                                      managed to fulfill that wish.. and ......... I feel very great
                                      about it.</strong></p>

              <p>Is this the kind of quality candidate that Marine Parade GRC is
                                      fielding?  See also

              <p>A speech is something that can be crafted beforehand with
                                      assistance. But Tin Pei Lin's replies to impromptu questions will
                                      surely have to be a true depiction of her own egg-headed
                                      standing.<br> <br> What annoyed me most was that an unprepared candidate, could
                                      potentially be getting a cushy salary (the figure of S$15000 was
                                      thrown around on the internet) which is basically taxpayers money,
                                      when there are people out there far more qualified in their
                                      vocations who are only paid a fraction of that. I know a couple of
                                      people who I would love to see as candidates – Au Waipang and
                                      mrbrown for their intelligence, wit and most of all, compassion.
                                      Tin Pei Ling is getting into parliament simply by teaming up with Goh
