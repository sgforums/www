              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's inflation rate rose to 5.2 per cent on-year in March 2012, from 4.6 per cent the previous month.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This was attributed to a sharper increase in COE premiums which led to higher car prices. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>According to the 
              Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and 
              Industry (MTI), "private road transport cost added 1.3 percentage points
               to CPI-All Items inflation in March, slightly more than twice its 
              contribution in February".<br><br>Meanwhile, prices of retail items, 
              such as clothing and footwear, rose more moderately compared to the 
              previous month. Clothing and footwear prices rose 1.2 per cent 
              year-on-year in March compared to 1.6 per cent year-on-year the previous
               month.<br><br>Services and food inflation were broadly stable, at 3.0 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively.<br><br>The
               MAS' measure of core inflation, which excludes accommodation and 
              private road transport, eased to 2.9 per cent in March compared to a 
              year earlier, from 3.0 per cent in February.<br><br>In a statement, the 
              MAS said inflation will likely remain elevated over the next few months,
               before easing gradually in the second half of this year. It reiterated 
              that the CPI-All items inflations is expected to average around 5 per 
              cent year-on-year in the first half of this year, while core inflation 
              is forecast to hover around 3 per cent.<br><br>Accommodation cost will 
              contribute more than a third to CPI-All Items inflation this year as 
              "leasing contracts continue to be renewed at rentals that are 
              considerably higher than those under existing contracts, especially in 
              the HDB segment". Other drivers of inflation include higher car prices 
              and services fees, as "wages and other costs will likely continue to 
              pass through to consumer prices". <br><br>For the year, MAS expects the 
              CPI-All Items inflation to be 3.5 to 4.5 per cent while Core Inflation 
              will likely be in the range of 2.5 to 3.0 per cent. <br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Govt closely monitoring inflation: DPM Tharman</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and 
              Manpower Tharman Shanmugaratnam has assured Singaporeans that the 
              government is closely monitoring inflation including prices of everyday 
              goods and services.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking at the May 
              Day dinner, he noted that inflation remains an important challenge and 
              one that union leaders are most concerned about.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This year's May Day 
              dinner comes at a time of continuing uncertainty in the global economy, 
              caused especially by the problems in Europe, said Mr Tharman.<br><br>In Singapore however, he said the economy is not in a bad shape.<br><br>"Our
               unemployment rate remains lower than in most other countries. This is 
              due to the very large number of jobs created last year. With the 
              economic slowdown, we have seen a pick-up in redundancies since the last
               quarter of 2011, and can expect a slight increase in unemployment in 
              the short term as displaced workers take some time to find new jobs," 
              said Mr Tharman.<br><br>Singapore's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 
              about 5.2 per cent in March 2012 compared to a year ago and he said this
               is a high figure.<br><br>However, he also explained that this does not mean that the average Singaporean will feel this high inflation.<br><br>That
               is because more than half of the headline inflation rate of 5.2 per 
              cent came from higher COEs for cars and the effect of higher market rent
               on houses. <br><br>Mr Tharman assured that the vast majority of 
              Singaporeans who already own their homes and are not buying new cars 
              will not feel the effects of these sharp increases. <br><br>Mr Tharman 
              also said the increase in prices of daily necessities and essential 
              services such as food and clothing have actually been much more moderate
               at three per cent or lower.<br><br>"The vast majority of Singaporeans, 
              who already own their homes and are not buying a new car, will not feel 
              the effects of these sharp increases. The increase in prices of daily 
              necessities and essential services, such as food, clothing &amp; 
              footwear and education, has actually been much more moderate, at three 
              per cent or lower. The inflation in actual household expenditures for 
              most Singaporeans is hence lower than five per cent," said Mr Tharman.<br><br>He
               added: "Nevertheless, we are closely monitoring the situation, 
              including prices of everyday goods and services. MAS has been 
              strengthening the value of our dollar to reduce the impact of imported 
              inflation. The government has taken actions to cool the property market.
               Although property prices are not part of the consumer price index, in 
              an overheated property market, many other prices can also go up. We will
               keep a close watch on the property market.<br><br>"In the meantime too,
               the government is providing some help for Singaporean households to 
              cope with the rising cost of living. This year, we introduced GST 
              vouchers, which will help lower income Singaporeans and especially our 
              older folk with their expenses."<br><br>Mr Tharman noted that the 
              National Wages Council has been discussing the wage guidelines for 2012 
              and 2013 and he is sure that they will consider all factors carefully 
              before making their recommendations, expected by June. <br><br>Mr 
              Tharman hopes that the guidelines will allow workers to get their fair 
              share from the growth over the past year and get wage increases that can
               be sustained while still ensuring that businesses in Singapore remain 
              competitive and continue to generate good jobs. <br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
