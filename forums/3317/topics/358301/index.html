              <p>About 150 members from Singapore's arts community cast their votes
              today to propose two persons whom they feel would make the cut as
              Nominated Members of Parliament.</p>
              <p><em>Melanie Yip</em> was there to witness the 3-hour voting process of the Arts N-M-P candidates.</p>
              <p>Three candidates stood before a considerable turnout at Theater
              Works as each made a pitch on who would give arts a greater voice in
              parliament.</p>
              <p>They were Substation's Artistic Co-Director, Audrey Wong, Theater
              Director Loretta Chen and Managing Director of Arts Management
              Associates, Dr Robert Liew.</p>
              <p>In the end, the arts community selected Ms Wong and Ms Chen.</p>
              <p>Ms Wong won more than 50 percent of the 152 votes cast.</p>
              <p>While both acknowledged the pressures that come with the
              responsibility as NMPs, they were nonetheless excited about the
              opportunity.</p>
              <p>Substation's Ms Wong on how she intends to bridge the different voices within the arts community.</p>
              <p>"It is also important for this person to have her own position. She
              has to be able to speak about things that are important to her while
              also listening. I think it is important to listen to the different
              views from the arts community. And we need to find ways to filter out
              the different views, and if necessary to direct people's questions to
              the right person."</p>
              <p>Theater director, Loretta Chen, on the other hand, hopes to develop platforms for more open dialogues and constructive feedback.</p>
              <p>"I think in Singapore, we either slam something or choose to not
              take part. Even for a child, the minute you tell them "wow you did
              great but you could have done it better" That means a lot and speaks
              volumes. Perhaps we do mean well, but sometimes we are unable to give
              constructive feedback to artistes, and that is important when we are
              able to give constructive feedback and also to be more positive in our
              feedback to the artistes."</p>
              <p>The names of Ms Audrey Wong and Ms Loretta Chen will be submitted to the National Arts Council for consideration to be NMPs.</p>
              <p>The council is expected to confirm their endorsement by next week.</p>
              <p>If neither of the two proposed candidates secure the council's
              endorsement, organizers of today's voting process say they will endorse
              the two names as independent nominees.</p>
              <p>Media, arts and sports organizations constitute one of six functional groups invited to nominate candidates for the NMP post.</p>
              <p>The deadline for NMP applications closes on 11th May.</p>
