              FH has already begun getting fewer by the day and the wealth divide is worsening. Also, $inkies are becoming the slaves/puppets to many of these foreigner owned companies (PAP foreigner friends???) who have the POWER to dictate your property value just by making malicious public announcements: e.g. that the lease will NOT be renewed (i.e. announcemenmts that <strong>will totally demolish any enbloc value/hope</strong>, just like <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.academia.edu/1863396/Voting_your_way_into_a_slum_Singapores_election_dilemma">GCT abused his moral authority by attempting to turn opposition held districts into slums by vetoing gahmen run upgrading projects in opposition held districts</a>).<br><br>PAP so good at pretending to protect Singaporean rights and<a style="color: #005688;" href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/video/world-cup-pioneer-generation-package-081945153.html"> spent a billion on the Brian Rich man pioneer package (world cup) advertisement (appears during EVERY MEDIACORPSE programme)</a> that now I either hate pioneers or hate the world cup altogether. So why hold hands with foreign companies and share holders to manipulate and decrease Singaporeans rights???!!!<br><br>BTW: foreigner has to jump hoops to buy Singapore landed property to put $inkies first, so manipulate freehold title is okay, just because most Sinkies are too stupid/ stressed-out to voice complain???!!!</div>

              The rule allow companies to obtain gahmen like rights to manipulate the market by retaining freehold title whilst reissuing a lease hold one . Gahmen are elected so there is 5yrly check and balance. But for pte developers to have such rights, there are only 2 possibilities:<br>1) PAP is in bed with enemy, overlooked this anormaly because palms greased.<br>2) PAP neglected protecting Singaporean's rights because PAP sleeping on the job.<br><br>Singaporean's loss is the gain of shareholders in these MNC companies, many of these shareholders possibly foreigners/ foreigner pension funds etc. In the case of (1): politicians with greased palms obviously receive $$$bribes.<br><br>I do hope that only the 2nd possibility is valid, cos if it is the reason of the first instance, than that proves that $inkie politicians are not just stupid, but also corrupt to say the least.<br><br>Even money changers cannot give out loans (they are not registered $ lenders) so why are Singapore licensed private developers being encouraged to take on loan sharking roles???!!!</div>
