              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concrete structure outside Tampines HDB unit gives way</span></strong></p>
              <div>SINGAPORE: A concrete structure that gave way outside a four-storey HDB block along Tampines Street 23 has been removed, after close to seven hours. No one was hurt as a result of the incident that happened on Sunday morning (Sep 25).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/blob/3154356/1474773641000/tampines-hdb-structure-collapse-data.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>The structure serves as a sun shield for a unit on the fourth storey of Block 201E. According to Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC Cheng Li Hui, an engineer and safety officer have assessed the situation.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Tampines Town Council, which is the building owner of the HDB block, was directed by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to engage a professional engineer to advise on the necessary measures to remove the dislodged sun breaker, as well as to carry out a detailed investigation and recommend permanent rectification works.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The professional engineer engaged by Tampines Town Council has inspected and assessed that the structural integrity of the main building is not affected by the incident, said BCA.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>A sun breaker on the third floor was also damaged during the fall but Ms Cheng said the structure will “unlikely” be removed on Sunday as it may not be safe to do so. “It’s still quite attached, so we will be building a proper platform and we will be looking at removing it over the next week,” she said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>BCA also said that as an added safety precaution, the professional engineer is also required to inspect all the other HDB blocks in the area with similar architectural facade.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Meanwhile, a statement from HDB said that the sun breaker is "non-structural in nature and will not affect the building’s structural integrity". </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"HDB engineers have inspected the block and ascertained that the building is structurally safe. There were no injuries," the emailed response added. "Our engineers are investigating the cause of the incident."</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>According to an eyewitness who spoke with Channel NewsAsia, the sun breaker fell at around 10am. “I heard sounds of glass shattering,” she said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The owner of the affected unit, Mr Choo Keat Thin, said an HDB officer has been called to check the internal structure of his flat.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"I was watching TV, and I heard a 'boom' sound," said Mr Choo. "So I came to the window to take a look and I saw the beam fell. I thought this beam will cause danger to the public downstairs, so I call 999.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"It's a shock to realise that such a big part of the external block ... to just collapse and, luckily it did not roll over and hit the bottom or the flat below."</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>While HDB and town council officers waited for the arrival of a crane to remove the structure, HDB and town council officers used some cables and a net to hold up the sun breaker. The area was cordoned off, with police at the scene. </div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ultrasound checks on sunbreakers at 4 Tampines HDB blocks</span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: From Friday (Sep 30), the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will use ultrasound scanning equipment to check the condition of all sunbreakers in Block 201E Tampines St 23, as well as the surrounding blocks 201A, 201B and 201D on Tampines St 21.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The checks come after a sunbreaker on the fourth storey of block 201E gave way last Sunday. The dislodged sunshade has been removed and taken to a laboratory, where investigations are still ongoing to determine the cause of the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB earlier assessed that the structural integrity of the building was not compromised, and is working with the Tampines Town Council on the necessary repairs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While no physical signs of cracks were found at block 201E and the three neighbouring blocks, HDB says the ultrasound scans will be able to test for the presence of metal reinforcement bars embedded within each sunshade as this is one of the areas being investigated. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The scans at block 201E are expected to be completed within a week. Checks will also be carried out progressively on the other three blocks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters at a site visit to the affected block on Friday, the area's Member of Parliament, Cheng Li Hui, said she had spoken to residents to reassure them of their safety - particularly those on the third storey where the dislodged part had damaged the sunbreaker on their floor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Some of the residents are concerned because they are worried about the safety of the third level, and we reassured them that the engineers have certified that the third level is safe," said Ms Cheng. "But we put in tension cords as a precaution just to assure them that there's a second barrier of safety as well in place for them."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She added that, based on feedback, it was business as usual for most shops in the area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB said it will share the results of the investigation and any follow-up measures after completion of the site checks and lab work, and asked the public to not speculate on the cause of the incident.</p>
