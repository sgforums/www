              <p><strong>Vatican says in touch with Iran over stoning case</strong></p>
              <p>CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AFP) - – The Vatican said on Sunday it was in
               contact with Tehran over the case of an Iranian woman sentenced to 
              death by stoning for adultery amid a global diplomatic push for 
              clemency.</p>
              <p>The Vatican said it was using "diplomatic channels" to intervene in the case, while Italy urged Iran for a "act of clemency".</p>
              <p>Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, a 43-year-old mother of two, is facing 
              the death penalty after being convicted of having an extramarital 
              relationship in a case that has sparked an international campaign for 
              her release.</p>
              <p>"The Holy See is following this affair with attention and 
              commitment," Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said in a statement 
              issued in response to journalists' questions on the matter.</p>
              <p>"The position of the Church, opposed to the death penalty, is known and stoning is a particularly brutal form," he said.</p>
              <p>Intervention by the head of the Roman Catholic Church on 
              humanitarian questions takes place through diplomatic channels, and this
               sort of action has been taken a number of times in the past, the 
              statement said.</p>
              <p>Pope Benedict XVI did not make any mention of the case at the traditional Angelus blessing on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini on Sunday called
               on Tehran to grant clemency in the case, the ANSA news agency reported.</p>
              <p>While reiterating his "full respect for Iranian sovereignty," 
              Frattini said "only an act of clemency could save the life of this 
              person."</p>
              <p>He added that contacts had taken place with the Iranian embassy in Rome.</p>
              <p>Frattini also recently said he had arranged to meet his Iranian 
              counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of the forthcoming UN 
              General Assembly in New York.</p>
              <p>The plight of Mohammadi-Ashtiani, who was also convicted of being an
               accomplice in her husband's death, which she has denied, has caused a 
              global uproar.</p>
              <p>Tehran meanwhile has provisionally suspended the death sentence.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, Mohammadi-Ashtiani's son Sajjad said she had also been 
              sentenced to 99 lashes for a photo of her without a headscarf published 
              in a British newspaper.</p>
              <p>A French petition has been signed by two former French presidents 
              and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>
              <p>A hardline Iranian newspaper branded Bruni-Sarkozy a prostitute for 
              signing the petition, with the French government describing the slur as 
              "unacceptable".</p>
              <p>France has urged the European Union to threaten new sanctions 
              against the Iranian regime over the stoning case, while EU foreign 
              policy chief Catherine Ashton said talks were taking place with Tehran.</p>
              <p>Mohammadi-Ashtiani's son called on the international community to 
              continue the campaign, and appealed to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio 
              Lula da Silva to use his country's ties with Iran to assist in her 
              release.</p>
              <p>Lula has already tried in vain to convince Iran to let Mohammadi-Ashtiani take asylum in Brazil instead of being executed.</p>

              <p>What happened to the 100th lash?</p>
              <p>Is it because they purposely make it into odd numbers so that it is difficult for the Judge to give discount?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Victim: Clemancy!!! Give me a good price please!</p>
              <p>Judge: Ok! ..... *PAUSE*......!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Judge: What is 10% of 99 lashes?</p>
              <p>Slave of Judge: Your Honour! 9.9 lashes!</p>
              <p>Judge: Thanks Slave! Victim!!! Due to impracticality of  giving 89.1 lashes, I am unable to give you any discount.</p>
              <p>Judge: Enjoy the lashes! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
