              <p><strong>MOE to review initiatives aimed at keeping drop-out rate low</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) will review
              initiatives aimed at getting students to stay in school. It said more
              will be done to help the schools keep their drop-out rate low. </span></p>
              <p><span>The ministry's target is to keep the drop-out rate in both
              primary and secondary schools at 1.5 per cent in 2010. It achieved that
              target last year and the figure was maintained this year. <br> <br> Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education Masagos Zulkifli said it is impossible to have an attrition rate of zero per cent.
              <br> <br> About three years ago, the drop-out rate was about four to five per
              cent. It went down to three per cent and then to 1.5 per cent last
              year.
              <br> <br>He said: "If you look at the 1.5 per cent, it is an absolutely
              small number. In many countries where I have visited, when we tell them
              our attrition rate is 1.5 per cent, they almost always fall off their
              chair, because what to them is manageable is always around five to
              seven per cent, which is what they're going towards and find hard to
              achieve."
              <br> <br>Even so, the ministry is not giving up on those who have dropped
              out. But for now, the focus is to enhance the initiatives aimed at
              keeping the drop-out rate low. <br> <br> Mr Masagos said: "We want to ensure that the programmes that we run in
              these schools do not get routinised, (and) students do not feel that
              they are somewhat disadvantaged. We will look at and review the
              programmes over time, get feedback from the ground.
              <br> <br> "If we need to increase the funding, we will. If we need to increase the number of programmes, we will." 
              <br> <br>One such item is the Time-out programme which targets students that
              have poor school attendance. Some 80 schools have applied for up to
              S$12,000 worth of funds each to start the programme. <br> <br> Telok Kurau Secondary School is one them. Five of the six students
              involved in the programme have been coming to school regularly. Before
              they were put on the programme, they were habitual absentees, sometimes
              staying away from school for months at a stretch.
              <br> <br>The school also started its very own initiative, known as SWISS or
              School Within a School System, last year. Normal technical students are
              able to take up courses in hairstyling and beauty, so as to keep them
              engaged in school. <br> <br> Mohd Taufiq Abdul Rahman, a student, said: "During Sec one and two, I
              was not interested in school and was always late coming to school. So
              after this programme was introduced to me, I started to like coming to
              school. Sometimes after school I will stay back in school and do my
              work too, so this place is like a home already."
              <br> <br>In fact, teachers said none of the 140 students involved have
              dropped out from school so far. The school said it intends to expand
              both the Time-out and SWISS programme next year. </span></p>
