               singer-actress Gigi Leung announced Saturday via her micro blog that 
              she will be marrying her 36-year-old Spanish boyfriend Sergio on the 
              Spanish island of Ibiza on Monday, reported Hong Kong media.<br><br>"I am getting married! This is the happiest moment of my life, thank you everyone for your well wishes!<br><br>"I
               am grateful that I can meet someone in this lifetime who is so kind, so
               full of positive energy, who makes me happy and loves me!" gushed Leung
               in a post on her micro blog.<br><br>"I am stepping into another stage 
              of my life. I know there are a lot of things in life I have to continue 
              to learn! I will work hard! <br><br>"Hopefully, everyone will find their own happiness and bless this happy bride!" added the 35-year-old star.<br><br>Leung
               met Sergio in February this year at a friend's dinner party in 
              Barcelona, but only started dating him in April when he followed her to 
              Hong Kong and lavished flowers on her.<br><br>Two months later, Sergio proposed in Barcelona.<br><br>"He
               brought me to a palace. He knew there would be very few people there at
               the time. I thought we were just going to look around but once we got 
              in, he kneeled and brought out a bouquet of roses as well as a ring," 
              said Leung.<br><br>Leung wanted to consult her mother before making such a big decision so she turned him down.<br><br>But Sergio never gave up and she finally gave him the nod when he proposed again in July.<br><br>"At a hotel, he arranged roses into a 'Marry Me' message and put a ring on my finger. I cried and agreed," said Leung.<br><br>The
               singer-actor, who had previously dated Hong Kong star Ekin Cheng and a 
              French furniture designer named Sly, revealed that her mother was very 
              satisfied with Sergio, a man whom Leung lovingly described as having 
              restored her faith in love.<br><br>"He is really, really good, he dotes on me," said Leung.</span></span></p>

              <p>Karen Mok gets hitched in Florence</p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>FLORENCE, ITALY: 
              Hong Kong singer-actress Karen Mok married her 41-year-old German 
              boyfriend Johannes on Saturday, at a chapel in Florence, Italy.<br><br>The
               wedding saw Mok in a graceful, lacy white gown and wearing 
              one-of-a-kind custom-made Ferragamo heels, exchange her vows with 
              Johannes while his three daughters looked on.<br><br>Although Mok's 
              celebrity friends like Carina Lau, Christine Fan and Pace Wu were not 
              present at the wedding, they all congratulated her via their micro 
              blogs.<br><br>Mok had earlier revealed that she will honeymoon in Europe until November and had no plans for children yet.<br><br>Johannes is Mok's first love.<br><br>The 41-year-old star first met Johannes, who now holds a senior position in a financial institution, when she was just 17.<br><br>They were both studying at a university in Italy but Mok broke up with him after dating him for a year.<br><br>They met once more at an alumni gathering in Italy, in 2000, and she found out that Johannes was married with three children.<br><br>Johannes eventually got divorced and the pair became lovers again some two years ago before eventually deciding to get hitched.<br><br>-CNA/ha</span></span></p>
