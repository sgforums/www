This is a terrorist attack!" I had just received word that a 
                  second plane had plunged into the World Trade Center in New York. Thirty
                   minutes later I would learn that another plane had hit the Pentagon.<br> "You have to go to the bunker, now!" the Secret Service agent yelled at 
                  me. "There are planes flying into buildings all over Washington. The 
                  White House has got to be next."<br> As I was almost lifted off my feet and pushed toward the safety of the 
                  Presidential Emergency Operations Center, I stopped to call President 
                  George Bush.<br> "You can't come back here," I said.<br> "I'm coming back," he replied.<br> "Stay where you are," I answered, raising my voice in a way that I had 
                  never done and would never do again to the President of the United 
                  States. "We, I mean, the United States is under attack."<br> For those of us in office on that day, it is as if time was suspended. 
                  For us and for the victims' families, every day since then has been Sept
                   12.<br> Our sense of what constituted security and what it takes to protect the 
                  country had been irrevocably altered. The United States, the most 
                  militarily and economically powerful country on Earth, had experienced a
                   devastating attack. And it had been carried out by a stateless band of 
                  extremists, operating from the territory of what was at the time a 
                  failed state, Afghanistan.<br> In the months after the attack, we reflected again and again on the 
                  deeper causes. What could provoke the hatred that led people to fly air 
                  planes into buildings on that bright September day?<br> Ten years later, it is clear that 9/11 made encouraging democracy and supporting political institutions a global necessity.<br> In 2002, a group of Arab scholars at the United Nations issued the Arab 
                  Human Development Report, identifying three gaps - respect for human 
                  freedom, women's empowerment and access to knowledge - that are holding 
                  back the progress of millions of people. And these gaps do even more 
                  harm: They cause the hopelessness that in turn creates a vacuum into 
                  which extremism and hatred flow.<br> This is the link between what happened on 9/11 and the urgency of democratic reform throughout the Middle East. <span style="color: red;">For
                   60 years, the US sought stability at the expense of democracy in 
                  supporting authoritarian regimes. But we should have known better.<br> If people have no way to hold their governments accountable through peaceful change, they will do so violently. <br> There is a reason that extremists are the most organised political 
                  forces in the Middle East today. Authoritarians did not permit politics 
                  in the public square and thus "politics" went instead into the radical 
                  mosques and madrassas.</span><br> Now decent political forces - those that will defend women's rights and 
                  religious and ethnic tolerance - will need the time to organise 
                  themselves to fill the void. Authoritarianism is simply unsustainable. 
                  As difficult as the journey to democracy may be, it is the only pathway 
                  to true stability.<br> <br> FREEDOM CANNOT BE DENIED<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GlItm7WfHeI/Tmk-lcm-UCI/AAAAAAAAAYA/O_thwJY50bo/s1600/Protesters+march+through+Sanaa%252C+Yemen%252C+on+Sunday+...JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GlItm7WfHeI/Tmk-lcm-UCI/AAAAAAAAAYA/O_thwJY50bo/s200/Protesters+march+through+Sanaa%252C+Yemen%252C+on+Sunday+...JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br> The killing of Osama bin Laden just a few months before the 10th 
                  anniversary of 9/11 and the eruption of the Arab Spring in the same year
                   bring together the lessons of that devastating day. Extremism will 
                  wither as people gain legitimate means to control their future. I do not
                   believe that extremism will win when the public square allows the open 
                  debate of ideas.<br> Political institutions will come into being - weak at first but 
                  ultimately necessary to define the relationship between the authority of
                   the state and the rights of the individual.<br> In Baghdad and Kabul, citizens are trying to use their new democratic 
                  institutions to secure better lives as free men and women. That road is 
                  long but at least they are on their way with constitutions that define 
                  the relationships between those who govern and those who consent to be 
                  governed.<br> The people who are experiencing glimpses of freedom in Egypt, Libya, 
                  Syria, Tunisia and across the Middle East have just begun to build the 
                  institutions that will secure their liberties. And in some places, 
                  dictators are fighting to hold back the day when they will fall. Freedom
                   can be delayed but not denied.<br> Since 9/11, we have come to understand that no country can secure itself
                   in isolation and that helping failed states heal is no longer simply a 
                  matter of largesse - it is now a necessity.<br> Consequently the US has pursued a foreign policy that is as practical as
                   it is compassionate and transformative: We encourage economic and 
                  social development, we promote the empowerment and protection of the 
                  vulnerable, and we strive for a civilised and ultimately more peaceful 
                  world.<br> These ideals transcend political parties and form the basic core values 
                  for which American democracy stands and those that we, as American 
                  citizens, represent.<br> In the days to come, those who perished on 9/11 will be honoured by 
                  family and friends and fellow citizens and sympathetic people around the
                   world. The lives lost can never be regained - leaving grieving parents 
                  and children, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters who will never 
                  quite be whole again.<br> But perhaps there is some comfort for them - for all of us - in knowing 
                  that there was far greater meaning in the horrors of that day. Because 
                  of the fortitude of the United States, 9/11 is not a day that reminds us
                   of defeat or vulnerability or a global power's supposed decline.<br> It is a day that rallies us, in tragedy and in victory, to declare that 
                  freedom will prevail. Many of us have been blessed with God's gift of 
                  freedom. It is our responsibility and our work never to tire until it is
                   universally enjoyed. @Condoleeza Rice (Distributed by The New York 
                  Times)<br> <br> <span style="font-size: xx-small;">Condoleezza Rice was Secretary of State from 2005 to 
                  2008. She was national security adviser from 2001 to 2005. She is a 
                  professor of political economy at the graduate school of business at 
                  Stanford University, in Palo Alto, California; a senior fellow on public
                   policy at the Hoover Institution there; and a professor of political 
                  science at the university. Her book, to be published on Nov 1, is No 
                  Higher Honor. On Sept 11, 2001, Ms Rice was in her West Wing office at 
                  the White House when she learned from one of her aides about the attack 
                  on the World Trade Center.</span><br> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC110906-0000262/Why-democracy-prevails">http://www.todayonline.com/Commentar...cracy-prevails</a></p>

                   the buddhism sutra, Buddha Sakyamuni was a king-to-be and enjoyed both 
                  milirary, economy and martial art prowess. He chose to renounce because 
                  the power of both military and economic are not the long term solution 
                  to abusiveness. Abusive begets abusive while love begets love. According
                   to the sutra, this is a degenerating era from the average age of 84,000
                   gradually degenerates into the average age of 10 years old, where a 
                  substraction of one year in every 100 years. In this denegerative era, 
                  human is getting more and more abusive due to lack of culture self to 
                  live harmoniously for the well beings of humanism and earth.</p>

              <p>This is remarkably awesome and hope that US will regain its consciousness from its authoritarianism

                  short period of time with the support of the people of America to recognize the essential to 
                  succeed in this transformative era of good fortune for all.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
