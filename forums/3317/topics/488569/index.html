              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">A man was shot dead after he rammed through the barricades at a Police checkpoint near Shangri-La hotel early this morning, May 31.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">The Singapore Police Force (SPF) confirmed in a <a style="color: #0a69c5; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.facebook.com/singaporepoliceforce/posts/10153983059339408">Facebook post</a> that one man was shot dead and two others were detained in an incident in the vicinity of the Shangri-La hotel at 4.36 am.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">The trio was earlier stopped at a Police vehicular checkpoint set up along Ardmore Park. When asked to open the car boot for checks, the driver suddenly accelerated the vehicle towards Anderson Road.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">Despite Police warnings to stop, the driver continued to crash through Police barricades, endangering the lives of the officers.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">Police opened fire at the vehicle to stop further danger.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">The vehicle subsequently stopped at the junction of Orange Grove Road and Anderson Road.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">Substances believed to be drugs were found on one of the persons detained.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">Police are in control of the situation. Orange Grove Road, Anderson Road and Ardmore Park are temporarily closed to facilitate police operations. Members of public are advised to stay away from the area.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">Due to the ongoing Shangri-La Dialogue, security measures including vehicle and person check points have been put in place in the vicinity of the Shangri-La hotel.</p>

              <p>She's one of several people living near Shangri-La Hotel who were disturbed by a commotion in the early hours of Sunday morning. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Condominium resident Rachel Maher, 42, heard two shots being fired at 4.17am. Then a horn sounded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The U.S. resident lives on the 11th storey of Admore II condominium. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She said: "We went out to the open area where the service elevator was, to have a look. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We did not hear any voices until my husband heard men yelling." â€‹</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There were about 50 officers at the scene, she added. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A shocked Ms Maher, who has been here with her husband and two children since last November said she had bad dreams after going back to bed. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another resident in the area, Mr Andreas Rommel, heard two screams, which sounded like they came from a man. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The first scream was longer than the second. I thought he was drunk," said the IT specialist, 35.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.9999990463257px; line-height: 13.3333339691162px;"><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/shangri-la-shooting-terrorism-ruled-out-20150601"><strong>Shangri-La shooting: Terrorism ruled out</strong></a></span></p>
              <p>THE failed breach of a security checkpoint barely 250m from the venue of the Shangri-La Dialogue yesterday morning, when one man was shot dead and two arrested, may have eventually been found to be drug-related.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But "police did the right thing, ever vigilant to the fact that this could have been a terrorist plot", said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only after a bomb squad confirmed that there were no weapons or explosives in the car was the all-clear given, and traffic, which was held up at a safe distance behind a cordon, allowed to resume. At about 11.30am, Orange Grove Road, Anderson Road and Ardmore Park were reopened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If there was an improvised explosive device detected, the implications would have been very sobering and serious for Singapore," added the minister.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The area around Shangri-La Hotel had been placed under a tight security net, given that it was hosting a major security summit attended by defence ministers and security chiefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At around 4.30am at a highly secured checkpoint along Ardmore Park, three Singaporean men in a red Subaru Impreza defied orders to allow police to check the boot of the car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead, the 34-year-old driver tried to make a run for it and crashed the car through the barricades. "Despite police warnings to stop, the driver continued to crash through police barricades, endangering the lives of the officers. Police opened fire at the vehicle to stop further danger," a police spokesman said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The car, which had a single bullet hole in the front windscreen, came to a stop on a grass patch barely 250m from the entrance of the Shangri-La Hotel. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. It was the first time in seven years that police have had to open fire, with the last incident - involving a knife-wielding man who continued to advance on an officer at Outram Park MRT station - occurring in 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The two passengers, aged 26 and 31, were arrested. The latter was wounded and taken to hospital. Police later searched the vehicle and found a bag containing a white powdery substance - believed to be drugs - and drug paraphernalia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The police yesterday said two of the men, including the driver, were wanted by the authorities, but added little more, declining to answer queries on their identities or how many shots were fired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Shangri-La Hotel was locked down briefly in the wake of the incident. Vehicles, delegates and the media were not allowed to enter the hotel from around 7.30am. But this is believed to have lasted for just 30 minutes and the three-day summit ended yesterday afternoon as scheduled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said the police swiftly brought the situation under control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The investigations so far indicate that the situation is related to drugs," he said, adding that the police would deal firmly with lawbreakers to maintain public safety and security.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The incident came just days after the revelation that a local 19-year-old student had been detained under the Internal Security Act as he wanted to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria terror group. It was also reported last week that the group had identified Singapore as a possible target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"All Singaporeans are thankful that it (a terror attack) did not happen this time, but with the threat of extremist terrorism, we must all be prepared if an actual terrorist plot does occur," said Dr Ng.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">The alleged wife of the man shot dead in the Shangri-La dash through incident has spoken up. In a Facebook post to the Singapore Police Force FB page, the woman who goes by the moniker Fifi Divinez (Nassida Nasir) questioned if the police is justified to shoot dead her husband with a M-16 rifle just because he tried to escape. According to her, her husband tried to escape the road block because he was driving without a valid license.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">This was what she posted on SPF's Facebook page:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">"Good Job To SPF yes ..and now tell me i am his Wife.My Name is Nassida Nasir .So tell me is it justify of the law to shot dead right on my husband head just because he tried to run away? Well people the real reason is bcoz he drove away and hit the barricades due to he did not have a driving license ! So is this how he will be punished ? And if it is a high security and professionals ones , they should know whether they hit a real terrorist. And here i am , with my 2months new born baby living without a father ! Who was scared and running away without a driving license and punished in terrible way ! So tell me if it was your husband can u live everyday without thinking of the incident !"</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">In response to some commentors who criticized her defense of her deceased husband, she said:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">"Oh yeah , and so (not siding anyone) if the drugs was his , was the law created to shoot a person on the head w a riffle of M16 , tell me pls.. Cos i just can't accept the way he was being punished."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">"The have just came out from cantonment and let me clarify this to you that bag wasn't even carried w him , and i do not need to say who or whoever but what i can say he ran because he broke the law and the only thing he did was driving w/o license ! Do u even think if there was so much of drugs ? Wouldn't they check the news and avoid such places like shang ri la thr because there was a high security road block . And my ans is my late husband was only enjoying his joyride ! And the joyride ended DEAD of his mischief"</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The area around Shangri-La Hotel had been placed under a tight security net, given that it was hosting a major security summit attended by defence ministers and security chiefs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The police then opened fire at the vehicle. The car, which had a single bullet hole in the front windscreen, came to a stop on a grass patch barely 250m from the entrance of the Shangri-La Hotel. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.</span></p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Ismail is also wanted for drug related offences and for failing to stop at a roadblock. Both he and Muhammad Syahid Mohamed Yasin have previous drug related offences and criminal records.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If convicted, Ismail and Syahid face between 5 and 15 years' imprisonment and between 5 and 15 strokes of the cane.</span></p>
