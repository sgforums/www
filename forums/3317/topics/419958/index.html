              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Two Filipino women were sentenced to jail on Monday for being part of a conspiracy to cheat Standard Chartered Bank.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>One of them, Charon Legaspi Dimpas, was sentenced to 45 months behind bars for cheating the bank of S$759,900.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 26-year-old 
              former direct sales agent from telemarketing company, Touch &amp; Tech, 
              committed the offence between June and November 2009.<br><br>She pleaded guilty to eight charges while 88 other similar ones were taken into consideration.<br><br>Touch &amp; Tech was engaged by the bank to telemarket the unsecured credit facilities the bank offers to prospective clients.<br><br>To
               earn additional income, Dimpas became part of a syndicate that 
              illegally helped foreigners secure such credit facilities from the bank 
              even though they were not eligible for the services.<br><br>She had 
              forged her applicants' pay slips by inflating their monthly incomes so 
              that their annual pay would appear to be more than S$60,000.<br><br>The court heard that their annual income has to be at least that amount to be eligible for such credit facilities.<br><br>And
               because foreigners holding employment passes must have a minimum of 
              one-year validity remaining on their working papers, Dimpas also forged 
              letters of extension for employment to assist her applicants.<br><br>Deputy
               Public Prosecutor Magdalene Huang told the court that Dimpas earned a 
              commission of more than S$8,000 from her 96 successful applications 
              using the forged documents.<br><br>The other offender, 39-year-old Maria
               Theresa Arenas Garcia, who was one of the applicants, was sentenced to 
              six months' jail for being part of the ruse.<br><br>By submitting forged
               pay slips and a bogus letter of extension for employment, the 
              administrative operation executive had deceived the bank into giving her
               a loan of <br>S$10,500.<br><br>For the offences, each woman could have been jailed up to ten years and fined for each charge.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
