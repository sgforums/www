              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Another 15,000 financially vulnerable Singaporeans 
              and Permanent Residents (PRs) will be barred from entering the two 
              casinos in Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>From July 2012, the 
              third-party casino exclusion will be extended to 12,000 individuals who 
              are receiving short to medium term ComCare assistance.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>ComCare provides social assistance for low-income individuals and families.<br><br>These recipients are mostly unemployed or in financial need.<br><br>From
               August, 3,000 individuals paying subsidised rents for their HDB rental 
              flats, and who have chalked up rental arrears of six months or more, 
              will also be barred.<br><br>The Community Development, Youth and Sports 
              Ministry (MCYS) said this is part of its move to strengthen existing 
              social safeguards and to protect the financially vulnerable from casino 
              gambling. <br><br>There are currently 28,000 persons who are excluded from the casinos under third-party casino exclusion. <br><br>They include undischarged bankrupts and those receiving long-term public assistance and special grants. <br><br>The third-party casino exclusion is administered by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG).<br><br>The
               intent to extend casino exclusions to more financially vulnerable 
              persons was earlier announced by Acting Minister for MCYS Chan Chun Sing
               in February. <br><br>Mr Chan said: "We want to protect the financially 
              vulnerable who can ill afford casino gambling. The 2011 NCPG Gambling 
              Participation Survey showed a small but increasing proportion of low 
              income gamblers who betted large amounts. We want to move proactively to
               address this." <br><br>NCPG Chairman Mr Lim Hock San said: "We are 
              heartened to see the government taking measures to protect the 
              financially vulnerable. On its part, NCPG will continue its efforts in 
              creating greater awareness of problem gambling." <br><br>MCYS said it is
               working with other government agencies to review relevant legislation 
              and regulations to beef up social safeguards. <br><br>Apart from 
              third-party exclusion, the other two types of casino exclusion are 
              voluntary self-exclusion and family exclusion, where a family member can
               apply to bar a loved one from entering the casinos.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              A good way to protect this group of Singaporeans.
              
              It will be better if local clubhouses can stop non-members from gambling in their slot machine room. 
              
              Presently anyone can be a sign-in guest when they visit the slot machine room at some local clubhouses. There are a few regular members loitering there. They will sign in for anyone who approach them because they will get tips when non-members win money. 
              
              Perhaps local clubhouses should also tighten up this area.

              And it is easily accessible to vulnerable Singaporeans.

              <p><strong>Courts shouldn't "undermine intent for casino self-exclusion order"</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Given that Parliament had decided not to criminalise 
              breaches of casino self-exclusion orders, the courts should be mindful 
              not to undermine the self-help regime as intended by the lawmakers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Too harsh a 
              punishment for an offence, which consists of breaching or attempting to 
              breach a self-exclusion order, will only dissuade those vulnerable to 
              the temptation of gambling from applying for a self-exclusion order in 
              the first place.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Chief Justice (CJ) 
              Chan Sek Keong made these points in a written judgement released on 
              Thursday as he explained why a man's two-month jail term was "wrong in 
              principle, inappropriate and manifestly excessive".<br><br>Xu Zhaohe, 
              41, was caught on September 4 last year for attempting to use his wife's
               identity card (IC) to enter the casino at Resorts World Sentosa, which 
              is an offence under the National Registration Act. <br><br>Xu's son had 
              applied for a self-exclusion order in Sept 2010 on Xu's behalf, out of 
              Xu's "own fear that he would be unable to resist the temptation of 
              gambling in a casino".<br><br>Xu was sentenced to two months of jail by a District Judge, who felt a deterrent sentence was warranted.<br><br>CJ Chan had allowed Xu's appeal and substituted the sentence with a S$3,000 fine.<br><br>In
               his judgement, CJ Chan said he disagreed with the District Judge as he 
              felt this was a case where "a judge should have some understanding of 
              the nature of the offence" committed by Xu and why he had committed it.<br><br>Although
               the use of another person's IC without lawful authority or reasonable 
              excuse is an offence, CJ Chan said the gravity of this offence must 
              depend on the purpose for which the IC is used, and the sentence imposed
               by the court must in turn reflect the offence's gravity. <br><br>The 
              Chief Justice reiterated that Parliament's decision not to criminalise 
              breaches of self-exclusion orders is "highly material" to the 
              determination of the proper punishment in such cases. <br><br>The court 
              must bear in mind enforcement measures that have already been 
              implemented in the Casino Control Act, which places the onus on casinos 
              to conduct "stringent checks to ensure that excluded persons do not 
              enter their premises", CJ Chan said.<br><br>"Criminalising breaches of self-exclusion orders will, in any event, lead to an absurd outcome," he added. <br><br>"The
               result will be that an excluded person who has the foresight to apply 
              to lift his self-exclusion order before going to a casino to gamble is 
              not a criminal, but an excluded person who momentarily succumbs to 
              temptation and enters a casino to gamble despite the self-exclusion 
              order in force against him is." <br><br>CJ Chan said deterrence should also be "sensitively applied" for family exclusion orders.<br><br>"Severe
               sentences for offences which consist essentially of breaching or 
              attempting to breach a family exclusion order may inadvertently lead to 
              greater internal conflict as the offenders concerned may blame their 
              punishment on the family member who applied for the exclusion order," he
               added.<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
