              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Sunday
              the country has a considerable way to go in its productivity drive,
              especially when compared with other countries which have achieved
              significant productivity growth. </span></p>
              <p><span>He said Singapore's productivity can improve by 60 to 70 per cent.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee's remarks follow the release of the Economic Strategies
              Committee Report, which placed productivity as the key growth strategy
              for Singapore's economy.
              <br> <br>The Prime Minister made the assessment on the first day of the Year
              of the Tiger, as he visited a select group of workers who are keeping
              the country going during the holiday period. <br> <br> Accompanied by key union leaders, Mr Lee gave away S$10 hong baos and
              oranges to some 150 staff at Swissotel the Stamford and Fairmont
              Singapore.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said efforts must redouble if Singapore is to achieve the
              target of two to three per cent productivity growth over the next 10
              years.
              <br> <br>"It's a turning point. Your numbers will grow more slowly and if
              you want the economy to do well, that means the productivity must go
              up," said Mr Lee.
              <br> <br>"And if your productivity doesn't go up and we don't get the
              growth, then I think you may feel that you're relaxing a little bit
              more but the mood, the buoyancy, the optimism, will be quite different.
              So we have to work hard and take this very seriously."
              <br> <br> To help staff increase their productivity levels, some hotels have been using a device called the Ezi-Maid.
              <br> <br>The device is able to elevate beds to waist level, making it easier
              for cleaning staff to change the sheets and vacuum under the bed,
              cutting the time taken to clean a room.
              <br> <br> The job scope of workers is also being re-looked.
              <br> <br>General secretary of Food, Drinks and Allied Workers' Union, Tan
              Hock Soon, said: "We're working with management to upgrade the skills
              of the workers through expansion of knowledge, through skills
              upgrading, so that we can ultimately integrate jobs. So that
              productivity goes up, therefore better wages for our workers in the
              industry."
              <br> <br> Mr Lee also touched on the need for Singaporeans to have more babies. 
              <br> <br>He said that while there is no "magic bullet" to boost the
              fertility rate, working mothers will need family support, and husbands
              can play a part.
              <br> <br>"(Husbands can) start by changing nappies!" said Mr Lee. "When the
              kids grow a bit older, you're not just a father figure, but you're
              helping around the house and showing them a good example, so when they
              grow up they also know how to look (after) the house."
              <br> <br> Singapore's resident Total Fertility Rate slid from 1.28 in 2008 to 1.23 last year, the lowest ever.

              <p>agreed...and more work and educational programs should be set to allow more Sg to survey and learn how China and other oversea chinese survive and made it to the top in other countries....such programs could help to shock our young and spoiled Singaporeans </p>
              <p>Lacking natural resources, we need to innovate from a limited pool of human resources...however, since it is much a people's economy...we should also strengthen and factor in the importance of social psychological framework, particularly tolerance and more constructive viewpoints (including oppositions) to sustain a stronger Singapore in future...</p>
              <p>i would not agree with LKY's views that such a small country like Sg do not need many oppositions...but i think varied but genuine oppositions should be encouraged to prepare for a much stronger Singapore against outside brutal realities...if we just follow...our young Singaporeans will never be tough and stronger...and the day will surely come when Singapore will fall in their hands....</p>

              <p>my stance is on young Singaporeans to be more exposed to external brutalities than in a protective environment...</p>
              <p>which is also why i personally would encourage the continuation of NS but with greater benefits to level the social responsibility...and to propose more national or social programs for women to contribute than spending their time on shopping...</p>
              <p>and here i dun agree with LHL's views that only women jungle between work and family...but to take closer look...their over reliance on maids (who are the real executives of homes) to the point of abusive behaviour has brought shame (as well as men)...over favouring women at the expense of men will do no good for their healthy development...a feminized Sg...</p>
              <p>productivity needs also to re-look into overall social psychological development with balanced interests ... as like Mayo, who understands better lighting system to increase work productivity... </p>

              <p>that is also another reason we need more and better oppositions to vet on the issue...it has to be more convincing...with balanced interests...</p>
              <p>work and more work is itself no bad thing so long as we reap the fruits of our labour....but aren't we feeling that only the top few are reaping it than the masses? </p>

              <p>Even if it's another govt, going up the economic value chain will still occur. It's as if under another govt we've natural resources to survive on and live on kampung life.</p>
              <p>you dun have to care abt wat they say. Eventually one fine day you'll or everyone will realise once there's another bunch of credbile and practical ppl to run the govt, for all we may know they could become e new govt.</p>
              <p>At e same time, it's e people tat will drive the economy eventually.</p>

              <p>Yes, his salary can also cut down by 60 to 70 per cent.</p>
              <p>Cut down his salary la to encourage more productivity.   He receives so much $$$ for his salary I don't see he has lots of productivity.     Look at yourself LHL before pointing fingers at the people who feed you.</p>
