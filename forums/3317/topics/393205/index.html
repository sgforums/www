              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The talk may be all about how to help foreigners fit in
               Singapore, but children of expatriates here seem to find it relatively 
              easy to integrate. </span></p>
              <p><span>Some 56 per cent of expat parents said their children are more 
              socially integrated here than they were in their home countries, 
              according to the world's largest survey of expats, Expat Explorer.
              <br> <br> Not only did 71 per cent say their kids adapted "really well" to the 
              education system here (compared to the global average of 49 per cent), 
              65 per cent said their children found it easy to make new friends 
              (global average 50 per cent).
              <br> <br> Expat kids fit in easiest in Australia. In contrast, expat kids in the 
              United Kingdom and United States struggled the hardest to make friends 
              and integrate. 
              <br> <br> These were the findings of the second annual survey issued by HSBC Bank 
              International, which polled over 3,100 expats from more than 50 
              countries.
              <br> <br> Overall, Singapore was ranked next best, behind Australia, for expats to
               raise a family. Nine in 10 expat parents living here felt they had 
              moved to a safer, more childcare-friendly place for their youngsters.
              <br> <br> Three in four said education standards were better than in their home 
              country (global average 56 per cent), while 70 per cent felt childcare 
              had improved since moving here (global average 50 per cent). 
              <br> <br> But the Republic was also rated one of the most expensive place to raise
               a child - 60 per cent said they now spend more on childcare.
              <br> <br> As for providing an environment to raise healthy kids, expat children in
               Singapore ate the least junk food, according to the survey. But over a 
              third tended to spend less time outdoors and playing sports after moving
               here.
              <br> <br> Overall, the UK was indicated as the worst country for childcare and 
              education.
              <br> <br> Agreeing with the survey's findings was one expat based here - Mr 
              Sebastian Arcuri, HSBC Bank International's head of personal financial 
              services. 
              <br> <br> "As a father of three young children, all born in Singapore, I have been
               able to experience first-hand how child-friendly Singapore is and can 
              vouch for the high standard of childcare available here," he said.
              <br> <br> "I found it easy to enroll my children in local kindergartens and 
              international schools, which provide a quality education as well as a 
              conducive environment for them to make new friends and integrate into 
              the community here ... Having lived in five different countries, I think
               Singapore is a great place to raise children and I am very glad the 
              survey confirms this."
