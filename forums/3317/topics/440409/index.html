              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>WASHINGTON: US justice officials on Tuesday charged four 
              Singaporeans and one Iranian with fraudulently exporting radio equipment
               to Iran that subsequently ended up in roadside bombs in Iraq.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At least 16 radio 
              antennas were found in unexploded improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in
               Iraq, the US Justice Department said in a statement, noting that the 
              Iranian suspect in the case is still at large.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The indictment said 
              thousands of antennas were meant to be exported from the United States 
              to Iran, and in addition to the four Singaporeans, four companies from 
              the Asian city state had been charged in the alleged plot.<br><br>Admiral
               Mike Mullen, then the top US military officer, said in July that Iran 
              was stepping up its support for Shiite militants in Iraq, supplying them
               with more sophisticated weapons that were being used against American 
              forces.<br><br>"Yesterday, authorities in Singapore arrested Wong Yuh 
              Lan (Wong), Lim Yong Nam (Nam), Lim Kow Seng (Seng), and Hia Soo Gan 
              Benson (Hia), all citizens of Singapore, in connection with a US request
               for extradition," the justice department statement said.<br><br>"The 
              United States is seeking their extradition to stand trial in the 
              District of Columbia," where the US capital Washington is located.<br><br>"The remaining individual defendant, Hossein Larijani, is a citizen and resident of Iran who remains at large," it added.<br><br>Assistant
               Attorney General for National Security Lisa Monaco said the defendants 
              had attempted to subvert export controls by sending US-origin components
               to Iran rather than their stated destination of Singapore.<br><br>"Ultimately, several of these components were found in unexploded improvised explosive devices in Iraq," she said.<br><br>"This
               case underscores the continuing threat posed by Iranian procurement 
              networks seeking to obtain US technology through fraud and the 
              importance of safeguarding that technology."<br><br>US Attorney Ronald 
              Machen said the defendants misled US companies in buying parts that 
              ended up in IEDs on the battlefield in Iraq. "We hope for a swift 
              response from Singapore to our request for extradition," he added.<br><br>US
               officials regularly accuse Iran of meddling in the politics of 
              Baghdad's Shiite-led government, and training and backing militant 
              groups that target US troops in the south of Iraq.<br><br>Analysts have 
              voiced concern that Tehran's ability to interfere could increase as a 
              result of President Barack Obama's announcement last week that all US 
              troops will be pulled out of Iraq by the end of this year.<br><br>-AFP/ac</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>S'poreans accused by US of selling bomb parts, arrested</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The four Singaporeans accused by the United States of
               illegally exporting bomb parts to Iran have been arrested and remanded 
              in custody without bail.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They are Wong Yuh 
              Lan (female, age 39), Lim Yong Nam (male, age 37), Lim Kow Seng (male, 
              age 42) and Benson Hia Soon Gan (male, age 44).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They were arrested 
              by Commercial Affairs Department officers on Tuesday, and later produced
               in Court number 10 of the Subordinate Courts.<br><br>Singapore's 
              Attorney-General's Chambers said the extradition papers submitted by the
               US are in the process of being served on the four persons or their 
              counsel. <br><br>There'll be a hearing to go through the evidence 
              provided by the US in order for the court to decide whether there are 
              sufficient grounds to extradite them.<br><br>The AGC said the case 
              further underscores Singapore's commitment to 
              internationally-coordinated efforts in the context of transnational 
              crime so that enforcement agencies are not hampered when dealing with 
              persons operating across borders. <br><br>It also shows that Singapore takes its international obligations seriously. <br><br>The
               AGC said Singapore shares the US' concerns about the violation of 
              export control laws and the illegal diversion of strategic goods, and 
              will not condone Singapore being used as a base for proliferation 
              activities.<br><br>The case will be mentioned at the Subordinate Courts of Singapore again on November 1.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p>This is a warning to those who are naive enough to trust the west.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the true master in these games with the west and a man that I respect for his tactical skills is Kim Jong il.</p>
              <p>He is not a simple guy. He is extremely good at playing these political games with the U.S.</p>
              <p>But that is another long story.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2008/0809/kim_jong_il_0919.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> Even with his friends he is also cunning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">....At the risk of jumping the gun, let me stick my neck out. I reckon that at long last this is for real. The pipeline and power lines will get built, and they are a game-changer. Here's why. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kim Jong-il's genius lies in his timing. </span></span></strong>I was puzzled why he didn't go for this sooner, but I see now. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was holding the Russian card in reserve, waiting for the killer moment to use it. <br></span></span></strong><br>That moment is now. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Three-way energy cooperation slays several birds with a single stone.</span></span></strong> Diplomatically, just when China thought it had North Korea in the bag as sole sustainer, Kim has leapt free to remind Beijing - and all of us - that he still has other options. We are back to North Korea's old game of playing off one power against another. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He's very good at that. </span></span></strong><br><br>Economically, it's money for old rope - or new gas. All Kim has to do is sit and collect the rent, which some estimates put as high as $500 million a year. Nice, for doing nothing. <br><br>Moreover, the deal must include some of that power and gas staying in the North, where it is sorely needed. North Korea's creaking power grid, and its industries, will get a vital boost. <br><br>Best of all, it puts the South on the spot. This is an offer Lee Myung-bak can't refuse, neatly timed. With elections in the South next year, Lee is already a lame duck; he can't run again. His hard line on the North has clearly failed. His successor, left or right, will try a different tack. With fears growing since Japan's tragedy over South Korea's dependence on nuclear power, no one in Seoul is going to turn down a pan-Korean gas pipeline, if it materializes. <br><br>This won't solve North Korea's problems, let alone the North Korea problem. But yet again Kim Jong-il looks to have won a new lease of life. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You have to admire the old poker player. </span></span></strong></span></p>

              <p><strong>S'porean accused of sending weapons to Iran granted bail</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : One of the four Singaporeans accused by the United 
              States of sending weapons parts to Iran has been granted bail, after a 
              hearing before District Judge Toh Yung Cheong on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The judge granted 
              bail of S$100,000 for Lim Yong Nam, with the condition that his passport
               be impounded and that he remain contactable by the authorities at all 
              times.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Lim's lawyers - 
              Hamidul Haq and Yusfiyanto Yatiman - submitted Lim's psychiatric report 
              to the court to request that a bail of S$20,000 be allowed. <br><br>Deputy public prosecutors Mark Jayaratnam and Crystal Tan argued that the offence was serious and the case was sensitive. <br><br>As such, Singapore must give effect to its treaty obligations with the US in good faith, so a high bail amount was called for.<br><br>Mr
               Jayaratnam requested for a S$400,000 bail based on the penalty of a 
              jail term of five years or fine of US$250,000 should Lim be convicted in
               a US court of his alleged offence.<br><br>Mr Haq argued that there was 
              no flight risk as Lim was firmly rooted in Singapore and that he had not
               absconded when he was investigated by Singapore Customs.<br><br>Lim - 
              together with Lim Kow Seng, 42, Benson Hia Soon Gan, 44, and Wong Yuh 
              Lan, 39 - had allegedly duped an American company, Digi International, 
              into selling them 6,000 powerful radio frequency modules in August 2007.
               <br><br>Singapore has a bilateral extradition treaty with the US.<br><br>The
               four, held under the Extradition Act, are awaiting a committal hearing 
              where a judge will decide whether they should be extradited to face 
              charges.<br><br>They face 11 counts in the US, including a conspiracy to
               defraud the US by dishonest means and illegal export of defence 
              articles.<br><br>They were said to have tricked Minnesota-based Digi International into selling them the modules through a network of companies.<br><br>Those held under the Extradition Act are not allowed bail unless they are sick, infirm or are juveniles.<br><br>The
               committal hearing - where a judge will decide whether the four will be 
              extradited to the US - will take place on December 9 and 12.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Judge allows S'poreans' extradition over bomb parts exports</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A Singapore judge has cleared the way for the 
              extradition to the United States of four Singaporeans accused of 
              illegally exporting radio components to Iran that later ended up in 
              Iraqi roadside bombs. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The four Singaporeans are Lim Kow Seng, Lim Yong Nam, Benson Hia Soon Guan and Wong Yuh Lan. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They are accused of exporting US-made radio equipment to Iran that ended up in bombs, targeting coalition forces in Iraq. <br><br>The charges include conspiracy to defraud the US, smuggling and illegal export of goods from the US to Iran.<br><br>An Iranian national, accused of masterminding the illegal export, is currently on the run. <br><br>The
               US government immediately welcomed the decision even though the four 
              accused have 15 days to appeal against the extradition to face a US 
              trial.<br><br>US Ambassador to Singapore, David Adelman said the ruling 
              reflects the strong spirit of cooperation between the United States and

              in arms and equipment that can pose significant threats to the United

              <p>Friend......</p>
              <p>You must be so naive.......</p>
              <p>They are just some ordinary electronics distributor.......</p>
              <p>Just think and use your head......</p>
              <p>Singapore is a global city and lots of imports-exports companies are trade firms are here......</p>
              <p>These 4 people are just your average next-door neighbour electronics trader.....</p>
              <p>The one who use their network is probably some Iranian agent or another proxy........</p>
              <p>Why
                   would they want to export banned arms materials to Iran purposely ? I 
                  dont even think they know or realize what exactly they are doing.</p>
              <p>Those
                   are electronics equipment.....maybe dual use.....means can be used for 
                  civilian usage as well as military usage.......and I think they are just
                   wholesaler and distributor.......they wont know about some US arms 
                  ban......</p>
              <p>The whole thing is making me angry.</p>
              <p>The coverage in the media is so biased and one-sided.</p>
              <p>In the first place, is this ban even legal ?</p>
              <p>The ban is from USA. The USA government made it.</p>
              <p>Because USA has a political problem with Iran, so they made all these bans and sanctions and blockades.</p>
              <p>But
                   not all of these measures have international support. Some are endorsed
                   by UN, so it means all UN members are supposed to follow it, but also 
                  there are many measures put in place by USA ownself unilaterally as an 
                  extra.</p>
              <p>If Im not wrong, this one is from USA unilaterally.</p>
              <p>Friends,</p>
              <p>Dont
                   you remember last time there was an Australian jihadist (Caucasian boy)
                   who got caught by US soldiers in Afganistan, and then he was put in 
                  trial and was about to be punished by jail or whatever by US government,
                   and there was an uproar and a reaction from the Australian public and 
                  government. They defended the boy and asked him to be returned.</p>
              <p>And that was in war theater, mind you, caught red handed, and those 2 countries are close relatives.</p>
              <p>And now.....??</p>
              <p>Compare to Singapore..??</p>
              <p>For
                   some unilateral blockade measure with dubious legality and morality, 
                  these 4 Singaporeans who are electronics distributors, are delivered as 
                  sacrificial lambs to satisfy a superpower country.</p>
              <p>What makes me 
                  angry is that in Straits Times everytime this case is mentioned, they 
                  purposely insert the statement from American Ambassador to Singapore, 
                  patting and complimenting the Singapore action of delivering sacrificial
                   lambs to satisfy American foreign policy agenda.</p>
              <p>WTF ?!</p>
              <p>Where is the nationalism ?</p>
              <p>Dont you remember,</p>
              <p>When
                   the Romanian second-in-charge drove his car and killed some people, 
                  there was uproar, from the public and even the government, including 
                  Foreign Minister George Yeo who managed to push the case and even 
                  cleverly setup some meetings with his counterparts.</p>
              <p>(I give him points for that)</p>
              <p>But now...?</p>
              <p>No voice....?</p>
              <p>No defence ?</p>
              <p>This one is even worse, because why should Singapore support US foreign policy of imperialism in the Middle East.</p>
              <p>But
                   fine.........I can still understand it...for political reasons....I 
                  understand Singapore is a small country who need the protection and 
                  patronage of a big country like USA....it's ok.....I follow LKY hard 
                  nosed no-nonsense approach.......But when the life, safety, wellbeing, 
                  and welfare of 4 people are in jeopardy......why is it that Singapore 
                  does not try to do something on their behalf ?</p>
              <p>At least do 
                  something symbolically and make them stop the exports, maybe give them a
                   fine.....or give the punishments here by Singapore local courts and 
                  then report it to the US counterpart.......</p>
              <p>No action whatsoever to try to help them......</p>
              <p>This whole thing is quite pathetic, my friends....</p>

              <p>But Lee Kuan Yew did not tolerate and destroyed chinese education and suppressed dialects in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Made the alien english as dominant language so as to give himself and the peranakan elite the advantage in politics?</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew also played down all the history of the anti-colonial, anti-Japanese, anti-imperialist activities of the chinese in Singapore, since he himself was never part of that movement.</p>
              <p>He is afraid of us. He is keeping a watch on us. His policies retards us.</p>
              <p>We are the offensive power in Singapore and he is not one of us.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew can never mobilise the chinese people of Singapore. That's why there is no substance in Singapore nationalism.</p>

              <p>You must be so naive.......</p>
              <p>They are just some ordinary electronics distributor.......</p>
              <p>Just think and use your head......</p>
              <p>Singapore is a global city and lots of imports-exports companies are trade firms are here......</p>
              <p>These 4 people are just your average next-door neighbour electronics trader.....</p>
              <p>The one who use their network is probably some Iranian agent or another proxy........</p>
              <p>Why would they want to export banned arms materials to Iran purposely ? I dont even think they know or realize what exactly they are doing.</p>
              <p>Those are electronics equipment.....maybe dual use.....means can be used for civilian usage as well as military usage.......and I think they are just wholesaler and distributor.......they wont know about some US arms ban......</p>
              <p>The whole thing is making me angry.</p>
              <p>The coverage in the media is so biased and one-sided.</p>
              <p>In the first place, is this ban even legal ?</p>
              <p>The ban is from USA. The USA government made it.</p>
              <p>Because USA has a political problem with Iran, so they made all these bans and sanctions and blockades.</p>
              <p>But not all of these measures have international support. Some are endorsed by UN, so it means all UN members are supposed to follow it, but also there are many measures put in place by USA ownself unilaterally as an extra.</p>
              <p>If Im not wrong, this one is from USA unilaterally.</p>
              <p>Friends,</p>
              <p>Dont you remember last time there was an Australian jihadist (Caucasian boy) who got caught by US soldiers in Afganistan, and then he was put in trial and was about to be punished by jail or whatever by US government, and there was an uproar and a reaction from the Australian public and government. They defended the boy and asked him to be returned.</p>
              <p>And that was in war theater, mind you, caught red handed, and those 2 countries are close relatives.</p>
              <p>And now.....??</p>
              <p>Compare to Singapore..??</p>
              <p>For some unilateral blockade measure with dubious legality and morality, these 4 Singaporeans who are electronics distributors, are delivered as sacrificial lambs to satisfy a superpower country.</p>
              <p>What makes me angry is that in Straits Times everytime this case is mentioned, they purposely insert the statement from American Ambassador to Singapore, patting and complimenting the Singapore action of delivering sacrificial lambs to satisfy American foreign policy agenda.</p>
              <p>WTF ?!</p>
              <p>Where is the nationalism ?</p>
              <p>Dont you remember,</p>
              <p>When the Romanian second-in-charge drove his car and killed some people, there was uproar, from the public and even the government, including Foreign Minister George Yeo who managed to push the case and even cleverly setup some meetings with his counterparts.</p>
              <p>(I give him points for that)</p>
              <p>But now...?</p>
              <p>No voice....?</p>
              <p>No defence ?</p>
              <p>This one is even worse, because why should Singapore support US foreign policy of imperialism in the Middle East.</p>
              <p>But fine.........I can still understand it...for political reasons....I understand Singapore is a small country who need the protection and patronage of a big country like USA....it's ok.....I follow LKY hard nosed no-nonsense approach.......But when the life, safety, wellbeing, and welfare of 4 people are in jeopardy......why is it that Singapore does not try to do something on their behalf ?</p>
              <p>At least do something symbolically and make them stop the exports, maybe give them a fine.....or give the punishments here by Singapore local courts and then report it to the US counterpart.......</p>
              <p>No action whatsoever to try to help them......</p>
              <p>This whole thing is quite pathetic, my friends....</p>

              <p>1) the ban to Iran has been going on for sometime and is a well known. </p>
              <p> 2)They were fraudulently exporting radio equipment to Iran that subsequently ended up in roadside bombs in Iraq. They may well be electronic trader but all electronic traders should know the difference between electronic gadgets and sensitive radio equipment (and esp to a country Iran).</p>
              <p>3) you think our court so short sighted as not to see the concrete evidence presented before him before sending them to the US?</p>

              <p>I dont think it is well known by them.....they are just some small fry electronics Ex-Im trader.......anyways maybe you are right, but I just doubt it.......</p>
              <p>Even if it is true, and they know it, is it an international ban, or just an American ban ? I think it is an American ban and not a UN ban, so the American government should have punished their own companies and their own suppliers, how come they want to punish Singaporean distributors as well ?</p>
              <p>Even if they want to punish Singaporean parties, how come there is no defence to them, so easily just obey and accept American perspective.</p>
              <p>By the way, what is the punishment to the American suppliers ?</p>
              <p>Because I have the feeling that the American suppliers and the Singaporean distributors are about the same........meaning they are just being naively used by the Iranian agent......what do they know.</p>
              <p>The one who is the brain is the Iranian agent.....meaning the Iranian agent is the one who think and plan and figure out who to circumvent the ban.....then he just use the pathways and the networks....in this case the 4 Singaporean traders........</p>
              <p>Then of course the American prosecutor want to catch all.......</p>

              <p>1) Every Singapore exporters have the deal with our custom and our custom will specify to them the ban items (very specifically in detail) to import/export. <a href="http://www.customs.gov.sg/stgc/leftNav/ove/Legislation.htm">http://www.customs.gov.sg/stgc/leftNav/ove/Legislation.htm</a></p>
              <p>Even ppl like me not dealing with export can read about the ban on Iran in the papers and in the TV.</p>
              <p>2) The ban is a UN ban but US is carrying out the judiary in accordance with the UN law.</p>
              <p>3) How the US system works is that there are scaler systems of what are permitted to export and how much technology is allowed to export with regards to each of its friendly allies. <br><br>For example, Japan - high, Singapore - mid, China - low.</p>
              <p>The US can't prosecute the US exporter because Singapore is on its friendly list with the US exporter was most probably permitted to do so under the existing US-Singapore bilateral agreement law. (That is why our Ministers regularly visit the US to update on the bilateral agreements with them - what we can sell to them, what they can sell to us).</p>
              <p>This explains why the sensitive radio equipment can be export to Singapore but not to some other countries. This explain why the US govt didn't touch the US co. The US co. did not break the US law with regards to US export agreement with Singapore.</p>

              <p>I see.....</p>
              <p>I dont understand how come they could export the electronic antennas if they are listed and specified as banned by Singaporean customs ?</p>
              <p>Is that really the case ?</p>
              <p>Means it is partly Singaporean customs fault ?</p>
              <p>Also are you sure it is a UN ban...? Because it is not mentioned in any articles. I would think they would write it down if it is based on UN and international law. It is confusing to me because I have read there are different types of blockade measures by UN, EU, and US separately.</p>
              <p>Also I dont understand why would the American company not punished in any ways, because they could be accused of lacking checks too, and in this same vein, it is the same with the 4 Singaporean traders, they are just middlemen who are being used by the Iranian agent.</p>
              <p>Did the Iranian agent openly admit and declare himself, and say why he wanted to buy the antennas, where, how, and for whom ?</p>
              <p>I would think he disguised himself, maybe he made an electronics company front and then he just said he wanted the antenna to make a TV relay equipment or whatever.</p>
              <p>Still.......for this type of political power play (not a real crime but a political crime) I dont know why Singapore does not try to defend them while still satisfying the political objectives of stopping the exports. Or maybe strike a deal with American prosecutors and ask them not to impose a heavy punishment.</p>
              <p>Just gladly hand them over....and in the closing paragraphs....always, the American Ambassador would say a few words.</p>
              <p>How nice......</p>
