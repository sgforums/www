              <p>Two foreign lecturers were heard labelling Singaporean students as 
              'stupid' and slow learners while they were on board the same bus as a STOMPer. The lecturers were also heard criticizing the administrative system at a local university.<br><br>The STOMPer wrote:<br><br>"This
               happened today when I was on board bus number 179 heading to Boon lay 
              Interchange. I was seated at a distance away from them but they were 
              speaking very loudly that I could hear them from five seats away.<br><br>"Although
               they were conversing in English, I think they are from China judging by
               their accents and the constant mentions about the system there.<br><br>"These
               two professors, which they claimed to be while conversing, were 
              criticizing Singaporean students as 'stupid' and slow learners, causing 
              them to be unable teaching the syllabus on time.<br><br>"They were also 
              complaining about the administrative system in NTU, saying that it takes
               a lot of time to get things done while comparing a similar but faster 
              system in China with that of NTU.<br><br>"It pains me that NTU have such professors who demean the university so openly."</p>

              <p>on the hindsight, well, its not that the educational resources &amp; technology or IQ here are lacking but rather attributed to cultural, management, and policy differences....</p>
              <p>indeed, china has much greater probability of high IQ people due to their population, but there is still a little catch up for us ....it lacks a kind of thinking hat ...besides the other six hats....perhaps i would coin it as "Hungry Hat"...</p>
              <p>hungry as a physiological instinct....and our students are not as "hungry" as them in terms of learning, doing, acting faster, and to survive due to a highly competitive and merciless environment which China has undergone.....</p>
              <p>that is the missing hat....our children has been too "spoonfed" and "molded" to a certain cask which deter than spruce that "hungry" physiological mode to outperform..</p>

              <p>while some of the "spoonfed" syndrome may be true, here's another take: most of the time, i have no idea what most PRC people are trying to say when they attempt to speak english... even when they are "educated"</p>

              <p>The way that we are being educated from Pri to A level/poly, are by spoon feeding. When we go to university, the prof expect us to find out ourselves, while we expect the prof to provide the answer. No thinking skills with only memory skills make us stupid.</p>
