              <p><strong>Man appears alive at own funeral in Brazil</strong></p>
              <div class="bd">
              <div class="content">
              <p>RIO DE JANEIRO â€“ A
              Brazilian bricklayer reportedly killed in a car crash shocked his
              mourning family by showing up alive at his funeral.</p>
              <p>Relatives
              of Ademir Jorge Goncalves, 59, had identified him as the victim of a
              Sunday night car crash in Parana state in southern Brazil, police said.</p>
              <p>As
              is customary in Brazil, the funeral was held the following day, which
              happened to be the holiday of Finados, when Brazilians visit cemeteries
              to honor the dead.</p>
              <p>What family members didn't know was that
              Goncalves had spent the night at a truck stop talking with friends over
              drinks of a sugarcane liquor known as cachaca, his niece Rosa Sampaio
              told the O Globo newspaper. He did not get word about his own funeral
              until it was already happening Monday morning.</p>
              <p>A police
              spokesman in the town of Santo Antonio da Platina said Goncalves rushed
              to the funeral to let family members know he was not dead.</p>
              <p>"The
              corpse was badly disfigured, but dressed in similar clothing," said the
              police spokesman, who talked on condition of anonymity as he wasn't
              authorized to discuss the case. "People are afraid to look for very
              long when they identify bodies, and I think that is what happened in
              this case."</p>
              <p>Sampaio told O Globo that some family members were not sure the body was Goncalves.</p>
              <p>"My
              two uncles and I had doubts about the identification," she told O
              Globo. "But an aunt and four of his friends identified the body, so
              what were we to do? We went ahead with the funeral."</p>
              <p>The
              police spokesman confirmed there were doubts: "His mom looked at the
              body in the casket and thought something was strange. She looked and
              looked and couldn't believe it was her son," Sampaio said. "Before
              long, the walking dead appeared at the funeral. It was a relief."</p>
              <p>The
              body was correctly identified later Monday, the police spokesman said,
              and has already been buried in another state. He declined to release
              the actual victim's name.</p>
