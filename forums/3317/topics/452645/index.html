              <p>A STOMPer was slapped on the face and hit in the ears 
              by a Tiger Airways staff in an airport in Guangzhou, China, after the 
              two parties got caught in an argument. The counter staff had reportedly 
              tore up her boarding pass prior to the flashpoint.</p>
              <p>The STOMPer wrote:<br><br>"I'm a 35-year-old Singaporean who was slapped
               and beaten at the Guangzhou airport in China when I was on a business 
              trip there last week.<br><br>"I was checking in to my flight back to 
              Singapore when a male staff at the Tiger Airways counter told me that I 
              needed to pay an extra $60 as my luggage had exceeded the limit by 3kg.<br><br>"I
               then asked if I could just take out a toy from inside one of my 
              luggages as I don't have anything heavy to carry on board the plane but 
              he told me I had no time to do it now.<br><br>"When he said that, the toy was already removed from my bag so I told him 'ok, the weight of my luggage are now 25kg'.<br><br>"He got angry and told me that there wasn't enough time to check my luggage already as the gates were closing then.<br><br>"When
               I said I wanted to fly still, I also told him that I needed his help 
              with my luggage as I had four bags on hand and I wasn't able to carry it
               myself to the airport.<br><br>"He rejected my request and then threatened to tear off my boarding pass.<br><br>"When I didn't back down, he just tore up the boarding pass in front of me,<br><br>"We started arguing and he then challenged me to make a report to Tiger Airways if I wasn't happy.<br><br>"Then, I tried to take a photograph of him and that was when he slapped me as he tried to stop me from doing that.<br><br>"I lost control of myself and slapped him back but he got out of his counter and hit me on the head, near the ears.<br><br>"He
               then walked off and I tried to follow him as I didn't want him to run 
              away from this, even leaving my luggage there as a result.<br><br>"That was when his manager came out and spoke to me, asking me to calm down  and give my side of the story.<br><br>"I
               gave him that and told him I wanted to make a police report but the 
              station there was closed b then so I had to wait till the next morning 
              to lodge a report with the police.<br><br>"That was when I realized that
               I couldn't fly out of China if I had a pending police report there. As a
               result, I closed the report.<br><br>"I tried to contact Tiger Airways 
              when I was in China and also when I got back to Singapore but all they 
              did was ask me to email them about this.<br><br>"After waiting four days
               for an email reply, which I didn't get from Tiger Airways, I decided to
               follow a friend's suggestion and post this on STOMP.<br><br>"I want to make my story known to everyone so that nobody will end up in a similar situation like me."</p>

              its always the case in foreign countries.
              
              when overseas one should try to avoid confrontations.  its not your home afterall.  many  singaporeans behave badly when overseas. i have witnessed a lady banging the hotel reception counter in thailand yelling, 'i'm a singaporean!!!'.  as if it makes her better.
              
              damn foolish!!!
