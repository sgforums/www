              <p>Yeah.... I was stunned when I saw things like Secant Rule and 3D geometry in my tuition kid's O Level syllabus....</p>
              <p>I have a friggin' degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I swear that I had never heard of Secant Rule until I saw it in my student's textbook.....</p>
              <p>As for 3D geometry, I only learnt it in JC. And the way it was taught in the O Level textbook was..... dumb. I actually had to teach my student how to properly visualize the 3D shapes and to project them onto a 2D plane - simple concepts which I learnt in JC (but which the textbook didn't seem to teach).</p>

              <p><strong>PSLE Chinese papers - some may have edge over others</strong></p>
              <p>The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board, SEAB, says it has in
              place a due process to ensure that all examination questions are
              carefully set and vetted so that they are fair to all candidates. <br> <br> It issued the response in reply to a MediaCorp query on last Friday's PSLE Chinese exam paper. <br> <br> Some students who sat for the paper had found a comprehension passage very familiar. <br> <br> Parents posting to online forums said their children told them that the
              passage had previously appeared in an assessment paper with only minor
              changes. <br> <br> In its response SEAB added that examination questions are set by experienced and reliable examiners. <br> <br> They are then moderated several rounds by panels of specialists from SEAB and the Ministry of Education. <br> <br> Items are also trialled to ensure that the questions are fair and to determine the level of difficulty. <br> <br> SEAB says in this instance, although the setter had drawn reference from an external source, the passage is not a reproduction. <br> <br> The content and language in the passage had been substantially modified to be aligned to the assessment objective. <br> <br> Comprehension questions set on the passage were not taken from any source. <br> <br> SEAB also gave the assurance that pupils who had seen the other passage
              would not have been unfairly advantaged over those who did not. <br> <br> This is the second time this year's PSLE examinations are coming under the spotlight. <br> <br> Earlier, the PSLE Mathematics paper drew criticism for being too tough.</p>

              <p>The teacher who set the question do not have the decency to do a time check to see if the question (or all the questions) can be completed on time bah......</p>
              <p>Some more its the first time they can use calculator, so they should use the 1st paper set to gauge students level, and not some teacher created some riddles and marvel to see which bright or smart student can solve his question.</p>

              <p><strong>Parents up in arms again over PSLE Mathematics paper</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The first thing her son did when he came out from the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) maths paper on Thursday this week was to gesture as if he was "slitting his throat".</p>
              <p>"One look at his face and I thought ’oh no’. I could see that he felt he was condemned," said Mrs Karen Sng. "When he was telling me about how he couldn’t answer some of the questions, he got very emotional and started crying. He said his hopes of getting (an) A* are dashed."</p>
              <p>Not for the first time, parents are up in arms over the PSLE Mathematics paper, which some have described as "unbelievably tough" this year. As recently as two years ago, the PSLE Mathematics paper had also caused a similar uproar.</p>
              <p>The reason for Thursday’s tough paper, opined the seven parents whom MediaCorp spoke to, was because Primary 6 students were allowed to use calculators while solving <strong>Paper 2 for the first time. Paper 2 makes up 60 per cent of the entire paper and consists of 18 questions.</strong></p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There you go, 18 questions..... shows outright of poor time estimation by question setter in MOE. How is it that if 1 question needs around &gt;5 min inclusive of reading the question and formulating a solution.</p>
              <p>So, paper 2 is 2 hrs mah?</p>
              <p>Also the question setter or exam duration setter didnt even take into account exam stress which will require the students longer time in the exam environment.</p>
              <p>I think even Polys or Univ lecturer able to set more realistic timing than them.</p>

              <p>Some things to take note and think about:</p>
              <p>For English, the textbook is rarely used by most English teachers because they are mostly on basic facts already taught in P1 onwards.</p>
              <p>For Maths, calculations are important in our daily life, especially when we work in the future. However, the calculator can now be used. Furthermore, you don't go to Uncle Tidbits and give a problem sum to the cashier, making him/her rack her brains, do you?</p>
              <p>For Chinese, the textbooks rarely help. The comprehension requires you to write everthing in the answer key. Even if your answer mean the same as that in the answer key, you will be marked wrong. For example, if the answer is ä»–çš„å®¶å¢ƒå¾ˆå¯Œè£•ï¼Œæ�°æ�°ç›¸å��ï¼Œå¥¹çš„å®¶å¢ƒå¾ˆè´«å›°ã€‚but if you write ä»–çš„å®¶åº­å¾ˆæœ‰é’±ï¼Œè€Œå¥¹çš„å®¶åº­å¾ˆè´«ç©·ã€‚, you may be marked wrong for missing out æ�°æ�°ç›¸å�� or not writing the key words å®¶å¢ƒå¾ˆå¯Œè£• and å®¶å¢ƒå¾ˆè´«å›°!</p>
              <p>For Science, most of the information you learn is not going to be used in the rest of your lives unless you work in that field. You don't go to the grocery stall and tell the uncle, "Do you have any Prunus Cultivar (which is just the scientific name for plums)?", do you?</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore’s exam board says PSLE papers not too tough</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>SINGAPORE: After two outbursts in the last
              three years from parents about the Primary School Leaving Examination,
              in particular, the Mathematics paper, is there a nascent trend of
              questions becoming too difficult for 12—year—olds?</p>
              <p>Not so, says the Singapore Examination and Assessment Board (SEAB).</p>
              <p>In
              response to questions from MediaCorp, a spokesperson said that the
              panel responsible for setting questions ensures "there is a good
              coverage of syllabus and a judicious balance of easy, average and
              difficult questions".</p>
              <p>This examination panel is made up of
              "experienced schoolteachers, curriculum specialists from the Ministry
              of Education (MOE) as well as SEAB assessment specialists" and they
              take "careful consideration" to ensure "the questions are within the
              respective syllabus and within the pupil’s abilities and experiences".</p>
              <p>There
              are also "processes" in place to "calibrate the difficulty level of
              each question and to control the overall standard of the paper", said
              the spokesperson — though no specific examples were given.</p>
              <p>Asked
              if there has been grade inflation — and hence, tougher papers being set
              in response to better scores — the SEAB spokesperson noted that the
              level of difficulty of this year’s PSLE Mathematics test is "pitched at
              the same level as that in the previous years".</p>
              <p>Some parents
              have complained about this year’s paper based on feedback from their
              children, with some wondering if the introduction of calculators was a
              factor.</p>
              <p>The use of calculators does not have a "direct bearing" on the difficulty of paper, according to SEAB.</p>
              <p>Calculators
              became part of the primary school mathematics curriculum last year for
              Primary Five pupils "to help reduce computation errors". But basic
              computation skills "remain important", said SEAB.</p>
              <p>This is why
              the PSLE Maths exam has been split into two papers — the first without
              the use of calculators and which constitutes 40 per cent of total marks
              — and the second where calculators are allowed and which pupils sit for
              after a one—hour break. At two hours 30 minutes, the total time
              allotted is 15 minutes more than before.</p>
              <p>However, a teacher who declined to be named wondered if it was time to re—look the mode of PSLE assessment.</p>
              <p>She
              told MediaCorp: "The syllabus is moving away from knowledge—based to
              one that is creative ... but despite the shift, the mode of evaluation
              has not changed."</p>
              <p>She added that the level of difficulty could drive some parents to put additional pressure on their children.</p>
              <p>And some parents, it seems, are going to great lengths to ensure their children are prepared.</p>
              <p>A
              tutor told MediaCorp that she sends her nine—year—old son to two
              separate tuition centres so he can learn about creative problem solving
              as well as basic speed counting — all with an eye on the PSLE exams to
              come.</p>
              <p>"Of course, the teachers at his school do their best to
              cover the bases but they only have so many hours in a day to do this
              ... I just want to make sure he doesn’t get left behind and is well
              prepared," said the 35—year—old.</p>
