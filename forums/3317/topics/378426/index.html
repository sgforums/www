              <p><strong>Parents up in arms again over PSLE Mathematics paper</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The first thing her son did when he came out from the
              Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) maths paper on Thursday this
              week was to gesture as if he was "slitting his throat".</p>
              <p>"One
              look at his face and I thought ’oh no’. I could see that he felt he was
              condemned," said Mrs Karen Sng. "When he was telling me about how he
              couldn’t answer some of the questions, he got very emotional and
              started crying. He said his hopes of getting (an) A* are dashed."</p>
              <p>Not
              for the first time, parents are up in arms over the PSLE Mathematics
              paper, which some have described as "unbelievably tough" this year. As
              recently as two years ago, the PSLE Mathematics paper had also caused a
              similar uproar.</p>
              <p>The reason for Thursday’s tough paper, opined
              the seven parents whom MediaCorp spoke to, was because Primary 6
              students were allowed to use calculators while solving Paper 2 for the
              first time. Paper 2 makes up 60 per cent of the entire paper and
              consists of 18 questions.</p>
              <p>Said Mrs Vivian Weng: "I think the
              setters feel it’ll be faster for them to compute with a calculator. So
              the problems they set are much more complex; there are more values,
              more steps. But it’s unfair because this is the first time they can do
              so and they do not know what to expect!"</p>
              <p>These parents’ children are studying in both neighbourhood and "top" schools.</p>
              <p>In
              response to MediaCorp’s queries, the Education Ministry said this
              year’s paper was "comparable" to those of previous years. "There is no
              change in syllabus, question types or number of questions," a
              spokesperson said.</p>
              <p>"The introduction of the use of calculators
              does not have any bearing on the difficulty of paper. The use of
              calculators has been introduced into the primary maths curriculum so as
              to enhance the teaching and learning of maths by expanding the
              repertoire of learning activities, to achieve a better balance between
              the time and effort spent developing problem solving skills and
              computation skills. Calculators can also help to reduce computational
              errors."</p>
              <p>But the parents MediaCorp spoke to said students were
              apparently so stumped that many — even top students who have regularly
              aced past school examinations — broke down in tears in right after the
              paper.</p>
              <p>Private maths tutor Josephine Tan whose son studies at
              Anglo—Chinese School (Junior), said he told her that "many A* students
              in the top class... couldn’t finish all the questions".</p>
              <p>According
              to posts on an online forum for parents, one example of the problem
              sums given was: "Jim bought some chocolates and gave half of it to Ken.
              Ken bought some sweets and gave half of it to Jim. Jim ate 12 sweets
              and Ken ate 18 chocolates. The ratio of Jim’s sweets to chocolates
              became 1:7 and the ratio of Ken’s sweets to chocolates became 1:4. How
              many sweets did Ken buy?"</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan said: "They have spent
              months revising and preparing, but it’s so much tougher than they
              expected. It really put a big dent on students’ morale."</p>
              <p>Another common gripe: There was not enough time for them to complete the paper.</p>
              <p>A
              private tutor, who declined to be named, told MediaCorp she concurred
              with parents’ opinions. "This year’s paper demanded more from students.
              It required them to read and understand more complex questions, and go
              through more steps, so time constraints would have been a concern," the
              28—year—old said.</p>
              <p>However, the parents’ fear of poor grades
              for their children may be unfounded since they will be compared against
              the entire cohort’s performance.</p>
              <p>And the answer to the question? 68.</p>

              <p>I find it very frustrating that parents do not understand the concept of the bell curve. It's simple: even if the paper was so hard that the 90th percentile is pegged at say, in the 75-80/100 region, your child will still have a chance to get that A or A* so long as he beats the competition.</p>
              <p>You should only be worrying if your child ALONE is crying over the toughness of the paper. The key is to beat the competition by doing well in the paper RELATIVE to the rest of the cohort, not to set the unrealistic aim of scoring perfectly for each question and leaving your child an emotional wreck at the tender age of 12 because he could not achieve that. If you are confident that your child has been putting in more effort than his peers, then you should be confident about his results.</p>
              <p>I think the only possible exception to this rule of thumb is when parents are dead set on entering their kids into the truly premier independant schools etc. Raffles Institution where they may have the autonomy to decide to limit the size of a year's cohort due to that year's overall weak academic standards. I am not sure on this point.</p>
              <p>Am I wrong?</p>

              <p>I just hope that there won't be another P6 kid committing suicide over failing to get an A* for every subject.In the past,there were such news and judging from the current situation,that is still a very likely scenario.</p>
              <p>This might not be a pleasant thought but have you guys ever wondered why the parents put so much pressure on their children?</p>
              <p>Face/pride aside,did you ever consider the possibility that the parents only view their children as a tool to ensure their future survival when they become old?Many will claim to only want the best for their child,for their future....etc.But some of them are just worried as to whether their children would be able to provide them with the same comfortable standard of living or even better than that when they grow up.If the child fails to perform from young,he will not be able to support them in a way that their every desire would be met.</p>
              <p>When my friend failed to enter either the law or medical faculty at NUS,his parents condemned him as a failure/ingrate.From his sec school days till now,his parents have been constantly reminding him that they want to upgrade to a condominium from their current 4 room hdb before they would give him their blessings to marry his GF.</p>
              <p>Thus,such hooha over the PSLE difficulty don't come as a shock to me.</p>
              <p>I'm happy though that such parents are in the minority.</p>
