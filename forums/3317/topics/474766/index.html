              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">To judge from the commentary inspired by the shutdown, most progressives and centrists, and even many non-Tea Party conservatives, do not understand the radical force that has captured the Republican Party and paralyzed the federal government. Having grown up in what is rapidly becoming a Tea Party heartland–Texas–I think I do understand it. Allow me to clear away a few misconceptions about what really should be called, not the Tea Party Right, but the Newest Right.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The first misconception that is widespread in the commentariat is that the Newest Right can be thought of as being simply a group of “extremists” who happen to be further on the same political spectrum on which leftists, liberals, centrists and moderate conservatives find their places. But reducing politics to points on a single line is more confusing than enlightening. Most political movements result from the intersection of several axes—ideology, class, occupation, religion, ethnicity and region—of which abstract ideology is seldom the most important.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The second misconception is that the Newest Right or Tea Party Right is populist. The data, however, show that Tea Party activists and leaders on average are more affluent than the average American. The white working class often votes for the Newest Right, but then the white working class has voted for Republicans ever since Nixon. For all its Jacksonian populist rhetoric, the Newest Right is no more a rebellion of the white working class than was the original faux-populist Jacksonian movement, led by rich slaveowners like Andrew Jackson and agents of New York banks like Martin Van Buren.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The third misconception is that the Newest Right is irrational. The American center-left, whose white social base is among highly-educated, credentialed individuals like professors and professionals, repeatedly has committed political suicide by assuming that anyone who disagrees with its views is an ignorant “Neanderthal.” Progressive snobs to the contrary, the leaders of the Newest Right, including Harvard-educated Ted Cruz, like the leaders of any successful political movement, tend to be highly educated and well-off. The self-described members of the Tea Party tend to be <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none; color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?_r=0">more affluent and educated</a> than the general public.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Newest Right, then, cannot be explained in terms of abstract ideological extremism, working-class populism or ignorance and stupidity. What, then, is the Newest Right?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Newest Right is the simply the old Jeffersonian-Jacksonian right, adopting new strategies in response to changed circumstances. While it has followers nationwide, its territorial bases are the South and the West, particularly the South, whose population dwarfs that of the Mountain and Prairie West. According to <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none; color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.shsu.edu/~sgu001/mpsa2011.pdf">one study</a> by scholars at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas:</p>

Its social base consists of what, in other countries, are called the “local notables”—provincial elites whose power and privileges are threatened from above by a stronger central government they do not control and from below by the local poor and the local working class.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Even though, like the Jacksonians and Confederates of the nineteenth century, they have allies in places like Wisconsin and Massachusetts, the dominant members of the Newest Right are white Southern local notables—the Big Mules, as the Southern populist Big Jim Folsom once described the lords of the local car dealership, country club and chamber of commerce.  These are not the super-rich of Silicon Valley or Wall Street (although they have Wall Street allies). The Koch dynasty rooted in Texas notwithstanding, those who make up the backbone of the Newest Right are more likely to be millionaires than billionaires, more likely to run low-wage construction or auto supply businesses than multinational corporations. They are second-tier people on a national level but first-tier people in their states and counties and cities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> For nearly a century, from the end of Reconstruction, when white Southern terrorism drove federal troops out of the conquered South, until the Civil Rights Revolution, the South’s local notables maintained their control over a region of the U.S. larger than Western Europe by means of segregation, disenfranchisement, and bloc voting and the filibuster at the federal level. Segregation created a powerless black workforce and helped the South’s notables pit poor whites against poor blacks. The local notables also used literacy tests and other tricks to disenfranchise lower-income whites as well as blacks in the South, creating a distinctly upscale electorate. Finally, by voting as a unit in Congress and presidential elections, the “Solid South” sought to thwart any federal reforms that could undermine the power of Southern notables at the state, county and city level. When the Solid South failed, Southern senators made a specialty of the filibuster, the last defense of the embattled former Confederacy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">When the post-Civil War system broke down during the Civil Rights Revolution of the 1950s and 1960s, the South’s local notable class and its Northern and Western allies unexpectedly won a temporary three-decade reprieve, thanks to the “Reagan Democrats.” From the 1970s to the 2000s, white working-class voters alienated from the Democratic Party by civil rights and cultural liberalism made possible Republican presidential dominance from Reagan to George W. Bush and Republican dominance of Congress from 1994 to 2008. Because their politicians dominated the federal government much of the time, the conservative notables were less threatened by federal power, and some of them, like the second Bush, could even imagine a “governing conservatism” which, <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none; color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Made-Texas-Southern-Takeover-American/dp/0465041213">I have argued</a>, sought to “Southernize” the entire U.S.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">But then, by the 2000s, demography destroyed the temporary Nixon-to-Bush conservative majority (although conceivably it could enjoy an illusory Indian summer if Republicans pick up the Senate and retain the House in 2016). Absent ever-growing shares of the white vote, in the long run the Republican Party cannot win without attracting more black and Latino support.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">That may well happen, in the long run. But right now most conservative white local notables in the South and elsewhere in the country don’t want black and Latino support. They would rather disenfranchise blacks and Latinos than compete for their votes. And they would rather dismantle the federal government than surrender their local power and privilege.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The political strategy of the Newest Right, then, is simply a new strategy for the very old, chiefly-Southern Jefferson-Jackson right. It is a perfectly rational strategy, given its goal: maximizing the political power and wealth of white local notables who find themselves living in states, and eventually a nation, with present or potential nonwhite majorities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong>Although racial segregation can no longer be employed, the tool kit of the older Southern white right is pretty much the same as that of the Newest Right:</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;"><em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;">The Solid South</em>.</strong> By means of partisan and racial gerrymandering—packing white liberal voters into conservative majority districts and ghettoizing black and Latino voters–Republicans in Texas and other Southern and Western states control the U.S. Congress, even though in the last election more Americans voted for Democrats than Republicans. The same undemocratic technique makes the South far more Republican in its political representation than it really is in terms of voters.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;"><em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;">The Filibuster. </em></strong>By using a semi-filibuster to help shut down the government rather than implement Obamacare, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is acting rationally on behalf of his constituency—the surburban and exurban white local notables of Texas and other states, whom the demagogic Senator seems to confuse with “the American people.” Newt Gingrich, another Southern conservative demagogue, pioneered the modern use of government shutdowns and debt-ceiling negotiations as supplements to the classic filibuster used by embattled white provincial elites who prefer to paralyze a federal government they cannot control.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;"><em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;">Disenfranchisement. </em></strong>In state after state controlled by Republican governors and legislators, a fictitious epidemic of voter fraud is being used as an excuse for onerous voter registration requirements which have the effect, and the manifest purpose, of disenfranchising disproportionately poor blacks and Latinos. The upscale leaders of the Newest Right also tend to have be more supportive of mass immigration than their downscale populist supporters—on the condition, however, that “guest workers” and amnestied illegal immigrants not be allowed to vote or become citizens any time soon. In the twenty-first century, as in the twentieth and nineteenth, the Southern ideal is a society in which local white elites lord it over a largely-nonwhite population of poor workers who can’t vote.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;"><em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;">Localization and privatization of federal programs. </em></span>It is perfectly rational for the white local notables of the South and their allies in other regions to oppose universal, federal social programs, if they expect to lose control of the federal government to a new, largely-nonwhite national electoral majority.</strong></p>

              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.dropcap" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">Did you happen to see Jimmy Kimmel’s interesting skit last week, where he asked people on the street whether they preferred “Obamacare” or the “Affordable Care Act”? Far too many people chose the “Affordable Care Act” over “Obamacare” without realizing that they are one and the same law.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">Even worse, several of Kimmel’s interviewees rejected “Obamacare” after having already endorsed major pieces of it! Some of this cluelessness is no doubt because of propaganda. Some of it is no doubt because of partisan dislike of the president. But we must not shy away from the truth that too much of this is still about race.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">This shutdown over the Affordable Care Act is not just about John Boehner’s weak leadership. It’s not just about Ted Cruz’s misinterpretation of “Green Eggs and Ham,” or even his rude and crude attempt to jump to the front of the 2016 GOP presidential contenders in Iowa. It’s not just about personalities, and positioning, and day-to-day politics.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">This shutdown is also a showdown. Its roots run deep — all the way back to John Calhoun, to the Confederacy, to nullification.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">This shutdown is about the fear that drives the Republican Party’s hatred for Barack Obama. Democracy Corps’ just-released study on the core groups of the GOP does make this relevant point: “Obama is big government — but much bigger.They believe he is building dependent minorities that will give the Democrats a governing majority.”</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong style="color: #3d3c3c;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This shutdown is about race.</span></strong><span style="color: #3d3c3c;"> Consider another Democracy Corps conclusion: “They are </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">very conscious of being white in a country that is increasingly minority</span></span></strong><span style="color: #3d3c3c;"> — as Democrats use government to build dependency and therefore also their support with minorities. </span><strong style="color: #3d3c3c;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The race issue is very much alive.</span></strong><span style="color: #3d3c3c;">”</span></p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">Half a century ago, George Wallace stood in a schoolhouse door in Alabama, to try to deny entry to African-American students. He failed. The American people were better than that.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today, almost all Republican governors are standing in the hospital door, barring entrance to poor and working people — a huge percentage of whom are African-American and Latino — for health care through Medicaid expansion.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #3d3c3c;">The New York Times ran the census numbers a few days ago. Here’s the money quote on who will be excluded: “ . . . </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">two-thirds of the poor blacks and single mothers and more than half of the low-wage workers who do not have insurance. . . . Because they live in states largely controlled by Republicans that have declined to participate in a vast expansion of Medicaid,</span></span></strong><span style="color: #3d3c3c;"> the medical insurance program for the poor, they are among the 8 million Americans who are impoverished, uninsured and ineligible for help.”</span></p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">These GOP governors are using a loophole created by the Roberts Supreme Court, which managed to sneak in a “state’s rights” loophole to weaken the Affordable Care Act, even as the court judged the overall law constitutional. This loophole allowed Republican governors in half the states to mistreat their own constituents by denying Medicaid to millions of politically voiceless people who need the health care.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It’s not just a coincidence that a disproportionate share of African Americans who need Medicaid, and working poor people who need Medicaid, live in those states. It’s not just a coincidence that Arkansas, that rare Southern state with a Democratic governor, is the only state from the Old Confederacy that is not denying Medicaid expansion.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #3d3c3c;">Don’t just take my word for it. Listen to the words of analyst Michael Lind in Salon: “Right now most conservative white local notables in the South and elsewhere in the country don’t want black and Latino support. They would rather disenfranchise blacks and Latinos than compete for their votes. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">And they would rather dismantle the federal government than surrender their local power and privilege.”</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">Unfortunately, for Boehner, Cruz, the GOP governors, and the Tea Party, they are standing in the way of history. Like their predecessor, Gov. George Wallace, they are trying to deny innocent and needy Americans access to a universal right that the rest of the civilized world has already agreed upon.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">So if we stick together in this fight, the odds are that the Calhounites and Cruzies will fail in their quest to roll back progress. The odds are that they will fail in their short-term goal of shutting down the government, and in their longer-term quest to destroy the Affordable Care Act.</p>
              <p class="Pioneer 2013-Pioneer.body.copy.RR" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #3d3c3c; line-height: 20px; font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;">This is not just a shutdown, it’s a showdown. And our future’s at stake. Keep Hope Alive!</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Just as a strategy is not a conspiracy, so it is not insanity. Ironically, American progressives, centrists and some Northern conservatives are only deluding themselves, when they insist that the kind of right-wing Southerners behind the government shutdown are “crazy.” Crazy, yes — crazy like a fox.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Another mistake is the failure to recognize that the Southern elite strategy, though bound up with white supremacy throughout history, is primarily about cheap and powerless labor, not about race. If the South and the U.S. as a whole through some magical transformation became racially homogeneous tomorrow, there is no reason to believe that the Southern business and political class would suddenly embrace a new model of political economy based on high wages, high taxes and centralized government, rather than pursue its historical model of a low-wage, low-tax, decentralized system, even though all workers, employers and investors now shared a common skin color.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">So the struggle is not one to convert Southern Baptists to Darwinism or to get racists to celebrate diversity. The on-going power struggle between the local elites of the former Confederacy and their allies in other regions and the rest of the United States is not primarily about personal attitudes. It is about power and wealth.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">For some time, the initiative has rested with the Southern power elite, which knows what it wants and has a plan to get it. The strategy of the conservative South, as a nation-within-a nation and in the global economy, combines an economic strategy and a political strategy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The economic strategy is to maximize the attractiveness of the former Confederacy to external investors, by allowing Southern states to out-compete other states in the U.S., as well as other countries if possible, in a race to the bottom by means of low wages, stingy government welfare (which if generous increases the bargaining power of poor workers by decreasing their desperation) and low levels of environmental regulation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The political strategy of the Southern elite is to prevent the Southern victims of these local economic policies from teaming up with allies in other parts of the U.S. to impose federal-level reforms on the Southern states. Voter suppression seeks to prevent voting by lower-income Southerners of all races who are hostile to the Southern power elite. Partisan gerrymandering of the U.S. House of Representatives by conservatives in Southern state legislatures weakens the votes of anti-conservative Southerners, if they are allowed to vote.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">If voter suppression and vote dilution strategies fail, the Southern conservatives can still try to ward off unwelcome federally-imposed reforms that might weaken control of the Southern workforce by Southern employers and their political agents, by policies of devolving federal programs to the states, privatizing federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, blocking the implementation of new federal entitlements like Obamacare or a combination of these strategies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">To date the response of progressives and centrists, as well as moderate conservatives in the North (who have a quite different tradition) to what might be called the Southern Autonomy Project has been feeble and reactive. The South acts, the rest of the country reacts.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Here Midwestern Republican legislatures or governors try to copy the South’s anti-labor “right-to-work” legislation, and labor activists and liberals react.  The legislatures in the South and their allies elsewhere pass voter suppression laws, and civil rights groups scramble to counteract them. Now the Southern-dominated Tea Party in the House shuts down the government and threatens to force the federal government into default. In this game of “Whack-a-mole,” the Southern right and its neo-Jacksonian allies in other parts of the country always has the initiative.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Instead of waiting for the next Southern conservative outrage, and treating it as a single, isolated example of inexplicable craziness, the rest of America from center-left to center-right should recognize that it is dealing with different aspects of a single strategy by a regional elite — the Southern Autonomy Project. It is time for the non-Southern American majority, in alliance with many non-elite Southerners of all races, to target and attack every element of the Southern Autonomy Project simultaneously. If the neo-Confederates want to wage political and economic war, their fellow Americans should choose to respond with political and economic war on all fronts, not on the terms and in the places the Southern conservatives choose.</p>

Completely federalizing Medicaid (as President Ronald Reagan suggested!) and other hybrid federal-state social insurance programs would cripple the Southern Autonomy Project further.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;"><em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; list-style: none;">Real voting rights</em></strong>.  Using the authority of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Congress should completely federalize voting requirements for all federal, state and local elections, making it as easy as possible for U.S. citizens to vote — over the objections of kicking and screaming neo-Confederates.</p>

(Electoral reforms like instant run-off voting and proportional representation are struggles for a more distant future).</p>

It has been used by Southern white conservatives from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first to preserve Southern white power and economic privilege. This relic of premodern  British parliamentary politics should be abolished. Democracy means majority rule. If the Southern Right loses a battle in Congress, it can try to round up allies and win next time. It should no longer be able to paralyze the Senate, the Congress or the federal government as a whole.</p>

Now that the Southern right is trying to turn it into a recurrent tool of hostage-taking when it loses votes in Congress, the federal debt ceiling should be abolished. The federal government should be authorized to borrow any amount necessary to fund spending appropriated or authorized by Congress, if there is any shortfall in tax revenues.</p>

Among the beneficiaries of a National Majority Rule Project, if it succeeded, would be middle- and low-income white Southerners, whose interests have never been identical with those of the local oligarchs. Particularly among the Scots-Irish of Appalachia and the Ozarks, there have always been many Southern white populists and radicals — from the West Virginian and Kentucky Unionists of the Civil War to New Deal liberals in Texas — who have understood the need to ally ourselves with non-Southerners in national politics to defeat the local Nabobs, Bourbons and Big Mules. The true Southern patriots are those of us who want to liberate the diverse population of the South from being exploited as wage earners and from being disfranchised or manipulated as voters. Another term for the National Majority Rule Project might be the Southern Liberation Movement.</p>

Or will an aroused national majority, tired of being pushed around by a selfish Southern minority of the shrinking American white majority, finally fight back?</p>

But despite the last-minute deal, the deeper fissures that produced the Republican standoff and the government shutdown are not going away any time soon. They reflect fundamental divides in America’s economic and political landscape that have only deepened over time.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Over the past few weeks, politicians and commentators – from <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/01/obama-gop-holding-entire-economy-hostage-over-ideological-demands/">President Obama</a> to a whole <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2013/10/shutdown_hostage_taking_how_the_gop_trades_piecemeal_funding_bills_for_leverage.html">host</a>of <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/06/shutdown-crisis-we-need-a-hostage-negotiator.html">news</a> outlets – have referred to the shutdown as the work of a few Republicans holding Congress and the economy "hostage." One particularly striking map (immediately below) by<a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/09/meadows-boehner-defund-obamacare-suicide-caucus-geography.html">Ryan Lizza of the <em>New Yorker</em></a> has circulated around the internet for the last few weeks. It charts the districts of the 79 members of Congress credited as the instigators of the shutdown crisis, after they signed a letter to House Speaker John Boehner this summer demanding action on "de-funding" the Affordable Care Act.  </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><strong><img style="border-style: none; vertical-align: top; width: 600px; height: 435px;" src="http://cdn.theatlanticcities.com/img/upload/2013/10/16/congressdistricts_final_big-01.jpg" alt=""></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The geography of Tea Party conservatives is largely what you’d expect. Half are in the South, and a quarter are in the Midwest. Not a single one is in the Northeast or the along the Pacific coast. All voted for Romney over Obama. As Lizza points out, using data from Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman, the average district in this "suicide caucus" was three-quarters white, compared to 63 percent white in the average House district.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">To underscore how different the Tea Party base is, my colleague Charlotta Mellander at the<a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://martinprosperity.org/">Martin Prosperity Institute</a> ran a simple correlation analysis looking at the share of a state’s congressional delegation that had signed the August letter to Boehner (and thereby made it into Lizza’s "suicide caucus") and key economic and demographic characteristics of the state. As usual, we point out that this is only a preliminary analysis, and that correlation does not equal causation. But a number of interesting patterns appear, in light of both the maps in this post and what others have written about these diehard anti-Obamacare Republicans in the past few weeks.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">First off, Mellander found states with higher shares of suicide caucus districts to be less advantaged, less affluent, and less educated. The percentage of suicide caucus districts was negatively correlated with wages (-.30), incomes (-.33) and college graduates (-.36). States with higher shares of suicide-caucus districts were also less diverse – both in terms of immigrant and gay and lesbian shares of the populations (with correlations of -.33 and -.32 respectively). States with more suicide caucus district are also markedly less urban. The correlation between the share of members in the suicide caucus and levels of urbanization was significantly negative (-.5). Mellander also found a positive correlation between the share of uninsured residents and proportion of suicide cause districts, a fact that <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/where-are-the-uninsured-americans-who-will-benefit-from-obamacare/280283/"><em>National Journal’s </em>Ron Brownstein has noted.</a></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Next, compare Lizza’s map to the ones that <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2012/09/how-creative-class-reshaping-americas-electoral-map/3346/">Brownstein put together before last fall’s election</a>. These maps (below) chart the creative class vote (including scientists and technologists, business and management professionals, and arts, design, entertainment and media workers) by county in the 2008 Obama-McCain contest. (Keep in mind these maps use older data, gathered before the Tea Party even became a major force in American politics and they chart counties, not congressional districts).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Still, the basic pattern is clear. Notice how much of eastern Tennessee – a block of Tea Party dark red on Lizza’s map – shows up in the bottom third of counties for creative class membership. Tea Party areas like those in southern Missouri and northern Indiana also show up in pockets of red on the bottom map of low creative-class density. And some of the darker red regions that appear on the first map below, representing the nearly 43 percent of high creative-class counties that went for McCain, tend not to overlap with the 79 members of Lizza’s "suicide caucus" – through Nebraska and the Dakotas especially.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><img style="border-style: none; vertical-align: top; width: 600px; height: 767px;" src="http://cdn.theatlanticcities.com/img/upload/2012/09/20/092012_CC_maps.png" alt=""><br><em>Maps courtesy of National Journal</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Now compare Lizza’s map to <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2013/02/what-makes-some-cities-vote-democratic/4598/">the next map (below), which shows the share of Obama and Romney votes by metro area</a>. The deep red metros are largely in oil and gas-dependent metros of Texas, though places like Salt Lake City unsurprisingly make the list as well. Apart from these larger Energy Belt metros, comparing this map to Lizza’s shows how the Tea Party caucus represents the less urban, less dense places – the metros (and in general places that don’t even meet the definition of a metro) that are well below the densities required for innovation and real economic growth.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><img style="border-style: none; vertical-align: top; width: 600px; height: 464px;" src="http://cdn.theatlanticcities.com/img/upload/2013/02/08/metro%20electionmap1web.jpg" alt=""><br><em>Map by MPI's Zara Matheson</em></p>

It’s a map of America’s centers of innovation, which <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/10/where-americas-inventors-ara/7069/">I wrote about on <em>Cities</em> last week</a> (and which my <em>Atlantic</em>colleague <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/weekend-shutdown-reader-lest-we-forget/280535/">James Fallows</a> used to make a similar point earlier this week).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><img style="border-style: none; vertical-align: top; width: 600px; height: 464px;" src="http://cdn.theatlanticcities.com/img/upload/2013/10/16/patent_apps_2011.jpg" alt=""><em>Map by MPI's Zara Matheson</em></p>

As a reader wrote to Fallows, the lack of overlap in this map of patents and map of Tea Party strongholds is revealing: "A minority of Americans seems committed to a past that never quite existed and hopes for a future that seems rather unlikely."</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 19px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Taken together, these maps illustrate the deep economic fault lines underlying America’s dysfunctional politics. The Tea Party represents the lagging sectors of the economy, and, increasingly, the politics of those left behind by America’s transition to a new, knowledge-oriented economic future. As <a style="color: #16aab1;" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/ten-miles-square/2013/10/regional_differences_have_doom047323.php">Colin Woodard</a> writes over at <em>Washington Monthly</em>, the Tea Party’s strength is concentrated in the Deep South, Appalachia (stretching to West Texas), and a region he calls the Far West. He explains:</p>
              <blockquote style="padding: 20px; background-color: #e7f3f3; margin: 15px 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">There are tea party supporters everywhere, but only in these three cultural regions have they managed to achieve real and lasting political success. This is because their platform — to slash taxes, labor protections, environmental regulations, social programs, and the reach and authority of the federal government — is in accord with the centuries-old cultural ethos of each of these regions, and anathema to those elsewhere.</p>
              </blockquote>

The Tea Party, he writes, reflects "a coherent and rational strategy for maximizing the relative power of provincial white elites at a time when their numbers are in decline and history has turned against them."</p>
