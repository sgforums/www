              <p>Former foreign minister George Yeo is a man of many words. Many 
              remember him for his banyan tree speech which, in a round-about way, was
               telling leaders to let light shine through their over-protective 
              shoulders and let those under them blossom.</p>
              <p>Last month, he chose just two words and a question mark in a Facebook post to make his point.</p>
              <p>Striking in its brevity, refreshing in its clarity Yeo's post asked pointedly: Whither Singapore?</p>
              <p>That was just one day after the ruling party had suffered an 
              embarrassing defeat in a by-election that exposed a 11 percentage point 
              shift against it.</p>
              <p>The biggest and most unfortunate victim of the 2011 General Election 
              got more than 800 reacting on his Facebook and many more thinking what 
              was unthinkable just two years ago.</p>
              <p>Is the People's Action Party hurtling down a slippery slope to a 
              bigger humiliation at the next general election in 2016? Will this lead 
              to a two-party political system, even an Opposition sweeping into power,
               further down the road?</p>
              <p>The by-election backlash surprised many, even the opposition Workers'
               Party, which fielded a girl next door type candidate opposite PAP's 
              colorectal surgeon.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans outside Punggol East, where the by-election was fought, 
              were taken aback that the lack of everyday needs like childcare centres,
               coffeeshops and transport facilities had boiled over during the 
              campaigning.</p>
              <p>What was Mr Michael Palmer, the PAP legislator who triggered the 
              by-election because of his extra-marital affair, doing since the general
               election of 2011 when PAP's vote share dipped to a post-independent low
               of 60.1 per cent and three ministers, including Yeo, were voted out.</p>
              <p>Even the announcements of big-ticket items like multi-billion dollar 
              transport infrastructure projects and baby bonuses couldn't sway the 
              voters in Punnggol East. And the PM's last-minute entry at the final 
              election rally had no impact on Decision Day.</p>
              <p>Insiders say a press conference intended as a mop-up move after that 
              speech was cancelled because grassroots feedback showed that the PM had 
              swayed many voters.</p>
              <p>How misplaced that feedback was. Not only did the PAP lose the 
              constituency but polled only 43.7 percent of the votes against WP's 
              54.5.</p>
              <p>Just two weeks after the by-election thrashing, the government 
              submitted a White Paper on Population for debate in Parliament. That 
              sparked another round of anti-government bashing with many saying an 
              increase of 1.6 million people by 2030 taking the total population to 
              6.9 million, nearly half of them foreigners, will make the already 
              crowded city unliveable.</p>
              <p>Will the Singaporean become a stranger in his own land, some asked.</p>
              <p>The establishment was forced to clarify that the 6.9 million figure 
              was not a target, only a projection for planning purposes. But the 
              damage was already done.</p>
              <p>With the government in a state of siege and the public in a foul 
              mood, it was left to an insider, like PAP MP Inderjit Singh, to think 
              aloud about the eroding trust in government.</p>
              <p>A political commentator called on Singaporeans to get over the 
              emotional hump of angst, but she spoke too soon. For, it seemed, there 
              were other humps to cross. Some intellectuals and economists started 
              digging into the 42-page report and questioning the data used and the 
              conclusions reached.</p>
              <p>One took aim at the brains behind the report, the elite 
              administrative service, accusing it of not displaying academic rigour in
               researching the paper. Another said the red flag figure of 6.9 million 
              was "bogus".</p>
              <p>For a report that will affect the present and future generations, 
              there was no attempt to discuss it with the public. In the end a 
              slightly-amended version was passed after a five-day debate in a 
              PAP-dominated Parliament.</p>
              <p>Inderjit Singh, who was there when PM wrapped up the debate, absented himself when it was time to vote.</p>
              <p>Rarer still was to see thousands of people coming out on to 
              Singapore's version of the Speaker's Corner on Saturday to show their 
              displeasure.</p>
              <p>Even Singapore's harshest critics have only good words for its able and competent civil service and political leadership.</p>
              <p>But, the by-election blow-out and the White Paper wash-out have left many, not just Yeo, wondering where this country is headed.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: 'Serifa BT'; font-size: xx-large; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center;">Singapore: Wealth, Power and the Culture of Control</span></p>
              <p><strong style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span>Far Eastern Economic Review<br>September 2006<br>Reviewed by Garry Rodan <br><br>Singapore: Wealth, Power and the Culture of Control<br>by Carl A. Trocki<br>Routledge, 211 pages, $100/$33.95<br><br></span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">C</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">ARL Trocki offers a refreshingly different look at Singapore’s colonial and postcolonial history, emphasizing important <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">continuities in the city-state’s history of authoritarian rule and the struggles involving its Chinese-educated and ethnic Chinese majority. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">His book also makes the most <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">theoretically explicit statement yet that social conflict is the decisive force for change.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">For Mr Trocki, a professor of Asian studies at Queensland University of Technology, class friction was the key dynamic that shaped modern Singapore, with control over the opium trade and the system of labor organization being two fundamental aspects.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">However, he takes the legacy of precolonial social structures seriously in his explanation of the limits and possibilities of elite rule. His approach is also empathetic to the losers of these struggles and cognizant of the analytical importance of explaining their defeats. Consequently, the diminished power positions of local capitalists and the working class are afforded special attention and significance.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">The complex ethnic mix of forces important to the struggles over economic and social control throughout Singapore’s history poses challenges for class analysis. Mr Trocki appreciates this complexity, detailing much of it in the book. However, his principal focus is on how the different ethnic groups have been involved in, and affected by, the struggle to establish and shape capitalist development.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Therefore, whereas writers like Mervyn Wynne, Leon Comber and Wilfred Blythe saw Hokkien-Teochiu tensions in the 19th century as “doctrinal influences” imported from China, Mr Trocki argues that the root cause lies in the competition over control of pepper and gambier plantations.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Similarly, the fragmentation of Chinese secret societies into small-scale criminal gangs is traced by Mr Trocki to their being squeezed out of revenue farms, the coolie trade and pepper and gambier agriculture between the middle to late 19th century.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">The two points most powerfully made in this book relate to his class analysis but are not reducible to it. The first is the observation that the limited institutional penetration and social neglect of the colonial state had long-term political ramifications.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">The second is that the recent championing of Chinese cultural values by the ruling People’s Action Party <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">contradicts its own historic role in the marginalization of social forces and interests associated with Chinese culture.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Mr Trocki argues that due to both convenience and a lack of political will on the part of colonial authorities, many of the collective organizations of immigrant communities assumed a vast array of social and political roles. British rule in Singapore was “largely indirect and decentralized as a matter of necessity” given the unwillingness to invest in police forces and other infrastructure.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">The British relied, for instance, on voluntary collaboration from Chinese triad associations, Malay chiefs who exerted authority over trading communities, and other networks to control the rapidly expanding Chinese population. In the 19th century, Singapore-born Chinese merchants organized powerful kongsi organizations to ensure the wealth and welfare of their families and clans over the long term, providing for education, burials, support for the destitute and other social benefits.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Yet Mr Trocki explains that there were unintended political consequences from leaving the masses to their own welfare and organizational devices. The influence of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce (SCCC), labor unions and assorted student and cultural organizations expanded in the first half of the 20th century. Chinese schools also represented the largest and most vibrant education sector in Singapore by the 1940s.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">While the authorities selectively engaged with the SCCC, it was largely through other organizations that the postwar struggle for independence was conducted. This was a reality that Lee Kuan Yew and his faction in the pap had to contend with, the ultimate solution to which was harsh responses to independent, critical voices.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Despite Mr Trocki’s emphasis on class, he contends that<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the division between the Chinese-educated and the English-educated “lies at the heart of Singapore’s social fabric and has been one of the dynamic themes that binds the 19th-century history of the place to the 20th century.”</span></strong></span> In advancing this argument, Mr Trocki submits an especially unflattering contrast between the English-educated middle-class nationalists aligned with Lee Kuan Yew and Chinese-educated nationalists:</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">It was<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> the Chinese-educated, some of them communists, who had organized the labor unions in Singapore, fought secret-society thugs hired by the government, stood against police batons</span></span></strong> and, where necessary, gone to jail. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">None of these were things that Lee himself would ever have done.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Significantly, once the PAP was in government and Mr Lee’s faction in control of the executive,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> it was not just the organized working-class, Chinese-educated masses but also the local Chinese capitalists that Mr Lee sought to politically neuter. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">On this point, Mr Trocki makes a valuable contribution toward <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">a better understanding of how early and strategically Mr. Lee thought about curtailing organizational structures outside his control.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Nevertheless, his observations could still benefit from elaboration.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">For instance, what were the “left-leanings” of such business people as Tan Kah Kee, Lee Kong Chian and Tan Lark Sye that formed the basis of links between sections of the Chinese-educated business elite and the Chinese-educated mass organizations in the late 1950s and early 1960s?</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Was it only economic nationalism that provided any basis for extending the shared language and cultural agendas of these different social forces?</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Irrespective of the answers, Mr Trocki is right to emphasize how the tag of “Chinese chauvinism” was used expansively by Mr Lee to suppress legitimate debate about Chinese language and culture.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Having played <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">so decisive a role in the social, economic and political marginalization of the Chinese-educated, there is thus considerable irony in Mr Lee’s championing of Confucian values during the 1990s</span></span></strong>—a point to which Mr Trocki’s book gives acute expression. In this respect, the book’s target is as much the pap’s version of Singapore’s modern history <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">as it is professional historians who may have paid inordinate attention to elite colonial and postcolonial actors.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">In the latter chapters of the book, Mr Trocki offers a wide range of observations about the tensions unfolding in the present political economy of Singapore, including the growing dependence on new forms of immigrant labor.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">However, the real strength and originality of this book lies in the attempt to decipher the underlying nature and causes of social conflict over the last two centuries.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Trocki highlights the surprising continuity, maintaining that the real legacy inherited from the British was not a parliamentary system but “130 years of autocratic rule by an unresponsive bureaucracy and an ambitious and exploitative economic elite.”</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> For Mr Trocki, contemporary power structures in Singapore have much deeper roots than are generally recognized.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Government officials say that the call for more children was sparked by alarm over an increase in the number of adults who do not marry and a rise in the number of married couples who postpone having children. Without a change in the birth rate, officials contend, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">there will not be enough young people paying taxes by 2030 to provide services for the 800,000 residents 60 years old and above.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">"In order for any nation to survive, it has to change in accordance with changes in circumstances," First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said. "For us, it is even more necessary."</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">1960s Program</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Goh cautioned couples who cannot afford larger families to refrain from having more children. But he said that most can support three children and those "who can really afford it" should have more.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">The government, fearful of a runaway population overwhelming the job market, housing and health care facilities, embarked on its population control program in the 1960s. After the Family Planning and Population Board Act was passed in 1965,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>young people were bombarded with government slogans such as "Girl or Boy--Two Is Enough" from officials, teachers and other advisers.</strong></span> At the time, four or five children per family was the norm, and experts warned that the population would climb to a staggering 5 million people by the year 2000, overwhelming the 239-square-mile city-state.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">To help convince parents that fewer were better, the government legalized abortion and encouraged voluntary sterilization. Hospital fees went up as a woman had more babies, working mothers were allowed only two paid maternity leaves and a family's third, fourth and subsequent children were given a lower priority in the choice of and admission to schools.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">The measures had an immediate effect. Birth rates dropped sharply in the first four years and continued to decline. The small family grew in appeal as more people were educated, women joined the work force and incomes rose. The fertility rate--the number of children each woman is likely to have--dropped steadily from 4.7 per woman in 1965 to the planned level of 2.1 in 1975.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Campaign Backfired</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">But the campaign then began to backfire. The decline in the birth rate did not level off. Officials say that the average Singapore woman is likely to have only one or two children today. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They predict that the population will peak at 3 million in 2020 and then decline.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Goh said that the government could not have anticipated the problem.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> If every woman had married and had two children, the population would be replacing itself, he said.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">"It's because large numbers of people remain unmarried and the better-educated ones who are married have fewer than two children," Goh said.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Married couples now have "to make up for those who are not (having children) or who are under-producing," Goh said, while the government seeks ways to encourage single adults to marry.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Tax Rebates, Subsidies</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">The package of incentives is aimed at reducing the financial burden of having more children, he said. It includes special tax rebates, subsidies for child-care centers, priorities in government-subsidized housing and the removal of earlier disincentives discouraging more than two children.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Seeking cooperation from employers, the government is encouraging part-time and flexi-time employment for women with young children, extended maternity leave and the retraining of mothers who rejoin the labor force after having children.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">Goh is optimistic that Singapore residents will be replacing themselves by 1995 with the help of the new policies. But critics note that the emphasis on economics completely ignores major social changes and the realities of caring for babies.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">"We have a new breed of women," Malla Tan, a University of Singapore sociologist, said. "They're involved in their careers and have become used to a certain amount of leisure and more material possessions.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;">"Many prefer to be single. For those who marry, first they're told to stop at two children, but one is even better. Then they hear they should have three or more. It's crazy. It unnecessarily creates stress."</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The new government campaign also reflects a condescending attitude toward women, Tan said. "They tell women what to do, and they expect them to do it," Tan said.</span></span></strong></p>
