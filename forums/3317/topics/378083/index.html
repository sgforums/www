              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) was clearly
              manifested in this economic downturn when tripartite partners came
              together to issue guidelines to firms on how best to manage excess
              manpower and to save jobs, said Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong on
              Tuesday.
              <br> <br> This, despite a Trade and Industry Ministry survey which found that only three in ten companies practise CSR.
              <br> <br>Mr Gan said: "Companies were urged to save jobs by implementing
              alternative ways to manage their excess manpower, such as through
              shorter work weeks or to send their workers for training during
              downtimes and consider retrenchment only as a last resort.
              <br> <br>"This creates a win-win situation for both the company and the
              workers as the company is able to retain experienced workers and
              reposition itself for the eventual upturn, while the workers are able
              to keep their jobs."
              <br> <br>Out of the 1,900 companies surveyed, two-thirds or 66 per cent
              indicated that they had no plans to retrench workers. As for the rest,
              four out of five of them postponed their retrenchment decisions as a
              result of the guidelines.
              <br> <br> Mr Gan said such efforts to save jobs are a clear example of how CSR can work.
              <br> <br>CSR, however, is not without its critics. There are those who feel
              that businesses can contribute to society by doing what they do best,
              which is to remain profitable and to generate wealth and employment.
              <br> <br> There are also some who argue that CSR is a distraction which can lead to a misallocation of funds.
              <br> <br>Nonetheless, more Singapore companies have signed on to the United
              Nations Global Compact, which champions CSR practices globally, since
              2005. From just ten firms, the number grew to 72 in 2009. <br> <br> Thomas Thomas, executive director of Singapore Compact for CSR, said:
              "We want to tell organisations and companies that we can achieve
              environmental, social and economic progress together. People, planet
              and the profits can go together."
              <br> <br>To provide a better understanding on CSR, a book has been published
              by the Singapore Compact for CSR to showcase the success stories of ten
              businesses which practise it.
