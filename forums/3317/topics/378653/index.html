              <p>PARIS - Two-thirds of French people do not want Culture Minister
              Frederic Mitterrand to resign for having written about paying young
              male prostitutes for sex in Thailand, an opinion poll showed Monday.</p>
              <p>Mitterrand
              has rejected calls for his resignation, sparked by revelations in his
              2005 autobiography, "The Bad Life," and said the male prostitutes were
              consenting adults.</p>
              <p>The French government has also come out in support of Mitterrand, who has threatened legal action to protect his reputation.</p>
              <p>The
              controversy surfaced after Mitterrand defended film-maker Roman
              Polanski, who faces extradition from Switzerland to the United States
              for having had sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977.</p>
              <p>Both the far-right National Front party and main Socialist opposition party said he should step down.</p>
              <p>However,
              67 percent of French people do not want Mitterrand to resign, against
              20 percent who think he should, according to the survey of 1,005 people
              carried out by pollster BVA on October 9-10.</p>
              <p>Mitterrand has
              called his experiences in Thailand, described in the book that mixes
              autobiography and more dreamlike reflection, as "a mistake, certainly,
              a crime, no."</p>
              <p>"I got into the habit of paying for boys," Mitterrand wrote.</p>
              <p>"All
              these rituals of the market for youths, the slave market excited me
              enormously ... the abundance of very attractive and immediately
              available young boys put me in a state of desire."</p>
              <p>Mitterrand,
              the nephew of former Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, shot to
              the top of popularity polls after he was drafted into Sarkozy's
              centre-right cabinet in June.</p>

              <p>not known if the boys he paid for were underage..</p>
              <p>however, polanski ran from the law.. which is why the cops in the US don't want to let it go..</p>
              <p>he got away and by living the high life elsewhere, he basically flipped the bird at them..</p>
              <p>won't you be pissed off too?</p>
