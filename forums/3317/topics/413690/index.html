              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A former officer from AETOS Security Consultants has 
              been charged with asking a teenage girl to either have sex with him or 
              give him money after he caught her smoking and littering.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>26-year-old Eddie 
              Quek Yu Meng was attached to the National Environment Agency (NEA) as an
               enforcement officer when he caught the student and two other teenagers 
              throwing cigarette butts at Woodlands Civic Centre on October 31, 2008.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He took down their 
              particulars but is believed to have released them on the spot instead of
               reporting the trio to the relevant authorities.<br><br>Quek allegedly 
              posed as an NEA officer and contacted the girl in February 2009 even 
              though he had already left AETOS the year before.<br><br>The pair is believed to have met up at a stairway of Block 365, Woodlands Avenue 1 on February 10, 2009.<br><br>Quek allegedly told the girl that he would inform her parents about her offences if she did not give in to his demands.<br><br>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau declined to reveal the girl's age or if she had given in to his demands.<br><br>Quek is also accused of accepting $50 from an unknown Chinese man whom he had caught littering.<br><br>It is believed this was in exchange for not taking enforcement action against the litterbug.<br><br>Quek allegedly committed this offence in September 2008 when he was still an AETOS officer.<br><br>If convicted of corruption, he could be jailed up to five years and fined a maximum of $100,000.<br><br>Quek also faces five forgery charges.<br><br>In
               one of the cases, he allegedly made use of another person's education 
              certificate and passed it off as his own to apply for a job in November 
              2007.<br><br>Quek is believed to have used the Singapore-Cambridge 
              General Certificate of Education belonging to a woman identified as Koh 
              Hui Hoon.<br><br>Quek will be back in court on November 8.<br><br>If convicted of forgery, he could be jailed up to four years and fined for each charge. </span></span></p>
