              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said having prime space
               at downtown Marina Bay to expand the Central Business District gives 
              Singapore a "significant competitive edge" to grow the financial sector 
              at a time when opportunities in Asia abound.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He added Marina Bay is a great example of how the country has risen from "mudflats to metropolis".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking at the 10th
               anniversary celebration of the Fullerton Hotel, Mr Goh said the 
              Fullerton Heritage development is part of efforts to transform Singapore
               into a distinctive and dynamic global city.<br><br>The event also saw the launch of a book which pays tribute to the historical significance of the Fullerton area.<br><br>Known
               as the "Fullerton Heritage", the area which spans 1.4 million square 
              feet along the waterfront, comprises a mixture of dining and hospitality
               options. <br><br>The Fullerton building, opened in 1928, was home to public offices like the General Post Office and Finance Ministry.<br><br>Mr Goh started his civil service, shipping and political careers at the building.<br><br>"Here,
               I had the privilege of working for and learning from the first 
              generation political leaders like Dr Goh Keng Swee and Mr Lim Kim San, 
              and top public officers like Joe Pillay and Ngiam Tong Dow.<br><br>"I 
              had worked in offices on the second floor, fifth floor and also the 
              small space up on the sixth floor. You can say that I literally worked 
              my way up in Fullerton Building.<br><br>"Not many people may know this 
              but Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) was incorporated in Fullerton Building 
              with borrowed space from my office on the sixth floor. Later, NOL moved 
              out to its own premises. I joined it a few years later.<br><br>"In 1976,
               I stood for elections and was appointed Senior Minister of State for 
              Finance a year later. Like a homing pigeon, I returned to Fullerton 
              Building where the Finance Ministry was," said Mr Goh.  <br><br>He added
               when the decision was made to turn the building into a hotel, it showed
               the government had "learned about the value of location".<br><br>- CNA/fa/wk</span></span></p>
