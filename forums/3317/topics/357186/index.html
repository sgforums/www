              <p><strong>Police investigating death of Freddie Mac official</strong></p>
              <p>WASHINGTON - The chief financial officer of money-losing mortgage giant
              Freddie Mac was found dead in his basement early Wednesday morning in
              what police said was an apparent suicide. A law enforcement official
              familiar with the investigation said it was an apparent hanging. He
              declined to be identified because the investigation was ongoing.</p>
              <p>David Kellermann's death is the latest in a string of blows to
              Freddie Mac since it was seized by the government last September. The
              company, which owns or guarantees about 13 million mortgages, has been
              criticized for financing risky loans that fueled the real estate bubble
              and are now defaulting at a record pace.</p>
              <p>Freddie Mac lost more
              than $50 billion last year, and the Treasury Department has pumped in
              $45 billion to keep the company afloat. Last month, David Moffett, the
              government-appointed chief executive, resigned apparently frustrated by
              strict oversight.</p>
              <p>Kellermann worked for Freddie Mac for the past
              16 years, starting out as a financial analyst and auditor. He was named
              acting chief financial officer last September when the government
              ousted former CEO Richard Syron and Kellermann's predecessor Anthony S.
              "Buddy" Pizsel.</p>
              <p>Neighbors said Kellermann, 41, had lost a
              noticeable amount of weight under the strain of the new job. Some
              neighbors said they suggested to Kellermann he should quit to avoid the
              stress, but Kellermann responded that he wanted to help the company
              through its problems. The neighbors did not want to be quoted by name
              because they didn't want to upset the family.</p>
              <p>As the company's
              financial chief, Kellermann was working on the company's first quarter
              financial report, due at the end of May, with federal regulators
              closely overseeing the company's books and signing off on major
              decisions.</p>
              <p>That relationship has been tense at times. Freddie Mac
              executives recently battled with federal regulators over whether to
              disclose potential losses on mortgage securities tied to the Obama
              administration's housing plan, said a person familiar with the
              deliberations who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p>
              <p>Federal
              prosecutors in Virginia have been investigating Freddie Mac's business
              practices. But two U.S. law enforcement officials, who spoke on
              condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the
              Freddie Mac investigation, said Kellermann was neither a target nor a
              subject of the investigation and had not been under law enforcement
              scrutiny.</p>
              <p>Police responded to a 911-call at 4:48 a.m. at the
              suburban Virginia home Kellermann shared with his wife Donna and
              5-year-old daughter Grace.</p>
              <p>The Kellermanns live in Hunter Mill
              Estates, a well-off neighborhood of large single-family homes with
              manicured lawns in Fairfax County. County records show Kellermann's
              home is assessed for about $900,000.</p>
              <p>Paul Unger, who lives across
              the street from the Kellermanns, called the family a "solid,
              salt-of-the-earth kind of family" that hosted the neighborhood's
              Halloween party. "He was just a nice guy ... You cannot imagine what
              kind of pressures he must have been under," Unger said.</p>
              <p>Kellermann,
              a University of Michigan graduate who went to business school at George
              Washington University. News of Kellermann's death came as a shock to
              employees of the McLean, Va.-based company, with those who knew
              Kellermann tearing up on Wednesday morning and a quiet mood prevailing.
              Senior executives at the company heard the news on local radio before
              going to work.</p>
              <p>Freddie Mac canceled a bond offering on Wednesday,
              as top Freddie Mac officials visited the family's house to offer
              condolences. John Koskinen, the company's interim chief executive,
              spoke to workers at an 11 a.m. staff meeting mourning Kellermann's
              loss, telling employees that they could use the company's counseling
              services.</p>
              <p>In statement e-mailed to employees and the media,
              Koskinen called Kellermann "a man of great talents .... His
              extraordinary work ethic and integrity inspired all who worked with
              him."</p>
              <p>Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a statement
              that "our deepest sympathies are with his family and his colleagues at
              Freddie Mac during this difficult time."</p>
              <p>Freddie Mac and sibling
              company Fannie Mae have both come under fire from lawmakers as they
              plan to pay more than $210 million in bonuses through next year to give
              workers the incentive to stay in their jobs. Kellermann was in line to
              receive retention awards totaling $850,000 over the next year.</p>
