              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) says it
               is vital for the country to remain cohesive, alert and nimble to take 
              advantage of the opportunities and to get out of harm's way if 
              necessary. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It says that in a 
              more unpredictable and fluid global environment, Singapore will 
              cooperate with all countries and institutions that wish to cooperate 
              with it.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At the same time, it will do what needs to be done to protect and promote the country's national interests.<br><br>The ministry outlined these goals in its addendum to the Presidential Address.<br><br>In
               the addendum released on Saturday, MFA said that ASEAN remains 
              Singapore's core interest and cornerstone of its foreign policy.  <br><br>It
               said a more integrated and cohesive ASEAN enhances the region's 
              economic competitiveness and gives it a strong platform to engage key 
              international players, especially the United States and China. <br><br>And
               ASEAN should not be distracted from its goal of building an ASEAN 
              Community by 2015, through the implementation of the three Community 
              Blueprints.<br><br>The ministry described Singapore's relations with its closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, as good.<br><br>It said that strengthening these relationships on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect remains a key interest. <br><br>With
               Malaysia, the resolution of the railway land issue and the handing over
               of the waterworks under the 1961 Water Agreement to the Johor water 
              authorities were milestones in the bilateral relationship. <br><br>With 
              these issues settled and upcoming projects like the joint development in
               Iskandar Malaysia and the Rapid Transit System link between Johor Baru 
              and Singapore, there is strong impetus for closer cooperation between 
              Singapore and Malaysia. <br><br>MFA said relations with Indonesia are 
              anchored by robust trade, as well as investment links and cooperation in
               sectors such as health, environment and counter-terrorism. <br><br>Cooperation
               with the Riau Islands (KEPRI), especially in the Batam, Bintan and 
              Karimun Special Economic Zone, will remain a priority.<br><br>Bilateral relations with the other ASEAN member states are strong and anchored in the bedrock of shared interests. <br><br>They
               will be further strengthened through regular bilateral exchanges and 
              institutionalised linkages, including technical assistance through the 
              Singapore Cooperation Programme and Initiative for ASEAN Integration.<br><br>Turning
               to the United States, MFA said the US military presence in the region 
              continues to be the vital and irreplaceable foundation of the stability 
              that is the necessary condition for growth. <br><br>It said the US remains a key strategic and economic partner.<br><br>MFA
               said Singapore will continue to build on its excellent relations with 
              China and expand cooperation beyond the economic and political spheres 
              to areas such as education, culture and human resource development.<br><br>On
               supporting Singaporeans abroad, MFA said it will continue to work 
              closely with the Overseas Singaporean Unit to keep them connected to 
              Singapore. <br><br>The ministry believes that the number of Singaporeans
               seeking help overseas will increase as more travel for work, leisure 
              and education. <br><br>It will work closely with other agencies to ensure the safety and well-being of Singaporeans overseas.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
