              <p>stealing is stealing. Pls dun mix in politics.</p>
              <p>It is not his first offence. Have you consider that the court took into account all his previous offences and that perhaps he had already been jailed for various durations already?</p>
              <p>Stealing is a crime. It cannot be justified with reasons like his mother no food, if he dun steal, the mother would die. The law is written around (a bit) on rights of an individual or entity. No individual can steal your things. It is your right to own what you own and it is protected by the laws governing the consituation.</p>
              <p>Besides, if he can steal, he can work. Even working at mac or working at hawker centre is also work. Stealing brings one down to the lowest being of man.</p>

              <p><strong>Mosque speaks up in S$32 theft case</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A man, who was sentenced on Thursday to a year's jail
               for stealing S$32 from a mosque, had been helped by the same mosque for
               the last three years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In a media statement
               to Channel NewsAsia, Darussalam Mosque said Noraizam Abdullah had been 
              caught committing offences on several occasions since he sought refuge 
              in the mosque in 2008.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The mosque heard that the 40-year-old man used to live with his sister but was asked to leave after a family dispute.<br><br>He then sought refuge at the mosque and was later offered a job there as an assistant caretaker. <br><br>However, he was caught threatening the mosque staff, hurling vulgarities and acting aggressively towards them.<br><br>In addition, he was also found asking the staff and members of his congregation for money. <br><br>Darussalam Mosque said Noraizam still continued with his mischief despite undergoing repeated counselling by staff.<br><br>The last straw was when he was caught stealing from a donation box. <br><br>The mosque said that a police report was made to protect the safety of its staff and congregants. <br><br>Noraizam had previously said in court that he stole money to feed his family, including his handicapped mother. <br><br>In response, the mosque said it is currently looking into this and would extend necessary assistance if needed. <br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>
