              <p>BEIJING (AFP) - – China's health ministry said Tuesday it had ordered
               food safety authorities in central Hubei province to investigate claims
               that milk powder has caused infant girls to grow breasts.</p>
              <p>Officials had already begun tests on the baby formula after parents 
              and doctors expressed fears that hormones in the milk powder made by 
              NASDAQ-listed Synutra had caused babies to develop breasts.</p>
              <p>"The Ministry of Health had attached great importance to this issue,"
               spokesman Deng Haihua told a news conference, according to a 
              transcript.</p>
              <p>Local food safety authorities had earlier refused a parent's request
               to investigate the formula made by Synutra, based in the eastern city 
              of Qingdao, saying they did not conduct tests at consumers' behest, 
              state media reported.</p>
              <p>Medical tests indicated the levels of hormones in three girls, 
              ranging in age from four- to 15-months and who were fed the same baby 
              formula, exceeded those of the average adult woman, China Daily reported
               on Monday.</p>
              <p>A fourth case was reported in Beijing, Xinhua reported on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The ministry said medical experts were also assisting a separate medical investigation into the cause of the infants' condition.</p>
              <p>Synutra insisted in a statement that its products were safe and that
               no man-made hormones or illegal substances had been added during 
              production.</p>
              <p>The company's shares plunged 27 percent on Monday in New York to 
              12.72 dollars, their steepest fall since China's 2008 tainted milk 
              scandal.</p>
              <p>Chinese dairy products were recalled worldwide in 2008 after it was 
              found that melamine, which is used to make plastics, was widely and 
              illegally added to the products to give the appearance of higher 
              protein.</p>
              <p>Melamine was found in the products of 22 Chinese dairy companies in a
               massive scandal blamed for the deaths of at least six infants and for 
              sickening 300,000 others in China.</p>

              <p><strong>China widens milk tests</strong></p>
              <p>SHANGHAI - CHINA is expanding an investigation into reports of 
              hormone-tainted milk powder by testing a range of infant milk powders 
              and breast milk, state media said on Saturday, the latest food scare to 
              hit the country.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Health launched the probe following complaints that 
              tainted milk powder had caused baby girls to show signs of premature 
              sexual development.</p>
              <p>The Ministry said it would test baby-formula maker Synutra 
              International as well as other brands to compare the level of estrogen 
              in dairy products, the People's Daily reported on its website. 'In order
               to guarantee that the milk powder tests are safe and reliable, this 
              time the Ministry of Health has chosen Beijing and Shanghai to test the 
              products,' Liang Li, a medical expert, who is also a member of the 
              investigation panel of the Ministry, was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>Shares of Synutra, a Chinese firm, plunged as much as 35 per cent 
              earlier this week, but stabilised after the company denied the reports 
              and said it was in the process of taking legal action to protect its 
              brand.</p>
              <p>Even if the allegations prove to be unfounded, the concerns 
              about exposure to tainted milk products has underscored the persistence 
              of food safety problems that have alarmed consumers, undermined China's 
              global image and sparked criminal cases.</p>
              <p>Two years ago, China was plagued with a melamine scandal 
              when at least six children died and nearly 300,000 became ill from 
              drinking powdered milk laced with melamine, an industrial compound added
               to fool inspectors by giving misleadingly high results in protein 
              tests. -- REUTERS</p>

              <p><strong>Breasts not caused by milk</strong></p>
              <p>BEIJING - CHINA'S health ministry said an investigation had found no 
              evidence that milk powder produced by a Chinese company caused three 
              infant girls to grow breasts, state media reported on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The findings of the clinical investigation were announced by the 
              health ministry in Bejing, the official Xinhua news agency and Wangyi 
              news website said.</p>
              <p>Authorities in the central province of Hubei had been ordered to 
              investigate baby formula after parents and doctors expressed fears that 
              hormones in the powder made by Nasdaq-listed Synutra had caused babies 
              to develop breasts prematurely.</p>

               request to investigate the formula made by Synutra, based in the
