              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore economy grew at 8.5 per cent on-year in
               the first quarter, better than consensus expectations of 5.7 per cent 
              according to a MediaCorp poll of 10 economists.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This compares to the growth in the previous quarter at 12 per cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This was according to the advanced estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).<br> <br>On a seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter annualised basis, the economy grew by 23.5 per cent. <br><br>This is an improvement from the 3.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter. <br><br>The
               MTI said the strong growth was driven by the manufacturing sector, 
              particularly in the electronics and precision engineering clusters, 
              which benefited from a pick up in business investment in the region.<br> <br>On
               a year-on-year basis, the manufacturing sector grew 13.9 per cent, 
              compared to the expansion of 25.5 per cent in the previous quarter.<br> <br>The
               construction sector grew by 2.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the
               first quarter, reversing the contraction of two per cent in the 
              previous quarter. <br> <br>This mainly reflected an increase in building activities in the residential segment. <br> <br>The services-producing industries also saw an increase in activities in the first quarter of 2011. <br> <br>Compared
               to a year ago, the services producing industries expanded by 7.2 per 
              cent, following the growth of 8.8 per cent in the preceding quarter. <br> <br>Growth was driven by the financial services sector, which saw an increase in commercial bank lending activities. <br> <br>Trade-related
               services such as the wholesale and retail trade, and transport and 
              storage sectors also expanded, in line with continued growth in global 
              demand.<br><br>The Monetary Authority of Singapore separately said that 
              economic activity is likely to be sustained at a high level for the rest
               of the year  - even as domestic cost and price pressures remain firm.<br><br>And to contain those pressures, the MAS has further tightened its policy by re-centring the exchange rate policy band upwards.<br><br>Strength
               of the economy and the policy stance, both caught some analysts by 
              surprise. Still some economists say they will not be revising their 
              forecasts as risks remain.<br><br>Vishnu Varathan, an asia economist 
              with Capital Economics, said: "There are three overarching risk factors,
               and one is Japan, the calamity in Japan means that we are less certain 
              about export demand, and second high oil prices. This can have a huge 
              knock on effect in terms of demand and as well as what it means for the 
              squeeze on manufacturers.<br><br>"And the last factor would be the 
              European debt crisis, that's still ongoing even though some of the 
              tensions have receded. That's still a major unknown out there."<br><br>-CNA/wk/ac</span></span></p>
