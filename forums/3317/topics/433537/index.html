              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A Danish national has filed a writ against Alexandra 
              Hospital (AH) for allegedly planting a microchip in him during a 1988 
              operation, which he claimed later caused him mental distress due to 
              being constantly monitored.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>According to court 
              papers filed in the High Court on June 21 against AH, which has been 
              managed by Jurong Health Services since August last year, Mr Mogens 
              Tindhof Honore said he first found a metal instrument akin to a 
              microchip in his left lung after an X-ray scan in 1997.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Honore, 54, added
               the metal piece was implanted in him during an operation at AH more 
              than two decades ago - the last time he had undergone surgery in his 
              chest and lung.<br><br>Represented by lawyer Oliver Quek, the former 
              seaman said that he was stabbed in the lung in May 1988. After his 
              discharge, he kept hearing voices in his head and could not lead a 
              normal life. He would also feel generally unwell and would even cough 
              out blood.<br><br>"(Mr Honore) also discovered and experienced that 
              strange people on the streets would approach and speak to (him) about 
              strange subject matters or pass strange irrelevant comments," according 
              to the papers filed.<br><br>Mr Honore said that his subsequent discovery
               of being constantly tracked left him in a "perpetual state of 
              apprehension and fear for the safety of his life". It also prevented him
               from holding on to a job.<br><br>When he returned to Singapore in 
              December last year to investigate his condition, he claimed that he was 
              turned away by AH which said it had no records of his stay.<br><br>He 
              claimed that two X-ray scans later on May 9 this year at AH and Mount 
              Elizabeth Hospital found the metal fragment (microchip) in his left 
              chest wall instead of his left lung.<br><br>He also claimed that, earlier this month, he underwent an operation at Mount Elizabeth Hospital to remove the fragment.<br><br>In
               his lawsuit, Mr Honore is now alleging that employees of AH who had 
              then operated on him implanted the microchip in him intentionally, 
              causing "exceptional harm and lifelong suffering". He also said that the
               alleged act constitutes a trespass on his body.<br><br>Mr Honore claims
               that he suffers from various conditions following the alleged act, such
               as impairment of relationship, loss of enjoyment of life and suicidal 
              thoughts.<br><br>Seeking damages for expenses incurred such as 
              psychiatric help and medication, he is also alleging that AH medical 
              staff who tended to him were negligent.<br><br>He said that the staff 
              was careless in placing a metal fragment in his left chest wall during 
              the operation, resulting in harm and injury.<br><br>Responding to media 
              queries, AH director of communications and service quality Casey Chang 
              said: "We understand that the patient had recently returned to Alexandra
               Hospital to seek information regarding medical treatment he had 
              received at Alexandra Hospital in May 1988. This was 23 years ago when 
              Alexandra Hospital was a government hospital."<br><br>She added that, 
              after the hospital was informed of the lawsuit, AH has taken steps to 
              convey to the patient's lawyer (Mr Quek) that Jurong Health Services Pte
               Ltd has been wrongly identified as the defendant in the suit.<br><br>At the time Mr Honore was treated in AH in 1988, the hospital was under the Ministry of Health.</span></span></p>
