              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div>The argument that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China will overtake the United States to dominate the world is a myth</span></strong>, and it is completely unfounded for some people to speculate that China will transfer its ever-increasing economic strength to military power, a senior Chinese official said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo published an article on China's road of peaceful development on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The article points out that not taking the lead and not seeking hegemony are China's basic national policy and strategic choice. China will always adhere to peaceful coexistence, respect the rights of people of all nations to independently choose development paths and will never seek hegemony or to rule the world, Dai said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dai said in the article that the attempt to form a clique to contain China, make mischief between countries and engage in joint military drills off China's coast are examples of typical Cold War thinking. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></span></strong><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Compared to the United States, Japan and many other countries, the per capita level of China's military spending is still quite low, which will pose no threat to the rest of the world, according to the article. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">As for the transparency, there is no absolute transparency in the world. While, military transparency in China has seen growing improvement over the past decades, in particular, our strategic intent is more transparent than many other countries, especially major powers. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">For example, we publicly declared to the world to never seek hegemony, made commitment to never first use nuclear weapons and use or threaten to use nuclear weapons. If other countries do so, it is undoubtedly a great contribution to the world peace, stability and development.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">By Liang Jun, People's Daily Online</em></div>

              <p>excerpts:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;  "><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have an interesting question to ask the Chairman: China probably needs 50 years to get everything in shape-the people's living standard greatly improved and housing problems, educational problems and construction problems all solved. What will China's future be by then?</span></strong></span>
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In your view, we will be aggressive by then, is that right?</span></strong></span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: No. At least I hope you will not.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are afraid that a country, when it gets strong, should be cautious not to commit aggression.</span></strong> The United States is a case in point.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: Right, absolutely right. Britain was another case in point. Prior to the First World War the most powerful nation in the world was the British Empire. The United States was only a colony of Britain 180 years ago.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The historical lesson is that a country tends to be aggressive when it is very powerful.</span></strong></span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: A country is to be driven back when it commits aggression overseas. The North America of George Washington or the British Empire, which is more powerful? Yet, Washington with some shabby rifles drove back the British Empire in eight years.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: The American Revolution was a good thing. Often revolution is a good thing. Without the American Revolution, Canada would not be today's Canada. The Chinese revolution was good, too. So revolution can be good.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: You are very enlightened.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: I am a soldier.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: A foreign country for its people to live in; others should not occupy it, nor do they have the right or reason to squeeze in.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: I agree.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: It is a historical lesson that one will be driven out if one gets in.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will be China's destiny 50 years from now? By then China will be the world's most powerful country.</span></strong></span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: Not necessarily. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fifty years from now China's destiny is still 9.6 million square kilometers. China does not have a god, what it has is a Jade Emperor. Fifty years from now the Jade Emperor will still be reigning over 9.6 million square kilometers. We would be aggressors if we occupied an inch of land belonging to others.</span></strong> In fact, we are the "aggressed." The United States has occupied our Taiwan. But the United Nations gave us the title of "aggressor." You are facing an "aggressor." Aren't you afraid?</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: Before the revolution, you suffered aggression by us.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Mao: That was in the past, and now there is no hatred, only a little left over from history. We can establish diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors with you if your government improves its attitude just a little bit.</span>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Montgomery</strong>: I hope so.</span></p>

              <p>Half a century ago, on May 27, 1960, late Chinese leader Mao Zedong has a very fascinating, intriguing talk on China's development "50 years later" with Bernard L. Montgomery, British field marshal and allied commander during World War II, and the gist of their talk reads roughly as follows:<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Bernard L. Montgomery (hereinafter referred to as Montgomery): I would like to have an intriguing question for Chairman: China probably needs for 50 years (of development), and then all things will be done... By that time, how would you think of China's future?<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mao Zedong (hereinafter referred to as Mao): Your idea is that we shall be aggressive by that time, and isn't it?<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Montagomery: I have the idea that when a country turns very strong, it should be very careful, so as not to carry out aggression. Just take a look at the United States, people will get to know... The historical lesson is that a country tends to be aggressive when it is very powerful.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mao: A country is to be driven back when it commits aggression overseas... A foreign country is for its people to live in; others should not occupy it, nor do they have the right or reason to squeeze in... If you get there, you will be driven back, and this is a historical lesson.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Montgomery: What will be China's destiny 50 years from now? By then China will be the world's most powerful country.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mao: Not necessarily. Fifty years from now China's destiny is still 9.6 million square kilometers. China has no God but the Jade Emperor. Fifty years from now, the Jade Emperor will still be reigning over 9.6 million square kilometers. We would be aggressors if we occupied an inch of land belonging to others. In fact, we are the "aggressed."<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The above "Montgomery's queries" reflect a historical "inner logic" of Westerners in history contest. When a nation becomes strong enough, it inclines to invade others. The development of some Western nations in history has fully proven this point. The ancient Roman and Ottoman empires have taken this road, so have the Netherlands (or Holland), Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States. Why it is so is attributed to two substantial reasons. One is the cause of economics. After the human society enters into private ownership, powerful nations often go ahead with overseas aggression and expansion to plunder the property of other countries, especially when they became capitalist countries, where their military force and colonial expansion provide capital for the development of their industry and so served as special means of capitalist production.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Another is the political clause. Some Westerners hold that Charles Darwin's theory of "survival of the fittest", or the law of nature, is also a law of development and progress in human society. So, they introduced the "Law of the Jungle", or a set of political philosophy, to bully the small and weak. With this "historical logic" in addition to the so-called "Yellow Peril theory" innate in their mind, Some Westerners are worried about and alert to the development of China, formerly a "great sleeping lion" that has now been awakened.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Time slides by and 50 years has elapsed in a flash. Looking at China today, its economic output has leapt to the world's second, its comprehensive national strength has enhanced greatly, and its social appearance and people's outlook have undergone great historical changes. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">China has not engaged in invasion, aggression, plunder, wars, or expansion and domination as Western powers used to practice, nevertheless; China is still taking the road of peaceful development. Why does the Chinese nation not emerge the very situation which Marshal Montgomery had predicted and worried about?<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Frankly speaking, this is determined by China's national character. As known to all, China is a socialist country, which insists on taking as the primary object the people's wish for their wellbeing, social equality, national development, security and world peace.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">New China initiated the five principles of peace co-existence with the related countries shortly after it was founded in October 1949; it held high the banner of peace, development and cooperation and steadfastly implemented the independent policy of peace and development since the launch of the reform and opening-up policy in the 70's of the last century and, since its entry of the 21st century and the new stage of development, China has increasingly integrated itself with the international community and related its own destiny with that of the world.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">China wants peace, development and cooperation, and it has firmly pursues a strategy of opening up for mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and this has definitely become China's only choice or only way out. Party General Secretary Hu Jintao's political report to the 17th CPC National Congress solemnly declared that China pledged to take the path of peaceful development steadfastly and unswervingly and further annotated the peaceful nature of the socialism with Chinese characteristics. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Meanwhile, anti-hegemony has been written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Party Constitution of the CPC. This kind of the social character and political system has determined that China will never seek hegemony and never carry out overseas expansion. China's development in the last half of this century has given an eloquent proof the sincerity and correctness of Mao Zedong's remarks half a century back to answer Montogmery's queries about China's future development. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">However, some personalities in the Western world still have anxiety on such issues whether China will go for overseas expansion after it turns increasingly powerful, and those with harbored ulterior motives however have been claiming the so-called "China Threat Theory". As long as its people steadfastly take the path of peaceful development, China can surely answer Montogmery's queries well in another 50 years and contribute even more to the world's lasting peace and common prosperity.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Contributed by People's Daily Online and its author is Chang Ming </em></p>
