              <p>SINGAPORE: A 29-year-old lawyer has been fined S$10,000 for falsifying her law degree certificate and transcript so as to improve her chances of getting a job with the Singapore Legal Service.<br><br>Jaya Anil Kumar, who read law at the National University of Singapore, pleaded guilty to two charges of “fraudulently using as genuine a forged document”.<br><br>Another four similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing.<br><br>Jaya had graduated from NUS in 2011 with second class honours (lower division), but doctored her certificate and transcript to read “second class honours (upper division)”.<br><br>She also admitted she had edited her transcript to reflect better grades than she had actually received.<br><br>Jaya was called to the Singapore Bar as an advocate and solicitor in July 2012.<br><br>When she applied to the Singapore Legal Service in January 2013, she submitted a genuine certificate, but forged the transcript to reflect better grades for 21 out of 27 subjects, a court heard.<br><br>Jaya’s forgery was not detected, and she was granted an interview with a selection panel. However, she was not offered a job.<br><br>In October 2016, Jaya applied to the Singapore Legal Service again. This time, she forged both her certificate and transcript.<br><br>Jaya doctored the certificate to reflect “second class honours (upper division)", as well as the transcript to reflect better grades for 18 out of 27 subjects.<br><br>When the Legal Service Commission contacted Jaya to seek her consent to ask NUS for her class ranking and percentile ranking, she declined.<br><br>The Legal Service Commission also asked her about the discrepancies in the certificates and transcripts she had submitted in 2013 and 2016.<br><br>Jaya emailed her genuine documents to the Legal Service Commission after their queries. They lodged a police report in November.<br><br>Besides attempting to fool the Legal Service Commission, Jaya admitted she had also submitted falsified documents to legal resource service provider R &amp; T Asia Resources in May 2016.<br><br>For using as genuine a forged document, Jaya could have been sentenced up to four years’ jail and fined.</p>
