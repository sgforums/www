              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Barely had they thrown their names into the hat for
              the post of Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) when the criticisms
              began on the government feedback website, REACH.
              <br> <br>NMP hopefuls Loretta Chen and Beatrice Chia-Richmond – along with
              incumbent Siew Kum Hong, who is seeking a second term – have been
              accused of being "homosexuality activists" by some Netizens.
              <br> <br>Postings on REACH questioned if their applications, in the words of
              one, were "a back door for more pro-LGBTs (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
              Transgender)" to have a voice in Parliament. The debate has set REACH's
              thread on NMP candidates abuzz. <br> <br> First opened for comments on May 1, the thread picked up steam since
              last Thursday and has attracted 93 postings and more than 1,400 page
              views as of last night. In comparison, the thread on Influenza A (H1N1)
              has attracted eight comments.
              <br> <br>With his role as a legal adviser in the recent AWARE leadership
              saga, Mr Siew, 34, bore the brunt of the criticisms; many accused him
              of "pushing homosexual lifestyle" and of being "against the majority
              Singaporean".
              <br> <br>On the other hand, Ms Chia-Richmond, 34, and Ms Chen, 32, both arts
              practitioners, came under fire for their past projects, which forumer
              'Very Worried!!' alleged about Ms Chia-Richmond's application "is far
              more serious and worrying than Siew Kum Hong being re-nominated".
              <br> <br>Ms Chen, a theatre director, has been charged as being "no
              different". "She's openly gay and has also directed films with mainly
              controversial themes," wrote forumer 'isay'.
              <br> <br>When asked about this, Ms Chen said, "I am who I am and I don't
              intend to pretend to be someone that I am not. If you can be honest to
              yourself, you can then be honest to the team you are leading and only
              then you can be honest to society at large."
              <br> <br>Ms Chen, who hopes to speak up on arts, youth and elderly issues,
              added, "I don't see this NMP as a backdoor (for LGBT issues). Human
              beings are capable of being multi-dimensional, multi-perspective and
              multi-layered. I think it's sad when some Singaporeans choose to be so
              single-minded and so single-focused that you can only be defined by
              your sexuality or by your race or your religion."
              <br> <br> Ms Chia, who is married and a mother of one, could not be reached for comment last night.
              <br> <br>When contacted, Mr Siew said he had not seen the full comments
              posted on REACH, but has seen similar objections to his re-application
              online. He also received several emails.
              <br> <br>"It seems there's some effort to organise a campaign to target me,"
              he said. "It does bother me to be a target, to be singled out for
              expressing a sincerely held opinion."
              <br> <br>Mr Siew, who is married and is a corporate lawyer, reiterated that
              he does not support homosexuality but is rather against discrimination,
              which is why he sought to repeal the law against gay sex in 2007.
              <br> <br>The criticisms on REACH is another sign that the two camps – those
              with concerns over the gay agenda and those seeking more equality for
              gays – are turning to "mainstream portals" as their sounding boards,
              according to Singapore Management University assistant professor Eugene
              Tan.
              <br> <br> "The two groups are fairly educated and are not afraid to use the new media to draw and canvass for support," he said.
              <br> <br> Feedback on REACH is typically passed to the relevant agencies.
              <br> <br>But Mr Siew hopes the Special Select Committee of eight MPs will
              evaluate his record in Parliament, which he feels "speaks for itself"
              as he had spoken out on numerous topics.
              <br> <br> "The only thing I hope is that rational minds will prevail," he added.
              <br> <br>The panel, led by Speaker Abdullah Tarmugi, will make its
              recommendations to President SR Nathan after it has interviewed the
              candidates. The new NMP term begins in July.

              <p>18/05/09 Siew Kum Hong makes police report against defamatory comments made by netizens/ write</p>
              <p>Nominated MP Siew Kum Hong has made a police report against netizens posting defamatory comments about him.</p>
              <p>He revealed this in his blog.</p>
              <p>He's also requested forums which hosted such remarks to take them down</p>
              <p>When contacted, Mr Siew refused further comment saying the matter is now with the Police.</p>
              <p>The latest attacks have alleged or insinuated that he asked for and
              is receiving foreign funding from a Swedish politician who allegedly
              funds the Singapore Democratic Party as well.</p>
              <p>It’s also alleged that he’s involved or associated with the SDP and may be their representative or “mole” in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Mr Siew has issued a strong rebuttal to these allegations on his blog.</p>
              <p>He said both of these allegations are untrue and false.</p>
              <p>He considered them extremely defamatory and criminal in nature and
              goes beyond anything that a reasonable person could possibly perceive
              as being a valid or legitimate exercise of the right to free speech.</p>
              <p>Mr Siew stressed that he did not at any time ask for, and have not
              at any time been offered or accepted, any sort of funding from any
              local or foreign entity.</p>
              <p>He said the only sources of income or funding that he has are from
              his employer and the Government in the form of his monthly NMP
              allowance.</p>
              <p>He also said he’s not involved or affiliated or associated, whether
              directly, indirectly or in any other way, with the SDP, and certainly
              not their representative or “mole” in Parliament.”</p>
              <p>The attacks on Mr Siew first started in the aftermath of the Aware EGM.</p>
              <p>It has culminated in an campaign to sabotage his re-application for a second term of NMP.</p>
              <p>A week ago, netizens flooded the REACH portal with comments about why he shouldn't be given a second NMP term.</p>
