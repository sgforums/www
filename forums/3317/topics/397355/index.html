              <p>JAKARTA: Thousands of angry Indonesian factory workers set fire to 
              cars and a warehouse yesterday after an Indian company executive called 
              them 'stupid', police and media reports said.</p>
              <p>Nine people were reported to have been injured when workers went on 
              the rampage at a factory belonging to Drydock World Graha in Batam city.
               Two of the injured had to be taken to hospital.</p>
              <p>'An Indian company executive called us, Indonesian workers, 
              'stupid' and this made us very angry,' a worker known only as Disra was 
              quoted as saying by Antara news agency.</p>
              <p>Indonesian police spokesman Zainuri Lubis said: 'It started 
              when an Indian manager yelled something rude to an Indonesian worker. 
              Word spread, and in the end, about 5,000 angry workers got together and 
              got violent.'</p>
              <p>About 400 police officers were called to the scene and they 
              evacuated 41 unidentified foreign staff from the seaside factory in 
              boats, Antara reported.</p>
              <p>Up to 20 cars were set alight, along with a company 
              warehouse.</p>

              <p><strong>No Singaporeans affected by Batam shipyard riot: MFA</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's Foreign Ministry said no Singaporeans have
               been affected by the riot that broke out at a shipyard in Batam on 
              Thursday afternoon. However, it will continue to monitor the situation. </span></p>
              <p><span>Thousands of furious Indonesian factory workers set fire to cars 
              and dockyard buildings on Thursday after an Indian company executive 
              called them "stupid",  police and media reports said.
              <br> <br> Nine people were reportedly injured when about 5,000 workers went on the
               rampage at a factory belonging to PT Drydock World Graha in Batam city,
               a special economic area south of Singapore, police said.
              <br> <br> Around 400 police officers were called to the scene and they evacuated 
              41 unidentified foreign staff from the seaside factory in boats.
              <br> <br> Up to 20 cars were set alight, along with a warehouse and two other 
              buildings belonging to the company.
              <br> <br> Local police commander Leonidas Braksan addressed the crowd through a 
              loudspeaker and appealed for calm.
              <br> <br> "I am on your side. I want you all to keep working well. Your families 
              are waiting for you and your salaries at home," he said, according to 
              Antara news agency.
              <br> <br> He said any foreigner who had insulted Indonesia should leave the 
              country, bringing cheers from the workers who also sang the national 
              anthem and other patriotic songs.
              <br> <br> "The workers spontaneously burned cars as they felt offended and angry 
              after a company executive, who is an Indian national, called Indonesian 
              people stupid," national police spokesman Zulkarnain told AFP.
              <br> <br> "The situation is now under control and we escorted the protestors 
              outside the company's complex."
              <br> <br> The shipyard, owned by a Dubai conglomerate, has been temporarily shut.

              <p>Do you really think that foreigners snatch our jobs in Singapore? I believe that we are given priority in many cases.</p>
              <p>You see those cleaners from China, India, Bangla and of course some from Singapore, are you complaining people like them snatch our job?</p>
              <p>Or you are just complaining foreigners who work in some big company, hotels, restaurants?</p>
