            <div class='col-md body'><p>Review new HTC Legend and Desire: which is better for video playing?<br>With the mobile phone market increasingly fierce competition, each big brands manufacturer is to launch new products to get bigger market. Now HTC successively introduced two phones – HTC Legend and HTC Desire in the first half of the year 2010. But which is the one for you to spend your hard-earned on? The Hero-a-like Legend or the insanely powerful but stupidly monikered Desire? Below is our brief summary.<br>[img]http://www.nidesoft.com/forum/htc/legend-desire.jpg[/img] <br>Form/Factor Design: <br>These HTC smartphones share a bar-style design that's dominated by a large touchscreen display but they differ in appearance. The Legend retains the traditional Android chin in a thin aluminum body and the Desire looks similar to the Nexus One.<br>Touchscreen Display: <br>The HTC Desire is the clear winner in this category with its 3.7″ (480*800) WVGA AMOLED capacitive touch screen with pinch-to-zoom capability. The Legend comes with a 3.2″ (320*480) HVGA AMOLED capacitive touch screen with pinch-to-zoom capability<br>Operating System/ User Interface: <br>Both the Legend and the Desire run on the latest Android 2.1 OS and feature the updated Sense UI concept.<br>Camera: <br>These smartphones are more or less equal in the camera department. The Desire and Legend both come with 5 megapixel cameras. However, the Desire comes with more camera features including face detection, widescreen photo capture, geotagging, auto focus and flash<br>Processing Power: <br>Again the HTC Desire takes the cake in the processing department with its 1GHz Snapdragon processor and 512MB ROM / 576MB RAM. The Legend offer less powerful processor specs with 600MHz MSM7227 processors and 512MB ROM / 384MB RAM.<br>Multimedia<br>Both of these two phones’ music players are great. The interface is simple to use but attractive. <br>They support FM Radio and video recording function. Both of Legend and Desire’ build-in players support same video and audio formats. Such as: Audio supported formats: AAC, AMR, OGG, MID, MP3, WAV, WMA and recording formats: AMR; And Video supported formats: 3GP, 3G2, MP4, WMV and recording formats: 3GP etc. We find that both phones could not support DVD formats. But what should I do, if I want to play DVD files on the phone. I search this question on Google and find good software to solve this problem – [url=http://www.nidesoft.com/dvd-ripper.html]Nidesoft DVD Ripper[/url] which could provide you an easy and fast way to rip DVD movies to most popular formats easily and quickly, such as: Rip DVD to MP4, Rip DVD to 3GP, DVD to WMV, etc. Below is the simple process.<br>Firstly, you may download this software here: <a href="http://www.nidesoft.com/downloads/dvd-ripper.exe">http://www.nidesoft.com/downloads/dvd-ripper.exe</a><br>After download and install this powerful software, only four steps are needed to complete the conversion.<br>Step 1: Insert the DVD disc into the DVD Drive. <br>Click the Open DVD button, browse your computer, and find the DVD folder of the movie. (It is not only load DVD disc, but also could open a disk backup’s directory.)<br>A DVD may have multiple titles and each title contains one or more chapters. After your DVD movie is loaded, its contents will be listed. Click “+” to show the chapters in a title. Then you can click any title or chapter to preview it in the preview window on the right. <br>[img]http://www.nidesoft.com/forum/dvd-ripper/dvdripper-1.jpg[/img] <br>Step 2: Click the "profile" button and select the format for your player. <br>Step 3: Click the "convert" button. Please wait before the conversion succeeds!<br>Ok, you have ripped your DVD movies to other format you want, now just enjoy it. Another, I also have a try [url=http://www.nidesoft.com/video-converter.html]Nidesoft Video Converter[/url] which could convert video or audio files between all popular formats. If you have some video files which your player don’t support. You may use it! I think these two software are good assistant for media player and for your HTC mobile.<br>Other features:<br>Each phone also sports the features that are becoming more standard every day: Accelerometer, GPS, 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity, etc. And each of these phones are a joy to use, that’s no question. <br>Battery: <br>The Desire comes on top of this category with its 1400 mAh rechargeable Lithium-ion battery with 390 mins talk time and 360 hours standby time. And the Legend comes in second with its 1200 mAh rechargeable Lithium-ion polymer battery with 440 mins talk time and 560 hours standby time. <br>Conclusion: <br>So, circling back to our earlier questions, for the extra cost of the Desire over the Legend you get a larger and sharper screen, faster processor, live wallpapers and video capture at a slightly higher resolution. On the other hand the Legend's button positions may provide better single-handed operation, and some may even prefer its silver metallic look and feel to go with certain Apple products, so you'd best get your hands on the two devices before handing over the cash.</p></div>
