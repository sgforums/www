              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The rift between Potong Pasir Member of Parliament 
              Chiam See Tong and his former right-hand man Desmond Lim looks set to 
              deepen, after the latter engaged a lawyer to defend him in disciplinary 
              proceedings initiated against him.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Colin Ng &amp; 
              Partners' Peter Low, a former Law Society president, will be 
              representing Mr Lim. MediaCorp understands that a lawyer's letter was 
              sent to Mr Chiam on Wednesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>On Dec 6, the 
              Singapore People' Party (SPP) central executive committee had sent Mr 
              Lim a letter detailing nine charges against him, including the 
              allegation that Mr Lim had made defamatory remarks about Mr Chiam in an 
              October newspaper article over the issue of the Reform Party (RP) 
              joining the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The SPP, a component
               party of the SDA, was also unhappy with Mr Lim for speaking in his 
              capacity as SDA secretary-general to the media.<br><br>Mr Lim, who had 
              fended off an attempt by Mr Chiam to remove him from the SDA, responded 
              to the charges the next day, but is still awaiting SPP's replies.<br><br>Mr Lim told MediaCorp that he had "no choice but to engage a lawyer to formally ask them to respond to my letter".<br><br>Said
               Mr Lim: "I'm taking this matter very seriously ... It's not that I want
               to get a lawyer to fight them. I also wish to find out who are the 
              cadres in the disciplinary committee."<br><br>MediaCorp understands that
               in his lawyer's letter, Mr Lim pointed out that Mr Chiam should take 
              him to court if he felt he was defamed, instead of subjecting Mr Lim to 
              disciplinary proceedings.<br><br>Mr Chiam held a Christmas Party on 
              Thursday, which was attended by several opposition leaders including RP 
              chief Kenneth Jeyaretnam and the National Solidarity Party's Sebastian 
              Teo. When approached, Mr Chiam declined to comment on the lawyer's 
              letter. </span></span></p>
