              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: As the authorities seek to fend off a resurgence of 
              tuberculosis (TB) here, non-government organisations (NGOs) have backed 
              the medical fraternity's call for more comprehensive screening for 
              foreigners.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The NGOs also proposed that the authorities rethink the repatriation policy for work permit applicants diagnosed with active TB.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Earlier in May, 
              Today reported that two experts - Dr Cynthia Chee and Dr Wang Yee Tang, 
              who are both from the TB Control Unit at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) -
               had called on the authorities not to underestimate these foreigners' 
              "potential to spread TB to the community" even though they do not stay 
              here for long. <br><br>They also argued that a repatriation policy "has 
              not only potentially devastating consequences for the patient, but would
               also not serve the greater good of the global community, including our 
              own".<br><br>The Ministry of Health (MOH) is currently reviewing its TB elimination programme.<br><br>Under
               the Manpower Ministry's work permit regime, foreign workers who are 
              unable to pass a medical examination, which includes those who have been
               diagnosed with active pulmonary TB, will have to be repatriated. <br><br>For
               foreign workers already working here and are found to have TB, it is up
               to their employers whether they want to keep them here, Today 
              understands. <br><br>Ms Debbie Fordyce, an exco member of Transient 
              Workers Count Too, cited the case of a construction worker who was 
              diagnosed with TB after working here for three months. While the worker 
              began treatment, "he was often asked to work 24 hours at a stretch and 
              was not able to visit the polyclinic during opening hours to collect the
               medicine", she said. <br><br>Dr Thein Than Win, who volunteers with the
               Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, added: "If they 
              cannot seek and complete treatment in their home countries, there is a 
              risk of a further spread."<br><br>And if the authorities repatriate such
               foreigners, MOH should "work actively with the governments of (the 
              foreigners') countries and NGOs to provide possible sources of treatment
               and care services ... so that follow up treatment and social support is
               provided", Dr Thein said.<br><br>Doctors here also suggested more comprehensive screening for foreigners.<br><br>In
               a letter to Today published earlier this month, Dr Vincent Chia pointed
               out that a chest X-ray "has poor sensitivity, specificity and 
              reproductibility". <br><br>Responding to Dr Chia's letter, MOH 
              Communicable Diseases Division Director Jeffery Cutter noted that the 
              "vast majority of lung TB cases will have abnormalities in their chest 
              X-rays and will thus be picked up during screening". <br><br>Dr Cutter 
              said: "Cases with lung TB are required to undergo treatment under strict
               programmatic conditions." He also noted that the Republic's screening 
              policy is consistent with "the United States Centre for Disease 
              Control's recommendation for diagnosis of lung TB". Nevertheless, he 
              added: "We urge employers to be supportive of TB treatment for their 
              workers, by granting them the flexibility to go for treatment, when 
              necessary." <br><br>Dr Thein pointed out that, to the companies, 
              "TB-stricken workers are perceived as a liability". Employers that TODAY
               spoke to said they handle the cases on a case-by-case basis. <br><br>Mr
               Alan Chew, director of Chew Hock Seng Construction, said: "If he's a 
              good worker, I don't mind giving him sick leave until he's well again, 
              but if he causes me a lot of problems, and TB is added (to the mix), 
              then I will have to think extra-hard about it before taking the 
              necessary steps."<br><br>Mr Chew pointed out that sometimes, the 
              TB-stricken worker prefers to return home for treatment. He had a case 
              when an Indian worker wanted to do so, after he was suspected of having 
              TB. Said Mr Chew: "He said that treatment (back home) was cheaper and 
              faster. He told me that TB is more common over there, and doctors know 
              how to treat (it) faster and better." <br><br>While he has not had to 
              handle such a situation, Jian Huang group executive director Lee Chong 
              Chin said he will send TB-stricken workers home if their work permit is 
              expiring soon. Otherwise, he would assign them to light duties, he said.
               <br><br>Association of Small and Medium Enterprises president Chan 
              Chong Beng urged employers to take responsibility for their foreign 
              workers. "The moment the employee is employed, it's part of your 
              responsibility (as an employer) to make sure they are healthy or are 
              receiving treatment in the course of working with you," said Mr Chan, 
              who also felt a "more thorough screening process" for foreigners is 
              necessary.<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
