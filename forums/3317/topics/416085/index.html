              			<br><br></h1>
              <p>CIVIL servants are in for a bumper bonus for this year, boosted by 
              the strong economic recovery. They stand to get two months year-end 
              payment - made up of the annual variable component (AVC) and a 13th 
              month payment - said a statement from the Public Service Division on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The good performers will also get a Special Variable Payment
               (SVP), also known as Growth Bonus, of between one month and 1.6 months 
              in March. The SVP is given when there is exceptionally good economic 
              growth, and the quantum varies depending on individual performance.</p>
              <p>PSD said good performers will receive one month of SVP and 
              better performers will receive more, up to 1.6 months, while poor 
              performers will not receive any SVP. Together with the year-end payment,
               the total variable payment for 2010 will be 2.5 months and $300, said 
              the PSD. In July, civil servants received a mid-year AVC of half-month 
              and a one-off $300.</p>
              <p>But salary adjustments for Administrative Officers, 
              political, judicial and statutory appointment holders continue to be put
               on hold. 'Despite the strong economic recovery in 2010, the Government 
              has decided to again defer the salary adjustments for Administrative 
              Officers, Political, Judicial and Statutory Appointment Holders,' said 
              PSD.</p>
              <p>'This is in view of the reduction in the private sector 
              benchmarks this year. There is currently adequate flexibility in the 
              salary structure to allow salaries to rise and fall in line with 
              economic growth.'</p>
              <p>The Government will monitor the economic growth and movement
               of the benchmarks before making any subsequent decision on when to 
              implement the salary adjustment, it added.</p>
              <p>The third and last phase of the salary adjustments was due 
              in January 2009, but has been deferred twice since then. The first two 
              adjustments were made in April 2007 and January 2008.</p>

              <p><strong>Generous bonus for Singapore civil servants</strong></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's 74,000 civil servants will get a year-end bonus of two months inclusive of the 13th-month pay.<br><br>This
               is on top of the half-month bonus plus S$300 received in July. Together
               with the year-end payment, the total variable payment for 2010 will be 
              2.5 months and S$300.<br><br>Last year, because of the economic slump, the payout was just 0.25 months, capped at S$750.<br><br>In
               addition, a Growth Bonus - now known as the Special Variable Payment 
              (SVP)  - will be paid in March 2011 to eligible civil servants, after a 
              three-year absence.<br><br>This year's bonus is perhaps one of the most generous payouts to civil servants, thanks to the strong economic recovery.<br><br>"The
               Singapore economy has recovered strongly and expanded by 17.9% in the 
              first half of 2010. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has 
              forecast the 2010 GDP growth at around 15%," said the Public Service 
              Division (PSD) in a statement on Wednesday.<br><br>For this, civil servants will be rewarded.<br><br>The
               SVP is payable when there is exceptionally good economic growth, and 
              the quantum varies depending on individual performance. <br><br>In March
               2011, good performers will receive one month of SVP and better 
              performers will receive more, up to 1.6 months, while poor performers 
              will not receive any SVP.<br><br>NTUC deputy secretary-general Halimah 
              Yacob said: "I'm really happy, because the government paid in 2007 a 
              Growth Bonus of half a month, and that is because the growth was 7.7%. <br><br>"This
               year's growth will be really much better than 2007, so we felt that the
               civil servants definitely deserve better Growth Bonus compared to 2007.
               So we had negotiations with the Public Service Division and I'm very 
              happy that they recognised and took into consideration the contributions
               of all civil servants."<br><br>Union leaders also welcomed the bonus announcement.<br><br>Mr
               Teo Yock Ngee, general secretary of Amalgamated Union of Public 
              Employees (AUPE) and NTUC secretary for financial affairs, said: "Given 
              Singapore's good economic performance in 2010, the AUPE welcomes the 
              PSD's decision for a year-end payment of two months. We also look 
              forward to the Special Variable Payment (formerly known as Growth Bonus)
               to reward good performers. We are glad of the government's recognition 
              of support and hard work by its employees in these good times." <br><br>Mr
               G Muthukumarasamy, general secretary of Amalgamated Union of Public 
              Daily Rated Workers, added: "We are very happy with the announcement and
               thank the government because for AUPDRW's union members, who are 
              daily-rated workers, this year-end payment will help our lower-wage 
              workers to meet their daily expenses. We also urge our members to set 
              some funds aside and save for a rainy day."<br><br>Private-sector companies are expected to take the lead from the public sector.<br><br>The
               employers federation expects companies to give out bonuses averaging 
              about 2.5 months - that's about half a month more than last year. 
              Unionised companies are expected to give a little more.<br><br>Stephen 
              Lee, president of Singapore National Employers Federation, said: "We 
              would like to urge companies to reward workers fairly and also to reward
               workers for the sacrifices that they have gone through last year to 
              pull our companies through."<br><br>The government, though, has again 
              decided to defer the salary adjustments for Administrative Officers, 
              political, judicial and statutory appointment holders.<br><br>That's because of the reduction in private sector benchmarks last year.<br><br>PSD
               said the government will "monitor the economic growth and movement of 
              the benchmarks before making any subsequent decision on when to 
              implement the salary adjustment".<br><br>The third and last phase of the
               salary adjustments was due in January 2009, but has been deferred twice
               since then. The first two adjustments were made in April 2007 and 
              January 2008.<br><br>Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service, Teo Chee 
              Hean, said: "Civil servants accepted a wage reduction during the 
              difficult economic times and worked hard to help turn the economy around
               quickly.<br> <br>"The year-end payment and Special Variable Payment to
               be paid in March next year recognise the contribution of our civil 
              servants in helping Singapore recover from one of its worst recessions.<br><br>"To
               ensure that Singapore can continue to grow, we will have to work even 
              harder to raise productivity and find new ways of expanding the 
              economy."<br><br>The payout may be good but experts are also tempering sentiments saying that workers should manage their expectations. <br><br>Prime
               Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that the blistering growth this year 
              cannot continue and Singapore is unlikely to achieve double-digit growth
               next year.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>COMPANIES will not be pushed to pay the 3 1/2-month bonus that civil 
              servants will get this year, said labour chief Lim Swee Say on Thursday.</p>
              <p>This is because performances vary across different industries and companies.</p>
              <p>'It depends firstly on how much total bonus came down last year, and 
              how strong the rebound is this year,' he told reporters on the sidelines
               of a Learning Journey event at Sakae Holdings.</p>
              <p>Still, Mr Lim said that the feedback from unions and companies is 
              that they are likely to pay on average of half a month more in year-end 
              bonus.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim explained that as most companies are doing better this year, wages have also gone up.</p>
              <p>'In some cases, they are restoring the monthly variable 
              component because some cut it during the downturn. So the first thing 
              they are doing now is to restore it. Others are paid higher bonuses,' 
              said the NTUC's Secretary-General.</p>
              <p>The bonus payout for civil servants announced on Wednesday 
              is the biggest since 1993. Some 74,000 civil servants will get a 
              two-month bonus at the end of the year, in addition to the $300 and half
               a month bonus paid out in July. Good performers also stand to get a 
              special variable payment of at least one month in March.</p>
