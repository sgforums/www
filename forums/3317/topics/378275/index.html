              <p><strong>Saudi gets 5 years in jail for frank TV sex talk</strong></p>
              <div class="bd">
              <div class="content">
              <p>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia â€“
              A Saudi court on Wednesday convicted a man for publicly talking about
              sex after he bragged on a TV talk show about his exploits, sentencing
              him to five years in jail and 1,000 lashes, his lawyer said.</p>
              <p>Talking about sex publicly is a taboo in ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.</p>
              <p>Lawyer
              Sulaiman al-Jumeii said he plans to appeal the court's ruling and is
              confident the sentence against his client, which includes a ban on
              travel and talking to the media for five years after his release, will
              be revoked.</p>
              <p>The lawyer said there is no specific law in the
              Saudi penal code "that defines punishment for talking or bragging." He
              said he assumes the judge based his decision on Islamic law, which
              forms the general basis of the justice system and stipulates that
              people should not talk about engaging in immoral behavior.</p>
              <p>Al-Jumeii
              maintains that his client, Mazen Abdul-Jawad, was duped by the Lebanese
              LBC satellite channel which aired the talk show and was unaware in many
              cases he was being recorded.</p>
              <p>"I hope you will not consider the
              case closed," the lawyer said. "I will continue pursuing the TV
              channel, even if no one stands by me, until it gets the punishment it
              deserves."</p>
              <p>The program, which aired July 15 on LBC and was
              seen in Saudi Arabia, scandalized this conservative country where such
              frank talk is rarely heard in public. Some 200 people filed legal
              complaints against Abdul Jawad, who works for the national airline.</p>
              <p>The
              program, "Bold Red Line," begins with Abdul-Jawad, dubbed a "sex
              braggart" and "Casanova" by the media, describing the first time he had
              sex at 14. He then leads viewers into his bedroom, dominated by red
              accessories, and then shows off blurred sex toys.</p>
              <p>He is later joined by three male friends for a discussion on what turns them on.</p>
              <p>Abdul-Jawad's
              lawyer maintains his client was referring to other people's sexual
              experiences and the toys were provided by the TV station.</p>
              <p>The government moved swiftly in the wake of the case, shutting down LBC's two offices in the kingdom and arresting Abdul-Jawad.</p>
              <p>The
              other three men on the show were also convicted of discussing sex
              publicly and sentenced to two years imprisonment and 300 lashes each,
              according to al-Jumeii.</p>
              <p>The case itself was also tried before
              the wrong court, maintains the lawyer, who says it should have been
              heard by a specialized court at the Information Ministry qualified to
              issue decisions regarding editing, dubbing and other technical issues
              related to the case.</p>
              <p>In his statement, al-Jumeii said the
              decision in the case was made "under pressure from public opinion" due
              to the media frenzy surrounding it.</p>
              <p>He also said he will continue pursuing a lawsuit he has filed against LBC.</p>
              <p>The
              kingdom, which is the birthplace of Islam, enforces strict segregation
              of the sexes. An unrelated couple, for example, can be detained for
              being alone in the same car or having a cup of coffee in public.</p>
              <p>Saudis observe such segregation even at home, where they have separate living rooms for male and female guests.</p>
