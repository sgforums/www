              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: 17px; font-size: 13px; color: #222222;">HE WAS mischievous and loved to play by himself, often pretending to be the monkey god from the fabled Journey To The West.<br><br>But on Saturday, his playful nature might have ended up costing him his life.<br><br>That afternoon, Yuen Kai Lek, 15, a special needs student, was found unconscious in his bedroom with one end of a nylon rope tied around his neck.<br><br>The other end was tied to a window grille in his bedroom. He was pronounced dead by paramedics shortly after.<br><br>When The New Paper visited the Yuen family's three-room HDB flat at Ang Mo Kio last evening, more than five relatives were inside with the grieving family. Kai Lek's parents looked tired, like they had been crying.<br><br>The family collected his body from the mortuary yesterday morning and cremated him in the afternoon.<br><br>While Kai Lek's elder brother, Kai Fai, 17, and his father declined to go to the door and speak with us, his mother, Madam Toh Kim Hiok, 57, told The New Paper yesterday that she had been at work when she received a call from Kai Fai.<br><br>Kai Fai, who works part-time, had wanted to enter the bedroom, but he found the bedroom door locked. He shouted out to his younger brother, but could not get a response.<br><br>The teen then used a spare key to open the door, only to see a shocking sight.<br><br>His brother's limp body was on the bed by the window, his head held up by one end of a nylon rope tied around the neck.<br><br>He was dressed, but his face was already blackish by then, said Madam Toh in Mandarin.<br><br>The shop assistant rushed home, but it was too late. Her son was already dead.<br><br>Madam Toh said that when she left the family's flat at 1.45pm on Saturday, Kai Lek, who had Down syndrome, was happily playing with his Game Boy in his room.<br><br>Her husband, vegetable stall assistant Yuen Kok Chee, 63, was in the living room at that time with Kai Fai.<br><br>Kai Lek's bedroom door was ajar.<br><br>Said Madam Toh: "But it's not unusual for him to lock the room door later. He often locks it when he plays by himself inside. Nothing happened in the past when he locked his door.<br><br>"Who would have thought he would have played until this happened? Perhaps it was destined," she added with a heavy sigh.<br><br>She said: "We've kept that nylon rope for more than 10 years. It was always in the storeroom; I don't know when he took it.<br><br>"He must have seen and taken it without us knowing."<br><br>She said that while it was the first time he had played with that nylon rope, it was not the first time he played with rope.<br><br>"There was another time he played with a rope and tied his hands together with it," she said.<br><br>Earlier reports had said that Kai Lek was allegedly mimicking a magician who freed himself after being tied with rope.<br><br>But Madam Toh dismissed the suggestion.<br><br>She said: "He does not watch magic shows. He likes to watch only his Journey To The West on DVD."<br><br>She recalled fondly: "He always liked to play. He loved watching the Cantonese series Journey To The West and would pretend that he was the monk or the monkey god.<br><br>"Sometimes, he would eat a banana and scratch his head while prancing around, acting like the monkey god."<br><br>Huge fan<br><br>Kai Lek was such a huge fan of the Chinese classic that he watched the series "more than 10 times".<br><br>Said his mother: "He would watch it over and over again. When the series ends, he would start from the beginning. He never got sick of it."<br><br>The teenager watched the series so often that he picked up Cantonese from there.<br><br>Kai Lek attended Fernvale Gardens School, a special education school set up by the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore.<br><br>He did well in his school and was to have studied there for four more years until he turned 18, said Madam Toh.<br><br>"He was very obedient. In school, his teachers taught him to do simple household chores like sweep the floor.<br><br>"Although he couldn't do it very well, he tried to help me at home," she said.<br><br>She added: "He would help me with little things. Sometimes, he would go downstairs to help us buy newspapers.<br><br>"He could also buy soya milk for himself after his teachers taught him how to buy things."<br><br>Kai Lek enjoyed simple hawker fare like chicken rice and duck rice.<br><br>Every Sunday, he would pester his mother to take him to a nearby coffee shop to have nasi lemak.<br><br>"He could eat those three dishes every day," Madam Toh said with a fond smile.<br><br>A neighbour, who declined to be named, said that Kai Lek was a jovial boy who was very polite.<br><br>"He always greeted me 'Aunty' when he saw me.<br><br>"Even though you could tell he's not a normal child, you could still have a normal conversation with him," she said in Mandarin.<br><br>Kai Lek also loved to sing karaoke and her family got used to hearing him sing every afternoon without fail.<br><br>"About 2 or 3pm, he would start singing. He would sing for about two hours. Sometimes, his father sang with him," said the neighbour.<br><br>She added: "Although we could not really make out the words he sang, he could sing in English, Mandarin and even Cantonese.<br><br>"His parents doted on him too, taking him with them whenever they went shopping."<br><br>When contacted, a police spokesman said that police received a call on Saturday at 3.50pm, requesting for police's assistance at a unit at Block 417, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10.<br><br>Upon police's arrival, Kai Lek's body was found motionless at the unit.<br><br>The New Paper understands that when Kai Fai found his brother unconscious, he cut the rope with their father's help to bring Kai Lek to the floor.<br><br>But it was too late.<br><br>Paramedics pronounced him dead at 4.05pm.<br><br>The police have classified the death as unnatural death and investigations are ongoing.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #222222;">HE WAS mischievous and loved to play by himself, often pretending to be the monkey god from the fabled Journey To The West.<br><br>But on Saturday, his playful nature might have ended up costing him his life.<br><br>That afternoon, Yuen Kai Lek, 15, a special needs student, was found unconscious in his bedroom with one end of a nylon rope tied around his neck.<br><br>The other end was tied to a window grille in his bedroom. He was pronounced dead by paramedics shortly after.<br><br>When The New Paper visited the Yuen family's three-room HDB flat at Ang Mo Kio last evening, more than five relatives were inside with the grieving family. Kai Lek's parents looked tired, like they had been crying.<br><br>The family collected his body from the mortuary yesterday morning and cremated him in the afternoon.<br><br>While Kai Lek's elder brother, Kai Fai, 17, and his father declined to go to the door and speak with us, his mother, Madam Toh Kim Hiok, 57, told The New Paper yesterday that she had been at work when she received a call from Kai Fai.<br><br>Kai Fai, who works part-time, had wanted to enter the bedroom, but he found the bedroom door locked. He shouted out to his younger brother, but could not get a response.<br><br>The teen then used a spare key to open the door, only to see a shocking sight.<br><br>His brother's limp body was on the bed by the window, his head held up by one end of a nylon rope tied around the neck.<br><br>He was dressed, but his face was already blackish by then, said Madam Toh in Mandarin.<br><br>The shop assistant rushed home, but it was too late. Her son was already dead.<br><br>Madam Toh said that when she left the family's flat at 1.45pm on Saturday, Kai Lek, who had Down syndrome, was happily playing with his Game Boy in his room.<br><br>Her husband, vegetable stall assistant Yuen Kok Chee, 63, was in the living room at that time with Kai Fai.<br><br>Kai Lek's bedroom door was ajar.<br><br>Said Madam Toh: "But it's not unusual for him to lock the room door later. He often locks it when he plays by himself inside. Nothing happened in the past when he locked his door.<br><br>"Who would have thought he would have played until this happened? Perhaps it was destined," she added with a heavy sigh.<br><br>She said: "We've kept that nylon rope for more than 10 years. It was always in the storeroom; I don't know when he took it.<br><br>"He must have seen and taken it without us knowing."<br><br>She said that while it was the first time he had played with that nylon rope, it was not the first time he played with rope.<br><br>"There was another time he played with a rope and tied his hands together with it," she said.<br><br>Earlier reports had said that Kai Lek was allegedly mimicking a magician who freed himself after being tied with rope.<br><br>But Madam Toh dismissed the suggestion.<br><br>She said: "He does not watch magic shows. He likes to watch only his Journey To The West on DVD."<br><br>She recalled fondly: "He always liked to play. He loved watching the Cantonese series Journey To The West and would pretend that he was the monk or the monkey god.<br><br>"Sometimes, he would eat a banana and scratch his head while prancing around, acting like the monkey god."<br><br>Huge fan<br><br>Kai Lek was such a huge fan of the Chinese classic that he watched the series "more than 10 times".<br><br>Said his mother: "He would watch it over and over again. When the series ends, he would start from the beginning. He never got sick of it."<br><br>The teenager watched the series so often that he picked up Cantonese from there.<br><br>Kai Lek attended Fernvale Gardens School, a special education school set up by the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore.<br><br>He did well in his school and was to have studied there for four more years until he turned 18, said Madam Toh.<br><br>"He was very obedient. In school, his teachers taught him to do simple household chores like sweep the floor.<br><br>"Although he couldn't do it very well, he tried to help me at home," she said.<br><br>She added: "He would help me with little things. Sometimes, he would go downstairs to help us buy newspapers.<br><br>"He could also buy soya milk for himself after his teachers taught him how to buy things."<br><br>Kai Lek enjoyed simple hawker fare like chicken rice and duck rice.<br><br>Every Sunday, he would pester his mother to take him to a nearby coffee shop to have nasi lemak.<br><br>"He could eat those three dishes every day," Madam Toh said with a fond smile.<br><br>A neighbour, who declined to be named, said that Kai Lek was a jovial boy who was very polite.<br><br>"He always greeted me 'Aunty' when he saw me.<br><br>"Even though you could tell he's not a normal child, you could still have a normal conversation with him," she said in Mandarin.<br><br>Kai Lek also loved to sing karaoke and her family got used to hearing him sing every afternoon without fail.<br><br>"About 2 or 3pm, he would start singing. He would sing for about two hours. Sometimes, his father sang with him," said the neighbour.<br><br>She added: "Although we could not really make out the words he sang, he could sing in English, Mandarin and even Cantonese.<br><br>"His parents doted on him too, taking him with them whenever they went shopping."<br><br>When contacted, a police spokesman said that police received a call on Saturday at 3.50pm, requesting for police's assistance at a unit at Block 417, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10.<br><br>Upon police's arrival, Kai Lek's body was found motionless at the unit.<br><br>The New Paper understands that when Kai Fai found his brother unconscious, he cut the rope with their father's help to bring Kai Lek to the floor.<br><br>But it was too late.<br><br>Paramedics pronounced him dead at 4.05pm.<br><br>The police have classified the death as unnatural death and investigations are ongoing.</span></p>
