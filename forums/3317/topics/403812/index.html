              <p>SINGAPORE Telecommunications's (SingTel) group chief executive Chua 
              Sock Koong's $2.7 million cash bonus last year boosted her net pay by 23
               per cent to $4.15 million.</p>
              <p>SingTel revealed this in its annual report for its financial year 
              2010 ended March 31, released on Tuesday morning.</p>
              <p>This is the 52-year-old CEO's biggest paycheck since her 
              appointment to the position in 2007. That year, she was paid $3.57 
              million. This fell to $3.38 million last year, because of a 
              significantly lower bonus.</p>
              <p>Other senior executives also got generous increments.</p>
              <p>SingTel's Australian unit Optus chief executive Paul 
              O'Sullivan, 49, saw his pay rise a whopping 42 per cent to $3.48 
              million, largely because of a more generous bonus of $1.8 million, 
              compared to $941,000 last year.</p>
              <p>Mr Allen Lew, SingTel's chief executive for Singapore, was 
              paid $2.88 million, 17 per cent more than a year ago. In 2008, Mr Lew, 
              54, was SingTel's highest paid executive, with a then-paycheck of $3.9 
              million.</p>
              <p>Outgoing chief executive for international Lim Chuan Poh, 
              55, who will retire at the end of the year, earned $2.25 million - up 23
               per cent from $1.83 million last year</p>
              <p>Separately, SingTel also announced that three directors, Mr 
              Heng Swee Keat, Mr John Powell Morschel, and Mr Deepak S Parekh, will 
              retire from the board at the coming AGM on July 30.</p>
              <p>Mr Heng, 49, managing director of the Monetary Authority of 
              Singapore, is an independent director and sits on its corporate 
              governance and nominations, as well as compensation committees. He 
              joined SingTel's board in 2003.</p>
              <p>Non-executive chairman of Australia and New Zealand Banking 
              Group Mr Morschel, 67, joined SingTel's board in 2001 and is also an 
              independent director who sits on its compensation committee. He is also 
              the chair of SingTel's Australian unit Optus' advisory committee.</p>
              <p>Mr Parekh, 65, is an independent director who was appointed 
              in 2004 and sits on its compensation committee. He is the chairman of 
              India's Housing Development Finance Corporation.</p>
              <p>SingTel declined to say who would replace them, but said the
               nominees will be at its July 30 AGM.</p>
