              <p><br>Singaporean housewife Nursiah Sabada 
              could only shrug in resignation as she shopped for food ahead of the 
              holiday weekend marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.</p>
              <p>"It's
               the same price being quoted everywhere, and I don't have much choice 
              because of the festive season," she told AFP after purchasing three 
              kilograms (6.6 pounds) of beef for the Eid al-Fitr celebrations.</p>
              <p>She
               was not alone in feeling the pinch, and the rise in beef prices in 
              import-dependent Singapore had little to do with the festival itself.</p>
              <p>Millions
               of Asians like Nursiah are spending more to put food on the table as a 
              result of supply disruptions from floods and drought, while changing 
              patterns of consumption are expected to put long-term pressure on 
              prices.</p>
              <p>The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) will hold a
               special one-day meeting to discuss rising world prices in Rome on 
              September 24.</p>
              <p>While analysts say the situation is less severe than
               the one experienced in Asia in 2008, when soaring food costs triggered 
              social unrest in poorer parts of the region, chances of prices easing 
              anytime soon are remote.</p>
              <p>"In the immediate future, it's not going 
              to go up to what we saw in 2008 but the trend is of course on the 
              upside," said Shikha Jha, principal economist with the Manila-based 
              Asian Development Bank.</p>
              <p>Erratic weather patterns, better nutrition
               amid rising affluence and shrinking supply of arable land are seen as 
              the main factors behind the rising food costs.</p>
              <p>"We expect another 
              multi-year food price rise, partly because of burgeoning demand from the
               world's rapidly developing and most populated economies where diets are
               changing towards a higher calorie intake," Nomura analysts said.</p>
              <p>"The
               supply side of the food equation is being constrained by diminishing 
              agricultural productivity gains and competing use of available land due 
              to rising trends of urbanization and industrialization," they said in a 
              report.</p>
              <p>The FAO's food price index in August reached its highest 
              level since September 2008, rising by five percent to an average of 176 
              points with the spike caused mainly by drought-hit Russia's restrictions
               on wheat exports.</p>
              <p>Kevin Grice, a London-based economist with 
              Capital Economics, said consumers in Asia's poorer economies would feel 
              the pain more acutely.</p>
              <p>"I think probably the most vulnerable would be Thailand, India and the Philippines," Grice said.</p>
              <p>Devastating
               floods in Pakistan have sent prices soaring with inflation set to hit 
              20 percent, and wiped out 80 percent of farmers' wheat stock and seeds 
              in breadbasket provinces such as Sindh and Punjab, according to the 
              government.</p>
              <p>Major floods have also affected China's agricultural 
              output with food prices up an annual 6.8 percent in July after rising 
              5.5 percent on-year in the first six months of 2010, the latest official
               data show.</p>
              <p>In India, food inflation rose 11.47 percent 
              year-on-year in the week to August 28 compared with 10.86 percent in the
               previous week.</p>
              <p>Indians saw food prices rise by nearly 18 percent 
              last year after the worst monsoon rains in three decades hit farming 
              output, sparking protests and fiery parliamentary debates.</p>
              <p>Food prices in the Philippines, which has a sizeable agricultural sector, are also on the up with sugar particularly affected.</p>
              <p>Blaming
               "irregular weather", Roberto Amore of the Chamber of Commerce and 
              Industry said: "Areas that need a lot of water for irrigation don't have
               water. Areas that need less water have a lot of water, they are 
              inundated."</p>
              <p>In Malaysia, the government has introduced price 
              controls on 18 items including chicken, eggs, some vegetables and fish, 
              but shoppers complain they are not working.</p>
              <p>"Consumers are angry. 
              How can you (say you) control prices when all the basic grocery 
              necessities have gone up?" said Siti Nora Abdul Manaf, a 50-year-old 
              housewife who lives just outside Kuala Lumpur.</p>
              <p>But in Indonesia at least, a stronger rupiah has shielded consumers from sharply higher agricultural prices, economists said.</p>
              <p>"If the rupiah weakens, then there could be a problem here," Sucorinvest Central Gani analyst Gifar Indra Sakti said.</p>
              <p>But
               food prices are relatively stable and the government is "unlikely to 
              introduce any price controls or stockpiling" for now, he said. "There's 
              no need for Indonesian consumers to panic."<br><br>Source:<br>AFP, Taken from Yahoo News.<a href="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Rising-food-prices-pinch-afpsg-3751551126.html?x=0"><br>http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Rising-food-prices-pinch-afpsg-3751551126.html?x=0</a></p>

              <p>LOL... This has got more to do with the quality and variety of the apple you are buying... <br><br>I think a better example would be .... <br>The difference a $50 can buy you for groceries 5 years ago, as compared to now.. <br><br>My family of 5 on average spends about $300 a week on groceries / food.... 5 years ago it was like $200....</p>
