              <h1>Tsunami generated by Indonesian quake not major: US agency</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE (REUTERS) - A tsunami measuring 17cm has been generated in 
              the Indian Ocean and is headed for the Aceh province of Indonesia after a
               strong earthquake, a Pacific Tsunami Warning Center official said on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Earlier, an 8.6 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Indonesia, sending residents fleeing in fear.</p>
              <p>Mr Victor Sardina, a geophysicist on duty at the 
              Hawaii-based centre, said the total vertical measurement of the wave, 
              according to monitoring gauges, was 35cm, making the height 17cm.</p>
              <p>He did not provide a time estimate for 
              landfall. 'It doesn't look like a major tsunami,' Mr Sardina said. 'But 
              we are still monitoring as tsunamis come in waves.</p>

              <p><strong>Indian Ocean on tsunami watch after Sumatra quake</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>WASHINGTON - US monitors issued an Indian Ocean-wide tsunami 
              watch following a massive earthquake off the coast of Sumatra Wednesday 
              but said it appeared to have only generated small waves.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Victor Sardina, a 
              geophysicist with the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, told 
              AFP the tsunami was "not anywhere near" as large as the devastating 
              tsunamis that struck Asia in 2004 and Japan last year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said the tsunami 
              measured a mere 35 centimetres (14 inches) near Padang, Indonesia, but 
              could swell to as high as a metre (three feet) near Sri Lanka, adding 
              that US scientists were still carefully monitoring the situation.<br><br>Earlier,
               the center said "earthquakes of this size have the potential to 
              generate a widespread destructive tsunami" but that it was not yet clear
               if such a tsunami had actually been generated.<br><br>The US Geological
               Survey said an 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra
               at 2:38 pm (0838 GMT) at a depth of 33 kilometers (14.2 miles), 
              revising earlier reports of a deeper, stronger quake.<br><br>The 
              epicenter was some 435 kilometers (270 miles) from Banda Aceh, 
              Indonesia, one of the hardest-hit areas in the December 26, 2004 tsunami
               that wrought devastation across the Indian Ocean and killed some 
              220,000 people.<br><br>The earthquake that caused the 2004 tsunami had a
               magnitude of 9.2, but also a much stronger vertical component, whereas 
              Wednesday's earthquake was more horizontally directed, Sardina said.<br><br>Last year, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan, killing some 19,000 people.<br><br>- AFP/ir</span></span></p>

              <h1>Small tsunami reaches Thailand after huge quake</h1>
              <p>BANGKOK (AFP) - A small tsunami measuring 10cm  reached Thailand's 
              Andaman Coast on Wednesday after a massive earthquake off the coast of 
              Indonesia, an official said.</p>
              <p>'A 10-centimetre tsunami wave generated by the first earthquake hit 
              Koh Miang off Phang Nga,' the director of Thailand's National Disaster 
              Warning Centre, Somsak Khaosuwan, said on Thai television.</p>
              <p>'But we cannot be complacent,' he added, noting there
               had been several powerful aftershocks. 'So we are maintaining the 
              warning.' The centre earlier advised people on the Andaman coast, a 
              magnet for foreign tourists, to move to higher places and stay as far 
              away as possible from the sea.</p>
              <p>The area was battered by an Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 that killed an estimated 5,400 people in Thailand alone.</p>

              <h1>Small tsunamis hit Indonesian coast after Sumatra quake</h1>
              <p>JAKARTA (AFP) - At least three tsunamis of up to 80cm hit Indonesia's
               coast after a massive 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck off Sumatra 
              island on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'Our tide gauges and buoys recorded small tsunamis,' Said Kristiawan 
              of Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said. He said the 
              highest was in Meulaboh in western Aceh, 'measuring 80 centimetres', and
               other smaller ones were recorded in nearby coastal regions.</p>
              <p>A massive earthquake struck off Indonesia's Sumatra 
              island earlier on Wednesday, triggering an Indian Ocean-wide tsunami 
              alert and evacuation orders to clear people away from the coast.</p>
              <p>The 8.6-magnitude quake struck 431km off 
              the Indonesian city of Banda Aceh, the US Geological Survey said, and 
              was followed by a major 8.2-magnitude aftershock.</p>

              tremors from the Aceh earthquake were felt this afternoon (April 11). <br><br>According
               to an article in AsiaOne, office workers were seen gathering outside 
              700 Beach Road, a nine-level office building, just before 5pm. The 
              evacuation apparently lasted less than 15 minutes before the workers 
              were allowed to return to the building.<br><br>Tremors were felt all over S'pore
               after a 8.7 quake hit Aceh, Indonesia. Areas where tremors were felt

              Basah and the Central Business District. <br><br>The National 
              Environment Agency released a statement in Twitter, requesting the

              <h1>Indonesia lifts tsunami warning after earthquake</h1>
              <p>JAKARTA (AFP) - Indonesia lifted a tsunami warning which was issued 
              following a massive 8.6-magnitude earthquake off Sumatra island on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'The tsunami warning has been lifted,' Sri 
              Woro Harijono, head of Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, 
              said on Metro TV.</p>
              <p>Indonesia cancelled the warning shortly 
              after the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii lifted its Indian 
              Ocean-wide tsunami alert.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">30 S'pore buildings in tremor-affected areas inspected</h1>
              <p>30 buildings in Singapore have been inspected and found to be 
              structurally safe after tremors were felt following a huge earthquake 
              off Indonesia at 4:38pm on Wednesday.<br> <br>The Building and 
              Construction Authority (BCA) and Housing Development Board (HDB) 
              inspected buildings in the Central Business District (CBD), Beach Road, 
              Temasek Boulevard, Selegie, Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Serangoon North, 
              Punggol, Woodlands, Geylang Bahru, Geylang and Siglap, where tremors 
              were reported.<br> <br>Members of the public felt buildings sway in different parts of the city-state after an 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Indonesia’s island of Sumatra.  A few offices temporarily evacuated staff. <br><br>The
               Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force said they 
              received 38 calls from the public reporting tremors in certain parts of 
              Singapore.<br><br> Facebook user Siva Sai Saravanan told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that he felt tremors at Block 107 Jalan Rajah.  <br><br> “My father and I experienced our flat swaying for a long time. The pails
               in our bathroom, filled with water started spilling by themselves.This 
              happened at around 4:45pm,” Siva said.<br><br> Another <span>Facebook</span> user, Siti, said, “ I thought I felt the building 
              tilting at around 3.10pm in Choa Chu Kang. Was wondering if I was 
              dizzy.”<br><br> Media planner Lyndsey Long was sitting in her office in Beach Road when she felt the tremors for about a minute.<br><br> "I felt giddy, and could feel myself swaying slightly... I also felt a 
              little nauseous," she told Yahoo! Singapore, adding that her entire 
              office was temporarily evacuated from the building she was in. She also 
              observed that some of the people at the adjacent Golden Mile Tower were 
              evacuated at the same time.<br><br> Facebook user Tommy Teo, who lives in Yishun, said he felt the tremors and saw his chair moving.<br><br> “I was in my master bed room doing some computer work this afternoon and
               felt my chair was moving. I asked my daughter and son, and they said 
              they felt some tremors.This was definitely an earthquake in Indonesia. 
              Minutes later the internet was abuzz with news of a major earthquake,” 
              said Teo.<br><br> Final-year undergraduate Philemon Foo was at home in Bedok when he felt the tremors.<br><br> “It started slow -- I felt my roller chair oscillating,” he said. “I 
              didn’t think much about it at first, but then the oscillations got 
              slightly more pronounced and I got a little worried as they didn’t stop 
              even after 30 seconds,” he added.<br><br> He said the tremors in his house lasted for what seemed like two 
              minutes, and saw items in his house like drawstrings and clothes hangers
               swaying in unison.<br><br> “It was quite long to me, that’s what made the experience scary,” he added.<br><br><em>Yahoo!</em> user Foo Kee Mak said that he contacted a friend in <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Padang+Indonesia&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;vm=r&amp;cs=bz">Padang</a>, a few
               hundred kilometres from the epicentre, and was told he felt the quake 
              for two minutes.<br><br> The quake struck 431 kilometres off Banda Aceh, located on the northern 
              tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. <br><br>A <span>tsunami watch has been raised </span>for the entire Indian Ocean, and countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka<span style="text-decoration: underline;">, </span>India and Singapore but it has been lifted.<br><br> The National Environment Agency said a regional tsunami may be generated but is unlikely to affect Singapore.<br><br> In Sumatra, residents were shaken by the quake, though it did not seem to have been felt strongly in Jakarta.<br><br> 78-year-old Tandio who was in Pematang Siantar (a town north of Medan, 
              Sumatra) said, “My heart started palpitating and felt like I was 
              falling. Thought it was my heart so I took medication.”<br><br> Singapore-based freelance translator Belda Kosasih who is currently in Jak    arta said she didn’t feel a thing.<br><br> She expressed concern for Indonesians living near the epicenter though.<br><br> “We're worried for Aceh because when the tsunami happened in 2004, it really devastated the place,” said Kosasih.<br><br> The tremors of the Sumatra quake were felt as far away as Thailand and Southern India, reported <em>Reuters</em>.<br><br>Should
               cracks or other structural defects be subsequently sighted, residents 
              or occupants in public housing estates should call the HDB’s emergency 
              service providers’ 24-hour hotline at 1800-325 8888, 1800-6275 5555, or 
              1800-6354 3333.<br> <br>Those in private buildings should call the BCA at 6325 7191 or 6325 7393.</p>
