              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Friday for 
              taking up-skirt videos and attempting to film women in changing rooms. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Twenty-five-year-old
               Liow Yaw Vwee had pleaded guilty to one charge of insulting the modesty
               of a woman and two charges of attempting to insult the modesty of a 
              woman.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Then a student in 
              the faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the National University of 
              Singapore, Liow tried to use his mobile phone to film a woman trying on 
              clothes in the changing rooms of a garment shop at Parkway Parade 
              Shopping Centre on 8 April 2010. <br><br>The unisex changing rooms were not totally covered as partitions between the cubicles extended only to calf level.<br><br>As
               the woman bent down to get her clothing and bag, she spotted a hand 
              holding a mobile phone at an angle aiming into her cubicle. She reported
               the incident to the shop. <br><br>On 19 April, Liow returned to the shop and went into the changing room with three shirts. <br><br>A staff on duty recognised Liow as a peeping tom from the earlier incident. <br><br>She
               called him out of the changing room upon observing that he had put his 
              haversack on the floor with a black and orange rectangular box on top of
               it.<br><br>He had cut a small hole on the box and inserted his mobile phone. <br><br>Liow
               admitted that he had intended to take photographs or videos of women 
              undressing but did not press the record button as he was afraid of 
              getting caught.<br><br>On another occasion on 11 August 2010, Liow used 
              his mobile phone to record an up-skirt video of a woman as he stood 
              behind her on an ascending escalator at Vivocity Shopping Mall. <br><br>Six other charges of filming up-skirt videos were also taken into consideration in the sentence passed.<br><br>The
               Deputy Public Prosecutor called for a deterrent sentence and said that 
              the offences were serial in nature and affected multiple victims. <br><br>She added that modern technology was used, which allowed for repeated viewing. <br><br>In
               his mitigation plea, Liow's lawyer said that Liow was a first offender 
              and had committed the offences when he was briefly depressed over his 
              failed relationships. <br><br>The defence also said that Liow's prospective employer was willing to give him a chance if the jail sentence was not too long. <br><br>In
               sentencing, the District Judge said that the dominant consideration is 
              deterrence and that a custodial sentence is warranted. <br><br>The maximum penalty for insulting the modesty of a woman is one year's jail and a fine on each charge.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
