              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Broadcaster ESPN Star Sports is suing landbanking 
              firm Profitable Plots, which is under police investigation following 
              complaints of cheating, for failing to pay close to US$4 million (S$4.9 
              million). </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>While a default 
              judgment was issued in December against Profitable Plots, after it did 
              not appear in court, the money has not been paid to date.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>ESPN is also 
              claiming damages for misrepresentation, conspiracy and fraudulent 
              trading in the lawsuit against Profitable Plots' directors John Andrew 
              Nordmann and Mr Timothy Nicholas Goldring, which they have denied in 
              their defence filed in April.<br><br>Court documents state that the two 
              companies had entered into an agreement in November 2007, which entitles
               Profitable Plots to air its advertisements and sponsor some of ESPN's 
              television programmes for three years.<br><br>ESPN's lawyer See Chern 
              Yang of Premier Law said the landbanking firm has defaulted on payment 
              since April 2009, and after several meetings between December 2009 and 
              June last year, the directors only kept giving verbal assurances.<br><br>In
               its court papers, the broadcaster alleged that Profitable Plots and its
               related companies had suffered losses of S$25.8 million in 2009 and 
              that the two directors had not only failed to ensure sufficient finances
               to fulfil agreements, they gave a false impression the business was 
              profitable, with the intention to deceive creditors.<br><br>In response,
               Profitable Plots' lawyer Roy Yeo of Sterling Law Corporation said his 
              clients did not proffer any oral assurances to make payment but were 
              given a time extension by ESPN after they had explained the firm's 
              difficulties.<br><br>In their court papers, the two directors claimed 
              that ESPN was, on its own accord, "happy to continue" with the 
              agreement, as it would have otherwise lost a considerable amount of 
              content from their channel without Profitable Plots' advertising.<br><br>The men claimed that ESPN withheld suspending the agreement due to its "own commercial reasons".<br><br>ESPN
               has since filed a reply refuting that there was any agreement to allow 
              delay of payment and said the defendants had admitted the debt by giving
               two post-dated cheques that were not encashable eventually.<br><br>The 
              broadcaster added that it terminated the agreement after the defendants 
              did not respond to several warnings and notices for payment.<br><br>Meanwhile,
               investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department into Profitable 
              Plots are ongoing after 229 complaints were made by investors who 
              claimed they were cheated of S$23.5 million.<br><br>No criminal charges have been pressed on the company's directors and the matter is due in court on July 8. </span></span></p>
