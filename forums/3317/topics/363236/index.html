              <p>NKorea sentences 2 US journalists to 12 years jail<br>By VIJAY JOSHI, Associated Press Writer <br>48 mins ago</p>
              <p>SEOUL,
              South Korea – North Korea's top court convicted two American
              journalists and sentenced them to 12 years in a prison Monday,
              intensifying the reclusive nation's confrontation with the United
              States.</p>
              <p>The sentencing came amid soaring tensions fueled by the
              North's latest nuclear and missile tests. Many believe Pyongyang is
              using the journalists as bargaining chips as the U.N. debates a new
              resolution to punish the unpredictable country for its latest military
              threats.</p>
              <p>In a cryptic two-sentence report, the North's state news
              agency said Laura Ling, 32, and Euna Lee, 36 were sentenced after the
              five-day trial ended Monday. They were guilty of a "grave crime"
              against the nation and of illegally crossing into North Korea, the
              Korean Central News Agency said.</p>
              <p>The court "sentenced each of
              them to 12 years of reform through labor," said the report, without
              giving other details. The phrase refers to a prison term, according to
              Choi Eun-suk, a North Korean law expert at Seoul's University of North
              Korean Studies.</p>
              <p>He said North Korean law calls for transferring convicts to prison within 10 days after verdict.</p>
              <p>Ling
              and Lee, working for former Vice President Al Gore's California-based
              Current TV, cannot appeal because they were tried in North Korea's
              highest court, where decisions are final.</p>
              <p>Some analysts believe negotiations will now begin that will likely lead to the journalists' release.</p>
              <p>"North
              Korea refused to release them ahead of a court ruling because such a
              move could be seen as capitulating to the United States," said Hajime
              Izumi, professor of international relations and an expert on North
              Korea at the University of Shizuoka in Japan.</p>
              <p>But now "North
              Korea may release them on humanitarian grounds and demand the U.S.
              provide humanitarian aid in return," he said. "North Korea will
              certainly use the reporters as a bargaining chip in negotiations with
              the United States."</p>
              <p>Their release could come through a
              post-negotiation political pardon, said Yang Moo-jin, a colleague of
              Choi at the University of North Korean Studies.</p>
              <p>Kim Yong-hyun, a
              professor at Seoul's Dongguk University, said the 12-year sentence —
              the maximum possible allowed by the North's laws — could have been a
              reaction to "hard-line" moves by the U.S., including threats of
              sanctions and putting North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of
              terrorism.</p>
              <p>"But the sentence doesn't mean much because the issue will be resolved diplomatically in the end," he said.</p>
              <p>Tensions
              have been running high since the North held its second underground
              nuclear blast May 25 and followed it up with several missile tests.
              U.S. officials have said the North appears to be preparing to test
              another long-range missile at a new launch pad.</p>
              <p>The circumstances
              surrounding the trial of the two journalists and their arrest March 17
              on the China-North Korean border have been shrouded in secrecy, as is
              typical of the reclusive nation. The trial was not open to the public
              or foreign observers, including the Swedish Embassy, which looks after
              American interests in the absence of diplomatic relations.</p>
              <p>The
              two were reporting about the trafficking of women at the time of their
              arrest, and it's unclear if they strayed into the North or were grabbed
              by aggressive border guards who crossed into China.</p>
              <p>U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Washington was trying to confirm press reports of the sentencing.</p>
              <p>Kelly
              said the U.S. was "deeply concerned" about the sentences and that
              officials would "engage in all possible channels" to free the women.</p>
              <p>Gore
              spokeswoman Kalee Kreider said the former vice president has no
              comment. The South Korean government also did not comment. Alanna Zahn,
              a spokeswoman for the journalists' families, said the family members
              have no immediate comment.</p>
              <p>Another American who was tried in
              North Korea in 1996 was treated more leniently. Evan C. Hunziker,
              apparently acting on a drunken dare, swam across the Yalu River — which
              marks the North's border with China — and was arrested after farmers
              found the man, then 26, naked. He was accused of spying and detained
              for three months before being freed after negotiations with a special
              U.S. envoy.</p>
              <p>The North Koreans wanted Hunziker to pay a $100,000
              criminal fine but eventually agreed on a $5,000 payment to settle a
              bill for a hotel where he was detained.</p>
              <p>___</p>
