              <h1 class="storyheadline">German minister: more deaths possible in outbreak</h1>
              <p>BERLIN - GERMANY'S health minister is warning that the number of 
              deaths from an E. coli outbreak may increase - but he's hopeful that the
               worst is over.</p>
              <p>The world's deadliest E. coli outbreak, which officials have traced 
              to German-grown sprouts, has so far killed 33 people and sickened nearly
               3,100.</p>
              <p>Health Minister Daniel Bahr was quoted on Saturday as telling a 
              newspaper that 'the wave is gradually abating - there is reason to hope 
              the worst is now over.' He said it is unlikely the outbreak will flare 
              up again.</p>
              <p>But he is cautioning that 'further deaths are not ruled out, as painful as that is.'</p>
              <p>Health officials said on Friday that sprouts from a farm in 
              northern Germany caused the outbreak, which prompted many in Europe to 
              shun vegetables over recent weeks.</p>

              <p><strong>E. coli death toll reaches 35; Germany warns of more</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>BERLIN: The death toll from a killer bug outbreak centred on 
              Germany rose on Sunday to at least 35 as the government warned of more 
              to come, despite the source having been identified and new infections 
              falling.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"More fatalities 
              cannot be ruled out, painful though it is to say so," Health Minister 
              Daniel Bahr told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, two days after the 
              source was identified as vegetable sprouts grown in northern Germany.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"The continuing fall
               in the number of new infections gives grounds for optimism. But that 
              does not rule out more cases of EHEC (enterohaemorrhagic E. coli)," he 
              said.<br><br>The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's national disease
               agency, said on Sunday meanwhile that the death toll had risen to 35, 
              but that the rate of new infections had continued to abate.<br><br>"The outbreak is receding," RKI spokesman Guenther Dettweiler told AFP.<br><br>All
               but one of the 35 deaths from EHEC poisoning have been in Germany, with
               the other being a woman in Sweden who had recently travelled to 
              Germany. <br><br>Some 3,255 people have also fallen sick in 14 European 
              countries plus the United States and Canada, according to the World 
              Health Organisation. All but five cases were in people who lived or had 
              visited Germany.<br><br>Many are seriously ill with bloody diarrhoea and
               potentially life-threatening conditions such as haemolytic uraemic 
              syndrome (HUS), a serious kidney ailment. <br><br>The WHO said on Saturday that 812 people had HUS, 773 of them in Germany.<br><br>In
               Germany, some 100 patients have such bad kidney damage that they need 
              an organ transplant "or will require dialysis treatment for the rest of 
              their lives", said Karl Lauterbach, health expert for the Social 
              Democrats party.<br><br>After several frantic weeks of searching, German
               authorities on Friday said they had identified the source as being 
              vegetable sprouts from an organic farm in Lower Saxony, northern 
              Germany.<br><br>The farm has been closed and all its products recalled. 
              The farm cultivated sprouts from a variety of products including 
              lettuce, azuki beans, mung beans, fenugreek, alfalfa and lentils.<br><br>Authorities
               have said though that the farm in the northern village of Bienenbuettel
               had done nothing wrong, with Gert Lindemann, Lower Saxony agriculture 
              minister, saying it had "high hygiene standards".<br><br>With German 
              authorities only late last week dropping advice, particularly in 
              northern Germany, to avoid uncooked tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce, the
               scare has cost European farmers hundreds of millions of euros 
              (dollars).<br><br>The RKI still recommends not eating raw vegetable sprouts.<br><br>Particularly badly hit were Spanish producers after Germany initially and erroneously blamed cucumbers grown there.<br><br>The European Commission has offered 210 million euros ($303 million) to farmers affected across Europe.<br><br>Russia
               also banned the import of all fresh vegetables from the whole of the 
              27-nation European Union. Moscow agreed at a summit with the EU on 
              Friday to lift the ban.<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">New E. coli sicknesses declining</h1>
              <p>BERLIN - THE number of people falling sick as a result of E. coli 
              contamination has slowed to a trickle, Germany's national disease 
              control center said on Tuesday, even as the death toll from the outbreak
               rose by one to 37.</p>
              <p>The Robert Koch Institute said a total of 3,235 people in Germany 
              have been reported ill, only seven more than the previous day.</p>
              <p>Germany's health minister has cautioned that even though the outbreak
               is waning further deaths are possible. The local council in the 
              northern town of Celle said a two-year-old boy died overnight, news 
              agency DAPD reported. German authorities have narrowed the source of the
               outbreak to vegetable sprouts from a farm in the north of the country.</p>
              <p>Thirty-six people in Germany and one in Sweden have now died
               in what has been the deadliest outbreak of E. coli ever. The crisis has
               devastated farmers across Europe as frightened consumers shunned 
              vegetables after German authorities initally advised people against 
              eating cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, the European Union approved a 210 million euro 
              (S$373 million) compensation package for fruit and vegetable farmers.</p>
              <p>EU Farm Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said the compensation was
               'an important signal for fresh vegetable growers because I was very 
              keen to show that Europe can react quickly' to the outbreak. Mr Ciolos 
              initially proposed 150 million euros for struggling farmers. But under 
              pressure from big producers like Spain, Italy and France, he had to 
              offer more help. -- AP</p>
