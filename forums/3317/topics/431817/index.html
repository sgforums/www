              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The bacteria is 
              commonly transmitted via contaminated raw food and sometimes through

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singaporeans 
              travelling to Germany should avoid eating raw tomatoes and leafy

              Consultant at the National University Hospital's Division of 
              Microbiology.<br><br>Symptoms of E. coli infection include abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea.<br><br>When it comes to food preparation, doctors say raw and cooked food should be separated to reduce contamination.<br><br>They advise eating cooked food as it means the bacteria is killed before consumption.<br><br>Associate
               Professor Leo Yee Sin, head of Department of Infectious Diseases at Tan
               Tock Seng Hospital, said: "It is a personal choice whether this person 
              will take up a salad or raw food, but I would strongly suggest that at 
              this moment in time when the situation is less clear, it's good to avoid
               raw food or food that you really do not know the source, whether or not
               it could potentially be contaminated, unclean or poorly prepared."<br><br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>HAMBURG - AN OUTBREAK of killer E. coli that has spread to 12 
              countries and killed 19 people may be linked to a Hamburg festival in 
              May and could have caused a 20th death, according to reports on 
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>As authorities continued to hunt the source of the killer bug, 
              Germany's national disease centre, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), is 
              looking closely at a harbour festival that took place in Hamburg on May 
              6-8.</p>
              <p>A paper said the festival drew 1.5 million visitors from Germany and 
              abroad and noted that the first reported case of E. coli infection 
              followed just a week later in the city's university hospital.</p>
              <p>German media also said on Saturday a man in his 50s who died
               in Brandenberg may be the 20th victim but the cause of death was 
              uncertain because he had several other infections as well as E. coli.</p>
              <p>Faced with uncertainty over the source of the outbreak, 
              reports said police were investigating a possible deliberate act and 
              were checking two restaurants in the northern town of Lubeck, one in 
              which 17 diners fell ill and another in which eight women were sickened.</p>
              <p>On Thursday Germany authorities said the number of new infections appeared to be stabilising.</p>

              several other infections as well as E. coli.<br><br>The latest confirmed death was of an 80-year-old woman in the northern German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Friday.<br><br>She
               succumbed as German authorities were still warning consumers off raw 
              vegetables, despite the EU's Reference Laboratory for E. coli in Rome 
              saying scientific tests had failed to support a link to the outbreak.<br><br>Faced
               with uncertainty over the source of the outbreak, reports said police 
              were investigating a possible deliberate act and were also checking two 
              restaurants in the northern town of Lubeck, one in which 17 diners fell 
              ill and another in which eight women were sickened, one of whom died.<br><br>On Thursday Germany authorities said the number of new infections appeared to be stabilising.<br><br>But
               Reinhard Brunkhorst, president of the German Nephrology Society, added:
               "We are dealing here in fact with the biggest epidemic caused by 
              bacteria in recent decades."<br><br>All but one of the fatalities since 
              the outbreak of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) poisoning began last 
              month have occurred in Germany. A patient who died in Sweden had 
              recently returned from Germany.<br><br>Regional German health 
              authorities have reported more than 2,000 cases of people falling ill, 
              with symptoms including stomach cramps, diarrhoea, fever and vomiting.<br><br>A
               large majority are female, suggesting the source is "probably something
               that women prefer more than men," Andrea Ellis, an epidemiologist at 
              the World Health Organisation's (WHO) department of food safety, said in
               Geneva.<br><br>In some cases the infection can lead to bloody diarrhoea
               and potentially life-threatening conditions such as haemolytic uraemic 
              syndrome (HUS), a kidney disease.<br><br>At least 552 people, 520 of 
              them in Germany, have HUS, according to the WHO, with 10 other European 
              countries plus the United States reporting HUS or EHEC infections.<br><br>The
               outbreak was "the largest epidemic of HUS to have occurred anywhere in 
              the world," according to Francois-Xavier Weill, head of France's 
              National Reference Centre for E. coli.<br><br>In addition to Germany, 
              cases of E. coli poisoning have been reported in Austria, Britain, the 
              Czech Republic, Denmark, France, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden,
               Switzerland and the United States.<br><br>Britain confirmed four more cases of poisoning on Friday, bringing the total number of infected in the country to 11.<br><br>Each is related to German travel and three of the patients have HUS, the Health Protection Agency said.<br><br>The
               WHO has identified the bacteria as a rare E. coli strain never before 
              connected to an outbreak of food poisoning. But researchers in Hamburg 
              said earlier they and Chinese colleagues had found the strain was a "new
               type" which is extremely aggressive and resistant to antibiotics.<br><br>Germany authorities were quick to point the blame for the outbreak at cucumbers imported from Spain, triggering trade tensions.<br><br>German
               Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the false cucumber alert in a phone 
              call Thursday with Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, saying 
              authorities were "duty-bound to inform the public at all times."<br><br>The
               advisory, retracted this week, left tens of thousands of tonnes of 
              Spanish produce unsold, costing Spanish growers an estimated 200 million
               euros ($290 million) a week.<br><br>To ease tension over the heavy 
              losses, European agriculture ministers are scheduled to meet in 
              Luxembourg for talks after June 17, according to diplomats.<br><br>With 
              no clarity on the source of the mysterious bacteria, the outbreak has 
              led some countries such as Russia and Lebanon to ban vegetables from the
               EU, in moves criticised by the 27-member bloc.<br><br>-AFP/wk</span></span></p>

               Sweden.<br><br>Sunday's figures showed a rise of 328 in cases of EHEC

              <p><strong>Seed sprouts might be responsible for killer bacteria, says minister</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>HANOVER, Germany: Seed sprouts are suspected of being at the 
              root of a deadly E. coli outbreak which has killed 22 people, mainly in 
              Germany, a regional agriculture minister said on Sunday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Gert Lindermann, who
               represents Lower-Saxony, said there was not yet definite proof but a 
              connection had been made "involving all the main outbreaks" of the 
              disease, which has also left more than 2,000 people ill.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>News of the possible
               breakthrough came as the death toll climbed to 22, with the latest 
              figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
              (ECDC) adding three victims to the previously confirmed 19.<br><br>All 
              but one of the deaths occurred in Germany, the source of the 
              enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) outbreak which has affected a dozen 
              countries. The other victim died in Sweden.<br><br>Initial test results 
              from a farm producing the sprouts, on the outskirts of Lueneburg in 
              northern Germany, showed contamination by the bacteria, the minister 
              told a press conference.<br><br>Sprouts are cultivated there from a 
              variety of products, including lettuce, azuki beans, mung beans, 
              fenugreek, alfafa and lentils. Some had been imported from abroad.<br><br>"It
               is significant that two women employees from the firm are ill with 
              diarrhoea, and in one case EHEC has been diagnosed," the minister said.<br><br>Early indications are that the farm "is at least one of the sources of contamination," he added.<br><br>The
               sprouts grow in temperatures of 37 degrees celsius (around 98 degrees 
              Fahrenheit) "which is ideal for all bacteria," the minister said.<br><br>The
               farm is in the small village of Bienenbuettel, some 80 kilometres south
               of Hamburg, one of the main cities hit by the bacteria outbreak.<br><br>Authorities
               in Lower-Saxony said the sprouts were delivered, either directly or 
              through wholesalers, to restaurants in Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, 
              Mecklenburg-Pomerania, Hessen and Lower-Saxony itself.<br><br>Further test results will be announced on Monday.<br><br>The European Commission meanwhile said it was not formally notified of the development.<br><br>"The
               German authorities simply said on Sunday they were going to circulate 
              the information about their suspicions surrounding a sprout-producing 
              firm on the rapid alert system system for food (RASFF)," said spokesman 
              Federic Vincent, who deals with health <br>affairs.<br><br>German Health
               Minister Daniel Bahr, who on Sunday visited Hamburg's Eppendorf 
              University clinic where many of the region's EHEC patients are being 
              treated, has warned that the source of infection could still be active.<br><br>"Food
               health officials are working around the clock to identify the source of
               the infection," Bahr told the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper on Saturday.<br><br>"But from earlier outbreaks, we know that we can't always identify the source.<br><br>"It
               can't be ruled out that the source of infection is still active," he 
              added, pointing to the need for continued vigilance as authorities still
               counsel against eating raw tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers.<br><br>Speaking
               to Bild am Sonntag, Bahr said also the situation in a number of north 
              German hospitals, especially Hamburg and Bremen, was "difficult" because
               of the high number of admissions, adding that other hospitals would be 
              called upon to help.<br><br>Cases of E. coli poisoning have also been 
              reported in more than 12 other  countries, including Austria, Britain, 
              the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, 
              Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. Each was related to German 
              travel.<br><br>Several German scientists on Sunday suggested the outbreak could be linked to bacteria found in biogas plants.<br><br>Biogas,
               or methane, is produced by the anaerobic digestion or fermentation of 
              biodegradable materials such as manure, sewage and green waste.<br><br>"There
               are all sorts of bacteria which didn't exist before which are now 
              produced in biogas fermentation tanks," Bernt Schottdorf, a medical 
              analyst, told Welt am Sonntag newspaper.<br><br>"They crossbreed and mix
               with one another - what goes on precisely hasn't really been studied," 
              he said, adding that 80 percent of the production waste finds its way 
              back onto fields as fertiliser.<br><br>Ernst Guenther Hellwig, head of 
              the veterinary and agriculture academy in Horstmar-Leer, said that 
              because it had rained very little in the spring it was possible such 
              fertilisers had not been washed off growing plants.<br><br>"Dangerous bacteria could be brought onto the fields this way and could contaminate vegetables," he said.<br><br>The
               WHO has identified the bacteria as a rare E. coli strain never before 
              connected to an outbreak of food poisoning. It is said to be extremely 
              aggressive and resistant to antibiotics.<br><br>The ECDC reported 1,605 
              cases of EHEC infection and 658 cases of the associated condition 
              haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) on Sunday.<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Killer bacteria source remains elusive</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>BERLIN: The source of a killer bacteria remained elusive on 
              Monday after Germany announced that initial tests on suspected organic 
              sprouts had proved negative, while the outbreak's death toll grew to 23.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The probes were 
              carried out on a farm in the northern state of Lower Saxony after 
              regional agriculture minister Gerd Lindermann said a link had been found
               to the main areas hit by the E. coli outbreak.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Results available 
              from 23 of the 40 samples of seeds, water, ventilation and work surfaces
               tested indicated they were free of the bacteria responsible for 23 
              deaths and more than 2,000 people falling ill, the state's agriculture 
              ministry said.<br><br>"Investigations are continuing," the ministry said, adding that it did not expect "any short-term conclusions".<br><br>Federal
               Agriculture Minister Ilse Aigner said Germany would maintain warnings 
              against eating sprouts as well as tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers, 
              particularly in the north of the country, until the origin had been 
              pinpointed.<br><br>But Andreas Hensel, head of the Federal Institute for
               Risk Assessment, said that "it is possible we shall never be able to 
              identify the source" of the contamination.<br><br>Aigner said investigations were continuing with checks on vegetable supply chains and producers up and down the country. <br><br>She
               was to travel to Luxembourg on Tuesday to attend an emergency meeting 
              of European Union agriculture ministers which is to discuss aid for 
              farmers who are unable to sell their vegetables because of growing 
              consumer fears.<br><br>At the meeting, EU health ministers will review 
              the bloc's food safety alert system to ensure that warnings have 
              "scientific basis and proof" before becoming public, according to EU 
              health commissioner John Dalli.<br><br>Dalli said the alert system 
              review was requested by Spain, where farmers were hit hard by inaccurate
               warnings that the outbreak might be linked to Spanish organic 
              cucumbers.<br><br>Klaus Verbeck, who runs the farm in Bienenbuettel, 
              some 80 kilometres south of Hamburg, told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung 
              he uses no fertilisers for growing a variety of sprouts and had no idea 
              how they might have been contaminated.<br><br>His farm, which produces 
              sprouts for lettuce, azuki beans, mung beans, fenugreek, alfalfa and 
              lentils and receives seed deliveries from several countries, has been 
              ordered closed and all products recalled, authorities said.<br><br>"Salad
               sprouts are grown from seeds and water. They aren't fertilised. And 
              there aren't any fertilisers used elsewhere on the farm," Verbeck said, 
              alluding to the fact the E. coli bacteria may originally have come from 
              animal droppings.<br><br>The Spanish government had sharply criticised 
              Germany after officials in Hamburg, the epicentre of the scare, warned 
              the outbreak might be linked to organic cucumbers imported from Spain 
              before retracting their statement.<br><br>Similar outbreaks in Japan 
              between 1996 and 2003 infected more than 10,000 people and left 22 dead,
               according to the Japanese health ministry.<br><br>Japan suspected that 
              radish sprouts were to blame, but they found no conclusive evidence and 
              farmers later successfully sued for compensation.<br><br>The present 
              outbreak, which has hit at least 14 countries, including the United 
              States, has left at least 23 people dead, according to figures compiled 
              by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and German 
              regional authorities. <br><br>Twenty-two died in Germany and one in Sweden - a woman who had visited Germany.<br><br>In
               Germany, 1,601 patients have been diagnosed with EHEC and a further 630
               with haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening condition 
              involving kidney malfunction, the Robert Koch Institute said.<br><br>The
               EHEC rate of infection grew from no more than nine a day during the 
              first 10 days in May, to finally reach a peak of 122 on May 23 and has 
              since slowed, the institute said.<br><br>The opposition Green party strongly criticised Chancellor Angela Merkel's government for its handling of the crisis.<br><br>"There
               is no crisis management. I really ask myself what the health minister 
              and the consumer affairs minister are doing," said senior party official
               Renate Kuenast.<br><br>She went on to call for "national control 
              measures" in a country where responsibility for public health matters is
               split between the federal government and authorities in each of the 16 
              states.<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Thailand finds E. coli in European cabbage</h1>
              <p>BANGKOK - THAILAND said on Saturday that it had detected E. coli in 
              cabbage imported from Europe and was checking whether it was the lethal 
              strain involved in a killer outbreak in northern Germany.</p>
              <p>The country, which had a false alarm about a shipment of European 
              avocados earlier in the week, has urged the public not to panic, noting 
              that there are several types of E. coli.</p>
              <p>'We need three to five days to check on the bacteria's strain,' said 
              Sathaporn Wongcharoen, director general of the Medical Science 
              Department of the Public Health Ministry.</p>
              <p>On Friday Thailand said that E. coli found in avocados a day
               earlier was not the deadly strain that has swept Europe in recent 
              weeks.</p>
              <p>German officials have said they are now confident that 
              sprouts grown at a farm in the north of the country are the source of 
              the highly virulent strain of bacteria that has killed at least 33 and 
              left some 3,000 ill.</p>
              <p>All confirmed fatalities, three of which were reported on 
              Friday, have been in Germany except for one woman who died in Sweden 
              after visiting Germany.</p>
