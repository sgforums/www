              <p>PROMINENT paraplegic athlete William Tan Kian Meng claimed that a woman who is suing him for some $400,000 had given him more than half of that, not lent it to him, as they had been in an 'intimate relationship'.</p>
              <p>Details about Dr Tan's relationship with Dr Stephanie Chee Jok Heng, 51, emerged in court when his lawyer cross-examined the woman on the first day of the hearing into her lawsuit.</p>
              <p>They had even gone on trysts to hotels, claimed Dr Tan. But Dr Chee, a divorcee with three daughters, flatly denied allegations that they had been lovers and insisted that the two had merely had a 'Christian platonic kind of relationship'.</p>

              <p><strong>Paraplegic Dr Tan says money given to him were "love gifts"</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Day two of the court case involving well-known 
              paraplegic Dr William Tan saw him insisting that the sums of money given
               to him by Dr Stephanie Chee were "love gifts" when they were still 
              together. </span></p>
              <p><span>In the High Court on Tuesday, Dr Tan said he and Dr Chee were in a
               romantic relationship between 2000 and 2006.
              <br> <br> Dr Chee is suing Dr Tan for S$259,800 in financial help given to him 
              between 1999 and 2005.
              <br> <br> She is also suing for another S$149,800 for losses suffered from the 
              sale of a property linked to Dr Tan, which she had held in trust and as a
               nominee for Dr Tan.
              <br> <br> In turn, Dr Tan said Dr Chee owes him S$279,900 - money he had lent her 
              to buy a property.

              <p><strong>William Tan says he hid romantic relationship from Chee's daughters</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The High Court case involving prominent paraplegic 
              athlete William Tan and the woman who is suing him for some S$400,000 
              wrapped up on Wednesday with more relevations about the nature of their 
              relationship. </span></p>
              <p><span>Dr Tan told the court on the last day of the hearing that Dr 
              Stephanie Chee had never asked for the money to be re-paid.
              <br> <br> The 53-year-old claimed that although they were in a romantic 
              relationship, he had to tell Dr Chee's daughters that they were just 
              friends.
              <br> <br> He also told the court that one of Dr Chee's daughters had knocked on 
              the door when she heard "noises" while they were intimate in the bedroom
               on one occasion. Dr Tan explained that her mother was helping him with 
              his leg braces.
              <br> <br> On the last day of the hearing of his suit with Dr Chee, Dr Tan said he 
              took loans from a friend to speculate on property and earn money so that
               he could fulfil Dr Chee's wish of living in a bungalow.
              <br> <br> The borrowing was "out of the ordinary" as he is "not a person who jumps
               to borrow money from people", said Dr Tan. But he "stepped up and went 
              out in search for the funding" because he wanted to build a future with 
              Dr Chee.
              <br> <br> "I've had many relationships, unfortunately they never last. So I 
              treasure this relationship very much," said Dr Tan. 
              <br> <br> He said he had tried to reconcile his differences with Dr Chee after he 
              received a writ of summons from her lawyers last year, but the two could
               not come to an agreement. 
              <br> <br> Dr Chee is suing Dr Tan for S$259,800 in financial help that she 
              extended to him from 1999 and 2005. 
              <br> <br> She is also claiming another S$149,800 for the losses she suffered from 
              purchasing and selling a unit at One Tree Lodge which she held in trust 
              and as a nominee for Dr Tan. 
              <br> <br> Dr Tan is in turn filing counterclaims and said that the money was a 
              love gift from Dr Chee.
              <br> <br> Asked by Justice Tay Yong Kwang why he did not return the money to Dr 
              Chee after her lawyers sent him a letter of demand in 2008 to return 
              S$433,000, Dr Tan said he had asked them for a breakdown of the sum but 
              had never heard from Dr Chee again until he was served with a writ of 
              summons.
              <br> <br> Dr Tan also said he had broken up with Dr Chee in 2006 because of "many"
               disagreements. She was being investigated by the police in mid-2006 for
               fraudulent offences and both of them had different ideas on how she 
              should have handled the matter, said Dr Tan. 
              <br> <br> Dr Chee has denied that the two were romantically linked and claimed 
              that their relationship soured because of Dr Tan's "poor" work 
              performance in a charity that they were both working in. 
              <br> <br> Dr Tan said: "I still have the gratitude to Dr Chee for all the 
              tremendous help given to me. I've never ever met a person who has been 
              so consistently kind to me, consistently helping me. (For) who I am 
              today, I'm very grateful to Dr Chee for what she has done for me.
              <br> <br> "All this while, I've always wanted to be a gentleman. Whatever is owed,
               I'll pay back. But the understanding that Dr Chee has given me is I 
              need not have to pay, that it's all right and we are one family."
              <br> <br> Judgement will be handed down at a later date.
