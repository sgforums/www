              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority (AVA) has 
              urged consumers to complement the government's efforts and support the 
              local farming industry by buying local produce.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>AVA's CEO Tan Poh 
              Hong said support from consumers for local produce, such as eggs, will 
              help spur local farms to increase their production to meet bigger 
              demand. This she said will in turn ensure the sustainability of local 
              farms.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>AVA said consumers 
              are assured of the quality and freshness of local produce, a result of 
              the stringent production and quality control procedures local farms 
              adhere to, as well as the short delivery time from farm to retail 
              outlets.<br><br>Ms Tan said: "While we have been looking at the supply 
              side, helping farmers to increase their productivity through technology 
              and extension services and so, we feel that it is also important to get 
              our consumers to support the local produce as well."<br><br>About 23 per
               cent of eggs consumed in Singapore are produced locally and AVA's aim 
              is to increase that to 30 per cent. AVA said local production is an 
              important secondary strategy in ensuring food supply resilience for 
              Singapore.<br><br>To this end, the government will continue to promote 
              local farming, with the aim to raise self-sufficiency levels for eggs, 
              fish and leafy vegetables to 30 per cent, 15 per cent and 10 per cent 
              respectively.<br><br>The quality of eggs produced by local chicken layer farms is assured under AVA's Singapore Quality Egg Scheme (SQES).<br><br>This
               voluntary quality assurance scheme was first introduced in 1999. All 
              three local chicken layer farms are currently registered under this 
              scheme. <br><br>Under SQES, local poultry layer farms are required to 
              ensure that their facilities are hygienic and quality control monitoring
               systems are well maintained at all times.<br><br>The eggs produced 
              undergo monthly inspection and freshness tests by AVA to verify their 
              quality. The date of production and farm code are also stamped on every 
              egg to ensure traceability.<br><br>AVA, which has recently revised the 
              Singapore Quality Egg Scheme logo to increase its visibility and 
              highlight the quality of local eggs, is urging customers to look out for
               the logo. And it seems to be working, with retail outlets here saying 
              the revised logo has helped.<br><br>Mui-Kok Kah Wei, Purchasing and 
              Merchandising Director with NTUC FairPrice, said: "Our local household 
              consumers who shop in supermarkets have a very high acceptance for local
               eggs, and they value the quality and the safety assurance from AVA and 
              they value the freshness as well, and probably they put a lot of premium
               on it being produced by local producers."<br><br>Currently about 45 per
               cent of eggs at NTUC FairPrice, are locally sourced, and the 
              supermarket giant is hoping to increase this. However, FairPrice said it
               would still offer eggs from other sources to diversify and to ensure 
              stability of supplies.<br><br>Ms Mui-Kok said: "We would always like to 
              support our local producers and if consumers accept these eggs, and the 
              local suppliers can cope with it, we certainly hope to increase the 
              supply.<br><br>"But having said that, we are in line with our 
              diversification strategies to ensure stability of supplies, we would 
              still want to balance the sources of supply for eggs."<br><br>Suppliers here are also stepping up production, with the help of AVA's S$10 million Food Farm grant last year.<br><br>Local chicken farm Seng Choon Farm said it has increased egg production from 300,000 to 400,000 since the grant.<br><br>Koh
               Yeow Koon, MD of Seng Choon Farm, said: "For local eggs, because the 
              production is in Singapore, so definitely its faster to get to the 
              market, so in terms of freshness, its definitely a very fresh egg. With 
              freshness and quality, I think it is a good choice for consumers to pick
               eggs from Singapore."<br><br>- CNA/cc/ac</span></span></p>
