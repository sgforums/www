              <p><strong>Has Wellness Village Spa left its customers in the lurch?</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>SINGAPORE: For over four years, it
              operated at the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel. But over the course of a
              day, the Wellness Village Spa left customers and the hotel in the lurch
              when it suddenly shut down, disconnecting its phone lines.</p>
              <p>At
              its Pagoda Street outlet in Chinatown, the premises were empty, with
              the doors wide open when MediaCorp visited on Monday. Neighbouring shop
              owners said they saw movers shifting equipment and furniture on Sunday
              afternoon. In the quiet of the night, the same scene was seemingly
              repeated at the Pan Pacific outlet.</p>
              <p>A nearby shop owner said
              the spa began retrenching workers last month. He noticed remaining
              staff packing up late last week, and believes that customers were told
              it was "fully booked" to keep them from coming down.</p>
              <p>This was certainly the experience for one customer.</p>
              <p>Ms Elaine Ong had been trying to make an appointment, but the spa kept telling her that it was fully booked.</p>
              <p>The
              "first hint of trouble" came last Thursday when she called the Pan
              Pacific outlet and an employee told her only two therapists were being
              employed, said Ms Ong who is in her 30s.</p>
              <p>As she has recently signed up for a $600 package, Ms Ong said she was a "bit alarmed".</p>
              <p>At
              Pan Pacific on Monday, a hotel employee told guests the spa had closed
              without informing anyone. Dutch businessman Laros, 39, who had been
              peering through the spa’s glass door, said the hotel’s reception
              pointed him to the spa for a massage when he checked in.</p>
              <p>The hotel told MediaCorp the spa "leases and operates the premises independently".</p>
              <p>It
              "sincerely regrets any inconvenience experienced" and is now
              re—directing guests to nearby spa facilities. It will "continue to
              attempt" to contact Wellness Village Spa, it added.</p>
              <p>Checks
              with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority showed that
              Wellness Village was incoporated in June 2004 and is still a "live
              company". Permanent resident Lia Meyrina is listed as its director.
              MediaCorp could not reach the company.</p>
              <p>Wellness Village Spa
              and Fitness, a limited liability partnership with Ms Lia and a Mr
              Christopher Tan Khee Howe listed as partners, was struck off in
              September. It was registered in 2007.</p>
              <p>Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) executive director Seah Seng Choon was "not surprised" by the spa’s actions.</p>
              <p>"Don’t
              be fooled by the location. Spas are generally small businesses, unless
              they have an international chain ... Consumers have to be careful when
              transacting with them," said Mr Seah.</p>
              <p>Since last year, CASE
              has received five complaints, including unsatisfactory services and
              difficulty in scheduling sessions, against Wellness Village. Four were
              made this year, with the latest complaint in October. CASE is trying to
              contact the company.</p>

              <p><strong>Wellness Village spa closure: Who'll foot those credit card bills now?</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Who foots the bill for credit card payments – the bank
              or cardholders – when a service provider makes a sudden disappearance? </span></p>
              <p><span>The question is being asked after the shutdown of spa operator Wellness Village, which was reported in TODAY on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> One customer was told by a former employee that the spa was still
              selling packages, some as costly as $10,000, up to the weekend before
              it closed down.
              <br> <br> The four-year-old spa is also believed to have up to 7,000 customers and they are wondering about their credit card liability.
              <br> <br>"I'm still paying off my instalment plan I paid with my credit
              card," said a customer who only wanted to be identified as Ms Tan. "Now
              that this has happened, will the bank take some liability?"
              <br> <br>When contacted, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) said
              the credit-issuing bank has already paid for the customers' purchases
              and the amount needs to be settled. <br> <br> ABS said customers should take their grievances to the spa owner.
              Credit card holders can choose to pay in full or by instalments at some
              establishments.
              <br> <br>"Regardless, the bank has a contractual obligation to pay the
              merchant in full once the charge slip is signed," UOB regional and
              Singapore head for cards and payment products Gan Ai Im also told
              MediaCorp.
              <br> <br> "The card member, on the other hand, is obliged to make full settlement of all charges incurred on the card to the bank."
              <br> <br> Wellness Village customers can call their card-issuing banks, however, to investigate or dispute the charges.
              <br> <br>Said Citi Singapore vice-president of corporate affairs Caren Lee:
              "We understand the concerns of the customers and empathise with them in
              this situation."
              <br> <br>"To support the investigation, the customer will need to provide
              supporting documents, including the purchase agreement with the
              merchant."
              <br> <br>Consumers Association of Singapore executive director Seah Seng
              Choon said it has received 138 complaints from former customers since
              the spa's closure made headlines.
              <br> <br>He said the "first thing the consumer needs to do is to file a
              claim against the business at the Small Claims Tribunal" to obtain an
              order demanding the business pays whatever amount is awarded.
              <br> <br>This applies to firms that are still "live", such as Wellness
              Village, as indicated by checks with the Accounting and Corporate
              Regulatory Authority.
              <br> <br>If the amount is not settled, the consumer can make a writ of
              seizure or other legal action, said Mr Seah. But that could cost more
              than the amount some customers would forfeit.
              <br> <br>Lawyer Doris Chia from David Lim &amp; Partners pointed to another
              alternative: For customers to "band together" and wind up the company.
              An official receiver will then look into the accounts and affairs of
              the company to see if money can be clawed back.
              <br> <br>Consumers can also file a police complaint. "If directors of the
              company continued to trade or accept more payments for packages even
              though they know there was no chance the company will be able to honour
              the packages, this ... may render the directors personally liable,"
              said Ms Chia.

              <p><strong>Customers of Wellness Village and Simply Spa get help </strong></p>
              <p>Atos Wellness Group has offered to take in customers of Wellness
              Village and Simply Spa who were left in the lurch after the sudden
              closure of the two spas. <br> <br> Atos's founder and CEO Ananda Rajah said, it's also working with other
              spa companies to take over the unused treatments of the affected
              clients as a matter of goodwill. <br> <br> Over 500 customers who had paid upfront for spa and wellness services
              were affected when Wellness Village and Simply Spa got into trouble. <br> <br> Now, they will be able to use up their unutilised treatments at no extra costs, thanks to a deal done by Atos Wellness Group. <br> <br> Atos is also working with four other spa companies, Sutle Senses,
              Beyond Beauty, Beauty Express and Rustic Nirvana to help these
              customers. <br> <br> Ananda Rajah is the CEO of Atos Wellness Group.<br> <br> "I had some discussions with the owners of other spa companies and we
              all felt that having these two companies close down actually give a
              very negative image to the whole industry and by doing this we are
              giving confidence now for the end users that the spa industry is a safe
              place for them to come and spend their money." <br> <br> Mr Ananda added his company felt obliged to step in and bolster confidence in the spa industry. <br> <br> The move came as good news for many former Wellness Village customers,
              including Nellie Chan who still has about 2000 dollars worth of unused
              treatment.<br> <br> "I'm very pleased to receive such good news, because it's like a
              Christmas gift, and at the same time it's because at the moment I have
              not really gone into which spa saloon I actually want to sign on to.
              So, I will be interested to really sit down, meet up with them and
              discuss what are the things they can offer to us." <br> <br> Going forward, Atos Wellness Group is thinking of setting up an
              association to help customers affected by closure of spa companies. <br> <br> "We are actually going to discuss with Case about the possibility of
              setting up an association of spa companies that they can actually look
              into helping out any of the clients in future that may sign up packages
              in spa companies which for some reason or another are not able to carry
              on." <br> <br> Executive Director of Consumers Association of Singapore, Seah Seng Choon welcomes the move.<br> <br> "The proposal to set up an association to look into that is certainly
              something worth looking at. If the industry players want to work with
              Case on putting in measures to protect the interests of consumers, we
              certainly welcome them." <br> <br> Atos Wellness Group hopes to set up the association by the end of January next year.</p>
