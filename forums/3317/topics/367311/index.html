              <p>PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia, July 8 - Malaysia is to abandon teaching maths
              and science in English, saying that far too many children from poor
              rural areas were being failed by the programme.</p>
              <p>The decision to
              start phasing out English medium teaching from 2012 has been backed by
              the government and Malaysia's main opposition parties, despite concerns
              that using the national language, Bahasa Malaysia, will undermine
              competitiveness.</p>
              <p>Malaysia has said recently that it wants to
              attract more high-value investment in areas like banking and finance,
              industries that are global and typically demand good English.
              [ID:nKLR467124]</p>
              <p>Instead of teaching maths and science in English,
              a policy started in 2003, the government will double the time spent on
              English lessons for primary children and increase that for secondary
              school children by half.</p>
              <p>It said it would hire an additional 14,000 teachers to teach English as a language.</p>
              <p>"I
              would not say it was a complete failure, but it did not achieve what it
              was supposed to achieve," Education Minister Muhyiddin Yassin told a
              news conference on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>A recent report from Morgan Stanley
              showed that Malaysia's tertiary enrolment and completion ratios were
              six and seven percentage points behind the average countries with a
              similar level of income per capita.</p>
              <p>That leaves it at a
              disadvantage as it seeks to tap into foreign investment which is
              increasingly using countries like China and Vietnam which have larger
              domestic markets and bigger reservoirs of cheap labour.</p>
              <p>Neighbouring
              Singapore split from becoming part of Malaysia and retained English as
              the primary language of education. The city state has emerged as one of
              the richest nations on earth with a per capita income of $51,649 in
              2008 while Malaysia's is $14,225, based on 2008 data.</p>
              <p>Critics
              said that the changes to use Bahasa Malaysia would not achieve the
              desired effect of enfranchising the rural poor or of boosting English
              language skills and said the move was largely political, aimed at
              appeasing the Malay majority.</p>
              <p>"What has not occurred to the
              authorities is that the education system requires very competent
              teachers," said Khoo Kay Kim, emeritus professor at the University of
              Malaya's history department, adding that politicians were driving the
              change due to their personal agenda.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Prime Minister
              Najib Razak was educated in an English-medium school in Kuala Lumpur
              and later in a private school in England, while opposition leader Anwar
              Ibrahim, was educated at the elite English-speaking Malay College.</p>
              <p>Khoo
              also warned that the move could increase divisions along racial lines
              in this country of 27 million people where 55 percent are ethnic Malays
              and there are sizeable ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities.</p>
              <p>"There is an emphasis on separation, not integration, today," Khoo said.</p>

              hmmm.. i don't mean those really 'terok' kind of english. i mean average kind of english. it may sound grammatically-incorrect but the meaning is still there and you managed to put it across to others. 
              
              so that means, you don't need to have really gd english. just a fairly average standard. yes, no?

              <p>it really wasnt a feasible plan from the start...the schools don't even teach english properly , passing english is not even a requirement at their SPM and they expect to use it as a medium for understanding concepts?</p>
              <p>i also dont get it why the education leaders do not just want to use Malay as a medium for teaching...it is firstly their national language, and also, if other people from china or europe or the middle east can teach math and science in the native language and be progressive at the same time, why can't the malay language make it too?</p>
