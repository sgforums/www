              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A Singapore Airlines (SIA) cabin crew member was 
              arrested last Sunday at Sydney International Airport after he allegedly 
              tried to bring in 1.6kg of heroin.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Nicholas Tan Ngat Liang, 50, was a leading steward who was believed to be on duty during the flight from Singapore to Sydney.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In response to 
              TODAY's queries, a spokesperson from the Australian Federal Police 
              confirmed that a 50-year-old Singaporean was arrested on Sunday and has 
              been charged with "importing a commercial quantity of a border 
              controlled drug, namely heroin". "The man was arrested for attempting to
               import 1.6kg of heroin into Australia," the spokesperson said.<br><br>In
               Australia, the offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment 
              and/or an A$825,000 fine (S$1.1 million). Tan's case was first mentioned
               in a New South Wales court on Monday.<br><br>Responding to TODAY's 
              queries, SIA spokesman Nicholas Ionides said: "We can confirm that a 
              member of our cabin crew was detained recently in Sydney by the police. 
              As it is a police matter, it would not be appropriate for us to provide 
              further comment."<br><br>A spokesperson from Singapore's Ministry of 
              Foreign Affairs said that the ministry has so far not received any 
              request to extend its assistance on the matter.<br><br>When this 
              reporter visited Tan's condo in Simei on Friday, a man and a woman who 
              answered the door declined to comment, saying that it was "not the right
               time".<br><br>The Singapore Police Force said that cabin crew members 
              and pilots are "subjected to the same level of checks as departing 
              passengers prior to boarding the aircraft". It added: "The authorities 
              conduct screening on persons and their hand-carry baggage. Checked 
              baggage is also subjected to screening upon check-in at the departure 
              hall."<br><br>An SIA flight steward, who wanted to be known only as Mr 
              Lim, said that at Sydney International Airport, random checks - which 
              occur about "50 per cent of the time" - are conducted on cabin crew 
              after their flights touch down.<br><br>According to the Australian Federal Police website, there were 332 seizures involving heroin between 2009 and May 31, 2010.<br><br>There
               have been previous reported cases of Singaporeans who were caught in 
              Australia's airports for trying to bring in drugs. In August 2009, a 
              Singaporean man was sentenced to a jail term of 11 years and three 
              months for importing 4.3kg of heroin from Kuala Lumpur. The drug was 
              concealed in food items. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com">TODAY</a></span></p>
