              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">DAMASCUS:
                      The Syrian regime is not bound by a deadline to withdraw its troops
                      from strife-torn areas, pro-government daily Al-Watan on Thursday
                      quoted a government official as saying.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">"There
                      is no set date or deadline," the unnamed official said.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">"April
                      10 is the date set for the beginning, not the end, of the withdrawal
                      of troops and it does not constitute a deadline."</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The
                      United Nations had announced earlier this week that Damascus agreed
                      to complete the withdrawal of regime forces from populated centres by
                      April 10, in accordance with a peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League
                      envoy Kofi Annan.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">But activists
                      on the ground and monitors say the regime of President Bashar
                      al-Assad was clearly not honouring the accord given the continued
                      troop deployments and violence across the country.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The
                      official quoted by Al-Watan said the Syrian foreign ministry had
                      linked the troop withdrawal to a commitment by rebels to also honour
                      Annan's six-point peace plan, aimed at ending one year of violence
                      that has left more than 9,000 people dead, according to the United
                      Nations.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Annan's spokesman said
                      on Thursday that the former UN chief expects both the Syrian
                      government and the opposition to fully implement the ceasefire
                      agreement by April 12.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">"What
                      we expect on April 10 is that the Syrian government will have
                      completed its withdrawal from populated centres ... and then we begin
                      a 48-hour period during which there will be a complete cessation of
                      all forms of violence by all parties," Ahmad Fawzi told
                      reporters in Geneva.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">"So the
                      clock starts ticking on the 10th on both sides to cease all forms of
                      violence," he added.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">The
                      Syrian regime has told Annan that it has begun withdrawing troops
                      from some parts of the country, said Fawzi, adding that "we are
                      in the process of verification."</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">An
                      advance team dispatched by Annan to pave the way for peacekeepers is
                      expected to arrive in Damascus on Thursday.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">They
                      will "begin discussing with the Syrian authorities the
                      modalities of the eventual deployment of this UN supervision and
                      monitoring mission," said Fawzi.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">-

                      A UN team sent by peace broker Kofi Annan arrived in Syria on
                      Thursday to pave the way for observers, as the Security Council
                      backed an April 10 deadline for the regime to end its deadly
                      crackdown.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.48cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
                      developments occurred as Annan said the Syrian government had
                      announced a partial withdrawal from protest cities, but that this had
                      not been confirmed and that "alarming levels" of deaths
                      were still being reported.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
                      Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was no sign of
                      withdrawals, with regime forces launching fresh assaults on rebel
                      strongholds, and that 38 people were killed nationwide, among them 17
                      civilians.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
                      advance UN team headed by Norwegian General Robert Mood, a Middle
                      East specialist, will discuss with the authorities "the
                      modalities of the eventual deployment of the UN supervising mission,"
                      Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Annan
                      told the Security Council on Monday it should consider whether to
                      send a mission to monitor events in Syria, where activists say more
                      than 10,000 people have been killed since March 2011 in the crackdown
                      on dissent.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Fawzi
                      said the observers can be sent only after a Security Council
                      resolution ordering their deployment.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
                      council formally backed the April 10 deadline that former UN chief
                      Annan agreed with Damascus to end its military offensive on protest
                      cities.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A
                      statement called on Damascus to "begin pullback of military
                      concentrations in and around population centres, and to fulfil these
                      in their entirety by no later than April 10, 2012."</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It
                      also called "upon all parties, including the opposition, to
                      cease armed violence in all its forms" within 48 hours of the
                      above being implemented.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In
                      remarks to the UN General Assembly, Annan urged the "government
                      and the opposition commanders to issue clear instructions so that the
                      message reaches across the country down to the fighter and soldier at
                      the local level.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"It
                      is clear that more far-reaching action is urgently required.
                      Immediate and verifiable steps are needed to complete implementation
                      of commitments in the crucial days ahead," he said.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"We
                      must silence the tanks, helicopters, mortars, guns and stop all other
                      forms of violence too: sexual abuse, torture, executions, abductions,
                      destruction of homes, forced displacement and other abuses including
                      on children."</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Annan
                      said opposition groups his team had spoken to had "committed to
                      call for cessation of violence once the Syrian government has
                      demonstrably fulfilled its commitments."</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Annan
                      spokesman Fawzi said in Geneva that "what we expect on April 10
                      is that the Syrian government will have completed its withdrawal from
                      populated centres... and then we begin a 48-hour period during which
                      there will be a complete cessation of all forms of violence by all
                      parties.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"So
                      the clock starts ticking on the 10th on both sides to cease all forms
                      of violence."</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Yet
                      pro-government daily Al-Watan quoted an unnamed government official
                      as saying Damascus is not bound by a deadline.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"April
                      10 is the date set for the beginning, not the end, of the withdrawal
                      of troops and it does not constitute a deadline," it said.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On
                      the ground, the Observatory said plumes of smoke could be seen near
                      the main mosque in Douma just outside Damascus as troop
                      reinforcements were sent in.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Two
                      young men were killed in Kfar Sousa, a neighbourhood of Damascus,
                      when security forces opened fire on their car, it said.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">And
                      two children were among four civilians killed in bombardment of the
                      rebel town of Rastan in central Homs province.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In
                      the city of Homs, eight regime forces were killed and dozens wounded,
                      and at least eight people killed in fighting in Idlib province along
                      with at least six regime forces, the Observatory said.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">French
                      Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said he had little confidence Annan's
                      plan would end the repression.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"Can
                      we be optimistic? I'm not," Juppe told reporters in Paris.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"I
                      think Bashar Al-Assad is cheating us. He is pretending to accept Kofi
                      Annan's six-point peace plan but at the same time he continues to use
                      force."</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Russian
                      Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the West against issuing
                      ultimatums to Damascus.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"The
                      Syrian government has accepted (Annan's) proposals, has begun
                      implementing them, and it is very important right now not to
                      undermine this process through ultimatums and threats and
                      unfortunately there are those who'd like to do that," he
                      said.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
                      foreign ministry said Lavrov told Annan by telephone that Moscow
                      backed Thursday's Security Council statement with the understanding
                      that a second deadline for the opposition to lay down weapons would
                      also be imposed.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
                      surge in violence has sent Syrians fleeing, with an official in
                      Ankara saying more than 1,000 people had crossed the border in the
                      past 24 hours, bringing to nearly 21,000 the number of Syrian
                      refugees now in Turkey.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br><br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Meanwhile,
                      Syria has agreed to provide access to detention facilities throughout
