              <p>A TECHNICAL glitch in DBS' banking system caused a breakdown in its 
              online banking services and much public confusion on Monday morning as 
              thousands of users could not access the systems and draw money from DBS 
              and POSBank ATMs islandwide.</p>
              <p>The breakdown was reported as early as 6.30 am.</p>
              <p>DBS has apologised to the public on its website for the inconvenience
               caused, and a spokesman said that teams from the DBS responded 
              immediately to rectify the problem.</p>
              <p>Since 10am, DBS banking systems have resumed normal service, said a 
              DBS spokesman, but not before many frustrated customers vented their 
              anger online, some complaining that they visited as many as five 
              different ATMs but were left cashless and unable to top up their cash 
              cards to pay for ERP.</p>
              <p>At 10.30 am, DBS posted a statement on their website apologising for 
              the service outage, saying: 'We are pleased to inform you that all our 
              DBS, POSB and Treasures branches are now up and operational. The ATMs 
              are also available progressively. We are working on restoring other 
              services such as our internet and mobile banking as well as the credit 
              card services. Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.'</p>
              <p>Affected customers took to social media sites like Facebook and 
              Twitter to vent their frustrations on how the disruption affected their 
              routine. Said Kenneth Ip on Facebook, 'The whole darned DBS network is 
              down. Including their credit cards and ATMS. I almost get stuck at the 
              gas station!!!'</p>

              <p><strong>DBS takes 'pro-active' steps</strong></p>
              <p>DBS Bank said it it took 'pro-active measures' to minimise disruption
               to customers 'who needed cash urgently' while its banking systems were 
              down on Monday morning due to technical glitches.</p>
              <p>All its online banking services ground to a halt at its branches, and
               its island-wide ATMs - for both DBS and POSBank transactions - also 
              crashed, sparking much anger and frustration among users who could not 
              withdraw money in a jiffy.</p>
              <p>Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a DBS spokesman said 
              the bank honoured all cash cheques of $500 and below and also allowed 
              urgent over-the- counter cash withdrawals. Additional staff were also 
              sent to various branches. The bank also increased staffing levels at its
               call centre to handle customer queries.</p>
              <p>'Banking services for DBS and POSB in Singapore were temporarily 
              affected early this morning due to technical difficulties,' said a 
              statement from DBS.</p>
              <p>'As of 10am, all DBS/POSB ATMs and branch services have been 
              restored. Customers are assured that all funds are safe and the Bank is 
              working to restore all other services as soon as possible'.</p>
              <p>Scores of frustrated and irate DBS and POSB customers took to the 
              social media to vent their anger, some complaining that they visited as 
              many as five different ATMs but were left cashless and unable to top up 
              their cash cards to pay for ERP.</p>

              <p><strong>DBS rules out sabotage</strong></p>
              <p>DBS has ruled out sabotage in its largest ever system breakdown on 
              Monday, which crippled its entire consumer banking services for at least
               seven hours.</p>
              <p>Neither were external parties involved, DBS chief executive Piyush 
              Gupta told reporters at an event on Monday night, hours after normal 
              services were restored.</p>
              <p>A full-scale investigation is underway to find out why the 
              bank's back-up system failed when it was hit by an outage which was 
              detected at about 3am on Monday.</p>
              <p>'We are now doing thorough investigations with our vendor 
              IBM... I don't think there is any sabotage. there has been no loss of 
              customer data...no loss of records,' said Mr Gupta.</p>
              <p>Added Mr David Gledhill, DBS head of Group Technology and 
              Operations: 'The bank has multiple levels of redundancy to protect 
              against such occurrences and this is the first time a problem of this 
              nature has occurred.</p>
              <p>'We deeply regret the inconvenience caused and once again 
              would like to assure our customers that DBS is continually reviewing and
               revising its resiliency and redundancy plans in line with developments 
              and advancements in technology.'</p>
              <p>The glitch hit the whole suite of DBS and POSB consumer 
              banking services, including branch offices, ATMs, credit cards, NETS, 
              AXS, Internet and mobile banking.</p>

              <p><strong>DBS chief says 'sorry'</strong></p>
              <p>DBS Bank apologised to customers yesterday after Monday's big systems
               crash that left customers and businesses in the lurch and in the dark 
              for about seven hours.</p>
              <p>Chief executive, Mr Piyush Gupta said: 'We are sorry for what 
              happened. We took numerous measures to minimise inconvenience caused by 
              the temporary disruption in services.</p>
              <p>'We have commenced a full scale investigation and I am treating this 
              matter with utmost priority.'</p>
              <p>Mr Gupta's comments come after Monday's massive network failure that 
              knocked out more than 1,000 ATMs..</p>
              <p>Irate customers could not access the bank's internet and mobile 
              banking facilities, while payments made on DBS debit and credit cards 
              could not be processed.</p>
              <p>To cope with the situation, DBS made arrangements to deploy 
              additional staff at branches and its call centre. Cheques were honoured 
              and urgent cash withdrawals up to $500 were permitted.</p>

              <p><strong>Islandwide ATM disruptions to DBS-POSB machines caused by systems

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Monday's islandwide DBS-POSB ATM disruptions were the 
              result of a systems outage said the bank's vendor IBM. </span></p>

              immediately to restore services. </span></p>
              <p><span> IBM added that it is committed to supporting DBS in continuing to 
              provide high quality services to its customers. </span></p>
              <p><span> Meanwhile a DBS spokesman told Channel News Asia that it is reviewing 
              and revising its resilience and redundancy plans. </span></p>
              <p><span> More than 1,000 ATM machines were down on Monday from as early as 3am 
              following the technical glitch. </span></p>
              <p><span> In its statement on Tuesday, DBS said that as of 10am on Monday, all 
              branch and ATM had resumed normal services. </span></p>

              <p><strong>DBS CEO writes to customers personally apologizing for last week's 
              service disruption</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: DBS Group CEO Piyush Gupta has written to DBS and POSB 
              customers, personally apologizing for the inconvenience caused by the 
              sudden disruption in banking and ATM services from 3 am to 10 am on July
               5. </span></p>
              <p><span> In a letter posted on the bank's website, he said customers have every 
              right to expect uninterrupted services 24/7, 365 days a year from the 
              banking group. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said he's sorry the group has failed them. </span></p>
              <p><span> The CEO said it was the first time DBS had experienced a system outage 
              and service disruption of such magnitude. </span></p>
              <p><span> Explaining what happened, Mr Gupta said the outage last week was 
              triggered during a routine repair job on a component within the disk 
              storage subsystem connected to the mainframe. </span></p>
              <p><span> A component replacement was scheduled for 3 am, a quiet period, which is
               standard operating procedure. </span></p>
              <p><span> Unfortunately, while IBM was conducting this routine replacement, a 
              procedural error inadvertently triggered a malfunction in the multiple 
              layers of systems redundancies which led to the outage. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Gupta said he's treating this matter with utmost priority and the 
              full scale investigation that was initiated last week is still underway. </span></p>
              <p><span> This investigation is being done with the support of IBM's labs in the 
              US and their engineering teams in Asia. </span></p>
              <p><span> So far, he said DBS understands from IBM that an outdated procedure was 
              used to carry out the repair. </span></p>
              <p><span> In short, a procedural error in what was to have been a routine 
              maintenance operation subsequently caused a complete system outage. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said DBS takes full responsibility for this incident and it's working
               closely with IBM to ensure that such lapses do not recur or cause such 
              significant impact. </span></p>
              <p><span> In fact, he said 12 months ago DBS commenced work on a major two- year 
              program to further strengthen the resiliency of our system and minimize 
              the risk of service disruptions. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Gupta also assured customers that all payments and transactions that 
              were scheduled to be made on July 5 were completed. </span></p>
              <p><span> On hindsight, he said DBS' internal escalation process could have been 
              more immediate. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Gupta said the bank could also have done more to mobilise broadcast 
              channels to inform customers of the disruption in services first thing 
              in the morning. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Gupta said there have been valuable lessons learned.  - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><strong>MAS concerned about DBS' service disruption on July 5</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore, MAS, has informed 
              DBS that it's seriously concerned with the disruption of the bank's 
              services last week on July 5. </span></p>
              <p><span> MAS has also instructed DBS to give a full account of the incident to 
              the public, including actions it will take to prevent future recurrence. </span></p>
              <p><span> It has noted DBS' explanation for the failure and will review its 
              investigation report on the incident. </span></p>
              <p><span> MAS said it will review the outcome of the bank's investigation and the 
              extent to which the bank has failed to meet the recommended standards 
              set out in the Internet Banking and Technology Risk Management 
              Guidelines before determining the appropriate regulatory action to be 
              taken. </span></p>
              <p><span> On the MAS website, one guideline listed is that banks, their service 
              providers and vendors who provide internet banking services, must ensure
               they have ample resources to deliver consistently reliable service - 
              one guideline which DBS may have breached. </span></p>
              <p><span> DBS Group CEO Piyush Gupta has written to customer, personally 
              apologising for the disruption. </span></p>
              <p><span> He also explained that the outage was triggered during a routine repair 
              job by IBM. An error had triggered a malfunction. </span></p>
              <p><span> A full scale investigation initiated last week is still underway. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said DBS understands from IBM that an outdated procedure was used to 
              carry out the repair work. </span></p>
              <p><span> IBM explained that a failure to apply the correct procedure had 
              inadvertently caused the bank's service outage. </span></p>
              <p><span> In a statement released Tuesday, IBM says its immediate priority was to 
              ensure customer data was not compromised in any way, while it sought to 
              restore services as quickly as possible. </span></p>
              <p><span> IBM said it has also taken steps to enhance training of its personnel 
              related to current procedures and brought in experts from its global 
              team to provide further assistance. </span></p>
              <p><span> IBM also apologised for the inconvenience caused to customers of DBS and
               POSB during the service outage. </span></p>
