              <p><span> SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore says it is in dialogue 
              with DBS Bank on investigations into the seven-hour outage that 
              disrupted banking and ATM services at DBS and POSB on July 5. </span></p>
              <p><span> More than 1,000 ATM machines as well as some branch services were affected by the disruption. </span></p>
              <p><span> DBS had said that the glitch was caused by a botched routine computer repair job. </span></p>
              <p><span> It is working with its IT vendor IBM to ensure that such lapses do not recur. </span></p>
              <p><span> Asked about the issue during a news conference on its annual report 
              Thursday, MAS said it will assess the outcome of the investigation 
              before deciding on the appropriate regulatory action to take. </span></p>
              <p><span> Deputy managing director, Financial Supervision, MAS, Teo Swee Lian 
              said: "It would be premature to say anymore at this stage, we should 
              look at what the investigation come up with, but every one is taking it 
              very seriously, both the bank as well as ourselves. </span></p>
              <p><span> "When we have a full understanding of what happened and what were the 
              causes, then we would look to see how we could address such gaps." </span></p>

              <p><strong>DBS Bank censured by MAS for management oversight in July ATM breakdown</strong></p>
              <p><span>Singapore: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has censured 
              DBS Bank for management oversight over its outsourced IT systems, 
              networks, operations and infrastructure that led to a service outage of 
              its banking systems on 5 July. </span></p>
              <p><span> In a statement released Wednesday, it said DBS Bank has not adequately 
              observed three Sections of the MAS Internet Banking and Technology Risk 
              Management Guidelines (IBTRM Guidelines). </span></p>
              <p><span> The widespread system, noted the MAS, also revealed weaknesses in DBS 
              Bank's technology and operational risk management controls. </span></p>
              <p><span>MAS said that investigations showed the breakdown arose in part 
              from the failure of the bank to put in place a robust technology risk 
              management framework to ensure the reliability, resiliency and speedy 
              recoverability of the bank’s IBM mainframe-storage area network (SAN) 
              platform and architecture. 
              <br> <br> It said DBS Bank did not exercise sufficient oversight of the 
              maintenance, functional and operational practices and controls employed 
              by IBM. 
              <br> <br> “MAS takes a serious view of this incident. We expect all financial 
              institutions to put in place a robust technology risk management 
              framework that will ensure the reliability, resiliency and speedy 
              recoverability of the institution's IT systems and infrastructure, 
              whether outsourced or in-house" said Ms Teo Swee Lian, Deputy Managing 
              Director, Financial Supervision, MAS.
              <br> <br> She added that the MAS has recently written to the CEOs of all financial
               institutions to remind them of its expectations, adding "MAS will not 
              hesitate to take appropriate supervisory action against any financial 
              institution which fails to meet the standards set in the IBTRM 
              Guidelines.”
              <br> <br> The MAS said DBS Bank has been told to conduct an independent review of the incident as well as to adopt remedial measures.
              <br> <br> This includes steps to diversify and reduce its material outsourcing 
              risks so that it does not overly rely on a single service provider or a 
              single vendor’s products and services.
              <br> <br> The bank has to also conduct a thorough internal review of the SAN 
              mainframe and open system architectures and configurations to discover 
              and correct any single points of failure or operational and functional 
              fragility.
              <br> <br> The MAS has also told the bank to redesign its online and branch banking
               systems platform to reduce risks and allow more flexibility and 
              resiliency in operations and recoveries.
              <br> <br> A review of outsourcing vendors' processes and functions related to 
              services and hardware/software maintenance has also been suggested, as 
              well as to make sure maintenance and support teams from vendors have the
               requisite level of skill, capability and experience to meet the bank's 
              service and support criteria.
              <br> <br> The bank will also have to assess the ability of outsourcing vendors to 
              meet, at all times, the bank's service level requirements and recovery 
              point objectives for all mission critical systems.
              <br> <br> In addition, it has to set up a Systems and Network Command Centre 
              within the bank to continually monitor the operation, performance and 
              health of its systems, networks, storage platforms and hardware and 
              software devices.
              <br> <br> Finally, the MAS has told the bank to strengthen its capabilities and 
              resources for a rapid disaster recovery plan when a major system failure
               or site catastrophe occurs.
              <br> <br> In its statement, the MAS said DBS Bank has been told to apply a 
              multiplier of 1.2 times to its risk-weighted assets for operational 
              risk, which translates to the bank setting aside about S$230 million 
              extra in regulatory capital on a group basis based on numbers as at 30 
              June 2010. 
              <br> <br> The additional capital requirement will be reviewed when MAS is 
              satisfied that the bank has put in place adequate risk control measures 
              to address the deficiencies identified.
              <br> <br> The MAS also said it also expects the bank to take immediate steps to 
              improve its customer communication process and ensure timely 
              communication with stakeholders with  effect.

              <p><strong>MAS instructs DBS Bank to set aside $230m in regulatory capital</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has 
              instructed DBS Bank to set aside about $230 million in regulatory 
              capital, as part of its supervisory action against the service outage of
               the lender's online and branch banking system on 5 July. </span></p>
              <p><span> The more than seven-hour outage caused significant inconvenience to the bank's customers. </span></p>
              <p><span> MAS says the additional capital requirement will be reviewed when it is 
              satisfied that the bank has put in place adequate risk control measures 
              to address the deficiencies identified. </span></p>
              <p><span>It says based on investigation reports and its own analysis, the 
              breakdown was in part a result of the failure by the bank to put in 
              place a robust technology risk management framework.
              <br> <br> DBS Bank did not exercise sufficient oversight of the maintenance, 
              functional and operational practices and controls employed by IBM.
              <br> <br> It has therefore not adequately observed Sections 5, 7 and 8 of the MAS 
              guidelines on Internet Banking and Technology Risk Management.
              <br> <br> MAS has also directed DBS Bank to adopt several measures including 
              diversifying and reducing its material outsourcing risks so that it does
               not overly rely on a single service provider or a single vendor's 
              products and services.
              <br> <br> It also expects the bank to take steps to improve its customer 
              communication process and ensure timely communication with stakeholders 
              with immediate effect. 
              <br> <br> Deputy managing director, Financial Supervision, at MAS, Teo Swee Lian 
              said the regulator has recently written to the CEOs of all financial 
              institutions to remind them of the need for a robust technology risk 
              management framework.
              <br> <br> She says MAS will not hesitate to take appropriate supervisory action 
              against any financial institution which fails to meet the standards set 
              in the guidelines.
