              <p>A woman in her 40s and a four-year-old girl were found dead at the foot of a Jurong block of HDB flats on Friday afternoon.</p>
              <p>The victims are believed to be Bangladeshis, said <em>The New Paper</em>, which first reported the story.</p>
              <p>Police, who have classfied the case as unnatural deaths, have not 
                  released the names of the victims, who were found at the foot of Block 
                  695B in Jurong West Street 65.</p>
              <p>An HDB estate cleaner, Abdul Rahman, 
                  who is also from Bangladesh and has been working in the estate for the 
                  last two years, told the paper that he was returning from his Friday 
                  prayers when he came across the bodies. <br><br>The 24-year-old said he 
                  knew both victims, and that he often saw the woman and her husband walk 
                  the little girl to a nearby kindergarten.</p>
              <p>"They appeared to be a happy family," he said.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile
                   a Madam Tan Jak Hoon, who lived on the 16th floor of the same block, 
                  said the victims could have used a broken chair that was stored outside 
                  her flat to climb over the parapet before their fall. </p>
              <p>She said 
                  that the chair, which had been left outside her five-room flat for the 
                  past two years, had been moved from its original location and that a 
                  "visible footprint" of an adult could be seen on it.</p>

              <p>Software engineer... he sees himself as an elite, and expect you, a lowly Sgrean to do all the shit... </p>
              <p>Going back to topic, i cant recognise Singapore anymore.</p>
              <p>Can the men in white scrap NS? i dont see any point in "protecting" it.</p>
              <p>Just now, i was inside the NEL heading towards Clark Quay. When the train stop at Farrer Park, i was stunned to see many bangala. Then at Little India, more bangala entered the train. I looked around the cabin only to realised myself and another malay guy is from Singapore.</p>
              <p>The rest of the cabin, filled with bangala, ah tiong, malaysian, taiwanese, filipino.</p>
              <p>YOU can bring in foreign workers, thats fine, but NOT FLOOD THE WHOLE FREAKING SG!</p>
              <p>And best of all, YOU give PRs  the chance to buy HDB and leaving YOUR OWN PEOPLE in the lurch. </p>
              <p>Tell me how?</p>
