              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Gang leader gets 18 years' jail for two killings <br>By Alethea Lim <br>Court Correspondent <br>AT 16, Balachandran Bernard became the section head of the '369' secret society. <br><br><br><br>For giving the go-ahead, Balachandran bore responsibility for the assaults. --WONG KWAI CHOW <br><br><br>The middle child in a family of three boys, he assumed the top position in the gang's Teban Gardens area after the then section head was sent to jail. <br><br>Balachandran, who was educated only up to Primary 5, had been recruited into the gang three years earlier. <br><br>His new position included reporting the group's activities to the gang's main leader. He also became a mentor for those members who went to him for help. <br><br>A year after his release, , he ordered two separate attacks which resulted in two men being killed and a third being injured seriously. <br><br>Yesterday, Balachandran, now 20, was sentenced to 18 years' jail and the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. <br><br>He had on Tuesday pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter while being part of an unlawful assembly and one charge of causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapons while part of a gang. <br><br>His lawyer, Mr S.S. Dhillon, said the youth never laid a finger on the two men whom his gang battered to death. Balachandran had only participated in the assault on Mr Nasir Din Meera Sahib, 37. <br><br>But Judicial Commissioner Woo Bih Li disagreed and said that 'the person who gave the go-ahead is no less responsible than the attackers' and should bear primary responsibility for the assaults. <br><br>The first attack happened at East Coast Park , where the gang assaulted Mr Hamzir Hamin, 41, using wooden poles and metal rods. Mr Hamzir died in hospital from multiple head injuries four days later. <br><br>On Oct 15, the gang set upon Mr Nasir Din and his friend, Mr Roslan Mohamed, 31, with parangs. The pair were at a pub in City Plaza in Geylang Road celebrating Mr Roslan's birthday. <br><br>Mr Roslan died at the scene from a neck wound while his friend received 50 slashes and spent 15 days in hospital with injuries to his arms, back, neck, scalp and chest. <br><br>The attacks on both occasions were unprovoked. <br><br>Balachandran went on the run but was arrested last July in Johor Baru. <br><br>In a statement read out in court, victim Nasir Din said: 'They slashed me a few times on my back. I was bleeding all over my body.' <br><br>When he collapsed, the gang continued slashing him. 'I thought I was going to die,' recalled the father of two children, aged 13 and six months. <br><br>Mr Nasir Din stopped work because of his injuries. He has already spent about $30,000 on his medical bills. <br><br>'I have to live with the ordeal of losing a good friend and being a burden to my family. I will never forget this terrifying incident for the rest of my life,' he said.</span></span></p>
