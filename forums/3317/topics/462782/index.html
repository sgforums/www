              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Two international reports have reaffirmed that 
              Singapore's students remain among the best performers internationally in
               reading, mathematics and science.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The studies -- 
              Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and 
              Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) -- saw 
              Singapore students remain in the band of best performers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The studies involved a sampling of 12,500 primary four and secondary two students between 2010 and 2011.<br><br>In
               primary four reading, for example, Singapore was among the top 
              performers, along with Finland and Hong Kong, and in secondary two 
              mathematics, Singapore students were again at the top, on par with 
              students from South Korea. <br><br>According to the report, Singapore's 
              education system has also made significant progress in improving the 
              performance of academically weaker students. <br><br>The percentage of 
              students who performed at a 'low' level or below that almost halved last
               year, at 13 per cent, compared to 24 per cent in 2001.<br><br>Ministry 
              of Education (MOE)'S director of Curriculum Planning and Development 
              division, Chua-Lim Yen Ching, said: "Our academically weaker students 
              have progressed significantly, and our stronger support for them did not
               compromise the performance of our academically stronger students -- as 
              our weaker students move up, our stronger students also moved up."<br><br>"Our
               philosophy is that we want to protect the base, but at the same time, 
              we do not want to cap the top so that they allow our academically 
              stronger students to flourish.<br><br>"We saw an improvement in the 
              reasoning skills and to us that is a good sign. That means the students 
              are able to move from knowledge to application and reasoning. Learning 
              is not just a matter of factual knowledge but it's also the students' 
              ability to be able to apply."<br><br>MOE, which released the report on 
              Tuesday, said the findings are testament to the strengths of an 
              education system that has intensified efforts in recent years to help 
              weaker students. <br><br>The reports also measured the ability of students in three areas: knowing, applying and reasoning. <br><br>In
               Singapore's context, students in both primary four and secondary two 
              improved in reasoning scores in mathematics and science last year, 
              compared to results in 2007. <br><br>MOE said this also reflects the shift of schools towards higher-order skills.<br><br>Despite
               stellar performances, the reports found that Singapore students 
              expressed a lack of confidence in the areas they fared well in.  <br><br>Government
               Parliamentary Committee Education's chairman, Lim Biow Chuan, said: "If
               we (Singapore students) have done so well, the other thing MOE may want
               to study further, is how can we inculcate this sense of confidence in 
              our students so that they may be able to compete internationally with 
              anyone.<br><br>"Otherwise no matter how good you are, you don't express 
              confidence in your abilities, when it comes to actual performance in 
              your work, that will not do well for yourself."<br><br>The reports also 
              found that students in Singapore liked subjects like mathematics and 
              science more than their international peers.</span></span></p>
