              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A fatwa - or religious ruling - has been issued by the 
              Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) against a group known as 
              Madrasah Faiz al-Baqarah for spreading "misleading teachings about 
              Islam". </span></p>
              <p><span>Muis states in a posting on its website that the group is a 
              splinter of Roh Mutmainnah, another group ruled as deviant by the Fatwa 
              Committee in 1974 and 2001.
              <br> <br> Muis usually issues fatwas to help Muslims in Singapore with solutions 
              or opinions on issues related to the Muslim religion. 
              <br> <br> In 2007, for example, the committee issued a fatwa taking the position 
              that it is permissible for Muslims to be included in the Human Organ 
              Transplant Act.
              <br> <br> After it had received complaints from the community about Madrasah Faiz 
              al-Baqarah, the committee met its leader Mr Rahman bin Kamari, on March 
              11 "to verify the information received on the group, as well as to 
              ascertain its teachings".
              <br> <br> The fatwa was issued against the group on May 20 after it was found, 
              among other things, that Mr Rahman had claimed to be a follower of Roh 
              Mutmainnah founder Hassan bin Jonit who died in 2004. 
              <br> <br> Mr Rahman, who is believed to be in his 50s, claimed Mr Hassan was "the 
              early spiritual form of the Prophet Muhammad".
              <br> <br> Not much else is known about the activities of Madrasah Faiz al-Baqarah,
               except that it has about 100 active members. 
              <br> <br> It is understood Mr Rahman conducted lectures at flats belonging to 
              followers. 
              <br> <br> The group created a buzz among sections of the Muslim community when its
               leader claimed an earthquake would hit Singapore on Jan 29.
              <br> <br> Mr Rahman had supposedly told his followers to leave Singapore to save 
              themselves.
              <br> <br> "This belief has no basis in Islam and is blind adherence to one's 
              desires and personal gains," said Muis.
              <br> <br> Still, lawyer Haji Hussien Bin Abdul Latiff, who practices Syariah law, 
              said it would be difficult for Muis to enforce the fatwa.
              <br> <br> "There are deviant groups practising in Singapore because we have 
              religious freedom," he said. 
              <br> <br> "Such groups can only be stopped if a law outlawing such practices is 
              passed."
              <br> <br> There are no official numbers of such Islamic groups here but some, like
               the Ahmaddiya sect which operates out of Taha Mosque, continue to 
              practice.
              <br> <br> In its statement, Muis said it was exposing the activities of Madrasah 
              Faiz al-Baraqah "to protect members of the community from being 
              influenced and misled by their false teachings and claims".
              <br> <br> The topic of tackling deviant teachings will be the theme of Fridayâ€™s 
              sermons in mosques across Singapore. </span></p>
