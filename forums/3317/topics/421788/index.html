              <h2>Drink driving ad receives flak for being ‘too obvious’</h2>
              <p>A public education message against drink driving by the Traffic Police and the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) has received flak over its advertisement, with some saying the public service message defeats its own purpose.</p>
              <p>The message, styled as the obituary of a teenager who was a victim of
               drink driving, ran with his picture and the words “Dearly missed by a 
              loving wife, children, and grandchildren that he will never have. Denied
               of a future of hopes and dreams that he will never realize”.</p>
              <p>But under this was a “disclaimer” — that the teen is a fictitious character.</p>
              <p>Those in the business of advertising and communications said the advertisement, which ran  in <em>The Straits Times</em> and <em>The New Paper</em> on Monday, deflated its own power with the disclaimer.</p>
              <p>Mr Gan Boon Guan, the chief operating officer of global marketing services group Carat Media Services, told <em>ST</em>, “It creates an effect and then takes it away.”</p>
              <p>The industry veteran with more than 20 years experience added that 
              the disclaimer defeated the purpose, because the drama created is lost, 
              and the message becomes almost a joke.</p>
              <p>Advertising veteran and part-time advertising lecturer Melina 
              Chua echoed those views saying, “When I realised it was an ad, the house
               of cards fell down for me. The gravity of the message was lost.”</p>
              <p>Mr Low Cheh Chuan, managing partner of Salt Creatives, which created 
              the ad for the Traffic Police, said the creative concept set out to show
               the reality of the consequences of drink driving.</p>
              <p>“It’s not about one life. It’s about robbing the person of the chance to be a husband, a father, a grandfather.”</p>
              <p>Defending the use of the disclaimer, he said it was necessary in the 
              name of responsible advertising, and insisted that it did not compromise
               the effect of the ad.</p>
              <p>“It’s still very real. The ad has done its work and got the reader’s 
              attention… If a lot of people go away thinking that it is a real 
              obituary, it creates a lot of hassle.”</p>
              <p>The teen in the ad is an 18-year-old whose features were digitally 
              altered “a fair bit” with his consent, and that of his parents. The 
              “obituary” is just a teaser, said Mr Low. Today, there will be another 
              ad that portrays the teenager as a father and a grandfather.</p>
              <p>The SRSC who is also a partner in the ad campaign, said it supported 
              the “bold and creative” approach that conveys the anti-drink driving 
              message, “We want a clear message that drives home the drastic 
              consequences of drink driving.”</p>
              <p>Advertising lecturer Tim Clark from Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
               said “deception” was a dangerous tactic to use in advertising. But it 
              was acceptable for public service messages, because “in this context, 
              the disclaimer doesn’t change the fact that real people do die this 
              way”.</p>
              <p>Last year, 22 people died and 182 people were injured in 
              drink-driving accidents, a total of 204 casualties. The number of people
               arrested for drink driving was 2,931. There were 267 casualties in 2009
               and 235 in 2008.</p>
              <p>Said a police spokesman, “It is hoped that the emotive appeal of the 
              advertisement will remind the public not to drink and drive.”</p>
              <p>Businessman Muhammad Nazran Ahmad, 30, said the ad prompted him to 
              think about the taboos of using a living person’s face in an obituary 
              instead of making him reflect on drink driving.</p>
              <p>“It was clever, but not necessarily effective,” he said.</p>
              <p>Do you agree?</p>
