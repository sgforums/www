              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: In the High Court on Monday, a case has come up where
               a Malaysian businesswoman, Madam Anne Wee, is suing her step-daughter 
              for a portion of a S$28.8 million trust, claiming that it is part of 
              matrimonial assets.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Madam Wee, who is in
               her 50s, is the niece of United Overseas Bank founder Wee Cho Yaw and 
              the daughter of Sarawak tycoon Anuar Wee Hood Teck.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>She is claiming that
               her Singaporean ex-husband Ng Hock Seng, had fraudulently 
              misrepresented to her that he did not have money to support their family
               during their 10-year marriage, when he had earned US$20 million in 1998
               from a wafer fabrication contract for services in Sarawak, Malaysia.<br><br>Madam
               Wee, the sole breadwinner of the family shortly after they moved from 
              Singapore to Kuching, maintained she was key in introducing the managing
               director of the wafer fabrication plant to her ex-husband.<br><br>She 
              said she did not make a claim for maintenance during her divorce from Mr
               Ng because he had told her he was broke and she believed him.<br><br>Mr
               Ng, who died in 2004 from tongue cancer, bought an apartment in Ocean 
              Park in Singapore and another in Four Seasons in Jakarta in 1999. 
              However, he claimed in an affidavit in January 2000 that he was of 
              limited means and had difficulty giving the maintenance of RM3,750 to 
              his children and could only give RM1,200.<br><br>He also claimed he was financially supported by his family and friends.<br><br>Madam
               Wee was cross-examined on Monday by her step-daughter's lawyer, Ms 
              Deborah Barker, who put to Madam Wee that she was not the one who 
              introduced the key contact of the wafer fabrication company to her 
              ex-husband.<br><br>Mr Ng had willed the money in the trusts to his 
              daughter from his first marriage, Ms Genevieve Ng Li-Ann, and his son 
              and daughter with Madam Wee. Ms Ng is the sole executrix of Mr Ng's 
              estate.<br><br>The trust is managed by BNP Paribas Trust Corporation, which is incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands. <br><br>Madam
               Wee is claiming costs against the trust which she alleged had 
              "unreasonably" incurred unnecessary costs "by failing to take a neutral 
              stand" in her claim against the late Mr Ng's estate.<br><br>Madam Wee is represented by Ms Indranee Rajah from Drew and Napier.<br><br>Ms
               Ng and BNP Paribas Trust Corporation disagree that Mr Ng's estate is 
              part of matrimonial assets. Lawyers for the trust also argue that her 
              claim for costs is baseless.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
