              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Observers said there was a "gulf of discrepancy" last
               year, between Singapore's economic growth and workers' salaries.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Despite the economy 
              growing 14.5 per cent last year, data from the Ministry of Manpower 
              released recently, showed nominal wages grew just 5.5 per cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The inflation rate last year was 2.8 per cent.<br><br>When that's factored in, real wages dipped to just 2.7 per cent in 2010.<br><br>Kelly
               Services professional &amp; technical general manager Ben Batten said: 
              "The reality was that while there have been growth in some sectors in 
              salaries, compared to 2007, we're back at similar sort of levels. <br><br>"The way that equates to dollars and cents in the hands of employees is actually not that great.<br><br>"We've got heavy inflation pressures and overall, with niche positions, we are seeing some highly competitive salaries.<br><br>"But
               if you take an average placement, 100 placements over the course of a 
              particular period of time for similar roles, we're not seeing big 
              spikes".<br><br>Some human resource practitioners said the picture is not likely to change this year.<br><br>Primestaff
               Management Services managing director Ronald Lee said: "For 2011, very 
              much will depend on the inflation again, because the consumer price 
              index is projected to grow, maybe for the year, about four per cent. <br><br>"So,
               at four per cent, if you want to maintain a real wage increase of 2.7 
              per cent or more, then you need to provide a nominal wage increase of 
              maybe seven, or 7.5  per cent even".<br><br>But labour economists said they think real wages could actually go up, even "going off the chart".<br><br>SIM
               University labour economist Randolph Tan said: "One is to make up for 
              last year's discrepancy between real output growth and real wage growth.
               <br><br>"And of course, this year, there are many weather-related 
              disruptions and other kinds of natural catastrophes that would feed into
               commodities and energy prices further. <br><br>"And this would actually give an additional push to inflation and then into wage growth".<br><br>In
               addition, Dr Tan said he believes the economy is heading towards a 
              tighter labour market, and this could also push real wages up.<br><br>"Over the last few years, the Singapore labour market has been very much determined by strong demand for labour," Dr Tan said. <br><br>"Also,
               the strong demand for labour has been accommodated by a very relaxed 
              supply regime. But I think we are on the cusp of what is most likely to 
              be a policy shift in that regard. <br><br>"It's certainly going to be true that we are not going to have as free labour market situation going forward. <br><br>"So,
               what I think in the medium term will happen, is that we could actually 
              have a tightening-labour-market situation, and a 
              tightening-labour-market situation will actually act towards an upward 
              pressure on wages."<br><br>In April, the National Wages Council recommended workers be rewarded with wage increases this year. <br><br>This is in keeping with the strength of Singapore's economy and the performance and prospects of companies'. <br><br>The council also suggested bosses consider a one-off special lump-sum payment to help employees cope with inflation.<br><br>Whether wages will rise by a lot more this year, one thing is certain.<br><br>Wages
               of employees in sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, 
              hospitality, IT and communications could go up by more than average due 
              to heavy demand for such workers.<br><br>Another sector is construction, following the government's announcement to ramp up the supply of public housing.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
