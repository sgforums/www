              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Law Minister K Shanmugam has said Singapore will not
              decriminalise gay sex but the courts have the power to decide how the
              law, Section 377, is applied. Section 377A of the Penal Code deems sex
              between men a crime.
              <br> <br>A recent ruling by the New Delhi High Court legalising gay sex
              between consenting adults in India raised questions on whether
              Singapore might go the same way. Both countries share the same Penal
              Code, inherited from the colonial British. <br> <br> In a dialogue with Punggol residents on Sunday, Mr Shanmugam said
              Section 377 will remain as homosexuality is still not accepted by most
              Singaporeans.
              <br> <br>He said: "We have the law. We say it won't be enforced. Is it
              totally clear? We, sometimes in these things, have to accept a bit of
              messiness. And the way the society is going, we don't think it's fair
              for us to prosecute people who say that they are homosexual."
              <br> <br>But he said that while the government will not take the lead in
              repealing the law, the legal courts in Singapore have the power to
              decide how Section 377 is interpreted and applied.
              <br> <br>Mr Shanmugam, who is also the Second Minister for Home Affairs,
              said the government will play a more active role in other areas, such
              as creating ways for new citizens and Permanent Residents to interact
              with the community.
              <br> <br>But he said all parties must also make an effort. "It's not a quick
              process. You can't wave a magic wand and say, 'oh, integration takes
              place'. It takes many years. And why talk about foreigners? Even
              amongst ourselves, different races, religions - how long has it taken
              to get to this stage?"
              <br> <br>During the hour-long dialogue, one resident noted that the minister
              had spoken of affirmative action for Malays five years ago and asked if
              he felt this was still necessary.
              <br> <br>In reply, Mr Shanmugam said the community had come a long way, but
              clarified that he was not calling for a quota system at the time.
              <br> <br> Instead, success must be founded on meritocracy.
              <br> <br>Mr Shanmugam said: "We don't talk about quotas, that's not our
              approach. We don't talk about...so many places for Malays, so many
              places for Indians, so many places for Chinese. That's a wrong way to
              go. It has got to be meritocratic. But assuming 10 people make the
              cut-off, try and look for some who are also from the Malay community."
