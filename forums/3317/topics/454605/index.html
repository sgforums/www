              <p>What a warning to the West; China is ready to compete!</p>
              <p>From earthly orbit to the deepest reaches of the Pacific Ocean, China has notched up two more firsts for the country's ambitious sea and space exploration programs.<br><br>On Sunday, the three Chinese astronauts on board the Shenzhou-9 manually docked their spacecraft to the Tiangong 1, an orbiting space lab.<br><br>On the same day, a Chinese manned submersible vehicle set a deep-diving record when it descended 7,020 meters into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>The three men on board the sub -- dubbed oceanauts in China -- sent greetings to the three astronauts on the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft.<br><br>"We wish for a great success of the manual docking and brilliant achievements in China's manned space and manned deep-sea dive causes," Xinhua quoted Ye Cong, Li Kaizhou and Yang Bo as saying.<br><br>Both endeavors have been a source of pride for China and could help bolster support for the Chinese Communist Party as it undergoes a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year and handles the fall-out from the demise of former politician Bo Xilai.<br><br>"Scientific achievements like this allow the Party to again remind the population of what has been achieved under their leadership," said Dean Cheng, a research follow at The Heritage Foundation in Washington.<br><br>"It buys credibility and justification for their continued rule, even as scandals like Bo Xilai eat away at their authority.<br><br>"I would expect additional such displays in the coming months, especially if reports of a troubled succession are correct."<br><br>Mastering the technique of joining spacecraft together manually is also seen as an essential step toward China's goal of building a space station in 2020.<br><br>Until now, the docking had been done by remote control from the ground.<br><br>Local media reported that China also plans to start building a deep-sea station to accompany its march into space.<br><br>The three-man sub Jiaolong, named after a mythical sea dragon, worked for three hours on the sea floor, collecting water samples, sediments and placing markers at the bottom of the sea.<br><br>Xinhua said the 11-hour dive "enabled China to join the ranks of deep-sea faring countries" like the US, Japan, France and Russia.<br><br>Cheng said that the ability to undertake such deep-sea dives also had commercial applications and would help China drill for oil and undertake deep-sea mining.<br><br>Will China overtake America in space?<br><br>China has been funding oceanographic research for more than a decade after it was added to the country's 9th Five Year Plan in 1996, he added.<br><br>Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for China's manned space missions said the program, which began in 1992, would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan (US$6.27 billion).<br><br>"These programs are emblematic of sustained Chinese investments in the human capital and infrastructure of science," said Cheng.<br><br><strong>"This should be a warning call to the U.S. and Western Europe that their traditional dominance in science is in jeopardy."</strong><br><br>But some Chinese internet users, while lauding the achievements, questioned whether these exploits were the wisest use of China's new-found wealth.<br><br>"Diving into the sea and flying out to space. China now can do them both," said one user of the Twitter-like portal Sina Weibo.<br><br>"It marks the development of technology and we are proud of it. But can the government care more about its people's well-being too?"</p>
