              <p>When Myanmar’s reforming President Thein Sein visited Singapore in 
              January, officials there offered lessons on how to modernize and attract
               foreign investment. Singapore’s eagerness to court Myanmar’s ruling 
              generals has been a diplomatic feature of the international community’s 
              two decades of trying to crack open the reclusive country.</p>
              <p>Now that Asia’s “next economic frontier” has started to open up, Singapore – where Myanmar’s senior generals bank and seek.<br> hospital treatment – is keen to offer itself as a dazzling example of 
              how to become a first-world economy within a couple of generations.</p>
              <p>It’s a siren call that should be resisted, said Rodney King, the 
              Australian author of the controversial book Singapore: Myth and Reality.</p>
              <p>“Singapore is not a good development model and not one a developing 
              country should follow. Singapore has basically conned the world about 
              its nation-building achievement,” said King. “It is frightening that 
              they should regard Singapore as a good model to follow.”</p>
              <p>Years of robust growth in Singapore were driven initially by waves of
               foreign capital into the city-state and more recently by the import of 
              foreign workers, who now make up one-third of the population. The 
              government’s jealous husbanding of much of the economy, meanwhile, has 
              rendered impotent much of the nation’s faculty for creative business.</p>
              <p>“Its entrepreneurial, innovative capacity is quite small. It’s got a 
              very small local private sector, unlike say South Korea and Taiwan, 
              where there are vigorous entrepreneurial cultures. In Singapore, they 
              don’t really have that,” said King, who spent many years working in the 
              island-state.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that Singapore says this in its diplomatic and 
              commercial outreach to Myanmar. Ashfaqur Rahman, chairman of the Center 
              for Foreign Affairs Studies in Bangladesh, had no doubt what Singapore 
              hopes for when he noted how it shunned the previous Western policy of 
              making a pariah of the ruling junta.</p>
              <p>“The basis of this strategy was to gain from a relationship which was
               essentially economic. Singapore invested heavily in Myanmar and traded 
              with her. It even pushed other [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] 
              members to allow Myanmar to join the regional organization.”</p>
              <p>Myanmar citizens, who for decades have been mired in corrupt economic
               lethargy, are no doubt dazzled by Singapore’s success in turning a 
              former modest British trading hub into a confident modern nation with a 
              per capita income among the highest in the world.</p>
              <p>Remarkably an island state with just 1% of Southeast Asia’s 
              population still attracts nearly half of its foreign direct investment. 
              Yet this success has come “at considerable costs in terms of independent
               development, human rights, freedom, and workers rights”, according to 
              an academic paper published last year.</p>
              <p>That part of the economy not in foreign hands is dominated by 
              government-controlled institutions run by the local nomenklatura. 
              Keeping an every present watch is the People’s Action Party (PAP), which
               has run virtually a one-party state since independence.</p>
              <p>“One of the key features of the Singapore model is that the 
              commanding heights of the economy are controlled by the state – directly
               or indirectly. Burma [Myanmar] had all its state enterprises taken over
               in 1962 by [the late general] Ne Win, which has just dragged the 
              economy into the ground,” said King.</p>
              <p>“If they were going to follow the Singapore model they would be just 
              repeating the mistakes that they have already made. Singapore crushes 
              individual enterprise but [Myanmar] is going to need all the enterprise 
              it can possibly muster to get over 50 years of chronic warfare and 
              political repression.”</p>
              <p>King’s criticism might have less sting given Singapore’s wealth were 
              it not also echoed by an increasing number of complaints rising from 
              within the city-state. Indeed, many now question whether the “Singapore 
              model” is still valid. In last year’s general election the ruling party 
              won its lowest share of the vote since independence.</p>
              <p>Productivity gains have been notoriously weak for decades, hardly 
              what the casual observer might imagine from a country regularly ranked 
              as one of the most competitive.</p>
              <p>The American economist Paul Krugman infuriated Singapore’s founding 
              father Lee Kuan Yew 20 years ago by claiming Singapore’s growth could be
               explained by more of everything – capital and labor – except 
              efficiency.</p>
              <p>Ever since the launch of the “Teamy the Productivity Bee” campaign 
              three decades ago, the government mantra has been to focus on generating
               greater added value. Despite myriad training initiatives, worker 
              productivity has barely grown by 1% a year in the new millennium.</p>
              <p>Growth has been sustained by an inflow of foreigners that has doubled
               the island’s population since 1980, with foreigners and non-Singapore 
              born citizens now representing three-fifths of the population. “We’ve 
              grown in the last five years by just importing labor,” said Lee Kuan Yew
               himself in 2010.</p>
              <p>The country arguably hasn’t maximized that influx. “They imported all
               these scientists and technicians from all over the world but the 
              outcome has been fairly modest. These people have found working in a 
              bureaucratic structure quite stifling,” said King. The authorities 
              “spend tons of money on resources but the ambience isn’t there really. 
              They seem to be able to attract talent, but when they get them they 
              can’t operate the way that they want.”</p>
              <p>Equality gap<br> Singapore shone in the headlines again recently when one of Facebook’s 
              founders, Eduardo Saverin, was revealed to have given up his United 
              States passport in favor of residency in Singapore to “invest like 
              crazy.”</p>
              <p>Saverin joins an elite of super-rich floating on top of an ordinary 
              public, many of whom struggle to make ends meet in an increasingly 
              expensive city. The bottom half of the population experienced either 
              falling real income, or no gain in income, over most of the last decade.</p>
              <p>High inequality levels have combined with falling social mobility, 
              reinforcing the grip of the privileged upper class to the point where 
              even the government recognizes this threatens the social compact.</p>
              <p>One of the city-state’s most respected economists, Professor Lim 
              Chong Yah, said in April that the city’s Gini coefficient (a measure of 
              equality) of 0.47 was approaching the “danger level” of 0.5 when 
              typically income inequality starts to tear at a country’s social fabric.
               He has advocated a “shock” therapy of pay rises for workers and tax 
              penalties for the rich.</p>
              <p>King estimates one-fifth of the population lives in poverty as 
              measured by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
              standards. “They have been able to attracts lots of foreign direct 
              investment … at the cost of Singaporean living standards.”</p>
              <p>Singapore may now have passed some sort of inflexion point. The first
               two generations of PAP leaders have faded from the scene – aside of 
              course from the Senior Lee himself – and the younger leaders do not seem
               to hold the power to cow the population as in the past.</p>
              <p>“This has been a country of frightened, intimidated people. In the 
              1950s and ’60s, Singaporeans were feisty, gung-ho people but Lee and co 
              killed their spirit,” said King.</p>
              <p>This past timidity in the face of authority permitted a series of 
              policy mistakes followed by awkward U-turns. One notable quirk came in 
              1970 when Lee discouraged big families after deciding the population was
               too high, only years later changing his mind to beg (rather comically) 
              Singaporeans to breed more freely.</p>
              <p>Over the years, careful observers have pointed out that Singapore’s 
              “success” owed much to being a small, compact island that made political
               and social control relatively easy, so enabling it to experiment with 
              robust but effective national development strategies.</p>
              <p>By contrast, Myanmar is an infinitely more complicated jigsaw of 
              ethnic, geographic, economic and historic problems in a space that is 
              one-thousand times bigger. “Vast, sprawling countries like Indonesia, 
              (Myanmar) and Thailand … would find such strategies a great deal harder 
              to implement,” said King.</p>
              <p>To be sure, Singapore’s founding myth as a mosquito-infested swamp of
               palm plantations and kampong dwellers in 1965 is a compelling one for 
              underdeveloped countries like Myanmar eager to learn the secrets of 
              rapid enrichment.</p>
              <p>Nothing could be further from the truth, however. In 1965, Singapore 
              was one of the most developed cities in Asia in terms of industrial 
              development, living standards and literacy of the population, argues 
              King.</p>
              <p>“Singapore’s nation-building success, such as it is, was based on a 
              set of highly favorable circumstances that are unlikely to be found 
              elsewhere,” he said.</p>
              <p>Singapore surely must be praised for many things, not least its 
              relatively clean dealings in a region benighted by corruption. But, if 
              King’s assessment is correct, then Myanmar might be wise to examine 
              carefully the advice from an authoritarian state of growing inequality 
              struggling with low productivity and rising social unhappiness.</p>
