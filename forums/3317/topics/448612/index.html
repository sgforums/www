              <p>Some parents are resorting to hiring tutors to do their 
              kids' school work to ease the burden being put on these children. 
              STOMPer Huh wonders if this is right.<br><br>The 
              STOMPer had come across a recent news report where a parent confessed to
               hiring a specialised tutor to do her kid's homework. The news report 
              had also interviewed another parent who had hired such a tutor to do the
               additional homework her child had been given by an elite tuition 
              centre. <br><br>These parents were willing to pay up $250 an hour for 
              such services, and generally feel that their kids grades wont be 
              affected by such practices. And a New Paper poll had also showed that 
              80% of parents were willing to hire or had hired such tutors.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"I have noticed a new trend.<br><br>"Parents seem to be hiring tutors to do their kids' homework.<br><br>"They
               are willing to pay between $200 to $250 an hour for these specialised 
              tutors to drop by at night to their children's school work.<br><br>"Such tutors usually don't advertise, and can be found through people who have hired them previously.<br><br>"Some parents hire the tutors to do the extra homework given by the elite tuition centres they send their kids to.<br><br>"These parents set aside $500 to $700 a month just for these tutors.</p>
              <p>"Though some of these parents claim its alright for the tutor to do their kids' homework, teachers argue otherwise.</p>
              <p>"Teachers also advise against such practices.</p>
              <p>"I
               feel that such practices can only be detrimental to a child's 
              development, and under no circumstances should a tutor do a kid's 
              homework.<br><br>"In the long run, the kid might get used to having someone complete his or her homework for him.</p>
              <p>"And when that option is no longer available, the child will not be able to handle the workload.<br><br>"If parents feel that that too much homework is being given, than they should give feedback to schools, tuition centres and MOE.</p>

Tuition teacher is to help the child if he/she cannot understand his/her work and can have another teacher to help out in his/her school work... you hire a t-teacher to help your child do homework than how he learn? Parents should use the corret way to educate their children... Tuition teacher should also think before they accpet the job do they really think that by helping the child do his/her homework will really help in his/her result? Or isit that the t-teacher just wanna earn money? And is this what we call "world class education system"? rofl...</p></div>

              <p>But don't you think that if the child don't do the homework parent shouldn't help them, the child should do it themselve if the don't let them go to school and recieve the punishment from the teacher... the job for students is to do their homework and study not come home and play game watch tv etc...</p>
