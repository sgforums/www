              <p>LOS ANGELES – <span id="lw_1245953847_0" class="yshortcuts">Farrah Fawcett</span>, the "<span id="lw_1245953847_1" class="yshortcuts">Charlie's Angels</span>"
                  star whose feathered blond hair and dazzling smile made her one of the
                  biggest sex symbols of the 1970s, died Thursday after battling cancer.
                  She was 62.</p>
              <p>The pop icon, who in the 1980s set
                  aside the fantasy girl image to tackle serious roles, died shortly
                  before 9:30 a.m. in a Santa Monica hospital, spokesman Paul Bloch said.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1245953847_2" class="yshortcuts">Ryan O'Neal</span>, the longtime companion who had reunited with Fawcett as she fought anal cancer, was at her side, along with close friend <span id="lw_1245953847_3" class="yshortcuts">Alana Stewart</span>, Bloch said.</p>
              <p>"After
                  a long and brave battle with cancer, our beloved Farrah has passed
                  away," O'Neal said. "Although this is an extremely difficult time for
                  her family and friends, we take comfort in the beautiful times that we
                  shared with Farrah over the years and the knowledge that her life
                  brought joy to so many people around the world."</p>
              <p>Other "Charlie's Angels" stars paid tribute to her.</p>
              <p>"Farrah had courage, she had strength, and she had faith. And now she has peace as she rests with the real angels," <span id="lw_1245953847_4" class="yshortcuts">Jaclyn Smith</span> said.</p>
              <p>Said <span id="lw_1245953847_5" class="yshortcuts">Cheryl Ladd</span>: "She was incredibly brave, and God will be welcoming her with open arms."</p>
              <p>Fawcett
                  burst on the scene in 1976 as one-third of the crime-fighting trio in
                  TV's "Charlie's Angels." A poster of her in a clingy swimsuit sold in
                  the millions.</p>
              <p>Her full, layered hairstyle became all the rage, with girls and women across America adopting the look.</p>
              <p>She left the show after one season but had a flop on the big screen with "<span id="lw_1245953847_6" class="yshortcuts">Somebody Killed Her Husband</span>." She turned to more serious roles in the 1980s and 1990s, winning praise playing an abused wife in "<span id="lw_1245953847_7" class="yshortcuts">The Burning Bed</span>."</p>
              <p>She
                  had been diagnosed with cancer in 2006. As she underwent treatment, she
                  enlisted the help of O'Neal, who was the father of her now 24-year-old
                  son, Redmond.</p>
              <p>This month, O'Neal said he asked Fawcett to marry him and she agreed. They would wed "as soon as she can say yes," he said.</p>
              <p>Her
                  struggle with painful treatments and dispiriting setbacks was recorded
                  in the television documentary "Farrah's Story." Fawcett sought cures in
                  Germany as well as the United States, battling the disease with iron
                  determination even as her body weakened.</p>
              <p>"Her big message to people is don't give up, no matter what they say to you, keep fighting," her friend Stewart said. <span id="lw_1245953847_8" class="yshortcuts">NBC</span> estimated the May 15, 2009, broadcast drew nearly 9 million viewers.</p>
              <p>In
                  the documentary, Fawcett was seen shaving off most of her trademark
                  locks before chemotherapy could claim them. Toward the end, she's seen
                  huddled in bed, barely responding to a visit from her son.</p>
              <p>Fawcett, <span id="lw_1245953847_9" class="yshortcuts">Kate Jackson</span> and Smith made up the original "Angels," the sexy, police-trained trio
                  of martial arts experts who took their assignments from a rich,
                  mysterious boss named Charlie (John Forsythe, who was never seen on
                  camera but whose distinctive voice was heard on speaker phone.)</p>
              <p>The
                  program debuted in September 1976, the height of what some critics
                  derisively referred to as television's "jiggle show" era, and it gave
                  each of the actresses ample opportunity to show off their figures as
                  they disguised themselves in bathing suits and as hookers and strippers
                  to solve crimes.</p>
              <p>Backed by a clever publicity campaign, Fawcett — then billed as <span id="lw_1245953847_10" class="yshortcuts">Farrah Fawcett</span>-Majors because of her marriage to "The Six Million Dollar Man" star <span id="lw_1245953847_11" class="yshortcuts">Lee Majors</span> — quickly became the most popular Angel of all.</p>
              <p>Her face helped sell T-shirts, lunch boxes, shampoo, wigs and even a
                  novelty plumbing device called Farrah's faucet. Her flowing blond hair,
                  pearly white smile and trim, shapely body made her a favorite with male
                  viewers in particular.</p>
              <p>A poster of her in a dampened red swimsuit sold millions of copies and became a ubiquitous wall decoration in teenagers' rooms.</p>
              <p>Thus the public and the show's producer, Spelling-Goldberg, were
                  shocked when she announced after the series' first season that she was
                  leaving television's No. 5-rated series to star in feature films. (Ladd
                  became the new "Angel" on the series.)</p>
              <p>But the movies turned out to be a platform where Fawcett was never able to duplicate her TV success. Her <span id="lw_1245953847_12" class="yshortcuts">first star vehicle</span>, the comedy-mystery "<span id="lw_1245953847_13" class="yshortcuts">Somebody Killed Her Husband</span>," flopped and Hollywood cynics cracked that it should have been titled "Somebody Killed Her Career."</p>
              <p>The actress had also been in line to star in "Foul Play" for <span id="lw_1245953847_14" class="yshortcuts">Columbia Pictures</span>. But the studio opted for <span id="lw_1245953847_15" class="yshortcuts">Goldie Hawn</span> instead. "Spelling-Goldberg warned all the studios that that they would
                  be sued for damages if they employed me," Fawcett told The Associated
                  Press in 1979. "The studios wouldn't touch me."</p>
              <p>She finally reached an agreement to appear in three episodes of "<span id="lw_1245953847_16" class="yshortcuts">Charlie's Angels</span>" a season, an experience she called "painful."</p>
              <p>She returned to making movies, including the futuristic thriller "<span id="lw_1245953847_17" class="yshortcuts">Logan's Run</span>," the comedy-thriller "Sunburn" and the strange sci-fi tale "<span id="lw_1245953847_18" class="yshortcuts">Saturn 3</span>," but none clicked with the public.</p>
              <p>Fawcett fared better with television movies such as "<span id="lw_1245953847_19" class="yshortcuts">Murder in Texas</span>," "<span id="lw_1245953847_20" class="yshortcuts">Poor Little Rich Girl</span>" and especially as an abused wife in 1984's "<span id="lw_1245953847_21" class="yshortcuts">The Burning Bed</span>." The last earned her an Emmy nomination and the long-denied admission from critics that she really could act.</p>
              <p>As further proof of her acting credentials, Fawcett appeared
                  off-Broadway in "Extremities" as a woman who is raped in her own home.
                  She repeated the role in the 1986 film version.</p>
              <p>Not content to continue playing victims, she switched type. She played a murderous mother in the 1989 true-crime story "<span id="lw_1245953847_22" class="yshortcuts">Small Sacrifices</span>" and a tough lawyer on the trail of a thief in 1992's "Criminal Behavior."</p>
              <p>She also starred in biographies of Nazi-hunter Beate Klarsfeld and photographer <span id="lw_1245953847_23" class="yshortcuts">Margaret Bourke-White</span>.</p>
              <p>"I felt that I was doing a disservice to ourselves by portraying only women as victims," she commented in a 1992 interview.</p>
              <p>In 1995, at age 50, Fawcett posed partly nude for <span id="lw_1245953847_24" class="yshortcuts">Playboy magazine</span>.
                  The following year, she starred in a Playboy video, "All of Me," in
                  which she was equally unclothed while she sculpted and painted.</p>
              <p>She told an interviewer she considered the experience "a
                  renaissance," adding, "I no longer feel ... restrictions emotionally,
                  artistically, creatively or in my everyday life. I don't feel those
                  borders anymore."</p>
              <p>Fawcett's most unfortunate career moment may have been a 1997 appearance on <span id="lw_1245953847_25" class="yshortcuts">David Letterman</span>'s
                  show, when her disjointed, rambling answers led many to speculate that
                  she was on drugs. She denied that, blaming her strange behavior on
                  questionable advice from her mother to be playful and have a good time.</p>
              <p>In September 2006, Fawcett, who at 59 still maintained a strict
                  regimen of tennis and paddleball, began to feel strangely exhausted.
                  She underwent two weeks of tests and was told the devastating news: She
                  had anal cancer.</p>
              <p>O'Neal, with whom she had a 17-year relationship, again became
                  her constant companion, escorting her to the hospital for chemotherapy.</p>
              <p>"She's so strong," the actor told a reporter. "I love her. I love her all over again."</p>
              <p>She struggled to maintain her privacy, but a <span id="lw_1245953847_26" class="yshortcuts">UCLA Medical Center employee</span> pleaded guilty in late 2008 to violating federal medical privacy law
                  for commercial purposes for selling records of Fawcett and other
                  celebrities to the National Enquirer.</p>
              <p>"It's much easier to go through something and deal with it
                  without being under a microscope," she told the Los Angeles Times in an
                  interview in which she also revealed that she helped set up a sting
                  that led to the hospital worker's arrest.</p>
              <p>Her decision to tell her own story through the NBC documentary
                  was meant as an inspiration to others, friends said. The segments
                  showing her cancer treatment, including a trip to Germany for
                  procedures there, were originally shot for a personal, family record,
                  they said. And although weak, she continued to show flashes of grit and
                  good humor in the documentary.</p>
              <p>"I do not want to die of this disease. So I say to God, `It is seriously time for a miracle,'" she said at one point.</p>
              <p>Born Feb. 2, 1947, in Corpus Christi, Texas, she was named Mary
                  Farrah Leni Fawcett by her mother, who said she added the Farrah
                  because it sounded good with Fawcett. She was less than a month old
                  when she underwent surgery to remove a digestive tract tumor with which
                  she was born.</p>
              <p>After attending Roman Catholic grade school and W.B. Ray High School, Fawcett enrolled at <span id="lw_1245953847_27" class="yshortcuts">the University of Texas at Austin</span>.
                  Fellow students voted her one of the 10 most beautiful people on the
                  campus and her photos were eventually spotted by movie publicist David
                  Mirisch, who suggested she pursue a film career. After overcoming her
                  parents' objections, she agreed.</p>
              <p>Soon she was appearing in such TV shows as "That Girl," "<span id="lw_1245953847_28" class="yshortcuts">The Flying Nun</span>," "<span id="lw_1245953847_29" class="yshortcuts">I Dream of Jeannie</span>" and "<span id="lw_1245953847_30" class="yshortcuts">The Partridge Family</span>."</p>
              <p>Majors became both her boyfriend and her adviser on career
                  matters, and they married in 1973. She dropped his last name from hers
                  after they divorced in 1982.</p>
              <p>By then she had already begun her long relationship with O'Neal. Both Redmond and <span id="lw_1245953847_31" class="yshortcuts">Ryan O'Neal</span> have grappled with drug and legal problems in recent years.</p>

              <p><strong>Hundreds say final farewell to Farrah Fawcett</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - Hundreds of mourners paid
              tribute to Farrah Fawcett as the "Charlie's Angels" star was laid to
              rest in a private ceremony in Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>The 62-year-old actress and pin-up girl died last Thursday after a
              three-year battle with anal cancer, news that was quickly overshadowed
              by the death of King of Pop Michael Jackson later that day.</p>
              <p>Fawcett's
              24-year-old son Redmond, her child with longtime companion Ryan O'Neal,
              was granted compassionate leave from a prison cell to attend.</p>
              <p>Both
              Ryan and Redmond O'Neal served as pallbearers for the service, held at
              Los Angeles Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angeles on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Fawcett
              emerged as a pop-culture icon in the 1970s and 1980s after her role in
              "Charlie's Angels" and appearance in a famous poster wearing a red
              swimsuit that would come to be her defining image.</p>
              <p>During the
              1970s, Fawcett was married to "Six Million Dollar Man" star Lee Majors,
              from whom she separated in 1979. In 1982 she began her long romance
              with actor O'Neal.</p>
              <p>After splitting from O'Neal in the 1990s,
              Fawcett faded from public view, although she appeared in Robert
              Altman's 2000 comedy "Dr T and the Women" in a cast that included
              Richard Gere, Helen Hunt, Laura Dern and Kate Hudson.</p>
              <p>In recent years Fawcett's health was the subject of intense scrutiny by a voracious tabloid media.</p>
              <p>News of her cancer fight broke in October 2006, sparking an outpouring of support from fans and well-wishers.</p>
              <p>In
              2007 she declared that months of grueling chemotherapy had seen her
              beat the cancer despite "excruciating pain and uncertainty."</p>
              <p>"It never occurred to me to stop fighting -- not ever," she said.</p>
              <p>However, in April this year it emerged that the cancer had returned and the actress was gravely ill.</p>
