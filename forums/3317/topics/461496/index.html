              <p>Why the driver did not highlight to the superior that he has no license? Afraid, obedient or what ? What's your guess?

              <p>If you are the superior, will you double check whether the driver has a license or do you think it is common understanding that your driver will know that no license can't drive and will highlight to you if he doesn't have one.</p>
