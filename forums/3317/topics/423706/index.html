              <p>OF THE 100 women listed on Forbes' Most Powerful Women 2010 list, 
              Temasek Holdings' Chief Executive Ho Ching and Singapore Telecom's Group
               Chief Executive Chua Sock Koong are ranked 30th and 71st respectively. 
              It is also interesting to note that apart from them, more than 50 per 
              cent of the 100 women on the list sport short hair.</p>
              <p>Do women feel having short hair projects a more 'masculine' image that gets them accepted in the male-dominated corporate world?</p>
              <p>Former Miss Singapore Teo Ser Lee, 45, who is now an image consultant, agrees.</p>
              <p>'First impressions are made within the first five to seven 
              seconds. So women with shorter hair are perceived to be more serious, 
              more masculine, more authoritative. Women with longer hair are seen as 
              more feminine, sometimes even sexier.'</p>
              <p>The 45-year-old says that even as General Manager of a 
              multi-national corporation, she was often judged based on her appearance
               and discriminated against because she had long hair.</p>
              <p>'They would ask, why is she in long hair and always so 
              dressed up? They would think that maybe she is trying to seduce the 
              clients or she is trying to be sexy,' she shared</p>
              <p>But she persevered - and kept her tresses - and now runs her own successful company, Protocol Academy.</p>
              <p>Angela Ling, a brand and communications manager at MSIG, had
               a different experience. She feels that her long hair did not hinder her
               career progress. Women RazorTV spoke with also added that merit and 
              capability were the main contributing factors to a female executive's 
              career growth.</p>
              <p>More on the debate and some tips from Ms Teo on how female 
              executives can protect their career while retaining their long, 
              glamorous locks.</p>
