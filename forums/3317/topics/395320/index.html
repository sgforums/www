              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">Anger against a beauty chain which went 
              bust last month is escalating. <br> <br> Some 20 customers of the now-defunct beauty shop, Wax In The City, 
              banded together to seek compensation. <br> <br> They turned up at another similar outlet, Silky Temptation, at Circular 
              Road, suspecting that it is run by the same company which owned Wax In 
              the City. <br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The angry women marched up to
               the shop located near Boat Quay. <br> <br> They wanted their money back - and most of them had spent more than 
              $1,000 each for packages at Wax In The City. <br> <br> One of them, Joylyn Ho claimed that its general manager Alexis Zhou had 
              once assured her that the shop will not go bust. <br> <br> "There is one sentence he said to me, my company is so big, there are 
              three outlets. We are having renovations at Boat Quay. If our company 
              Wax in the City ever closes down, my head- chop off, I give you my 
              head." <br> <br> And she was shocked when she found out about the store's closure. <br> <br> She learnt that another shop had taken over Wax in the City's Circular 
              Road branch.<br> <br> And she suspected that the new store is linked to a woman identified as 
              Monica Lee - believed to be Mr Zhou's girlfriend. <br> <br> "Why do I think? Because number one, they are at the same location, same
               address and even if they want to transfer, I don't think it will be an 
              immediate effect. And number two, all the staff that used to work at Wax
               in the City, including the tele-marketers are all now working in this 
              new shop." <br> <br> Ms Lee met the women, but explained to reporters later that she is a 
              shareholder of Silky Temptation and that her company is not linked in 
              any way to Wax in the City. <br> <br> She also said that she broke up with Mr Zhou about two months ago and 
              has no more contact with him. <br> <br> "I hired my ex-colleagues because I could not find therapists." <br> <br> Ms Lee said Silky Temptation merely took over the space vacated by her 
              ex-boyfriend's company. <br> <br> Wax in the City used to have two other outlets - one in Orchard Central 
              shopping mall and another at Craig Road in the Chinatown area. <br> <br> MediaCorp understands its closure left more than 3,000 customers high 
              and dry. <br> And more than 100 have complained to the Consumers Association of 
              Singapore or CASE. <br> <br> Its Executive Director Seah Seng Choon has this advice. <br> <br> "We urge consumers to file their claims with the Small Claims tribunal 
              to get the judgement first. If need be the judgement can be used as a 
              proof for them to claim against the company." <br> <br> It's believed some 300 affected customers have filed reports with the 
              Tribunal. </span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Defunct spa sparks spat</strong></p>
              <p>TWENTY disgruntled customers of defunct nail spa Wax in the City 
              (WITC) on Friday marched down to a new spa - Silky Temptation - 
              demanding compensation for packages they had bought.</p>
              <p>The women claimed that the owner of the two-day-old spa, which has 
              taken over WITC's Circular Road premises, was in cahoots with WITC owner
               Alexis Zhuo.</p>
              <p>They said that Silky Temptation's owner Monica Lee and Mr 
              Zhuo are in a relationship. And given that Ms Lee used to work at WITC 
              as a manicurist, it was too much of a coincidence that Ms Lee was 
              setting up shop at WITC's old location.</p>
              <p>The women - who said they represented some 4,000 people who 
              have bought packages worth between $535 and $1,999 - shouted and 
              demanded that Ms Lee come out of her shop.</p>
              <p>Police were called in to defuse the situation.</p>
              <p>'We want a refund, and we want to find Alexis,' said Ms 
              Joylyn Ho, 32, who bought a package for $1,800 on March 4.</p>
