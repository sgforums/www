              <p>BAGUIO, Philippines â€“
              American military helicopters ferried tons of aid Sunday to a northern
              Philippine mountain region facing shortages of food, gasoline and
              coffins after back-to-back typhoons killed more than 600 in the country.</p>
              <p>Four
              Marine CH-46 helicopters flew to Baguio city, which along with nearby
              provinces was devastated by storm-triggered mudslides that have blocked
              three key access roads to the area, isolating the upland region in
              recent days.</p>
              <p>Workers with bulldozers partly cleared one road
              Sunday, allowing cars but not relief trucks to pass, disaster-response
              agency spokesman Lt. Col. Ernesto Torres said.</p>
              <p>The U.S.
              military was responding to a request from the Philippines to help deal
              with the aftermath of two major storms since Sept. 26. Tropical
              Depression Parma blew out of the country's mountainous north late
              Saturday, allowing U.S. troops to start airlifting food aid to Baguio.</p>
              <p>About 700 Marines and sailors were on hand to help out, said Marine Capt. Jorge Escatell, a U.S. military spokesman.</p>
              <p>The
              helicopters flew to northern San Fernando township, where they picked
              up about 10 tons of food that were delivered to Baguio.</p>
              <p>The
              floods and landslides killed at least 53 people in Baguio, a summer
              tourist destination 130 miles (210 kilometers) north of Manila known
              for its cool climate. Rescuers continued to dig through a huge mound of
              mud in Crescencia village in search of more than 10 residents who were
              still missing, Baguio police chief Agrifino Javier said.</p>
              <p>While
              the weather has cleared, the city of more than 300,000 people faced
              dwindling food and gasoline supplies. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo
              flew in by helicopter Sunday to check the situation.</p>
              <p>"There is
              nearly zero gasoline supply now, and we're running low on food," Javier
              told The Associated Press, adding many foreign tourists were among
              those stranded in the city.</p>
              <p>Gasoline was being rationed and
              residents have been urged to calm after panic-buying emptied several
              stores of canned goods, said disaster-response officer Olive Luces.</p>
              <p>In
              nearby Benguet province, police and volunteer gold miners pulled more
              bodies overnight from houses buried by mudslides late Thursday and
              early Friday, bringing the province-wide death toll from Parma to 175.
              At least 20 people remain missing, provincial police chief Loreto
              Espineli said.</p>
              <p>Most of the dead were recovered in a
              mountainside community called Little Kibungan, where tons of mud and
              floodwaters buried or swept away houses as people slept late Thursday
              after a week of pounding rain, Espineli said.</p>
              <p>Marsman Diang
              said he wept as he frantically dug into the mud Friday for his five
              nieces and nephews in Little Kibungan. Four were found dead, wrapped in
              a bedsheet. One was pulled out barely breathing and did not make it to
              the hospital alive.</p>
              <p>The children's father, Diang's brother,
              left to work in Japan two months ago to raise money for the kids'
              education. "He couldn't talk. I heard him weeping with his wife when I
              called to tell them that their children were gone," Diang said.</p>
              <p>Apart
              from shortage of gasoline, the province has run out of coffins.
              Volunteers were busy making wooden coffins for six bodies found in
              Benguet's capital town of La Trinidad, Espineli said.</p>
              <p>Aside
              from delivering packs of sardines, bottled water and rice in Baguio,
              American and Filipino forces also fanned out in Pangasinan, a
              rice-producing province to its south, to help provide medical
              treatment. Nearly all of Pangasinan was inundated by flooding and water
              released from a major dam, but some areas struggled back to normalcy
              Sunday.</p>
              <p>"I see people drying up rice crop on the roadside. It's
              pretty amazing to me and I think that's a good sign," Escatell told The
              AP.</p>
              <p>With large expanses of land still under water, officials said damage to agriculture and infrastructure reached $312 million.</p>
              <p>Troops
              from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, based in Okinawa, Japan, had
              just finished rescue and cleanup work around Manila, which experienced
              the worst flooding in over 40 years after Tropical Storm Ketsana dumped
              record rains Sept. 26. That disaster displaced about 1 million people
              and killed 337 in the capital and nearby provinces. More than 241,000
              remain in evacuation centers.</p>
              <p>Then Typhoon Parma struck Oct. 3
              and lingered as a tropical depression for about a week before blowing
              away toward China, where two people went missing Sunday after their
              fishing boat capsized.</p>
