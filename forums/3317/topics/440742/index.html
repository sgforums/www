              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>PERTH, AUSTRALIA: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has 
              said that Parliament is a place for serious discussion and not just 
              criticism.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee added that Parliament is not just a place to hold either the government or opposition to account. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Instead both sides should participate in solving problems together, or Singapore would be worse off for it. <br> <br>He
               was speaking to the Singapore media at the end of the three-day 
              Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth on Sunday.<br><br>Earlier
               this month, Singapore's Parliament sat for the first time since the May
               General Election, and members shared their thoughts on the measures 
              needed for the country to prosper.<br><br>Mr Lee said that while the 
              opposition had put a lot of effort into their parliamentary speeches, it
               remains to be seen if they will participate in helping to solve 
              problems.<br><br>"This is not just a show, it's not just theatre. This 
              (Parliament) is a place where we are discussing very serious business 
              and where we have to make very difficult choices for Singaporeans on 
              behalf of our voters," he said.<br><br>"And I think as government, it's 
              our responsibility to speak the truth to Singaporeans and I think it's 
              the opposition's responsibility also to acknowledge the truth and to 
              speak it, whether or not it's politically advantageous to them," added 
              Mr Lee.<br><br>On Singapore's economy, Mr Lee said that there are dark 
              clouds on the horizon,  referring to the latest report from the Monetary
               Authority of Singapore (MAS).<br><br>The MAS report said that 
              Singapore's economic growth will stall over the next few quarters before
               seeing a modest recovery late next year because the long-term 
              structural problems in Europe will not disappear soon. <br><br>Prime Minister Lee added that Singapore is also facing slowing growth because the economy is more mature.<br> <br>"For
               a developed economy, 3, 4% (growth) is not bad. Of course, we've been 
              used to 5,6,7 (percent), or even more in the past, but it's a different 
              phase. When you're an adolescent, you grow and shoot up inches every 
              year. When you're mature you hope to grow, not necessarily taller but 
              wiser and better," said Mr Lee.<br><br>On the government's move to raise
               the minimum qualifying salaries for foreign professionals and skilled 
              workers, Mr Lee said that the government knows it has been painful for 
              employers.<br><br>He added that accepting a lower growth rate is the price to pay for managing the population size in Singapore.<br> <br>Even
               with these challenges, Mr Lee said Singapore should not be too 
              downbeat. He said Singapore hopes to have quality growth - improved 
              productivity for better wages.<br><br>Mr Lee also pointed out that he 
              had met various leaders at CHOGM, all of whom expressed admiration for 
              Singapore and said the country has done very well.<br><br>Referring to his meeting with Western Australia's Premier Colin Barnett, Mr Lee said it is keen to develop links with Singapore.<br><br>Mr Lee concluded that Singapore is "not doing badly", but can do better.<br><br>On CHOGM which had focused on reforms, Mr Lee said it would not be easy to transform the Commonwealth.<br><br>Calling
               the Commonwealth an "old boys' club" brought together by a shared 
              history, he said members work together where they can but they also have
               disagreements.<br><br>On the failed proposal to appoint a watchdog for 
              human rights, Mr Lee said Singapore's support will depend very much on 
              whether such a commissioner will be productive.<br><br>The proposal for 
              an independent commissioner on human rights, democracy and the rule of 
              law was one of the reforms called for by an "Eminent Persons Group" that
               CHOGM itself commissioned two years ago to help it maintain relevancy.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
