               complaints from consumers in the first half of this year, compared to 
              the same period last year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said it received 1,020 complaints so far this year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Timeshares are a form of ownership or rights to the use of property for certain periods during the year. <br><br>More
               than 90 per cent of these complaints are related to rogue agents 
              claiming that they can terminate the timeshares for consumers. <br><br>But many of such deals usually end up as unfulfilled promises. <br><br>CASE adds it has not heard of any successful cases by these agents.<br><br>CASE also advises consumers to go directly to the timeshare company if they want to terminate their contracts.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              <p>I have attended one presentation, and know it is bullshit right away.</p>
              <p>Basically, you buy a title deed to a tiny bit of a prestige property, e.g one room of a hotel. You buy, and you are owner of one room of the hotel for a tenure, of say for example 25 years or there abouts. The price is calculated at the price of the hotel accomodation for a few days for the 25 years. It seems a bargain, your holiday accomodation all taken care of for 25 years, you only need to pay for airfares and shopping.. (You cannot just walk into the hotel and say you want to stay in your room. The hotel receptionist will laugh at you and maybe call the police. They don't recognise your ownership.) You have to make an advance booking, through the Company that sold you the property. The Company also help you in other arrangements like insurance, car rentals etc. The Company can also arrange for you to stay in other 'properties' of equavalent value sold by them, so you don't always have a holiday for 25 years at the same hotel. You can also sell the remaining unused portion of the tenure at a good price, and they'll arrange that too.</p>
              <p>Thats all bullshit.</p>
              <p>They are actually a travel agency, who make bookings and travel plans for you. You are actually paying in advance for your holiday accomodations. They make the booking for you with the hotels and pay for the accomodation for you at the concessionary rate they are specially given.</p>
              <p>Many have found their service beneficial to them. Many have found out that it is not so rosy. </p>
