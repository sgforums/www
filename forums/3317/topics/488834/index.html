              <p>SINGAPORE - A police officer was shot this evening (June 20) at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. <br></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">TODAY understands that an accused who was being escorted at the hospital, began to attack one of the officers when his colleague was away. <br><br></span></p>
              <p>The accused first took hold of the officer's baton and used it to beat him to the ground, before snatching his revolver and then discharging three rounds. <br></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The police also issued a statement confirming the incident:<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"Police confirm that shots were fired at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) on 20 June 2015 at about 7.05pm.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Police had escorted a 24-year-old Singaporean man who had been arrested earlier to KTPH to seek medical attention after he complained of chest pains. While inside a private room in the hospital, the man attempted to escape and struggled with the officer during which shots were fired. <br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He was swiftly brought under control and remains in police custody. The situation is under control and members of the public were not in any danger at any time.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The accused sustained superficial injuries, while the 31-year-old officer sustained gunshot wounds to his thumb and foot. His condition is stable. Police investigations are on-going."<br><br></span></p>

              <p><strong>KTPH shooting: More time needed to assess suspect, psychiatrist says</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The man who allegedly snatched a police officer's revolver and opened fire in Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital (KTPH), injuring a police officer, will have his case heard in two-and-a-half weeks' time.<br></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The State Courts heard on Monday (Jul 20) that the assigned psychiatrist, Dr Steven Pang, needed more time to assess the accused, 23-year-old Muhammad Iskandar Sa'at.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The suspect has sought counsel and is represented by Shashi Nathan from Withers KhattarWong.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Channel NewsAsia understands that as part of the assessment, Iskandar's family members may be interviewed. His family members, three of which were present at the hearing, had secured counsel for him.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Iskandar will be further remanded at Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre. His case will be heard on Aug 6 at 3pm. A pre-trial conference for the capital charge has been fixed at the Supreme Court for Sep 8, Iskandar's defence lawyer said.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If convicted of unlawful discharge of firearms, Iskandar could face the death penalty. He faces two other charges of resistance to lawful apprehension by attempting to escape from the police officer's custody, and for voluntarily causing hurt to a staff sergeant, who ended up with gunshot wounds to his thumb and foot after the incident.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Iskandar was previously charged for motor vehicle theft.</span></p>
