              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's system of meritocracy can be improved for
               the benefit of all, as part of the ideals of a fair and just society, 
              said Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He highlighted this 
              as an area that the country can do better in when he spoke at the 
              Singapore Perspectives seminar on Monday morning.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The seminar also 
              heard from opposition politician Sylvia Lim on how the Workers' Party 
              can contribute to politics in the country. <br> <br>Governing the future
               together will mean casting new roles and ties between the government 
              and citizens, as well as refreshing the values that Singaporeans 
              cherish.<br><br>Mr Wong said while meritocracy ranks top among the 
              values, he stressed that Singapore does not want a system where its 
              people seek to advance individual interests at the expense of others.<br><br>Mr
               Wong said: "We do not want a meritocracy that results in a closed group
               of winners where advantages to any individual are ascribed by birth. 
              What we want is to shape a system of meritocracy in Singapore that works
               for the benefit of all and is consistent with our ideals for a fair and
               just society.<br><br>He added that it is not going to be easy to do this and there are "no ready-made solutions".<br><br>Mr
               Wong, who is also the Senior Minister of State for Communications and 
              Information, also believes that evolving leadership in a new environment
               of active citizenry and civic participation will be more challenging.<br><br>"It
               is not always possible to align everyone to the same view. Leaders also
               have to decide, explain the basis for decisions they make and take 
              responsibility for the outcomes," explained Mr Wong.<br><br>With a 
              general election and two by-elections held recently in the country, the 
              topic of politics was very much predominant at the Singapore.<br><br>Perspectives
               and participants at the seminar wanted to know what role opposition 
              politicians and their parties can play in the country's political 
              development.<br><br>Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim, who was one of 
              the speakers at the seminar, said: "Some people criticise us for being 
              too moderate. Perhaps they want us to be more rebel-rousing and be more 
              vociferous perhaps in some of our objections. Fundamentally, we will 
              have to take the position that we feel is correct by our own beliefs and
               which is sustainable. And one of the factors we take into account is 
              public support.<br><br>Ms Lim added: "We gauge our politics by how far 
              the public supports us. If we find that we have no support for the 
              things we are doing then it is fine for us to review and do things 
              differently. But so far as we can see, we do have public support. 
              Singaporeans do appreciate opposition politics of the sort that we offer
               them, so we humbly take that as a support of us and we will still 
              pursue the line which we think is sustainable and correct."<br><br>Ms 
              Lim said that while political parties may have different ideologies, 
              their focus must still be to ensure the well-being of Singaporeans.<br><br>She
               said: "We need to constantly check ourselves against (being) too 
              embroiled in partisan politics to miss the wood for the trees. The wood 
              here is the people's well-being which should always be the guiding light
               in our actions. We should guard against one-upmanship and ask ourselves
               where lies the greater good.<br><br>"I have personally made it a point 
              to submit submissions to the government in certain policy areas I am 
              familiar with ahead of public debate. My experience shows the ministries
               were objective and took my views on board to revise legislation."<br><br>The opposition politician believes political competition is a safeguard to improve Singaporeans' lives.<br><br>- CNA/al/fa</span></span></p>
