He should be locked up forever for the brutal murders of his fellow singaporeans.

Shame on Tiwary and all his family in singapore. That a*****e should rot in jail. B*****y SAF scholar!</p></div>

              <p><strong>Sydney court finds Tiwary guilty of double murder of Singaporean flatmates</strong></p>
              <p><span>SYDNEY: An Australian court hearing the re-trial of Ram Tiwary on
              Tuesday found him guilty for the double murders of his Singaporean
              flatmates Tan Poh Chuan and Tay Chow Lyang.
              <br> <br>In September 2003, Tiwary's two Singaporean housemates were found
              brutally murdered in Kingsford. All three were engineering students at
              the University of New South Wales.
              <br> <br>Tiwary, who was on a Singapore Armed Forces study award, was
              arrested seven months after the murders, when he tried to leave
              Australia for Singapore. <br> <br> In 2006, Tiwary was convicted of both murders and sentenced to life
              imprisonment without reprieve. However, Tiwary was granted a fresh
              trial at the court of appeal last year. <br> <br> Tiwary claimed at the first trial to have slept through the murders. At
              the retrial which started five weeks ago, he changed his story, saying
              that he had hid and barricaded himself in his room.
              <br> <br> However, the evidence of bloodstains on Tiwary's hands, shorts and feet pointed to his guilt.
              <br> <br>It was also found that Tiwary's baseball bat was used as a murder
              weapon. In this trial, Tiwary was represented by Senior Counsel David
              Dalton, who made several fiery addresses to the jury.
              <br> <br>The jury of eight women and four men at the Supreme Court of New
              South Wales deliberated for close to 17 hours but could not reach a
              unanimous verdict.
              <br> <br> The state of New South Wales can accept a majority verdict of 11-1 after a minimum of eight hours of deliberation.
              <br> <br> The judge ruled that sufficient time had passed, and after a brief recess, the jury delivered the guilty verdict.
              <br> <br>Later, a resigned Tiwary - now 30 years old - was led away in an
              armoured truck, back to prison in Lithgow, three hours northwest of
              Sydney.
              <br> <br>The court meets again for sentencing on November 13. Each of
              Tiwary's two murder charges carries a maximum penalty of life
              imprisonment. Tiwary's family did not comment on the verdict.

              <p><strong>Ram Tiwary sentenced to 48 years</strong></p>
              <p>The former Singaporean student found guilty of murdering two of his
              flatmates in Australia, has been jailed for a maximum 48 years. <br> <br> With parole and time already served the earliest Ram Tiwary can expect to be released is 2042. <br> <br> It was the climax to a murder investigation which began more than six
              years ago when the bodies of Singaporean students Tony Tan Poh Chuan
              and Tay Chow Lyang were found in the apartment they shared with Tiwary
              in this house. <br> <br> Both young men had been clubbed to death with a baseball bat. <br> <br> The horrific nature of the killings sent shock waves through the nearby
              University of New South Wales, where many of the students were also
              Asian. <br> <br> Initially there were fears the murders were racially motivated. <br> <br> But eight months later in a surprise breakthrough, police charged their flatmate Ram Tiwary with their deaths. <br> <br> Then 23, Tiwary was on a scholarship awarded him by the Singapore armed forces. <br> <br> Protesting his innocence, he was later found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. <br> <br> However, an appeal court later ordered a re-trial on the grounds the judge had misdirected the jury. <br> <br> The second trial, which lasted 26 days, again found Tiwary guilty. <br> <br> And today he was told he could expect to spend the next 33 years of his life behind bars. <br> <br> The judge said both murders were violent and savage which elevated the gratvity of the crime. <br> <br> In the case of Tan, the second victim, this was not a spontaneous
              attack, he said, rather an execution to prevent him giving evidence
              against the offender.<br> <br> The prosecution earlier claimed that Ram Tiwary had the "motive, opportunity and capacity" to carry out the murders. <br> <br> The fact that he also owed Mr Tay several thousand dollars in back rent, might also have provided a motive. <br> <br> Tiwary’s relatives, who earlier admitted they were still "terribly
              distraught," were not in court today. Nor were relatives of the dead
              men. <br> <br> But the convicted Singaporean is unlikely to let things rest. <br> <br> His defence team would not confirm whether he is likely to appeal, but
              Tiwary’s courtroom demeanour suggested he was unmoved by the length of
              his sentence. <br> <br> He offered no response before or after the sentence was handed down.</p>
