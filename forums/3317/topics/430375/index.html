              <p><strong>PAP's Women's Wing to strive for louder voice on women's issues: Grace Fu</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Senior Minister of State for National Development and
               Education Grace Fu said the Women's Wing of the People's Action Party 
              (PAP) will strive to give a greater voice for women on issues concerning
               them.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ms Fu, who's also 
              the Vice-Chairman of the Women's Wing, said this is how she hopes the 
              Wing would evolve after the General Election.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ms Fu was speaking to reporters before her thank you and victory parade Saturday morning.<br><br>Ms
               Fu noted the election has shown there was a greater fragmentation on 
              the ground, in which various interest groups wanted their voices to be 
              heard.<br><br>These include groups representing women's issues.<br><br>She
               cited issues involving less privileged women, such as divorcees and 
              single mothers, saying the PAP needs to find better solutions for them.<br><br>"I
               think in the past we tend to take a more neutral stand. We always felt 
              that we represent more than just the women MP, because we have among our
               constituents also men, also the young, the elderly and so on. I think 
              we need to have a voice on women's issues within the party to be louder.
               That I think would probably set the tone going forward," said Ms Fu.<br><br>During
               last week's General Election, Ms Fu defeated her opponent, 62-year-old 
              Ms Teo Soh Lung from the Singapore Democratic Party, garnering 66.9 per 
              cent of valid votes for Yuhua.<br><br>However, her counterpart Mrs Lim 
              Hwee Hua, who was Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and the only 
              woman in Cabinet, lost her seat in Parliament when her Aljunied GRC team
               was defeated by the Workers' Party.<br><br>Ms Fu believes this would not be a setback for women in politics, as she didn't see this as a gender issue.<br><br>But she admitted that it woud have a big impact for the party's Women's Wing which is helmed by Mrs Lim.<br><br>Ms Fu said Mrs Lim had done alot, especially in trying to get the Wing to re-focus on its new mission.<br><br>The 47-year-old also responded to suggestions that she could be the next woman Minister.<br><br>"I
               think there are many outstanding women now, who have been elected. I 
              think there're options for the PM (prime minister) and I'm sure he will 
              make good use of the options that he has...Whether I'm appointed a 
              minister or not, I will continue to serve and that's from the heart," 
              said Ms Fu.<br><br>Ms Fu believes appointing a woman minister should not be a symbolic gesture and stressed that everyone has to earn her spot.<br><br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
