                          Two doctors are suing the Government after alleging that the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) knowingly infringed their intellectual property by coming up with a mobile casualty station which they claim to have designed and patented.<p></p>

                          <p>Dr Mak Koon Hou, a 50-year-old cardiologist, and Dr Ting Choon Meng, a 52-year-old general practitioner who is chairman and chief executive of medical devices company HealthStats International, claim that Mindef's mobile clinic infringes on their patent of a "mobile first aid post" in idea and design specifications.</p>
                          <p>Mindef has denied the allegations and is claiming that the doctors' patent is not valid as the mobile clinic is not new, involved "no inventive step" and was "not capable of industrial application".</p>
                          <p>The Straits Times reported that the doctors started work on the "Station With Immediate First-Aid Treatment", or Swift, medical station after the Sept 11, 2011 terrorists attacks in the United States.</p>
                          <p>They obtained local and international patents in 2005.</p>
                          <p>The 10-tonne truck opens up to become a resuscitation area equipped with surgical devices and lights, a suction system for removing blood, fluids and debris, and emergency life-saving devices.</p>
                          <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force started using the vehicles in 2004 as it wanted a movable facility to stabilise casualties, prioritise treatment for victims and send them to the right place for treatment.</p>
                          <p>The doctors said SCDF paid them royalties for using their invention, which they say won praises from the United States Army and Singapore Technologies Kinetics.</p>
                          <p>Later, they formed MobileStats Technologies to market their mobile medical station.</p>
                          <p>MobileStats Technologies has issued a writ of summons against Mindef for infringing its Singapore patent. They are seeking damages and costs among other things.</p>
                          <p>Dr Ting told a local news source that they felt suing was the only way and that respect for intellectual property is very important.</p>
                          <p>The doctors also claim that they discussed the mobile station with officials over several meetings after Mindef approached them some years ago. However, nothing came out of it.</p>
                          <p>They told the Straits Times that they knew of Mindef's mobile casualty station after Mindef highlighted it in the run-up to National Day Parade in 2011 to improve its emergency response capabilities.</p>
                          <p>According to the English daily, Mindef's version has a ventilator, improved medical dressings to stop bleeding and an on-board water tank to wash wounds.</p>
                          <p>It can be sent to any emergency spot and be transformed into a medical clinic within 15 minutes. It can also treat up to 200 people for a variety of injuries.</p>
                          <p>When contacted, Mindef told The Straits Times that it is inappropriate for the ministry to make any statement as the court case is ongoing.</p>

              <p>the mindef mobile clinic only have special medical dressings and  a blood removal area which is similiar in function to inventors of actual mobile clininc?</p>
              <p>simply a bochap attitude to reverse engineer something  and progress forward without getting in trouble.they saw from someone elses designs.mindef could have placed a hydration units to cure heat stroke victims and law suits wont have any effects on claimants.right now functions of mindef medical mobile clinic is exact same functions as the civilian inventor mobile clininc....even the roof that folds out to a tent looks similiar too!.anyway the company who built the mindef battalion mobile clinic will answer to it really.</p>
              <p>mindef will look weak as usual no matter how big they are .</p>

              <p><br>this is different!the entire thing is registered international and Geneva and other countries are involved and oversseing the patent infringement be it from hollywood movie dvds to apple Ipad to even a rubber blown up doll...all are protected and by international police laws!</p>
              <p>u be lucky mindef only pay the fine if convicted in proceedings with international court of law for patents.its pretty much like a criminal act done by big organisations like they have windows vista using pirated versions or strange altered patched up versions of windows vista.</p>

              <p>remeber that copyright is not exzctly the same as patent infringement.</p>
              <p>in previous cases,subway inc sued a spore sandwhich maker called subway niche.the case is subway inc is not part of subway niche.copyright and trademarks are thus straigh forward. and thats why subway inc of usa lost to subway niche of spore.</p>
              <p>but for mindefs' battalion mobile clinic.if mindef contracted designs from contracter to build exact functions  as civilian mobile clinic with no other new functions like cicvilan mobile clinic has surgery unit and blood removal unit and mindef mobile clinic copied out also has same unit functions as civilian....and no other else newer designs thats added in...then mindef is noit going to win the case.we know ambulance u have no place for surgery etc etc..but so far in patent office that was made and registered, asearch was made worldwide after 1 year that world has nothing of that sort n thus awarded civilian mobile clinic a patent number.</p>
              <p>so if mindef simply just copied the exact blood removal unit..surgery unit..wound dressing unit which is duplicate of the civilian mobile clinic then mindef cant win the case in first place.</p>
              <p>but if mindef had engaged relatively practical people and knowledagable military staff and had incorporated the civilian mobile clinic with a few additions to the civilian mobile clinic like a heatstroke unit and a chemical warefare decontamination automatic unit....then the mobile clinic is entirely different from the civilian mobile clinic.but so far its pretty similiar!the ventilators ,tiger balm dressings and coke machine inside the mindef battalion mobile clinic dun count a thing.</p>

              <h1>The Relationship Between Basic and Improvement Patents</h1>
              <p><strong>Arnold B. Silverman</strong></p>
              <p>The term "basic patent" is frequently used to refer to a pioneering type of patent, such as a patent for the first laser or other comparable earthshaking technology. For the purpose of this article, however, a basic patent may be considered to be any prior patent. An improvement patent is one which adds to the technology of the basic patent.</p>
              <p>In comparing a basic patent and an improvement patent, one may consider whether the improvement technology is patentable over the basic patent. If a third party owns the basic patent, it may also be determined whether the improvement patent can be practiced without infringing the basic patent. In the technical patent context, the word "improvement" generally means technology that builds directly upon a basic patent. In a broader sense, an improvement may be considered to be something that modifies portions of the technology of the basic patent as distinguished from merely providing an alternate approach to achieving the same result.</p>
              <p>Different approaches are taken to determine patentability and infringement. In considering the patentability of an improvement over a prior patent, compare the complete disclosure of the prior patent to determine what it would teach one skilled in the art and then compare that teaching with the improved technology. In evaluating infringement, focus on the claims of the prior patent and compare them with the improvements.</p>
              <p>When considering patentability of an improvement, the entire disclosure of the basic patent is reviewed in order to ascertain whether there are meaningful technical differences between the disclosure of the basic patent and the improvement. If there are technical differences, the improvement has requisite statutory novelty. The next question is whether the differences between the improvement and the disclosure of the basic patent are such that one skilled in the art to which the improvement relates would find the differences obvious at the time the invention was made. If such differences are obvious, then the improvement is not patentable. For example, consider a basic patent that discloses a metal alloy consisting of a base metal and alloying constituent A, which is present in a specified range of weights. The improvement relates to the addition of alloying constituent B in a specified weight to the basic alloy. The central issue would be whether the addition of B would be obvious over the basic patent and any other relevant prior art. In making this evaluation, not only must the obviousness of the use of B be considered, but also whether the amounts employed and results obtained would be obvious. Were any unexpected beneficial properties obtained? Are there any economic, process, or environmental advantages achieved through the use of constituent B? These differences and others can contribute to patentability.</p>
              <p>U.S. patent law enables the inventive entity (i.e., the same inventor or same group of inventors) named in the basic patent to, under certain circumstances, avoid the basic patent being deemed prior art, which is citable against an improvement patent application. If the same inventive entity named in the basic patent files an application on the improvement within one year after issuance of the basic patent, the basic patent is not prior art citable against the improvement application. This is because the statute requires that prior art of this type be invented by another. The identity of the inventive entity in this example means that the basic patent was not issued for the invention of another. If, however, the patent application directed toward the improvement is filed more than one year after the basic patent issues, regardless of inventorship, the basic patent will be a prior art reference that must be considered in evaluating patentability.</p>
              <p>Thus far, this article has centered on the evaluation of whether a patent can be obtained for an improvement invention as compared with a basic prior patent. Another issue of importance is whether someone obtaining an improvement patent can practice the improvement without infringing the basic patent.</p>
              <p>There is a common misconception that obtaining a patent gives the right to practice the patented invention. A patent grants the patent owner a negative right (i.e., the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling the patented invention); it does not give the patentee the right to practice the invention. In many instances, a patented improvement cannot be made, used, or sold without infringing the basic patent.</p>
              <p>A simplistic example: a basic patent is obtained for a chair having three legs. Another may decide that a chair would be more stable if it had four legs and obtains a patent for a chair with four legs. The improvement patent would give the owner the right to keep others from making, using, or selling chairs having four legs. As the original patent claimed a chair with three legs, making, using, or selling the four-legged version would infringe the basic patent. The presence of an additional leg permits the inventor of the improvement to obtain a patent, but does not avoid infringement of the basic patent for a chair with three legs.</p>
              <p>The analysis between a basic patent and an improvement patent, therefore, involves an initial inquiry as to whether the issue is one of patentability over the basic patent or infringement of the basic patent. The factual determinations and legal evaluations are different depending upon which type of evaluation is being made.</p>
              <p>In evaluating patentability in comparing a basic patent with an improvement patent, not only the technology involved but also the identity of the inventors can be important. If there is common ownership or if a license has been granted by the owner of the basic patent to the owner of the improvement, infringement would not be a problem.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">In any event, what does this cartoon have to do with <a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/patent/"><strong><span style="color: #00009c;">patent law</span></strong> or </a><a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/inventing/"><strong><span style="color: #00009c;">innovation</span></strong>?  Plenty really.  By far, most inventions are improvements upon other known devices or solutions.  In fact, whenever I teach patent law courses I tell students that in their career as a patent attorney they are unlikely to ever come across a pioneering invention, which I will define as an invention that is the first of its kind.  Even </a><a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/05/16/famous-inventors-thomas-edison/id=3454/"><strong><span style="color: #00009c;">Thomas Edison</span></strong></a>, the most prolific inventor in US history, rarely came up with pioneering inventions.  What Edison had the knack for was taking something that someone else had come up with and making it extraordinarily better.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Frequently I am asked whether you can take a component from one product and put it together with a component from another product and file a patent application.  The answer to that question is yes, provided that the combination that you have come up with is considered new (i.e., never before done) and non-obvious (i.e., would not be considered to be merely a common-sense based combination).  Now those familiar with <a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/patent/"><strong><span style="color: #00009c;">patent law</span></strong></a> know that I just condensed hundreds legal principles and decisions into a single sentence in defining what is <a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/patent/patentability-requirements/nonobviousness/"><strong><span style="color: #00009c;">new</span></strong></a> and <a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/patent/patentability-requirements/nonobviousness/"><strong><span style="color: #00009c;">nonobvious</span></strong></a>, but the truth is for the average inventor nuanced understanding of what patent law treats as new and nonobvious is not required.  Ask yourself whether the identical invention has ever been made before and whether others in the relevant technical field would consider it a trivial or common sensical combination of parts.  If you are honest with yourself you will be about 70% of the way to deciding whether filing a patent makes sense.  If you have a patent search done and are honest with yourself then you are 85% of of the way to deciding, provided of course the invention has market possibilities, which is another story for another day.</p>
              <div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px;"><a href="http://ipwatchdog.com/patent/invent-patent-system/"><img src="http://ipwatchdog.com/images/invent_patent_33a.png" alt="" width="250" height="173"></a>

              </div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Returning to our electro-shock chair, this is a combination of parts known to exist.  These combination of parts likely result in a device never before made, which is likely a safe assumption so lets go with that in lieu of doing a patent search, although you may want to give it a whirl and see what you find.  For information on how to do a patent search see <strong><a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/patent/patent-searching/"><span style="color: #00009c;">Patent Searching 101</span></a></strong>.  In any event, for purposes of this discussion let’s proceed assuming for now that this invention would qualify as being novel, and therefore satisfying the newness requirement.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The real question then becomes whether the invention is nonobvious.  This is, in fact, the question that is most important in most patentability assessments.  So what do you think?  Much of the invention seems like it would be expected to go along with an office chair, namely the ergonomic design and certain other visible features.  The heated seat and massaging maybe are different for an office chair, but are well known to exist in some chairs, as is the reclining feature, so even though we may not be able to find all those features in an office chair they could be found in chairs, so the relevant someone would find those to be obvious, but the electro-shock feature seems to scream non-obvious to me, how about you?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In truth no one can give you a guarantee that any particular invention will be nonobvious, particularly now given that the Supreme Court changed obviousness law less than 8 months ago in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/04-1350.pdf"><strong><span style="color: #00009c;">KSR v. Teleflex</span></strong>.  But what can be said is that the less likely a certain combination would be made the more likely the invention is nonobvious and can be patented.  Unfortunately, it is not merely enough to say it has never been done before, but if it hasn’t been done before and the invention solves a particular problem that could help as well.</a></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Given what I have seen patented in the past, a chair with integrated radio, a pillow with integrated radio, a hair brush with integrated radio… do you see a pattern? I would have to say this device is probably nonobvious, but then the next question needs to be to  yourself.  What do you plan to do with a patent if it issues, and will anyone want to buy the product?  These are not patent questions, but extremely important to consider.  But that is another story for another day.</p>

              <p>Typically, a party which manufactures, imports, uses, sells, or offers for sale patented technology, during the term of the patent and within the country that issued the patent, is considered to infringe the patent.</p>
              <p>The test varies from country to country, but in general it requires that the infringing party's product (or method, service, and so on) falls within one or more of the <a title="Claim (patent)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Claim_(patent)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">claims</span></span></a> of the patent. The process employed involves "reading" a claim onto the technology of interest. If all of the claim's elements are found in the technology, the claim is said to "read on" the technology; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if a single element from the claim is missing from the technology, the claim does not literally read on the technology and the technology does not infringe the patent</span> </strong>with respect to that claim.</p>
              <p>In response to allegations of infringement, an accused infringing party will generally assert one or more of the following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>it was not practicing the patented invention; </li>
              <li>it was not performing any infringing act in the territory covered by the patent; </li>
              <li>the patent has expired; </li>
              <li>the patent (or the particular claim(s) alleged to be infringed) is invalid, because the invention in question does not meet <a title="Patentability" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Patentability"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">patentability</span></span></a> or includes a formal defect, rendering the patent invalid or unenforceable; </li>
              <li>it has obtained a license under the patent; </li>
              <li>the patent holder is infringing patent rights belonging to the accused infringing party, and the party may resolve the dispute in settlement or <a title="Cross-licensing" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Cross-licensing"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cross-licensing</span></span></a>. </li>

              <p>In certain jurisdictions, there is a particular case of patent infringement called "indirect infringement." Indirect infringement can occur, for instance, when a device is claimed in a patent and a third party supplies a product which can only be reasonably used to make the claimed device.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>Let us begin by discussing how a utility patent is infringed. Infringement may be direct or indirect.</p>
              <p><strong>Direct Infringement: </strong>A patent is directly infringed if a product or process incorporates all of the elements of an independent claim of the patent. The independent claim in a patent may have the following format.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. An apparatus comprising:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Element A;</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Element B; and</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Element C.</p>
              <p>Products that incorporate Elements A, B and C literally infringe Claim 1. Conversely, products that incorporate less than all of Elements A, B and C do not literally infringe Claim 1. For example, a product that incorporates Elements A and B but not C does not literally infringe Claim 1. As such, <strong>to avoid literal infringement</strong> of a patent, one must not literally practice (i.e., make, use, offer for sale or import) all of the limitations recited in the independent claims of the patent.</p>
              <p>However, even though a claim of the patent is not literally infringed, infringement can still be found under the <strong>Doctrine of Equivalents (a.k.a. DOE)</strong>. This doctrine stands for the proposition that even if a product does not literally infringe a claim because it does not incorporate one or more of the elements of the claim, infringement can still be found if the product or process incorporates a feature that is <strong>insubstantially different</strong> with respect to the missing element. As such, a product which incorporates Elements A and B and a feature which is insubstantially different with respect to Element C still infringes the patent under the Doctrine of Equivalents.</p>
              <p>To determine whether the element can be broadened under the doctrine of equivalents, the communications between the patentee and Patent Office must be reviewed to determine whether there are any statements or claim amendments that would prevent or limit the application of the Doctrine of Equivalents.  The law would not permit a patentee to make statements to the Patent Office that D is a substantial difference compared to element C during review at the Patent Office but argue during litigation that D is actually an insubstantial difference.</p>
              <p><strong>Hence, to avoid infringement of a patent, changes to a product or process must be made to avoid literal infringement and infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Myth</strong>: The <strong>percentage difference</strong> of a product compared to a patented product does not indicate whether the product infringes on claims of the patent. Patent infringement is found either literally or under the Doctrine of Equivalents.</p>
              <p><strong>Indirect Infringement: </strong>Liability for patent infringement may be found indirectly (1) when one actively induces another to infringe a patent or (2) when one offers to sell … or imports … a component of a patented machine … for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial non-infringing use.</p>
