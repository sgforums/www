              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Mr Tan Chuan-Jin said the government will continue to
               moderate foreign worker numbers to ensure they complement the local 
              workforce.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Minister of 
              State for Manpower and National Development was speaking in Parliament 
              on the third day of the debate on the President's Address. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"We were aware of 
              the impact of the growth in (foreign workers) numbers and began 
              calibrating to rein in the growth, beginning in June 2009. There was 
              another round in July 2010, and recently in July 2011... The next date 
              would be January 2012," said Mr Tan. <br><br>"It was a combination of 
              increasing levies, tightening entry and qualifications criteria, 
              increasing qualifying salaries, so as to moderate foreign worker 
              reliance and ensure foreign workers continue to complement our local 
              workforce. We will continue to watch this front closely," he added.<br><br>Also
               speaking in Parliament were many MPs who called for greater support for
               low-wage workers, women and PMETs (Professionals, Managers, Executives 
              and Technicians) to secure jobs.<br><br>Labour MP Zainal Sapari called for bold steps to help low-wage workers earn better salaries.<br><br>He wanted the drive for their sustained wage growth to be a key performance indicator (KPI) for all government agencies.<br><br>He
               also wanted the current target to increase their real wages over the 
              next 10 years to be revised from the current 30 per cent to 50 per cent.<br><br>Mr Zainal also urged a re-look at the strategy of outsourcing manual or <br>blue-collar jobs in the public service.<br><br>"We
               cannot afford to have any ministry or organisation take a 'bochap' 
              attitude in ensuring better wages and working conditions for their 
              workers. For a start, every ministry and government-related organisation
               must take ownership of the Inclusive Growth Programme," said Mr Zainal.<br><br>Opposition MP Yaw Shin Leong called for the government to put Singaporeans first when formulating manpower policies.<br><br>He
               said the goal should be to strike the right balance between an 
              efficient system of manpower supply and to achieve the best outcome for 
              employers, employees and above all, Singaporeans.<br><br>He called for the Employment Pass and S-Pass system to be more transparent.<br><br>"Figures
               showing a breakdown of the different categories of passes issued, and 
              across different industries are not released to the public. Why this 
              secrecy? We need regular reports showing the relative standings of 
              Singaporeans and pass-holders," said Mr Yaw.<br><br>"Singaporeans have 
              expressed their concerns about losing their jobs to foreign workers. 
              With the release of such detailed figures, it will help us better 
              understand the need for foreign manpower across various industries... 
              Transparency will also go far in removing insecurity on the part of 
              Singaporean workers and cool unwarranted anti-immigration sentiments."<br><br>Other MPs called for more support to encourage employers to hire PMETs, particularly those above 40.<br><br>MP
               for Chua Chu Kang GRC, Low Yen Ling, said: "We need leaders in 
              government, business and education to be creative, and be willing to 
              consider solutions they have not tried before. The government can take 
              the lead to support and encourage employers to desire and value the 
              benefits of employing PMETs above 40."<br><br>MP for Nee Soon GRC, 
              Patrick Tay, said: "We do not doubt the need for foreign PMETs in 
              certain specialised and niche industries. Instead, we cannot and should 
              not fall into a situation where employers can choose foreigners as an 
              easy option when they fail to recruit Singaporeans."<br><br>There were also calls for the government to make it easier for women to re-enter the workforce.<br><br>MP
               for West Coast GRC, Foo Mee Har, said: "Can we not consider a special 
              grant to encourage employers to offer re-induction to women returning to
               the workforce? Under this scheme, companies can obtain grants from the 
              government for a limited period of time, perhaps three to six months, 
              for hiring women returning into the workforce."<br><br>Manpower issues aside, there were also calls to reduce the number of foreign students in schools and universities.<br><br>MP
               for Mountbatten, Lim Biow Chuan, said: "I urge MOE to gradually reduce 
              the number of foreign students to not more than 10 per cent of each 
              class in our schools or universities. This is especially so for the 
              popular faculties like Medical School and Law School, which would allow 
              entry for more Singaporeans."<br><br>On tackling problem gambling, MP 
              for Nee Soon GRC Lee Bee Wah wanted more measures to prevent 
              Singaporeans from visiting the two casinos in Singapore. She suggested 
              increasing the levy amount imposed on Singaporeans and doing away with 
              the annual passes.<br><br>She said foreign workers should also be prevented from going to casinos.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>No tightening of foreign worker quotas: MOM</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM) emphasised on 
              Friday that it has not tightened foreign worker quotas. What it has done
               is to tighten the entry criteria for the various work passes to raise 
              the standards and quality of the workers. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Replying to a 
              question in Parliament on Friday, Minister of State for Manpower Tan 
              Chuan-Jin said the government will periodically review the need for 
              further adjustments while providing lead time for companies to adjust. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However, businessman and MP for Jurong GRC, David Ong, argued that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have their concerns. <br><br>He
               said: "The SMEs, most of them are feeling ... squeezed out, a noose 
              around their neck. They understand the rationale of government policies 
              but the pace is too quick for them. They couldn't find the workers to 
              fill those places vacated because of the non-renewal of their skilled 
              labour.<br><br>"They are grappling with business survivability. We are 
              hoping that the government can look at customising some of these 
              (measures by) implementing timings for certain industries."<br><br>Mr 
              Tan replied: "We are quite aware of these concerns and in the dialogue 
              we have shared with them our initiatives as well. We do have a wide 
              range of initiatives. <br><br>"What is key we feel is the associations 
              could do a lot more, companies which cluster together as they do share 
              common practices. How do you share the best practices amongst them and 
              as an association and industry how do you help each other.<br><br>"We have endeavoured to give lead time before these measures kick in and this is something we will continue to do so. <br><br>"One
               of the feedback, and we will act on this, is we will repeat these 
              announcements quite clearly to make sure that the message is sent out 
              and the receiver will hear it and understand that. That will give them 
              the lead time.<br><br>"The important thing is ... helping our 
              Singaporean companies to manage this transition. The emphasis is on 
              transitioning to a much higher productivity growth in terms of relying 
              on the same number of labour or perhaps with reduced number of workers. <br><br>"This is important, at the same time ensuring the SMEs continue to thrive because they provide jobs for many Singaporeans."  <br><br>Mr
               Tan added: "We recognise the difficulties many SMEs face in recruiting 
              Singaporeans. The government has introduced specific initiatives to help
               SMEs re-engineer their operations and reduce their reliance on labour. <br><br>"One
               example is the SME Productivity Roadmap (SME-PRO), a joint initiative 
              by the WDA and SPRING Singapore, which provides a systematic, three-step
               approach for SMEs to improve their productivity. <br><br>"A dedicated 
              portal provides SMEs access to information and resources to help them 
              take concrete actions to raise productivity. One feature of the portal 
              is an online productivity calculator for businesses to work out their 
              productivity levels and to benchmark this against industry levels."<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
