              <p>Artillery fire on Korean border</p>
              <p id="story_continues_1" class="introduction">South Korea says it has returned fire after North Korea fired around 200 artillery shells onto one of its border islands, reportedly killing one marine.</p>
              <p>The South's military was placed on its highest non-wartime alert after the shells landed on Yeonpyeong island.</p>
              <p>North Korea has not yet commented on the incident, in which three marines and two civilians were also injured.</p>
              <p>Correspondents say this is one of the most serious since the the Korean War ended without a peace treaty in 1953.</p>
              <p>There have been occasional cross-border clashes since, but the latest incident comes at a time of rising regional tension.</p>
              <p>North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong-il is believed to be ill and trying to engineer the succession of his youngest son. And on Saturday, North Korea showed off what it claimed was a new uranium enrichment facility - potentially giving it a second route to a nuclear weapon.</p>
              <p>The move prompted the US special representative for North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, to rule out the resumption of six-party talks on resolving the nuclear issue.</p>
              <p>South Korean presidential spokesman Kim Hee-jung also said it was investigating a possible link between the artillery attack and recent maritime exercises near the western sea border earlier on Tuesday.</p>
              <p><span class="cross-head">'Illegal firing'</span></p>
              <p>South Korean officials said artillery rounds began landing on Yeonpyeong island, near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border about 100km (60 miles) west of the Korean Peninsula.</p>

              <p id="story_continues_2">"A North Korean artillery unit staged an illegal firing provocation at 1434 (0534 GMT) and South Korean troops fired back immediately in self-defence," the defence ministry said.</p>
              <p>A resident on the island, where between 1,200 and 1,300 people live, told the AFP news agency that dozens of houses were damaged, while television pictures showed plumes of smoke rising above the island.</p>
              <p>"Houses and mountains are on fire and people are evacuating. You can't see very well because of plumes of smoke," a witness on the island told YTN television station. "People are frightened to death."</p>
              <p>The military said one marine was killed and three others were injured, according to South Korea's YTN television. Two civilians were also hurt.</p>
              <p>The South Korean military has fired 80 artillery shells in response and also deployed fighter jets to Yeonpyeong.</p>
              <p>However, President Lee Myung-bak urged officials attending an emergency cabinet meeting to try to prevent any further escalation.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said that both countries should "do more to contribute to peace".</p>
              <p>"What's imperative now is to restart six-party talks as soon as possible," Hong Lei told a news conference in Beijing.</p>
              <p>News of the incident has already been felt on international financial markets, with both the Korean won and the Japanese yen falling in value.</p>
              <p>This western maritime border, also known as the Northern Limit Line, has been the scene of numerous clashes between the two Koreas in the past.</p>
              <p>In March, a South Korean warship went down near the border with the loss of 46 lives.</p>
              <p>International investigators say a North Korean torpedo sank the ship, although Pyongyang has denied any role in the incident.</p>
              <p>Since then relations between the two neighbours have remained tense.</p>

              <p><strong>N.Korea shells S.Korea island, 4 troops wounded</strong></p>
              <p>SEOUL (AFP) - – Several North Korean artillery shells landed on a 
              South Korean border island Tuesday wounding four soldier, damaging homes
               and injuring two civilians, YTN television reported.</p>
              <p>A resident of Yeonpyeong island near the tense Yellow Sea border told
               YTN by phone that some 50 shells landed and dozens of houses were 
              damaged.</p>
              <p>The South's defence ministry could not immediately confirm damage or casualties.</p>
              <p>"A North Korean artillery unit staged an illegal firing provocation 
              at 2:34 pm (0534 GMT) and South Korean troops fired back immediately in 
              self-defence," a ministry spokesman told AFP.</p>
              <p>Another island resident, Lee Jong-Sik, told YTN: "At least 10 houses
               are burning. I can't see clearly for the smoke. The hillsides are also 
              on fire.</p>
              <p>"We were told by loudspeakers to flee our homes."</p>
              <p>TV footage showed huge plumes of smoke rising from the island.</p>
              <p>The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed that some shells landed 
              directly on the island, where a South Korean Marine detachment is based,
               and others in nearby waters.</p>
              <p>The incident comes amid high cross-border tensions over the North's 
              nuclear programme and the deadly sinking of a South Korean warship near 
              the border in March.</p>

              <p><strong>UPDATE: 1 S. Korean soldier killed as N. Korea fires artillery near western border</strong></p>
              <p>Seoul (The Korea Herald/ANN) - North Korea fired dozens of coastal 
              artillery shells, some of which fell on the South's Yeonpyaong Island 
              near the tense western inter-Korean border, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
              said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"The North fired dozens of artillery rounds from its Gaemeori western
               coastal artillery base at 14:34 p.m. In response to the military 
              provocations, we fired back dozens of rounds with K9 self-propelled 
              howitzers," JCS spokesman Col. Lee Bung-woo told reporters.</p>
              <p>In the artillery firing, one soldier was killed and four marine 
              solider were seriously injured. The military was trying to evacuate 
              civilians on the island near the border. Several civilians were reported
               to have suffered injuries.</p>
              <p>The firing came as the South was carrying out a live-fire exercise in
               waters off the Bangnyeong Island and the Yeonpyeong Island as part of 
              the annual nine-day Hoguk Exercise, aimed at enhancing inter-operability
               and defense capabilities against North Korea.</p>
              <p>Regarding the Hoguk Exercise, the North sent a faxed message to the 
              South in the morning, saying it would not "just sit back" while the 
              South is carrying out the live-fire exercise, according to JCS 
              officials.</p>
              <p>"Our military has begun operating the crisis management system and 
              strengthened a readiness posture in all military branches. We are fully 
              and firmly prepared to respond to additional North Korean provocations,"
               Lee said.</p>
              <p>The JSC called on the North to immediately stop acts that ratchet up
               military tension on the peninsula and inter-Korean confrontations. "We 
              will strongly respond to any further provocations from the North," the 
              spokesman said.</p>
              <p>The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae said it was looking into 
              whether the North fired the artillery in reaction to the South Korean 
              navy's 'Hoguk Exercise' near the island.</p>
              <p>"North Korea wired a complaint this morning asking whether (the 
              exercise) was an attack against the North," President Lee Myung-bak's 
              spokesperson Kim Hee-jung said during a press briefing.</p>
              <p>Lee held emergency meetings of his top aides and security related ministers in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>The volley of artillery came as tensions have run high between the 
              two Koreas following the March 26 sinking of the corvette Cheonan, which
               Seoul holds Pyongyang responsible for.</p>
              <p>The Seoul-led multinational investigation team concluded in May that
               a North Korean midget submarine torpedoed the 1,200-ton corvette, 
              killing 46 sailors. Pyongyang has persistently denied its involvement.</p>
              <p>In August, the North fired some 130 coastal artillery shells into 
              waters near the western inter-Korean maritime border. Some 10 coastal 
              artillery shells landed in waters about 1-2 kilometers south of the 
              Northern Limit Line off Bangnyeong Island.</p>
              <p>The volley of the artillery fire came after the South Korean 
              military finished its five-day maritime maneuvers in the West Sea, which
               were designed to enhance its defense capabilities against North Korean 
              provocations.</p>
              <p>The artillery firing came as a surprise as North Korea experts here 
              largely anticipated that the communist state would seek to improve ties 
              with its southern neighbor as it has been striving to solidify its 
              second hereditary power succession.</p>
              <p>The North has recently made it public that its leader Kim Jong-il's 
              youngest son Jung-un is being groomed to succeed his ailing father. 
              Jung-un has recently been made a four-star general and appointed as vice
               chairman of the ruling Worker's Party's Central Military Commission.</p>
