              <p>South Korea is very small country, even smaller than Taiwan so
              it doesn't take much for North Korea to invade South. Plus Seoul is
              only 50km from the border. USA is bogged down in Afganistan and
              Iraq but will be able to offer quick air and navy support to South
              and buy enough time for the US Marines to repel a potential North
              invasion.</p>
              <p>What I think South should do is also to enrich Uranium and then
              develop their own Nuclear weapon then Kim Jong Il will wet his own
              pants.</p>
              <p>Also Japan already has its own space rocket programme and their
              own nuclear reactors, so it is kacang puteh for Japan to develop
              their own nuclear missles. Then North Korea will think twice about
              launching artillery attacks to antagonize South and Japan.</p>

              <p>SEOUL -THE bodies of two civilians were found on Wednesday on a South
               Korean island a day after it was shelled by North Korean artillery, the
               coastguard said, bringing the death toll to four.</p>
              <p>A spokesman told AFP the bodies were found as coastguards searched the ruins of homes destroyed by the shelling.</p>
              <p>Both were men believed aged in their sixties.</p>
              <p>The military earlier said the shellfire killed two marines 
              based on Yeonpyeong island and injured 15 marines plus three civilians.</p>

              <p>Who say. North Korea's military budget is like 30% (Or 25%) when SK is like 1/10 of it (Bcoz South not like North wat Military first shotgun policy). N K has soldiers of 1.1 mil when SK do not even have 500k soldiers, if I am not wrong, already included the US troops.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Yes, the North have nuke that sucks. It is not Hydrogen bomb. Yes, the North's weapon not as advanced as South. So, no, if South more aggressive, it only helps to reduce world population instead of an easy win and flood the North. Dun forget that North have better territoral advantage than South as it is more mountanious than South. If South can swamp North, then US + NATO can swap Afghan and Iraq liao.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>FYI: the national military budget of the SOUTH DOES dwarf the NORTH's. check it up will ya? the national budget of the north alone is pathetic. the army of the north is weak, poorly equipped and has rock-bottom morale. her air force? vintage russian WW2 crap. the south airforce? F-22s from the US. a specialised missile defence system. a Navy that does dwarf the north in technology and capacity.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>As i said, the north budget is PATHETIC. how should u compare it to the south? AND, these days, truman's saying of "how many divisions have you?" is so irrelavent now. look at the gulf war. iraq had the world's fourth largest combat ready army in the world. what happened? the US sent in a series of synchronised airstrikes, wiped out the attacking capability of the iraqis. and FYI: the south's miitary budget, if measuredÂ in dollars, DOES dwarf the north's tenfold, get it?</p>
              <p>kim jong11 is prob the stupidest man alive right now. provoking the south is basically like an ant biting the toe of a gaint. how can u fight well when ur army is poorly equipped, ur airforce is vintage and rotting, ur navy cant even match up to ur enemy's and u r dirt poor with no proper supplies for ur troops?</p>
              <p>and lastly, please dont try to bring in the issue of china defending the north. in the first place, this is what really happened. the US DID NOT LOSE. in fact, macarthur would have occupied the whole of china if the senate allowed him. no, it was the wierd peace-movement that stopped the whole war on both sides. AMERICA does have the agressiveness and strengthÂ back then AND NOW and she is not afraid to defend the north even if it means invading the china and unleashing her nuclear arsenal.</p>
              <p>u guys think china is that great? heads up, the US and the south arent 'ants' either. consider that.</p>

              <p>.........an island bombardment???????thats odd indeed.....it seems as if someone wants to be seen as firing at south korea.......and posing as noth korea.thats indeed quite odd.,,,,normally it would take alot of aiming to fire on an island.......this sounds like an artillery or a deck gun fired from a submarine or a ship at sea.</p>
              <p>why go thru all this trouble unless people firing it on south korean island wasnt north korean in the first place!!!it makes more sense if artillery was fired on DMZ zone and not some island.....</p>
              <p>why not on south korean main island...why is it always far away at sea or another island?</p>

              <p>Yes, North dont have the economy to take the war, but neither South has. South's main economy area @ Seoul, which is so close to North DMZ, once a war starts, North will push their outdated artillery to destory Seoul and much of South power is disrupted. Dun forget that North has some lousy nukes to help when South have none, and an order from US takes time, even though you can safely assume North wont use their nukes, one of the reason is US counter attack and the other is both are Korean race afterall. Oh yeah, North's propaganda is like machine, so those robots infantry cannon folders will have higher morale than you thought. It is the present South is so Westernized that the young have many other better things to do that being patiriot until to die for the country is not the first thought they have, unlike North.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Dun underestimate North and China as well. Last time US dun attack China as well because North side also got difficulty due to terrain and weather constraint, how can US go further up and eat China? Furthermore, the borders of North - China / USSR is aided by Soviets limitedly. If US greedy go attack China and clean North, sure both of them may not have the power considered that US got UN support, but USSR by then will surely go out all, and start World War 3, and crush US as well. China, North / South Korea, US and USSR will suffer the consequences of nuclear holocaust then. So, it is not that simple as you think.</p>

              <p>Yes, ICBM and ABM to reduce South's nuke order from US time.

If they, especially the Russians allowed, then the Eastern Europe thing should be smoothly done.</p>
