              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The Court
               of Appeal on Thursday reserved judgement on prominent surgeon Dr Susan 
              Lim's attempt to overturn a High Court decision against her for 
              overcharging her patient, a member of the Brunei royal family.<br><br>Dr
               Lim was appealing against the decision to allow the Singapore Medical 
              Council (SMC) to convene a second disciplinary committee to hear her 
              case.<br><br>A hearing before the SMC's disciplinary committee halted 
              abruptly without a decision in July last year following accusations by 
              Dr Lim's lawyers that the panel had prejudged the case.<br><br>Dr Lim 
              has been embroiled in the high-profile case over her S$12 million bill 
              for treating a cancer patient - the sister of the Brunei queen - over 
              seven months in 2007. <br><br>Dr Lim, who's represented by Senior 
              Counsel Lee Eng Beng from Rajah and Tann, told the court that the SMC 
              has failed in its statutory obligation to provide a disciplinary process
               that is fair.<br><br>Mr Lee argued that the decision made by the Council to reconvene the disciplinary committee was not valid.<br><br>His argument was based on two emails, dated September 3 and 13 last year, sent to members of the Council by its secretariat. <br><br>The
               emails informed members about the Council's decision to appoint a 
              second disciplinary committee and that if no responses were received 
              from any member, the decision would be deemed to be unanimous.<br><br>Mr
               Lee claimed that the emails also do not contain sufficient information 
              and do not advise the members of what had happened and what 
              considerations they need to bear in mind before they could make a proper
               decision.<br><br>He also showed an affidavit filed by a member of the 
              SMC, Dr Wilmot Rasanayagan, who said that he rejected the appointment of
               the second disciplinary committee.<br><br>The court has ordered that 
              the SMC provides affidavits from members who received the emails to 
              ascertain that they read and understood the decision by the Council.<br><br>The SMC represented by Mr Alvin Yeo from Wong Partnership has asked the court to dismiss the appeal.<br><br>Mr
               Yeo said that the charges against Dr Lim be allowed to be fully 
              investigated in a formal inquiry by the second disciplinary committee.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
