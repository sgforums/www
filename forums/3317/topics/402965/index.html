              <p>magine living in a S$28,000-a-month rented estate where famous 
              Hollywood celebrities such as Paris Hilton’s sister Nicky, Ugly Betty 
              star America Ferrera and British singer Leona Lewis are your neighbours.</p>
              <p>If luck is on your side, you could even cross paths with Brad Pitt 
              and Angelina Jolie who are also said to own a property in the vicinity.</p>
              <p>Sounds too good to be true?</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Hollywood+Hills&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Hollywood Hills</a> estate is the place singer <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Ho+Yeow+Sun&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ho Yeow Sun</a>, 40, popularly known as Sun Ho, calls 
              home since spending much of her time in Los Angeles for her music 
              career.</p>
              <p>She is the wife of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Reverend+Kong+Hee&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Reverend Kong Hee</a>, 45, of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=City+Harvest+Church&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">City Harvest Church</a> and has been commuting between 
              Singapore and the U.S. since 2003.</p>
              <p>According to <em>The New Paper</em>, the Hollywood estate Ms Ho has 
              been renting for the past year is listed for sale at S$7.7 million. It 
              was reported that Ms Ho lives there with her son, an assistant, a nanny 
              and her relatives.</p>
              <p>The profile of residents in the neighbourhood is said to comprise 
              millionaires and high-profile businessmen who have bought homes there to
               enjoy the quiet, peaceful surroundings, with a low crime rate and 
              regular police patrols.</p>
              <p>The report’s detailed description also indicates that the dark green 
              Spanish Mediterranean style building Ms Ho is renting stands out from 
              the rest of the properties in the area due to its large size.</p>
              <p>The estate stands on 29,000 sq ft of land or about a third of a 
              soccer field. It comprises a main house, three self-contained 
              structures, with quarters for a butler, nanny and maid. Not only does it
               boast a swimming pool, a sundeck and a two-car garage, its driveway 
              still has space for another 9 cars.</p>
              <p>The total built-up area of the estate is 6,766 sq ft or about the 
              size of 5 five-room HDB flats, while the 4,135 sq ft main house has four
               bedrooms.</p>
              <p>The paper also noted the reaction of the house agent who described Ms
               Ho as “Singapore’s top singer and entertainer” while a neighbour said 
              she was very “sophisticated and seems traditional” as she often hosts 
              gatherings for traditional festivities such as Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>Back in Singapore, the couple has also made some big property moves 
              through the years. They started off in a five-room HDB flat in Tampines 
              which was purchased at S$127,000 before selling it for S$420,000.  They 
              then moved to a unit at Horizon Towers costing S$1 million in River 
              Valley before selling it off to buy a new apartment at The Suites at 
              Central on Devonshire Road, said to be worth about S$2.6million.</p>
              <p>Ms Ho returned to Singapore last Monday to assist the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Commercial+Affairs+Department&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Commercial Affairs Department (CAD)</a> in an 
              investigation into alleged misuse of church funds. She was said to have 
              been grilled by police for more than eight hours.</p>
              <p>Her husband, Mr Kong also explained his silence in a Facebook post on
               his account. He said, “Because we’re in the midst of the investigation,
               I am unable to provide any details about the progress besides what 
              already has been released by the Singapore Police in their statement to 
              the press.”</p>
              <p>“But I would like to assure everyone that I, together with the 
              Management Board of the church, am fully cooperative in providing the 
              necessary information needed for the investigation,” he wrote.</p>
              <p>The couple and at least 16 others connected to the City Harvest 
              Church are currently assisting the CAD in ongoing investigations.</p>
