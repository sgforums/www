              <p>Anyway I think the REAL loss of an lady MP that step down is Ms Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (ç¬¦å–œæ³‰). I used to live around Jurong area and those citizen living there would agreed that she is really an outstanding and cared for her resident MP.Can you imagine that she served for Jurong for about an decade before she is appointed as an Mayor ! Still she is one of the ladies that deserved respect and recognition in Singapore.Just too bad that she have been step down and nobody can replaced her selfless spirit and her uniqueness ...</p>

              <p>I know Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Holland Bt Timah for 2 terms) and I have never had the impression she is caring. Btw, she is *extremely* rich.</p>
              <p>I've been to her rally and in my own opinion, she does not talk sense. After reading this account of her, I feel I might have underestimated her.</p>

              <p>If you are interested to watch, her rally is here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03YFx4Gp7lU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03YFx4Gp7lU</a></p>
              <p>That said, she has done a smart thing in politics. Make powerful friends, refuse a full ministerial seat, retire quietly, keep mouth closed, stay out of the public eye, nobody curse her...</p>

              <p>The interesting thing to note here is that two former MPs are
              stepping down from grassroots activities after the loss of
              Aljunied. Of what signifiance is that? Are they stepping down on
              their own violation because of the allure of greener pastures out
              in business/career world? Or has it been deemed that they would be
              a hindrance to effectively win back Aljunied? Notice that the two
              replacements are older people in age!( doubtful if they can be
              potential electioneering candidates) Seat warmers? So will Aljunied
              like Hougang continue be lost in the next few elections to come? Or
              have they yet not found the right potential young candidates to
              focus on the grasroot work to recoup Aljunied?</p>
