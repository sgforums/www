              <h5><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>May 16, 2012</strong> </span>– <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>ATHENS</strong></span> – <span style="color: #00002e;">The
               bank runs that we are watching right now in Greece are shocking, but 
              they are only just the beginning. Since May 6th, nearly one billion 
              dollars has been withdrawn from Greek banks. For a small nation like 
              Greece, that is an absolutely catastrophic number. At this point, the 
              entire Greek banking system is in danger of collapsing. If you had money
               in a Greek bank, why wouldn’t you pull it out? If Greece leaves the 
              euro, all euros in Greek banks will likely be converted to drachmas, and
               the value of those drachmas will almost certainly decline 
              dramatically. In fact, it has been estimated that Greek citizens could 
              see the value of their bank accounts decline by up to 50 percent if 
              Greece leaves the euro. So if you had money in a Greek bank, it would 
              only make sense to withdraw it and move it to another country as quickly
               as possible. And as the eurozone begins to unravel, this is a scenario 
              that we are going to see play out in country after country. As member 
              nations leave the eurozone, you would be a fool to have your euros in 
              Italian banks or Spanish banks when you could have them in German banks 
              instead. So the bank runs that are happening in Greece right now are 
              only a preview of things to come. Before this crisis is over we are 
              going to see bank runs happening all over Europe. A Greek exit from the 
              euro would not only result in a run on Spanish and Italian bonds, but it
               would also likely result in a run on Spanish and Italian banks. 
              Meanwhile, banks in other troubled European nations are already on shaky
               ground. The Spanish banking system is an absolute disaster zone at this
               point and on Monday night Moody’s downgraded the credit ratings of 26 
              Italian banks. The situation in Italy is especially worth keeping a 
              close eye on. As Ambrose Evans-Pritchard recently noted, things are not 
              looking good for Italy at all: Italy’s former premier Romano Prodi said 
              the EU risks instant contagion to Spain, Italy, and France if Greece 
              leaves. “The whole house of cards will come down”, he said. Angelo 
              Drusiani from Banca Albertini said the only way to avert catastrophe is 
              to convert the European Central Bank into a lender of last resort. 
              Otherwise Italy faces “massive devaluation, three to five years of 
              hyperinflation, and unbearable unemployment.” –<a href="http://etfdailynews.com/2012/05/15/why-we-are-going-to-see-bank-runs-happening-all-over-europe-xlf-ewp-ewi-fxe-vgk-ewg-faz-fas/"><span style="color: #00002e;"><strong>ETF Daily</strong></span></a></span></h5>

              <div class="subhead">The dark scenarios are piling up. Here's a roundup of who's saying what about Europe's never-ending crisis. It's the story that just doesn't seem to end, and one that could affect the entire global economy. Yes, dear readers, Greece is back in the global business and economics headlines today. In a big fat way.A Grexit — this is what fun-loving economists are calling the 
              possibility of a Greek exit from the euro — is once again the talk of 
              the internets.</div>
              <p>Never mind that the European Union doesn't even have a process that 
              legally allows member states to leave the single currency (the Lisbon 
              Treaty only permits nations to leave the EU entirely).</p>
              <p>Never mind that Greece <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/120507/greek-voters-vent-rage-major-parties">doesn't have a stable government</a>, or a real plan for returning to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma">the drachma</a>,
               or that any new Greek currency would likely plummet in value as 
              investors raced to cash out, driving the troubled Greek economy into 
              even more short-term chaos.</p>
              <p>The mood around Europe is so grim that even Brussels technocrats are attempting to face it with a degree of humor.</p>
              <p>Here's how one Brussels jokester <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/14/eu-greece-grexit-idUSL5E8GEH7W20120514">put it to Reuters today</a>:</p>
              <p>"...it's a bit like the drummer in the band — if the band doesn't like 
              the drummer, there are ways of getting rid of the drummer."</p>
              <p>For a more serious look at what is a very serious matter, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/eurodammerung-2/">see Paul Krugman's bleak assessment</a> of the Greek situation in last night's New York Times.</p>
              <p>The Nobel Prize-winning economist darkly muses over the possibilities 
              of Greece leaving the euro, and even laid out a five-step approach to 
              the "end game," which Krugman warns could happen in months, not years:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"1) Greek euro exit, very possibly next month. 2) Huge withdrawals 
              from Spanish and Italian banks, as depositors try to move their money to
               Germany. 3a) Maybe, just possibly, de facto controls, with banks 
              forbidden to transfer deposits out of country and limits on cash 
              withdrawals. 3b) Alternatively, or maybe in tandem, huge draws on ECB 
              credit to keep the banks from collapsing. 4a) Germany has a choice. 
              Accept huge indirect public claims on Italy and Spain, plus a drastic 
              revision of strategy — basically, to give Spain in particular any hope 
              you need both guarantees on its debt to hold borrowing costs down and a 
              higher eurozone inflation target to make relative price adjustment 
              possible; or: 4b)End of the euro."</p>

              <h2 class="title">Eurozone ‘storm’: Banks nearly collapsed; Greeks withdraw €3bn in 10 days; UK makes contingency plans</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">(May 17) Economists warned that the Greek
               financial system could crumble within weeks or days unless the European
               Central Bank (ECB) steps up support. The euro fell to a four-month low 
              against the dollar and global stocks dropped on Tuesday as Greece’s 
              decision to hold new elections added to uncertainty about its future and
               a possible exit from the euro zone.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In an interview with the BBC to be broadcast on Thursday, Benoît Coeuré, executive director of the ECB, said: “<strong>In
               the autumn of 2011 the conditions were very dangerous … European banks 
              were facing severe difficulties to fund themselves, to access finance, 
              and we were very close to having a collapse in the banking system in the
               euro area</strong>, which would have also led to a collapse in the 
              economy and to deflation. And this is something that the ECB could not 
              accept.” The concern about the state of the banking system led to €1tn 
              being lent to banks through three-year loans. <strong>Those contingency 
              plans are now being dusted down amid speculation over a Greek exit, a 
              once taboo possibility that European leaders have now begun to discuss 
              openly. </strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://endtimesrevelations.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/greeceeurocrisis.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Supporters of Leader of the Greek conser" src="http://endtimesrevelations.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/greeceeurocrisis.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206" alt="" width="300" height="206"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Greek President Karolos Papoulias told party leaders that<strong> banks had lost €700m in withdrawals alone on Monday and €3bn in 10 days
               since the election on May 6 as citizens rush to pre-empt capital 
              controls.</strong> Between January 2010 and March 2012, Greeks have 
              already been withdrawing their savings from banks at a sharp clip – 
              nearly a third of bank deposits were withdrawn. The capital of four 
              Greek banks was so low that they were operating with negative equity. JP
               Morgan said Greek banks have already exhausted their collateral. A 
              refusal by the ECB to ease rules would amount to expulsion, forcing 
              Greece “to issue its own money.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The growing alarm comes as judge Panagiotis Pikrammenos was picked as Greece’s caretaker leader until the next vote on June 17.</strong> While the timing of any exit is not clear, in their preparations bank 
              banks are assuming a decision would be made quickly as the country would
               need to close down its borders and its banks to stop funds flooding out
               of the country.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://endtimesrevelations.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/greeceeurocrisis2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-19003" title="greeceeurocrisis2" src="http://endtimesrevelations.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/greeceeurocrisis2.jpg?w=306&amp;h=205" alt="" width="306" height="205"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>If Greece is to slide out of the euro and collapse, how are they going to protect Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy?</strong> European leaders who once denied vociferously that they were fretting 
              over Greece leaving their currency union have given up pretence. Asked 
              if he was concerned about a Greek exit, European Central Bank chief 
              Mario Draghi said simply: “No comment”. German chancellor Merkel tells 
              Greece to back cuts or face euro exit. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
               chief Christine Lagarde warned of “extremely expensive and hard 
              consequences, and not just for Greece” were Greece to leave the euro 
              zone, <strong>As the nation descended into political chaos, the fears 
              that Greece’s dire state could drag the euro zone deeper into crisis 
              rattled financial markets across the globe  are becoming very legitmate 
              now. The IMF’s sister organization, the World Bank, said the crisis 
              could spread beyond Greek borders to far bigger euro zone economies that
               are in trouble.</strong></p>

              collective anger against government austerity measures, joining a mass 
              protest by public sector workers including immigration officials, 
              healthcare workers and prison officers. The Daily Telegraph reports that
               David Cameron is considering extra £25bn of welfare cuts.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What happens
               in the eurozone in the coming weeks and months will have a great impact
               on the weakened global economy. In order to bring about one 
              international government, there would have to be a one-world monetary 
              system. The elite class will push for the international currency to 
              shore up failing nations, and will be instrumental in bringing prophecy 
              to bear concerning the mark of the beast. But some nations will oppose 
              this rule.</span></p>

              <h5><span style="color: #808000;"><strong><span style="color: #993366;">May 19, 2012</span></strong></span> – <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>IRELAND</strong> </span>- <span style="color: #000042;">Ireland’s
               bailed-out banks may need as much as €4 billion more loan loss 
              provisions than assumed in stress tests last year, which could “<em>tip the balance in favor</em>”
               of the country requiring a second aid program, Deutsche Bank said in a 
              report today. “A new, even modest, increase in capital requirements 
              could deter sovereign investor participation and tip the balance in 
              favor of the sovereign requiring a second loan program,” said Deutsche 
              Bank analysts David Lock and Jason Napier. The government’s plan to 
              introduce new personal insolvency laws creates “risks,” even as 
              politicians and the financial regulators seek to avoid widespread 
              residential mortgage debt forgiveness, the bank said. “Although 
              resilient during 2009 and 2010, mortgage arrears have risen sharply over
               the past year, house prices are continuing to fall, market liquidity is
               limited, and over half of customers are now in negative equity,” said 
              Deutsche Bank analysts in the report. “We fear the size of negative 
              equity balances for some mortgage holders may greatly reduce their 
              incentive to cooperate, pushing them towards default.” –<a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0518/breaking28.html"><span style="color: #000042;"><strong>Irish Times</strong></span></a></span></h5>

              <p><strong>OCBC Investment Research</strong> said:</p>
              <p class="rteindent1"><em>With the weakening of equity markets in Apr and exacerbation of the
