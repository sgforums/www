              <p>Try reading the accounts of those who work at TWC2. They did go through official channels, as reported by TOC, but were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/vincent-wijeysingha/you-can-resign-and-go-to-sbs-the-drivers-were-told/517597378258190">stonewalled</a>, led on a merry-go-round by various ministries and government bodies and told to join SBST.</p>

              <p><a href="http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/as-bus-drivers-strike-government-messaging-goes-into-overdrive/">“A disproportionate amount of attention has focused on events from 26 November when preceding developments that precipitated the workers’ action are equally pertinent. A key concern should be how long the workers must wait to have their grievances addressed by management. This leads to another question of what the consequences are for employers who, through their action or inaction, have aggravated the situation. If ’zero tolerance’ is the prescribed policy for workers engaged in illegal strikes, what should the consequences be for their employers who fail to adequately address their concerns?</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/as-bus-drivers-strike-government-messaging-goes-into-overdrive/">There are claims that the workers should have taken their case through due processes available. Drawing on TWC2′s experience, there is a gap between what is offered on paper as due process and what actually happens. Given the disputes involved in this case, had the SMRT workers approached the MOM, they might have been told that their employers had not violated any Singapore law and therefore it is beyond the ken of the Ministry to assist.”</a></p>
