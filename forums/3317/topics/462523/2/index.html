              <p>i quote a clip from the movie 'the flowers of war".</p>
              <p>The plot was that the city of nanking has been over run, reduced to rubbles. poockets of cheena resistence still fighting, the japs infantry is moving into the city, voered by tanks with 'heavy machine gun' as the primary turret weapon.</p>
              <p>note if the tanks have cannon or howitzer, heavy ballistics, it is still logical for soldiers to hit them first as they can still do destruction to buildings, where civilians and resistence soldiers can stay hide and recuparte.</p>
              <p>from the scene at 10:35 onwards, we can see that the streets are tight and covered with rubbles, ideal for the cheena soldiers to hide, move around and flank or encircle the imperial jap infentrymen. but they took the silly frontal and flanking assault atthe tanks that only have machine guns as the heaviest weapon.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkPM-aZIqQM&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkPM-aZIqQM&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i rally laff man, i can let the tanks run around the street firing machin gun rounds and easily hide or outrun them luring them into street corners. in this case i will order my men to take downas many of the japs infantrymen at the rear and flanks first before taking down the tanks. i can vertaully sit on top of the tanks and sing my national anthem once all the jap infenrty men behind the tanks are taken care of.</p>

              <p>we want soldiers to fight for our rights also. but not stupid
              soldiers like the ones depicted in 'the flowers of war' when the
              city of nanking has been over rnned and the cheena sodliers keep

              <p><strong>Resistance in China Today.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://daniellesabai1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wukan5.jpg?w=500&amp;h=312" alt=""></p>
              <p>The number of cases of resistance in China continues to grow. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protests both large and small are an extremely frequent occurrence in China. </span></strong></p>
              <p>They range in scale and nature from <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">workers’ protests against unpaid wages or demands for increasing labour rights, to protests against corrupt officials or environmental protests.</span></strong></p>
              <p>While protests have often been brought to a swift end via repressive means, struggles have also frequently led to concessions being granted to the protestors, as the party-state will adopt different means by which to limit social unrest and restore “social harmony”.</p>
              <p>The fact that the overwhelming majority of protests are spontaneous or limited to one locality or to a single issue, and furthermore due to fact that information and reports concerning struggles are frequently censored, makes it very difficult to view or comment conclusively regarding an in depth overall picture of resistance in China.</p>
              <p>However, there have been some struggles that have emerged more recently that have stood out for their significant new features, and which are worth commenting on as they seem to mark unprecedented steps forward or a change from the past.</p>
              <p>For twenty years, since the crack down on the democratic movement in 1989, deep demoralization has persisted among workers in the declining state sector, whilst among the booming private sector the low expectation of rural migrant workers has meant that they have been unaware of many of their rights. Thus workers’ economic struggles in both sectors have been highly atomised and spontaneous. The recent cases show that things may begin to change, as they reflect higher awareness regarding the coordinating of struggles and even an aspiration for grass-root democracy.  </p>
              <p>Although the party-state apparently remains very strong, there are signs at the provincial level that the party has to come to terms with this growing aspiration of the grassroots, hence these struggles subsequently offer us some new signs of hope.</p>
              <p>We would like to attempt here to provide an assessment of some of the more significant struggles of the last three years, to try to illustrate why they are significant in the context of China and why such forms of resistance could potentially be of importance for the future of wider resistance in China...</p>
