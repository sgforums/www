              <p>Just for general information here. Quite a number of China construction workers are formerly soldiers from the People Republic Of China….maybe they are daring and courageous enough to show their dissatisfaction and disagreement due to their former ideology as being soldiers, to do or die kind of thing lols. I’m sure some of the <span>SMRT</span> bus drivers may have been soldiers too with the People Republic Of China.</p>

              I shall give you a hint. CPF contributions versus Levies of foreign workers, which one will have more high returns looking at the situation now that there are more native Singaporean workers are aging now.
                  
              Second, MOM actually has outsourced their work permit services to private company to act on their behalf since 1999 if I'm not mistaken. However, the approval of work permits for foreign workers are only done by MOM HQ not their outsource agency. MOM outsource agency just follow instructions from MOM.

              <p> </p>
              <p>another case is a nother production staff deman i give her my login assess password so she can do transaction on teh spot i tell her its my cimputer and password cannot give she immedaitely raise her voice at me 'compewter your one arh' i tell her straight as engineer we have teh right to protect any office equipment issued to us and also our personal login assess, i tell her shoo go elsewhere masturbate or have lesbian sex.</p>

              However you look at it . Depriving workers of their rightfully earned salary is wrong to start with.  So the employer started this whole problem. Workers from foreign lands come here to earn a living  for their families back home waiting for their money to be remitted . Employers who do not pay up on time are being very heartless and inconsiderate.
              
              If the 2 men had not appraoched our Manpower Ministry that is a different thing. We are talking about  workers who whilst going down to the ministry to register their complains  Still have to continue working  the next day ...Manpower could have been more helpful by a quick email to the specific company. Few  workers will be crazy enough to make a false claim here  and risk court action. 
              
              Some of these workers have to pay both the bloodsucking Singapore as well as China agents  just to get their papers,  to work in Singapore. Now how much money can these papers actually cost?  But the individual worker actually works the first 6 months almost without money to pay up the hefty fees to blood sucking agents !!! Same case with maids...and we have a levy here  some more....And then you get employers "chao kar" ( stinko legs) don't want to pay  salary! 
              
              I say 1st offence jail the human resource head, 2nd offence  jail the CEO! This non pying errant companies disgrace our image. Just a fine doesn't work . Only when the individual is held responsible and punished will it be effective! So jail them!

              <p style="line-height: 14px; font-size: 11px;"><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin has acknowledged that in general, the relationship between an employer and employee tends to be weighted against workers.<br><br>Posting on his Facebook page, Mr Tan said that is why the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act was amended "to try and stem the worse abuses".<br><br>He was commenting on the latest case of two workers from China who sat on top of construction cranes for hours on Thursday, over an alleged pay dispute with their employer. The workers have been charged with criminal trespass.<br><br>Separate checks by the Manpower Ministry have also revealed that the two workers did not have any salary owed to them.<br><br>Still, Mr Tan said the ministry is investigating whether the company has breached any statutory provisions under the Employment Act.<br><br>Companies who contravene the Employment Act and/or the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act can be prosecuted, fined and may also be barred from hiring foreign workers in future.<br><br>He also reiterated that workers facing employment issues should approach the ministry for advice and help.<br><br>He noted that the workers in the latest incident, knew their way around. Shedding more light to the case, Mr Tan said 24-year-old Zhu Guilei had gone to the ministry in July 2011 to enquire about how he and his friend could resign and return home.<br><br>Both Zhu and 47-year-old Wu Xiaolin again went to the ministry on 5 December to highlight that they were owed salaries.<br><br>To help in investigations, the ministry had asked the workers to come back with their documents. <br><br>Mr Tan said they never did and ended up on the crane.<br><br>When asked why they did not come back to lodge their claims, one worker apparently said it was "troublesome".<br><br>"Our officers asked one of them why they did not come back. One of the workers shared that going to MOM to lodge their claims was 'troublesome'," Mr Tan said.<br><br>Mr Tan said the ministry requires documentation from the workers in order to substantiate their claims so they can handle the dispute fairly.<br><br>"We would like to reiterate that workers should not take matters into their own hands and break the law," he said.<br><br>He added the ministry follows up even on non-statutory cases where Labour Relations officers will speak to the companies to help get things smoothened out.<br><br>Companies he said can be blacklisted and denied access to workers if found to have breached rules or flouted acceptable practices.<br><br>But Mr Tan said in some instances, the workers too can have misplaced expectations or unreasonable demands.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span> </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Two Chinese nationals who perched themselves on top of two tower cranes for nine hours were charged in court on Friday (Dec 7) with criminal trespass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The duo are accused of unlawfully remaining on two construction cranes at a worksite in Jurong Port Road and intentionally causing alarm, with 24-year-old Zhu Guilei between 6am and 2.20pm and 47-year-old Wu Xiaolin between 6.30am and 3.30pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The two construction workers from Zhong Jiang International, a Chinese construction company, intend to claim trial and were offered bail of $10,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The case was adjourned for a pre-trial conference next Wednesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zhu and Wu were protesting over wages owed by their employers to them on Dec 6.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The two men had previously sought help from the Ministry of Manpower on Dec 5 for their owned wages as they were supposed to leave for home on Nov 30.</p>
