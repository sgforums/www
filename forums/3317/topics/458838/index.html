              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A lawyer found guilty of breaching legal profession 
              rules by a tribunal last week is set to face disciplinary action by the 
              Court of Three Judges. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr James Wan had 
              failed to advise his client, Mdm Chiang Choy Peng, to seek independent 
              legal advice in respect of her intended monetary gift to him, according 
              to the disciplinary tribunal's report.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Under the Legal 
              Profession Rules, a lawyer or any member of his firm must not act for 
              the client if the client intends to make a significant gift by will. <br><br>The
               Court of Three Judges, which is empowered to discipline lawyers, has 
              the power to suspend, fine or strike a lawyer off the rolls if found 
              guilty of serious misconduct.<br><br>The complaint by the 
              Attorney-General arose following a 2009 audit of the Bukit Batok Home 
              for the Aged where Mdm Chiang, a former patient at Woodbridge Hospital, 
              then resided. <br><br>The Auditor-General's Office discovered that Mdm 
              Chiang had received only S$500,000 from the sale proceeds of her 
              property in Siglap that was sold for S$960,000.<br><br>In 2001, Mdm 
              Chiang had engaged Mr Wan to retrieve her Deed of Conveyance and had, on
               Mr Wan's advice, given him the Power of Attorney to sell her property.<br><br>The
               disciplinary tribunal, comprising Mr Goh Joon Seng and Mr Tony Yeo, 
              found that Mdm Chiang was not aware of the S$1.1 million valuation of 
              the house when she drew up a letter to Mr Wan. <br><br>The letter stated
               that she only needed S$500,000 from the sale proceeds and that Mr Wan 
              could keep any amount above that as a reward for helping her recover her
               property. <br><br>The tribunal also found that Mr Wan had "manipulated"
               Mdm Chiang into accepting only that amount and that she did not know 
              how much her property had been sold for in 2002. <br><br>Mr Wan was also ordered to pay S$10,000 for the cost of the disciplinary proceedings.<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
