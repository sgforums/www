              <p><strong>Boys more likely than girls to suffer from physical, verbal bullying: 
              survey</strong></p>
              <p><span> SINGAPORE: A Singapore Children's Society survey on bullying in schools 
              showed that more boys suffered from physical or some form of verbal 
              bullying as compared to girls. </span></p>
              <p><span> Malays were more often the subject of bullying as compared to Chinese. </span></p>
              <p><span> Only about a third of those bullied sought help, which made the 
              situation better. </span></p>
              <p><span> Teachers and parents were the two most common sources of help. </span></p>
              <p><span> The 600 young adults between the ages of 25 and 29 surveyed gave many 
              suggestions on how bullying can be stopped. </span></p>
              <p><span> Methods used to successfully avoid being bullied included avoiding and 
              ignoring the bullies and seeking help. </span></p>
              <p><span> The survey found no evidence that bullying led to premature school 
              leaving. </span></p>
              <p><span> However, those who had been bullied had, on average, lower self-esteem 
              and well-being. </span></p>
              <p><span> They were also found to be typically more depressed. </span></p>
              <p><span> The survey aims to find out if there were long term effects of primary 
              or secondary school bullying. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Some victims of childhood bullying still haven't recovered from trauma: 
              survey </strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Some victims of childhood bullying do not grow out of 
              their trauma, according to a recent survey. </span></p>
              <p><span> It polled Singaporeans between 25 and 29 years old and found that most 
              victims have a weaker sense of personal well-being, compared with those 
              who had not been bullied. </span></p>
              <p><span> As a child, you might have come across the resident school bully, who 
              could have verbally or physically abused you or your peers. </span></p>
              <p><span> These unpleasant encounters sometimes never go away. </span></p>
              <p><span> Winston Ong, research officer, Singapore Children's Society, said: 
              "Respondents who've been bullied before actually have lower self-esteem 
              and lower levels of well-being. They're also more depressed as compared 
              to those who have never been bullied." </span></p>
              <p><span> The survey was a retrospective one involving 600 young adults who had 
              studied in a primary or secondary school. One key finding showed that 
              Malays were being more bullied than Chinese. </span></p>
              <p><span> Of those interviewed, 61 per cent of Malays said they had been bullied, 
              compared with 48 per cent of Chinese respondents. </span></p>
              <p><span> Researchers said they don't have any information explaining why but they
               do not detect any trends. </span></p>
              <p><span> One hot topic at this year's Bully-Free forum was cyber bullying and 
              schools are taking a serious stance on social networking platforms and 
              blogs. </span></p>
              <p><span> Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Law &amp; 
              Home Affairs, said: "All reported cases are investigated. Schools have 
              the autonomy to decide on the disciplinary measures to take against the 
              offenders as appropriate. More importantly, however, tough disciplinary 
              measures should be accompanied by proper education and counselling for 
              the bullies and victims." </span></p>
              <p><span> Fortunately, the victims surveyed said their situation improved most of 
              the time when they sought help from schools, parents and peers. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Policies on bullying needed</strong></p>
              <p>JUST as schools have strict policies about plagiarism, they should 
              have the same for bullying too.</p>
              <p>That is what experts called for on Saturday at the Bully Free Forum 
              2010, an event organised as part of the Bully-Free programme, which aims
               to promote bully awareness.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan Bee Joo, deputy director of the Singapore Children's 
              Society's Student Service Hub, said that schools should adopt a policy 
              that clearly defines what bullying is, and the schools' tolerance level 
              towards it.</p>
              <p>'Teachers also need to be equipped with specific skills to 
              detect and manage bullying. And programmes, such as a Bully Free Week 
              could be organised,' she added.</p>
              <p>She cited Park View Primary School as an example. It is the 
              first school in Singapore to embark on a school-based intervention 
              programme in January last year.</p>
              <p>Bullying has become a growing concern among educators here. A
               survey by the Singapore Children's Society in 2006 found one in five 
              pupils was a bully victim in school.</p>
