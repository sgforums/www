              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's pro-immigration policy was designed 
              mainly to mitigate the falling birthrates projected to have dire 
              consequences on the demographic and economic vitality of the nation.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Among the 
              non-citizen population, permanent residents (PR) are accorded certain 
              benefits not available to other foreigners who also contribute to 
              Singapore, particularly in the area of housing, education and medical 
              services.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The key 
              justification for the extension of privileges customarily accorded only 
              to citizens is that permanent residence is deemed as a first step 
              towards the acquisition of Singapore citizenship.<br><br>Hence the 
              benefits are to facilitate PRs' integration into society and signal to 
              them that their long-term commitment to Singapore is valued.<br><br>The evolution of the concept of the PR in Singapore is revealing when considered in the current zeitgeist.<br><br>Following
               separation from Malaysia, Singapore had to contend with a number of 
              stateless people within its borders and PR status was bestowed upon them
               to enable them to work towards becoming full-fledged citizens.<br><br>In
               effect, the situation Singapore found itself in at that time was - in 
              economic terms - a buyers' market where these people were surplus for 
              requirement and Singapore could take the pick of the crop.<br><br></span><strong>TODAY'S DILEMMA</strong><span><br><br>Now,
               Singapore finds itself a sellers' market where it is competing globally
               for talented labour in order to remain economically competitive. <br><br>Unlike
               the stateless PRs of the bygone era, the present PRs arrive with 
              citizenship of their motherland which not all of them choose to give up.<br><br>Nevertheless,
               they are still accorded similar benefits as citizens to induce them to 
              stay and contribute to Singapore's economic development, first as 
              long-term PRs, with the hope that they will in future adopt citizenship,
               or - to employ the botanical metaphor - sink their roots in the nation.<br><br>These
               privileges have recently come under great criticism from Singapore's 
              citizenry who fear that PRs are in a position to enjoy all the benefits 
              of being in Singapore during the good times while also being able flee 
              at the first sign of crisis with their own citizenship as the 
              ejection-seat button.<br><br>Consequently, the challenge facing the 
              Government is aptly summed up in an observation by Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong in a debate in 1990: How can we "make it attractive for 
              foreigners with skills and talents to want to come to Singapore and to 
              be PRs... (and) to make it even more attractive for such PRs to want to 
              become citizens, instead of the other way around, to make it more 
              attractive for citizens to wish that they were PRs?"<br><br>Unfortunately,
               it may be argued that the current response to the PR question merely 
              attempts to stop citizens from wishing they are PRs. It may neither 
              entice foreigners with skills and talents to want to come to Singapore 
              to be PRs, nor make it even more attractive for such PRs to want to 
              become citizens.<br><br></span><strong>COST OF VALUING CITIZENS MORE</strong><span><br><br>In
               a bid to reassure Singaporeans that citizens are valued more than PRs, a
               slew of policy adjustments have been introduced over the past year, 
              such as the reduction in the number of applications for permanent 
              residence approved and the clawing back of subsidies for PRs in 
              education and medical benefits.<br><br>Few would fault a government for 
              ensuring citizens enjoy better privileges than non-citizens. However, 
              penalising PRs to underscore the value of citizenship is a 
              well-intentioned but flawed response.<br><br>Firstly, the goal of 
              attracting talented and skilled international talent to Singapore that 
              underpins the permanent residence policy in the current context may be 
              undermined.<br><br>Systematically scaling back on the number of PR 
              permits and benefits creates uncertainty pertaining to their status 
              should they choose to settle in Singapore. Hence talented foreigners who
               could potentially call Singapore home may be deterred.<br><br>Secondly,
               such an approach may alienate the current pool of PRs. Making them bear
               the burden of Singaporeans' anxieties inadvertently implies that they 
              are to blame. <br><br>For instance, reducing educational and medical 
              subsidies they are entitled to may vindicate anti-immigrant speculation 
              that PRs have indeed been taking more than they have been giving. At the
               same time, it may also signal to them that their contributions over the
               years are not fully appreciated, which is counter-productive to 
              integrating them into Singapore society.<br><br></span><strong>A WAY FORWARD?</strong><span><br><br>How
               then can the PR system continue to attract foreign labour, entice them 
              to become citizens while also placate a restive citizenry? <br><br>Admittedly,
               there is no way to ensure PRs will adopt local citizenship. The most 
              realistic outcome would be for PR status to be attractive enough for 
              individuals to stay as long as possible to contribute economically with 
              the hope that they will become citizens.<br><br>A problem with the 
              current policy towards PRs is that it does not make a distinction 
              between recent and long-term PRs, who have the same entitlements. A 
              manner in which this may be achieved would perhaps be through a gradated
               system of benefits for PRs.<br><br>Effectively, such a system would 
              reward the "long-stayer" PRs for remaining through thick and thin and 
              drive home the point to all PRs that settling down has its privileges. <br><br>Within
               such a gradated system, not all PRs will have equal benefits of being a
               PR, be they educational or medical benefits; such benefits will 
              increase perhaps in five-year blocks as they continue to remain in the 
              country. <br><br>Furthermore, PRs within such a gradated system will not
               arrive at the full privileges of being a citizen. Instead, they will be
               made very aware that the telos of PR status is the eventual adoption of
               Singaporean citizenship with all its rights, duties and privileges.<br><br></span><em>Yolanda

There are PR that are still holding PR but they are not base in SG, in fact they are working overseas or their own business is overseas and they only come SG once a while only.

              I think u miss out the points, the many resentment is cause by in the past, the foreigner is given nearly equal right as Singaporean and they absurd the systems, and NS is one of it.  Thus even by inducted the foreigner into the defence system, it still won't serve a purpose unless the hole in the system was plug and disallow the foreigner (PR) to absurd the system.
              
              Maybe u could explain more on how by inducted foreigner into the defence system will prevent the PR to cont to take advantage of the system as I can't see any, unless it is like what taiwan in the past having been doing, which mean even the first gen PR (regardless u age is require to serve NS, or in the way inducted into the defence system).

              This is just a very simple maths.  Most plp make decision base on the push and pull factor.  Thus in the past, when being a PR have equal right as citizens but less responsible as citizens, plus not to mention that PR still have the right as his home country citizens, who in the right mind will take up sg citizens.
              
              Plus, the only point is that I dun see it as the govt is unhappy.  SG govt dun bother as long as the PR taxes and thus increase the elites "peanuts" salary.  However since the last G.E result might be a warning sign that a number of singaporean is getting unhappy.  Thus the elites are doing damage control now as it impact their interest.
              
              The govt in the past is not concern until now as it start to impact their interest (G.E. result).

                  First, the change in the cost of health care and education is only with this 2 yrs, whereas in the past there no much different, if you bother to check out the different before the 2010.
                  
                  Regarding the point of NS, it is not just NS, there are follow up like mob/ICT/RT which make singaporean in a disadvanatage position in the eye of the employer.  Assume u are the boss and there a urgent issue to settle on Sat/Sun, the employees suppose to handle this was call in for a mob (which is a sudden issue).  Similar thing will happen for RT.  Not to mention that during ICT, the employer is still suppose to pay the CPF (note: though the employer dun need to pay the salary, they are still require to make the CPF).  And in real life, all this factors come into consideration for the management when come to promote someone to the next level (I won't want my decision maker go missing for a few days when there are urgent thing to handle).  Or even hiring, of cos for one who are in the govt sector, such issue dun really exist. 
              
              And finally, I believe most of the singaporean are not calling for their expulsion but calling for a greater different in treatment regarding the citizens and PR.  Is this not what the topic is all about, discuss on the benefits for PRs.
