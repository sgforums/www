              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">October 28, 2009 by admin  <br> Filed under Top News<br> <br> Leave a comment<br> <br> From our Correspondent<br> <br> PRC national Zhou Sunfu who was charged last week for trying to rob a
              cabby was cleared afther the charge was dropped. He arrived in
              Singapore on a social visit pass.<br> <br> The cabby, 61-year-old Robert Lee Khee Choon was warded in hospital
              after his taxi crashed into a pillar in front of a shophouse.<br> <br> Zhou was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal on the application
              of the prosecution. No reasons were given for the discharge.<br> <br> There were few other details in the report carried by the state media.
              Neither was the cabby interviewed to find out what exactly happened.<br> <br> Did Zhou attempt to rob Mr Robert Lee at all? Or was he acquitted due to lack of concrete evidence?<br> <br> If Zhou had never tried to rob Mr Robert Lee, then the latter must have
              made a false police report and should be charged in court. However,
              there was no mention of it.<br> <br> There must be prima facie evidence to charge Zhou in court in the first place. What did the police investigations reveal?<br> <br> The abrupt acquittal of Zhou seemed to give the impression that there
              were lapses somewhere along the chain of investigation. Did the police
              or prosecution miss out anything?<br> <br> It is ironical that a PRC suspected of committing a crime in Singapore
              is given an unconditional discharge by the prosecution while Singapore
              citizens acquitted of wrong-doing by the court were not so lucky.<br> <br> Two weeks ago, 5 Singaporeans are acquitted on charges of “illegal
              procession” for walking in a group from one point to another in public.
              (read more here)<br> <br> The Attorney-General Chambers has since filed an appeal against their
              acquittal and sought to convict them for a “crime” which amounts to a
              maximum fine of $1,000. </span></p>
