              <p><br>You begin to lost hope on charity ? I long already gave up to charity , those selling flag i will give 10c or 20c so the rest wont bug me anymore.</p>
              <p> Donate money is more like sin nowaday , the more you donate , the higher chance they pocket it , so what to do to prevent them from pocketting the money ? dont donate lor.</p>
              <p>Anyway , if im donating to charity , there will never be cash transaction for me , i will buy and give them , need new bed ? i buy a bed then deliver there , need food ? i buy rice and canned food and deliver there , unless they want to pocket those canned food</p>

              <p>Hey guys:)</p>
              <p>I am from Red Cross Youth,currently a cadet.</p>
              <p>I dun think you should blame the society,at least the society realised that something was wrong in the finance department and report it to the police to settle the problem and not keep it hiding forever.</p>
              <p>However,I don't think this incident affect the genorosity of the people in Singapore.Every year,when i do flag day during march,there are still people who are willingly to donate money,be it 5c or even 10$,all these money have to come to your heart,or else,whats the point of donating money for the sake of donating. There are thousands of volunteers in the society including me,even link cadets(pri sch)also contribute such events. What I think that,such events that I have done is to contribute to the society,to join with others and help the sick and the suffering.</p>
              <p>I felt that, Red Cross have done the right thing,to tell the public about the recent 'misapproiating 90k'.</p>
              <p>Hence,I really hope you to appreciate what the volunteers from there have done,standing hours in the sun and pasting stickers around the tin,and last but not least,hoping the public can donate money from what it <strong>comes from their heart</strong>. :)</p>

              <p>It just that people nowaday cannot handle large amount money , same goes to any organisation with the same person.</p>
              <p>I have have to work out ways to donate so that those really in need got it , not those who want extra pocket money donated by people like you and me</p>

              <p><strong>Advised to stop fund-raising</strong></p>
              <p>THE Commissioner of Charities (COC) has advised the Singapore Red 
              Cross Society to stop all active fund-raising until internal 
              investigations into a misappropriation of funds have been done and 
              additional safeguards put in place.</p>
              <p>The COC is also bringing forward a planned governance review of Singapore's lead relief agency.</p>
              <p>This news came a day after the Red Cross revealed that it had made a 
              police report accusing a woman employee of misappropriating about 
              $90,000 since February.</p>
              <p>The discrepancies came to light last Wednesday during an internal audit.</p>
              <p>The COC said on Monday that the society was one of several 
              charities selected earlier for a review next year, as a way of helping 
              charities and Institutions of Public Character (IPCs) identify 
              governance gaps and develop plans to address them.</p>
              <p>The Red Cross review will now happen sooner, and the COC 
              will work with it to further tighten its internal controls and 
              processes.</p>

              <p><strong>Red Cross Sec Gen apologises </strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>The Secretary General for the Singapore Red Cross has 
              apologised for the incident involving the misappropriation of funds by a
               female employee.</p>
              <p>And while internal investigations continue, it has been advised by the 
              Commisioner of Charities not to conduct any fundraising activities.</p>
              <p>The administrative assistant in the finance department had allegedly stolen $90,000 between February and December this year. <br> <br> Mr Christopher Chua says the organisation will now implement more stringent and more frequent checks on its finances. <br> <br> This doesn't just apply to the Red Cross headquarters, but also to its Home for the Disabled. <br> <br> It will also be more careful when hiring new staff. <br> <br>"We apologise for what has happened. Second message is that we 
              will do whatever we can to ensure that it doesn't happen again. Third 
              message is to request our donors and supporters to continue to support 
              the work that Red Cross is doing." <br> <br> Irregularities were uncovered on 1 December, when staff were preparing for the annual audits. <br> <br> They realised what was banked in did not tally with the receipts issued to donors. <br> <br> Investigations reveal the employee had been stealing between $10 and several thousand dollars every few weeks. <br> <br> When they confronted her, she admitted guilt. <br> <br> Before the workday was over, she disappeared, leaving her staff pass on the table. <br> <br> It was later found that she had been admitted to hospital. <br> <br> Mr Chua says she is in her 30s, and worked for over a year as a temp 
              staff with the Red Cross, helping out at major fundraisers for the 
              victims of Cyclone Nargis and the Sichuan earthquake. <br> <br> But although she was also with the finance department, she did not handle any cash at the time. <br> <br> Colleagues recall her as a bubbly person, though it is understood she was seeking treatment for depression. <br> <br> Police say she has not yet been arrested.</p>

              <p><strong>Donations still allowed</strong></p>
              <p>THE Singapore Red Cross Society has clarified that it can continue to receive donations from the public.</p>
              <p>However, it has been advised against actively raising funds, for 
              example in the form of direct mailers, charity bazaars and flag days.</p>
              <p>This comes after a meeting between the society and the Commissioner of Charities (COC) yesterday.</p>
              <p>The latter had earlier advised the Red Cross to stop all 
              active fund-raising after an internal audit by the society last week 
              revealed that an employee had allegedly misappropriated about $90,000 
              since February this year.</p>
              <p>Red Cross, which is Singapore's lead relief agency, has 
              since lodged a police report about the employee, who has been suspended 
              from her duties.</p>
              <p>It is also conducting internal investigations and reviews, 
              and expects to submit a detailed report to the COC in the next two 
              weeks.</p>
