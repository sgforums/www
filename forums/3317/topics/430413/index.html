              <p>A former loan officer from OCBC Bank was charged in <span id="lw_1305262084_0" class="yshortcuts">court</span> on Thursday with conspiring with property agents to deceive the bank into giving housing loans worth more than S$61 million.</p>
              <p>Winnie Goh Li Ching, 33, faced 189 counts of deceiving the bank between 2004 and 2006. According to <em>The Straits Times, </em>she submitted false <span id="lw_1305262084_2" class="yshortcuts">income tax</span> or Central Provident Fund statements to secure loans for applicants who did not meet income requirements.</p>
              <p>Her actions misled the bank into approving and disbursing housing 
              loans of between S$112,000 and S$2.25 million each to about 170 clients.</p>
              <p>Also charged on Thursday were housing agents <span id="lw_1305262084_1" class="yshortcuts">Siti</span> Rahayu Masud, 38, and Lau Thuan Heng, 62.</p>
              <p>The duo were accused of submitting a <span id="lw_1305262084_3" class="yshortcuts">false statement of affairs</span> and failing to deliver surpluses from the sale of properties to the Official Assignee.</p>
              <p>Goh allegedly assisted Siti and Lau on 14 occasions in 2005 and 2006 
              to cheat OCBC Bank of S$11 million in the form of housing loans. It is 
              unclear if Goh accepted any commission from the agents in exchange for 
              obtaining the bank's approval.</p>
              <p>Goh also allegedly misled the bank on seven occasions into paying 
              commissions totaling S$11,258 to housing agent Lay Liang Suan, 
              purportedly for referring customers to the bank for housing loans.</p>
              <p>Goh, who started working for the bank in 2004, quit in 2006. Married 
              with a young child, she is now working in an administrative position 
              with a local company. Goh, who is represented by lawyer Chen Chee Yen, 
              is out on police bail of S$700,000.</p>
              <p>Chen asked for the case to be postponed so that he could take 
              instructions from his client on the charges. She will be back in court 
              on 9 June.</p>
              <p>Siti and Lau also faced charges under the Bankruptcy Act. They are also accused of multiple counts of leaving the country without permission.</p>
              <p>Both were remanded as they were unable to post bail of S$500,000 each.</p>
              <p>If convicted of cheating, the trio can be jailed for up to seven years on each charge, and fined.</p>
