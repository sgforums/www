              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said support from a
               strong alumni is important for the success and continued growth of any 
              university including the National University of Singapore (NUS).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said alumni may 
              return to teach, mentor students, serve on advisory boards or donate to 
              support academic programmes and new initiatives, and these will help NUS
               become a better university. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>More importantly, 
              the active interest and dedication of the alumni will also help forge a 
              stronger sense of identity and belonging among the NUS community. <br><br>Mr
               Lee said this at a ceremony on Friday at the NUS where he was conferred
               an Honorary Membership by the National University of Singapore Society 
              (NUSS), the largest graduate club in Singapore. <br><br>The conferment is to recognise Mr Lee's contribution to the nation. <br><br>NUSS
               co-hosted the event with the NUS, which was also to honour donors who 
              gave S$37 million for the new University Town which will open next 
              month. <br><br>One of the donors - the NUSS community - initially 
              pledged to raise S$1 million for the University Town. But it has already
               raised more than S$2 million so far and is committed to continue 
              raising funds over the next five years.<br><br>Mr Lee said the University Town is a strategic initiative to promote deeper interactions between students and faculty. <br><br>The University Town will also provide housing for 2,400 undergraduate and 1,700 graduate students.<br><br>"Students
               in the four undergraduate residential colleges in University Town will 
              not just live together but will also take a number of courses in the 
              College which will have a small-group, multi-disciplinary learning 
              format. The courses will foster critical thinking about issues of global
               importance, especially from the Asian perspective," said Mr Lee. <br><br>Mr Lee attended Raffles College from 1940 to 1941 when the Second World War intervened.  <br><br>He
               went to the University of Cambridge and after his return to Singapore, 
              he worked with the alumni of the University of Malaya and the Nanyang 
              University. <br><br>Previous recipients of the NUSS Honorary Membership 
              include, in order of conferment, Professor Maurice Baker, Emeritus 
              Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, the late Emeritus Professor Kiang Ai Kim,
               Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Professor Lim Pin, Professor Shih Choon
               Fong, NUS president Professor Tan Chorh Chuan and Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
