              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Non-executive directors (NEDs) in Singapore receive 
              the second-highest pay among their peers in four ASEAN countries, 
              namely, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This according to a report released by Hay Group, the global management consultancy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The report is based on an analysis on data collected from 200 large companies in the four ASEAN countries from 2008 to 2010.<br><br>According
               to the report, at the median level, NEDs from large companies in 
              Singapore received a remuneration of S$95,000 in 2010. Indonesian NEDs 
              took the top spot at S$239,000 while NEDs in Thailand and Malaysia 
              received S$59,000 and S$58,500 respectively. <br><br>The Hay Group report also shows that the remuneration for NEDs climbed steadily over the three years. <br><br>Singapore
               NEDs saw a pay increase of 9 per cent in 2009 and 2010. In Malaysia, 
              the increase was 17 per cent in 2009 and 3 per cent in 2010. Indonesian 
              NEDs observed an increase of 13 per cent in 2009 and 10 per cent in 2010
               and in Thailand, the increase remained steady at 14 per cent in 2009 
              and 2010. <br><br>The top three sectors in Singapore for median average 
              NED remuneration are banks (S$152,000), followed by food (S$113,500) and
               transportation (S$110,000). Banks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand 
              also offer the highest pay to NEDs compared to other industries. <br><br>The
               Hay Group report shows that the remuneration for NEDs in Singapore's 
              large companies is mainly composed of directors' fees (92 per cent) and 
              share-based compensation (8 per cent). In contrast, benefits and 
              perquisites are widely used for NED remuneration in Malaysia, Indonesia 
              and Thailand. <br><br>Benefits-in-kind in Malaysia account for a 
              significant portion (30 per cent) of total remuneration for NEDs. These 
              benefits-in-kind include social allowance, car allowance, reimbursement,
               retirement gratuity and others. NEDs in Indonesia and Thailand receive 
              bonuses which form a large portion of their total remuneration, with 52 
              per cent in Indonesia and 33 per cent in Thailand. <br><br>Share-based 
              compensation was not commonly used for NED remuneration among the four 
              countries. In Singapore, 10 out of the top 50 companies offer stock 
              option plans for NEDs and 13 companies offer full-value share plans for 
              NEDs. Even fewer companies (less than 10 per cent) in the other three 
              countries do likewise. <br><br>Gender diversity in board leadership 
              remained low, with the majority of the large listed companies in the 
              four countries lacking female NEDs on their boards during 2008 to 2010. <br><br>In
               Singapore, the percentage of companies with one or more female NEDs on 
              their boards remained largely unchanged at around 45 per cent. The 
              prevalence of female NEDs in Indonesia (around 30 per cent) is the 
              lowest among the four countries. In contrast, companies in Malaysia and 
              Thailand are making greater progress and more than half of the companies
               have female NEDs on their boards in 2010. <br><br>The Hay Group report 
              shows that, as at the end of 2011, the median tenure of independent 
              directors is seven years in Singapore, six years in Malaysia, 4.5 years 
              in Indonesia, and three years in Thailand. <br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
