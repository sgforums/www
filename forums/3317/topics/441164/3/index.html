              I was gonna say about racial discrimination but then when you look at the other photos, the scale of the problem is obvious... Not sure if you ever had taken photos by total strangers i think it feels like you're the animal being exhibited in the zoo... it definitely feels not right for the victim... and we're not talking about 1-2 bangla, the photos look like got 100 banglas leh!!!
              
              So while it's not right (nor easy) to discriminate correctly, the person who mention about the issue has a point on their end. but seriously, how can you justify something like... "sorry bangla you cannot come in because you're bangla... or... sorry singaporean you cannot come our country because we heard of your kiasu-ism, we don't care whether you not the same but to us all singaporeans are the same, so you cannot come" see if we do it to them, then we cannot complain when they do it to us. but singaporeans sure complain lah, where will singaporeans don't complain one, hahaha.

              Both side also have valid points, but the problem here is in implementing the controls of how you define someone who is having malice thoughts... if he dress like gentleman can go in? what if he go in and is the most perverted? it's never easy to control. if u want to determine by race or age, then can you tell me for the other age/race, is it confirm 100% they don't have the sort of problematic behavior that we're trying to eradicate by implementing the measures?
              
              if not, then it becomes a very sensitive issue... their country will say we're delibrately being bias against them... small things can lead to big things and big things lead to... i just want to fart.

              <p>Thats wrong.....thats the problem, you are not focusing on the real issue.</p>
              <p>The real issue is not someone's race.</p>
              <p>The real issue is someone or some group's propensity to group together, loiter, overcrowd, and thusly disturb and discomfort other visitors.</p>
              <p>So this is purely a case of human traffic management and customer management.</p>
              <p>Why keep bringing up "B****a" ?</p>
              <p>If you click the link on the first post, you can see from Stomp and from Asia1 portal, how these groups of young males foreign workers have seriously obstructed other visitors.</p>
              <p>Have you seen the picture where they completely occupy a bridge. The bridge is choked.</p>
              <p>So again I repeat this is purely a case of human traffic management and customer management.</p>

              if you're replying to my post, when i said bangla it was meant as an example... i brought up bangla because so obvious, the pictures all bangla so the first think to my mind is... bangla...
              
              my point is, assuming since you dun like bangla, let me use another example, what if you ban Americans because they are known to be rowdy... do you ban all americans? how do you know if that age 25 young male American is a trouble maker compared to another age 25 young male American?
              
              Known from experience??? Seriously... If they hire 1 security guard that has experienced being bullied in school by chinese, should he prevent all chinese from going in?
              
              Thats why i said it's almost impossible to implement this.
