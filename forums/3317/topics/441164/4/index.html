              <p>becuse the gahmen suk aliens' cocks until now they suck black aliens ones. when 1 or 2 of them do it probably no one cares. a whole group of them using every place a their leisure off days handouts relly we should do something about it. if you are at the pool not swiming gathering there and even can pay 2 bucks for it really you mean the pool cannot do anything? like i choose to stand at teh bank outside with a plastic tool gun and i get my friends to stand in group you mean the police at the bank cannot have the right to approach me and ask we all to disperse?</p>

              <p>these foreign pigs just act blur act lie they village people, if sgreans don;t do anything to make them realised that its not a joke workin here, only sgreans ourselves suffer. we should exercise total defence, er should send the message across that gahmen should really loook inot the requirements not just to let any pigs cum in, and mess in groups.</p>

              <p>The case that was mentioned a few post back about a report in the newspaper that groups of young male foreign workers have now stalked women in Jurong swimming pool is further illustrating my point.</p>
              <p>It is epecially telling that the newspaper article quotes some lawyers as saying that they didnt do anything specifically wrong.</p>
              <p>Actually I agree with that.</p>
              <p>In terms of law, of course formally and legally speaking, they did not do anything wrong.</p>
              <p>That is why I mention my suggestion, that the management of the premises must take initiative and notice this issue, an issue of loitering and overcrowding, and in some cases like these ones, gawking and leering, which disturb other visitors and customers.</p>
              <p>Therefore the management can make the decision to turn them away.</p>
              <p>Now I mention this because I am convinced that if the management do that, it is also something that does not specifically violate any laws.</p>
              <p>It is a failure and derelection of duty by the management if they overlook this problem.</p>
