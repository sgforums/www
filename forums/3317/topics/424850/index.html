              <h1>Massive 8.9 magnitude quake hit northeast Japan</h1>
              <p><span id="lw_1299828064_0" class="yshortcuts">TOKYO</span> (Reuters) - A massive 8.9 magnitude quake hit northeast Japan on Friday,
                   causing many injuries, fires and a four-metre (13-ft) tsunami along 
                  parts of the country's coastline, NHK television and witnesses reported.</p>
              <p>There were several strong aftershocks and a warning of a 10-metre
                   tsunami following the quake, which also caused buildings to shake 
                  violently in the capital Tokyo.</p>
              <p>TV pictures showed a vast wall of water carrying buildings and debris across a large swathe of coastal farmland.</p>
              <p>Public broadcaster NHK showed flames and black smoke billowing 
                  from a building in Odaiba, a Tokyo suburb, and bullet trains to the 
                  north of the country were halted.</p>
              <p>Black smoke was also pouring out of an industrial area in 
                  Yokohama's Isogo area. TV footage showed boats, cars and trucks floating
                   in water after a small tsunami hit the town of Kamaichi in northern 
                  Japan. An overpass, location unknown, appeared to have collapsed into 
                  the water.</p>
              <p>Kyodo news agency said there were reports of fires in the city of Sendai in the northeast.</p>
              <p>"The building shook for what seemed a long time and many people in the newsroom grabbed their helmets and some got under</p>
              <p>their desks," Reuters correspondent Linda Sieg said in Tokyo.</p>
              <p>"It was probably the worst I have felt since I came to Japan more than 20 years ago."</p>
              <p>Passengers on a subway line in Tokyo screamed and grabbed other 
                  passengers' hands. The shaking was so bad it was hard to stand, said 
                  Reuters reporter Mariko Katsumura.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of office workers and shoppers spilled into Hitotsugi street, a shopping street in Akasaka in downtown Tokyo.</p>
              <p>Household goods ranging from toilet paper to clingfilm were flung
                   into the street from outdoor shelves in front of a drugstore.</p>
              <p>Crowds gathered in front of televisions in a shop next to the 
                  drugstore for details. After the shaking from the first quake subsided, 
                  crowds were watching and pointing to construction cranes on an office 
                  building up the street with voices saying, "They're still shaking!", 
                  "Are they going to fall?"</p>
              <p>Asagi Machida, 27, a web designer in Tokyo, sprinted from a coffee shop when the quake hit.</p>
              <p>"The images from the New Zealand earthquake are still fresh in my
                   mind so I was really scared. I couldn't believe such a big earthquake 
                  was happening in Tokyo."</p>
              <p>The U.S. Geological Survey earlier verified a magnitude of 7.9 at
                   a depth of 15.1 miles and located the quake 81 miles east of Sendai, on
                   the main island of Honshu. It later upgraded it to 8.8.</p>
              <p>A police car drove down Hitotsugi Street, lights flashing, 
                  announcing through a bullhorn that there was still a danger of shaking.</p>
              <p>The Tokyo stock market extended its losses after the quake was 
                  announced. The central bank said it would do everything to ensure 
                  financial stability.</p>
              <p>Japan's northeast Pacific coast, called Sanriku, has suffered 
                  from quakes and tsunamis in the past and a 7.2 quake struck on 
                  Wednesday. In 1933, a magnitude 8.1 quake in the area killed more than 
                  3,000 people. Last year fishing facilities were damaged after by a 
                  tsunami caused by a strong tremor in Chile.</p>
              <p>Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most 
                  seismically active areas. The country accounts for about 20 percent of 
                  the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.</p>

              <p>BEIJING - THE powerful earthquake that struck Friday off Japan's 
              Pacific coast was felt as far away as the Chinese capital of Beijing, 
              2,500km to the west, residents said.</p>
              <p>Workers in some office towers reported via chat sites that they had 
              clearly felt the tremor, although no injuries or damage was immediately 
              reported.</p>
              <p>The China Earthquake Administration said it had received reports from
               residents across the city who also claimed to have felt it.</p>
              <p>The quake was not noticeable in AFP's Beijing bureau.</p>
              <p>Japan issued its top tsunami warning after the quake hit.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Kan: No radiation leak due to Japan quake</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - JAPAN'S prime minister Naoto Kan says nuclear power 
              facilities in the northeastern area of the country were not damaged and 
              there was no radiation leakage.</p>
              <p>However, Mr Kan said that the 8.9-magnitude quake had caused 'major damage'.</p>
              <p>'I ask the people to act calmly while listening carefully to information from radio and TV,' he said.</p>
              <p>The offshore quake Friday triggered a tsunami that hit Japan's northeastern coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.</p>
              <p>The government's top spokesman, Yukio Edano, said that the

              <h1 class="headline">Widespread tsunami warning after Japan quake</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A <span id="lw_1299833830_1" class="yshortcuts">tsunami warning</span> has been issued for the entire Pacific basin, except for the mainland 
              United States and Canada, following a huge earthquake that hit Japan on 
              Friday, the <span id="lw_1299833830_0" class="yshortcuts">Pacific Tsunami Warning Center</span> said.</p>
              <p>It said that among the countries for which a tsunami warning is in effect are: <span id="lw_1299833830_3" class="yshortcuts">Russia</span>, Taiwan, the Philippines, <span id="lw_1299833830_5" class="yshortcuts">Indonesia</span>, <span id="lw_1299833830_2" class="yshortcuts">Papua New Guinea</span>, Australia, New Zealand, <span id="lw_1299833830_4" class="yshortcuts">Fiji</span>, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, <span id="lw_1299833830_8" class="yshortcuts">Chile</span>, <span id="lw_1299833830_7" class="yshortcuts">Ecuador</span>, <span id="lw_1299833830_6" class="yshortcuts">Colombia</span> and Peru.</p>
              <p>The biggest earthquake to hit Japan in 140 years struck the northeast
               coast on Friday, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that swept away 
              everything in its path, including houses and cars.</p>
              <p>By 8:00 a.m. GMT there had been no reports of a serious tsunami hitting anywhere beyond Japan.</p>
              <p>"A tsunami is a series of waves and the first wave may not be the 
              largest," the center said. "The threat can continue for many hours as 
              multiple waves arrive."</p>

              <h2>MFA seeking info on S’poreans affected by Japan quake</h2>
              <p>Yahoo! Singapore understands that Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign 
              Affairs is desperately trying to get in touch with its Japanese 
              consulates to see if any Singaporeans have been affected by the monster 
              8.9 quake that hit northeast Japan on Friday.</p>
              <p>The quake  off the coast of Sendai triggered a 10-metre tsunami that 
              swept away everything in its path, including houses, cars, farm 
              buildings on fire and boats, media and witnesses said.</p>
              <p>Numbers of casualties are still patchy but Japanese media have warned
               the strength of the quake was “unprecedented”. Japan’s Prime Minister 
              has also warned of “extensive damage” in Sendai, which was the major 
              city closest to the epicentre of the quake, which was felt as far away 
              as Beijing.</p>
              <p>Singaporean Acra Koh, 25, a student studying in Tokyo, is back in 
              Singapore for a holiday and she told Yahoo! Singapore she’s been trying 
              desperately to get in touch with her Japanese friends.</p>
              <p>At least one person was killed in Fukushima prefecture, north of 
              Tokyo where four million homes were without power. There were several 
              strong aftershocks. In the capital Tokyo, some 370km away from Sendai, 
              buildings shook violently.</p>
              <p>Mr Ronnie Livni, a 42-year-old American living in Tokyo, said, “I 
              felt the aftershocks. I’ve been living in Japan for 20 years and used to
               having quakes but this one just kept going and going. The fridge moved 
              two metres. Laptop jumped off the desk and everything’s on the floor.”</p>
              <p>It’s expected that with extensive damage in the northeast of Japan, mobile and phone lines could be jammed or out of service.</p>
              <p>Secretary-general of The Japanese Association of Singapore Mr Sugino Kazuo told <em>Yahoo! Singapore </em>that
               he has not been able to contact his parents who live in the Chiba 
              prefecture, an area affected by the aftershocks of the earthquake.</p>
              <p>It was also reported that the Cosmo oil refinery in Chiba prefecture outside Tokyo has exploded, sending flames dozens of metres into the air, with firefighters unable to contain the inferno.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile local travel agents are also bracing for a wave of cancellations to the north-east of Japan in the coming days.</p>
              <p>Ms Eva from SA Tours told Yahoo!, “For now no cancellations and we 
              are keeping a lookout for the next two days. But if there are 
              cancellations, I won’t be surprised.”</p>
