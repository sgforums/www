              <p><strong>Fears mount as Japan struggles with stricken nuke reactors</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>FUKUSHIMA, Japan : Japan battled a nuclear emergency on Sunday 
              in which the government said two partial meltdowns may have taken place 
              and radiation had escaped from reactors at a quake-damaged atomic power 
              plant.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>About 200,000 people
               have been evacuated from residential areas around the Fukushima No. 1 
              plant, 250 kilometres (120 miles) north of Tokyo, as global concern 
              grows over the threat of a major disaster.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Japan's top 
              government spokesman Yukio Edano said it was highly likely that a 
              partial meltdown had occurred in one reactor of the Fukushima plant, and
               that authorities were working on the assumption that one may occur in 
              another.<br><br>Edano added that the radiation released into the air so far had not reached levels high enough to affect human health.<br><br>The
               crisis began with Friday's massive quake and tsunami disaster, the 
              worst on record in Japan, which caused electricity blackouts and led to 
              malfunctions of the cooling systems of the plant's reactors.<br><br>Authorities
               immediately declared a nuclear emergency and have since scrambled to 
              prevent reactors at two plants from overheating by pumping in water and 
              releasing steam to depressurise them.<br><br>Operator Tokyo Electric 
              Power (TEPCO) took the drastic measure of using sea water to cool 
              reactor one - where a huge explosion on Saturday tore away the outer 
              concrete housing while leaving the steel reactor intact.<br><br>The use 
              of freely available, but corrosive seawater is seen as a desperate step 
              and an admission that the reactor will never again be operational.<br><br>On
               Sunday, the operator warned that another reactor, number three, was 
              also overheating and that so much water had evaporated at one stage that
               the top three metres (10 feet) of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods were 
              exposed to the air.<br><br>A TEPCO spokesman later told AFP that the rods were covered again.<br><br>Edano
               said the pressure build-up at reactor three had forced another release 
              of vapour to depressurise the facility and that "we assume that a minute
               amount of radioactivity was released".<br><br>Nuclear plant operators 
              must alert the government when the hourly level of radioactivity reaches
               500 micro sievert - and Edano said the level had topped 1,200 on Sunday
               morning.<br><br>Edano later warned of the risk that the building around
               reactor number three could also explode, but voiced confidence that the
               reactor would also survive and that there would be no adverse effect on
               the health of nearby residents.<br><br>The government has evacuated 
              people from a 20 kilometre (12 mile) radius around the facility - while 
              also moving people out of areas surrounding a second nearby plant, 
              Fukushima No. 2, which has four reactors.<br><br>A total of 22 people 
              has been hospitalised after being exposed to radioactivity, although it 
              was not immediately clear to what degree they were exposed and what 
              condition they were in.<br><br>In the city of Fukushima, set amid 
              mountains some 80 kilometres northwest of the seaside plants, fears of a
               greater emergency grew, and people rushed to stock up on supplies. 
              Petrol stations had already run dry.<br><br>Hundreds joined orderly 
              queues outside a co-op market where shop assistants wore surgical masks 
              and overalls, and shoppers came out carrying as many bottles of water, 
              groceries and other supplies as they could.<br><br>Naruki Ono, 40, who 
              had travelled for 40 minutes to reach the town, said: "People are 
              nervous. People are not panicked, but nuclear plants are scary. The 
              bottom line is: I will pray that the nuclear plant doesn't explode."<br><br>Early
               Sunday, the country's nuclear safety agency rated the accident at four 
              on an international scale from 0 to 7. The 1979 Three Mile Island 
              accident in the United States was rated five while the 1986 Chernobyl 
              disaster was a seven.<br><br>But an official warned the rating might change as the situation developed.<br><br>Japan's
               centre-left Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who was battling opinion poll 
              ratings below 20 per cent before the disaster struck, faced media 
              criticism on Sunday over his government's response to the nuclear 
              crisis.<br><br>The Yomiuri Shimbun daily noted that it took five hours 
              for the government to publicly address fears about a nuclear meltdown 
              after the blast on Saturday, while an Asahi Shimbun headline charged: 
              "Crisis management all mixed up".<br><br>- AFP/ms</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Blast at Japan nuke plant, reactor not thought breached</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - AN EXPLOSION shook a quake-damaged Japanese nuclear power 
              plant on Monday but the reactor was apparently not breached, the chief 
              government spokesman Yukio Edano said.</p>
              <p>Mr Edano, citing information from the plant operator Tepco, said the 
              reactor container was likely undamaged and there was a low possibility 
              of major radiation.</p>
              <p>A Tepco official said some workers were injured but gave no numbers 
              or details. Japan's nuclear safety agency said the blast, at the number 3
               reactor of the Fukushima No. 1 plant, was believed to be caused by 
              hydrogen.</p>
              <p>A hydrogen explosion had hit the number 1 reactor at the 
              same plant on Saturday, a day after an earthquake and tsunami devastated
               the north-east coast. Authorities have declared an evacuation zone 
              within a 20km radius of the plant and evacuated 210,000 people.</p>
              <p>'We have strongly advised all the people still within the 
              evacuation area to go inside nearby facilities,' said nuclear safety 
              agency spokesman Ryo Miyake.</p>
              <p>Some 746 people - patients, elderly people and care workers 
              at three hospitals and nursing homes - remained within the 20km area on 
              Monday. A Fukushima official said 311 had so far been moved out.</p>

              <h1>Volcano Eruption in Japan</h1>
              <p>A volcano in southwestern Japan erupted Sunday after nearly two weeks of relative silence, sending ash and rocks up to four kilometres (two and a half miles) into the air, a local official says.</p>
              <p>It was not immediately clear if the eruption was a direct result of the massive 8.9-magnitude earthquake that rocked northern areas Friday, unleashing a fierce tsunami and sparking fears that more than 10,000 may have been killed.</p>
              <p>The 1,421-metre (4,689-feet) Shinmoedake volcano in the Kirishima range saw its first major eruption for 52 years in January. There had not been any major activity at the site since March 1.</p>
              <p>Authorities have maintained a volcano warning at a level of three out of five, restricting access to the entire mountain.</p>
              <p>In April last year, the eruption of the Eyjafjoell volcano in Iceland dispersed a vast cloud of ash, triggering a huge shutdown of airspace that affected more than 100,000 flights and eight million passengers.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">New failure hits Japan nuke plant after blast</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - ENGINEERS struggled on Monday to cool three nuclear reactors 
              at a quake-damaged Japanese power plant which has been hit by two 
              explosions since Friday's catastrophic earthquake.</p>
              <p>Fuel rods at one reactor were almost fully exposed at one point on 
              Monday, when a pump pouring cooling seawater around them ran out of its 
              own fuel.</p>
              <p>But chief government spokesman Yukio Edano said that ongoing work to 
              cool the number-two reactor would hopefully stabilise the situation.</p>
              <p>He said radiation around the Fukushima No. 1 plant, located 250km north of Tokyo, was at a tolerable level for humans.</p>
              <p>Plant operator TEPCO said late in the evening that the water
               level was rising fast, easing fears the rods could overheat and release
               radiation should the reactor's container be breached.</p>
              <p>Japan has been grappling with a nuclear emergency since a 
              massive earthquake and tsunami battered its northeast coast on Friday.

              just before 3.00pm local time (2pm Singapore time). The authorities 
              issue a tsunami warning.</p>
              <p>- A 10-metre tsunami wave smashes over the northeastern 
              Japanese coast, causing massive damage and flooding. A series of 
              aftershocks follows, many exceeding a magnitude of 7.0.</p>
              <p>- Japanese authorities announce that four nuclear power 
              stations in quake-hit areas have been shut down. Eventually 11 of the 
              nation's roughly 50 plants stop producing power.</p>
              <p>- The US Geological Service announces the quake was the most powerful to hit Japan since records began.</p>
              <p><strong>Saturday, March 12: </strong></p>
              <p>- The Japanese government orders the evacuation of residents
               living close to the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, where the 
              disaster has caused cooling systems to fail and raised fears of a 
              meltdown.</p>
              <p>- An explosion occurs in a building housing one of the plant's reactors.</p>
              <p>- Japan mobilises some 100,000 military and other rescue 
              personnel. Aid pours in from around the world, including from the US 
              military stationed in Japan.</p>
              <p>- Video images show the extent of the damage, with the 
              tsunami washing away houses and cars and hurling ships far inland, while
               fires blaze over large areas.</p>
              <p>The US Geological Survey says the force of the quake moved Honshu - the main Japanese island - by 2.4 metres .</p>
              <p><strong>Sunday, March 13: </strong></p>
              <p>- The government says 230,000 people have been evacuated from the vicinity of the crippled nuclear reactors.</p>
              <p>- While the overall toll remains unclear, the police chief 
              in badly-hit Miyagi prefecture said the number of deaths was certain to 
              exceed 10,000 in his region alone.</p>
              <p>- A man who was swept out to sea on a piece of the roof of his house is rescued by a naval vessel.</p>
              <p>- The Japanese government announces energy rationing due to 
              the shutdown of nuclear power stations. Millions of residents are 
              without any power or water.</p>
              <p>- The Japanese weather service says there is a 70 per cent 
              chance that a further aftershock with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher could
               occur within three days.</p>
              <p><strong>Monday, March 14: </strong></p>
              <p>- A second explosion occurs at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power station.</p>
              <p>- Rescuers say they have found 2,000 bodies in Miyagi prefecture.</p>
              <p>- Share prices plunge 6.18 per cent on the Tokyo stock exchange.</p>
              <p>- A United Nations humanitarian agency says 1.4 million 
              Japanese are without running water and more than half a million have 
              been evacuated.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">New explosion shakes stricken Japanese nuclear plant</h1>
              <p>FUKUSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - A fresh explosion rocked a damaged Japanese nuclear power plant on Tuesday where engineers have been pumping sea water into a reactor to prevent a catastrophic meltdown in the wake of a devastating earthquake and tsunami.</p>
              <p>Japan's nuclear safety agency said Tuesday's explosion at the plant's No.2 reactor was caused by hydrogen. There was no immediate word on damage, but Jiji news agency quoted the trade ministry as saying radiation levels remained low after the blast, the third at the plant since Saturday.</p>
              <p>Japan has asked the United States for more equipment to help cool reactors at the Fukushima nuclear complex, which was hit on Monday by a dangerous drop in cooling water levels that exposed fuel rods in the No. 2 reactor.</p>
              <p>The full extent of the destruction wreaked by Friday's massive quake and tsunami that followed it was still becoming clear, as rescuers combed through the region north of Tokyo where officials say at least 10,000 people were killed.</p>
              <p>"It's a scene from hell, absolutely nightmarish," said Patrick Fuller of the International Red Cross Federation from the northeastern coastal town of Otsuchi.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Japan was facing its worst crisis since World War Two and, with the financial costs estimated at up to $180 billion, analysts said it could tip the world's third biggest economy back into recession.</p>
              <p>The U.S. Geological Survey upgraded the quake to magnitude 9.0, from 8.9, making it the world's fourth most powerful since 1900.</p>

              <p><strong> Radiation levels around reactors a threat to health</strong></p>
              <p>TOKYO - A FIRE has broken out at the number-four reactor at the quake-hit Fukushima No.1 atomic power plant and radiation levels have risen considerably, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Tuesday.
              People between 20-30km from the reactor should stay indoors, Mr Kan said. The radiation levels around the reactors are now a threat to human health, the Japanese government said.
              As well as the atomic emergency, Japan is struggling to cope with the enormity of the damage from the record-breaking quake and the tsunami which raced across vast tracts of its north-east, destroying all before it. The official death toll has risen to 2,414, police said on Tuesday, but officials say at least 10,000 are likely to have perished.
              Japan's nuclear safety agency said the operator of the stricken Fukushima No.1 power plant on the eastern coast believed the seal around the reactor, which is critical for preventing a major radiation leak, had not been holed.
              But the top government spokesman said there appeared to be damage to the structure around the number-two reactor, the third to be hit by an explosion since Friday's disaster which knocked out cooling systems.
              Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) 'said it believes the container vessel has not sustained damage such as a hole, judging from the fact that the radiation level has not jumped', a safety agency spokesman told AFP. Tepco said some workers had been evacuated from the number-two reactor at the plant, located 250km north-east of Tokyo, but those pumping water to cool the reactor were still at work.
              Higher radiation levels were recorded in Ibaraki prefecture north of Tokyo after the the blast, Kyodo News reported, but it quoted the safety agency as saying that the level did not pose health risks. -- AFP</p>

              <p>Currently, 3 reactors had experienced suspected hydrogen explosion.</p>
              <p>However, no further news reports on the breach of the containment.</p>
              <p>Well, risk of a partial meltdown is low, a full meltdown is very low currently. However, it depends on the fuel rods. If the fuel rods melt, then a partial meltdown is very real.</p>
              <p>So far, this only means fuel prices will skyrocket which means higher cost of living.</p>

              <p>TOKYO - THE official death toll from a killer earthquake and tsunami 
              that flattened Japan's north-east coast has topped 2,400, police said on
               Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The National Police Agency said 2,414 people are confirmed dead and 
              3,118 missing, with 1,885 injured from the disaster which struck on 
              Friday afternoon.</p>
              <p>The official toll yesterday was 1,647.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, the police chief of Miyagi, one of the 
              hardest-hit prefectures, said the number of deaths was expected to 
              exceed 10,000 in his region alone.</p>
              <p>Amid a mass rescue effort there were grim updates indicating
               severe loss of life along the battered east coast of Honshu island, 
              where the monster waves destroyed or damaged more than 55,380 homes and 
              other buildings.</p>
              <p>More than 3,000 houses were flooded by the tsunami, while 
              some 130 houses had been burned, police said, adding that there were 68

              9.0-magnitude quake also hit off the coast of the remote Kamchatka 
              peninsula in Russia's far east on November 4, 1952, causing Pacific-wide
               tsunamis.<br><br>The USGS said on its website that quake magnitudes are
               often revised once its experts have received all the seismology reports
               from around the world and the estimates from other national and 
              international agencies.<br><br>"Some methods give approximate values 
              within minutes of the earthquake, and others require more complete data 
              sets and extensive analysis," it added.<br><br>Japan has been left 
              reeling by Friday's natural catastrophe, with more than 10,000 feared 
              dead, whole villages devastated, at least 1.4 million people left 
              without running water and more than 500,000 crammed into shelters.<br><br>The
               Asian nation is also facing a nuclear emergency after the quake and 
              tsunami crippled the ageing Fukushima plant, located 250 kilometres 
              northeast of Tokyo, knocking out the cooling systems.<br><br>Two 
              explosions have rocked the complex and the Japanese government said part
               of the container of one of the reactors appeared to be damaged, 
              indicating possible serious radiation leaks.<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>
