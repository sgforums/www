              <p>PLANS are under way for a Singaporean inventor to ship at least 100 of his environmentally-friendly coffins to Japan.</p>
              <p>The lightweight Eco-ffins created by Dr Ng Khee Yang, 47, are made of
               cardboard, plywood and compressed wood dust. These materials burn more 
              quickly than that of a regular coffin and as a result, use less fuel.</p>
              <p>It is intended to help overcome the reported shortage of fuel for 
              cremation and coffins in villages and small towns that have been 
              overwhelmed by the thousands who died after a massive earthquake and 
              tsunami hit north-east Japan on March 11.</p>
              <p>Said Dr Ng, a director of the Centre for Applications in 
              Environmental Technology at Singapore Polytechnic: 'I see it as a duty 
              to use my product to meet just one of the many needs in Japan.'</p>
              <p>Japan's death toll has exceeded 9,700 and about 16,500 people are missing.</p>
              <p>Although the dead need to be removed from the open quickly 
              to avoid the spread of waterborne diseases, returning volunteers from 
              Singapore non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had indicated that 
              relief efforts were focused on helping the living, he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Reactor fear at Japan plant as toll tops 10,000</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SENDAI, Japan : The operator of a disaster-struck Japanese 
              nuclear plant on Friday reported possible damage to a reactor vessel - 
              casting a new shadow over efforts to control a steady radiation leak.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Two weeks after a 
              giant quake struck and sent a massive tsunami crashing into the Pacific 
              coast, the death toll from Japan's worst post-war disaster topped 10,000
               and there was scant hope for 17,500 others still missing.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The tsunami 
              obliterated entire towns. Some 250,000 homeless in almost 2,000 shelters
               are braving privations and a winter chill, with a degree of discipline 
              and dignity that has impressed the world.<br><br>The focus of Japan's 
              fears remained the Fukushima nuclear plant, which was still emitting 
              radioactive vapour that at one point this week made the capital's 
              drinking water unsafe for infants.<br><br>China, South Korea and the EU 
              joined the United States, Russia and several other nations in 
              restricting food imports from Japan, which itself has ordered a stop to 
              vegetable and dairy shipments from the region near the atomic plant.<br><br>A
               day after two workers at the 1970s-era facility were hospitalised with 
              radiation burns, its operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) reported 
              possible damage at reactor number three.<br><br>"It is possible that the pressure vessel containing the fuel rods in the reactor is damaged," a TEPCO spokesman told AFP.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The new safety scare
               could hamper urgent efforts to restore power to the all-important 
              cooling systems at the plant, located 250 kilometres (155 miles) 
              northeast of Tokyo.<br><br>"Radioactive substances have leaked to places
               far from the reactor," said a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety 
              agency, Hideyuki Nishiyama.<br><br>"As far as the data show, we believe 
              there is a certain level of containment ability but it's highly possible
               that the reactor is damaged."<br><br>The reactor is a particular 
              concern because it is the only one of six at the plant to use a 
              potentially volatile mix of uranium and plutonium.<br><br>A hydrogen explosion badly damaged the unit's outer building on March 14, and a partial meltdown is also suspected. <br><br>Higher
               radioactivity has also been detected in the ocean near the Fukushima 
              plant on Japan's Pacific coast, raising public fears about the safety of
               fish and seaweed, which are traditional staples in the island nation's 
              diet.<br><br>"This terrifies me from the depth of my heart," Sunao 
              Tsuboi, a survivor of the US atom bomb attack on Hiroshima in 1945 who 
              is in his mid-80s, told AFP.<br><br>"Radiation damages genes and DNA. This is something that no doctor can fix. There is no proper remedy for radiation exposure." </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Two Japanese 
              travellers were briefly sent to hospital in China with radiation levels 
              well above normal levels after they arrived in the eastern city of Wuxi 
              on Wednesday on a flight from Tokyo, China's safety watchdog said.<br><br>A
               doctor at a hospital in the nearby city of Suzhou told AFP the pair 
              were checked, "decontaminated" and released, and the safety watchdog 
              said they did not pose any threat to other travellers. <br><br>Radiation
               was also detected on a Japanese merchant vessel that berthed in the 
              southeastern Chinese port city of Xiamen on Monday, the Chinese watchdog
               said.<br><br>The list of contaminated foodstuffs grew Friday when the 
              health ministry said radiation above the legal limit had been detected 
              in Japanese mustard spinach grown in Tokyo.<br><br>At the Fukushima 
              plant, workers kept spraying seawater onto overheating reactors and fuel
               rod pools as a stop-gap measure to prevent a larger meltdown, while 
              trying to rebuild the original cooling systems.<br><br>The pair 
              hospitalised Thursday were installing cables in the basement of the 
              third reactor's turbine building when they stepped into water containing
               iodine, caesium and cobalt 10,000 times the normal level, TEPCO said.<br><br>The
               men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were wearing radiation suits but had on
               ill-fitting shoes, and they had ignored a warning alarm from their 
              dosimeters, "assuming a problem with the device", a TEPCO official said.<br><br>A
               total of 17 workers have been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts, 
              the level at which the risk of developing cancer rises, the company 
              says.<br><br>TEPCO admitted on Friday it may take at least another month
               to achieve a cold shutdown of all reactors - when temperatures inside 
              fall below boiling point and its cooling systems are back at atmospheric
               pressure.<br><br>Japan's top government spokesman Yukio Edano asked 
              people still living within 20-30 kilometres of the plant to leave 
              voluntarily.<br><br>- AFP/al</span></span></p>

               expose a person to their annual safe dose, said an official who however
               ruled out an immediate threat to aquatic life and seafood safety.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The iodine-131 level
               in the Pacific Ocean waters just off the Fukushima plant was 1,250 
              times above the legal limit -- compared with readings of 126 times 
              higher taken on Tuesday, and 145 higher on Thursday.<br><br>"This is a 
              relatively high level," nuclear safety agency official Hidehiko 
              Nishiyama said in a televised press conference on the test results from 
              Friday released by plant operator the Tokyo Electric Power Company 
              (TEPCO).<br><br>Assessing the likely impact on aquatic life, Nishiyama 
              added: "Generally speaking, radioactive material released into the sea 
              will spread due to tides, so you need much more for seaweed and sea life
               to absorb it."<br><br>He added that because iodine-131 has a half-life 
              -- the time in which half of it decays -- of eight days, "by the time 
              people eat the sea products, its amount is likely to have diminished 
              significantly."<br><br>However, TEPCO in a statement also said that 
              levels of caesium-137, which has a half life of about 30 years, was 79.6
               times the legal maximum.<br><br>The assurances did little to lift the 
              gloom that has hung over Japan since a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake 
              struck on March 11 and sent a monster tsunami crashing into the 
              northeast coast in the country's worst post-war disaster.<br><br>The 
              wave easily overwhelmed the world's biggest sea defences and swallowed 
              entire communities. The confirmed death toll rose to 10,151 on Saturday,
               with little hope seen for most of the 17,053 listed as missing.<br><br>The
               wave knocked out the cooling systems for the six reactors of the 
              Fukushima plant, leading to suspected partial meltdowns in three of them
               and hydrogen explosions and fires that have ripped through the 
              facility.<br><br>Fire engines have hosed thousands of tons of seawater 
              onto the facility in a bid to keep the fuel rods inside reactor cores 
              and pools from being exposed to the air, where they could reach critical
               stage and go into full meltdown.<br><br>Radioactive iodine, caesium and
               cobalt levels in water in the turbine buildings next to reactors one 
              and three were 10,000 times the normal level -- raising fears that the 
              reactor vessels or their valves and pipes are leaking.<br><br>The 
              worst-case scenario at reactor three would be that the fuel inside the 
              reactor core -- a volatile uranium-plutonium mix -- has already started 
              to burn its way through its steel pressure vessel.<br><br>Worried about 
              the salt buildup in the crippled plant, engineers have started pumping 
              in fresh water instead. More is being shipped in, including on two US 
              military water barges headed for the plant from a naval base near Tokyo.<br><br>Radioactive
               vapour from the plant has contaminated farm produce and dairy products 
              in the region, leading to shipment halts in Japan as well as the United 
              States, European Union, China and a host of other nations.<br><br>Higher
               than normal radiation has also been detected in tap water in and around
               Tokyo, some 250 kilometres (155 miles) from the plant, leading 
              authorities at one stage to warn against using it for baby milk formula.<br><br>Japan
               widened the zone around the plant where it suggests people evacuate, to
               30 kilometres (20 miles) -- still below the 80 kilometres advised by 
              the United States, and larger areas including Tokyo in other nations' 
              alerts.<br><br>Environmental watchdog Greenpeace started its own 
              monitoring near the plant, charging that "authorities have consistently 
              appeared to underestimate both the risks and extent of radioactive 
              contamination".<br><br>"We have come to Fukushima to bear witness to the
               impacts of this crisis and to provide some independent insight into the
               resulting radioactive contamination," said the group's radioactivity 
              safety advisor Jan van de Putte.<br><br>The campaign group said it would provide "an alternative to the often contradictory information released by nuclear regulators".<br></span><span><br>-AFP/ac</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Workers evacuated as radioactivity rises in reactor</h1>
              <p>OSAKA - EXTREMELY high levels of radiation were detected in water 
              leaking from reactor two of the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, 
              forcing the evacuation of workers, its operator said on Sunday.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power said the level of radiation 
              found in the leaked water was 10 million times higher than it should be 
              for water inside the reactor, indicating damage to the fuel rods.</p>
              <p>'We detected 1,000 millisieverts per hour of radiation in a puddle of
               water at the reactor number two. This figure is 10 million times higher
               than water usually kept in a reactor,' the spokesman said.</p>
              <p>'We are examining the cause of this, but no work is being done there because of the high level of radiation.</p>
              <p>'High levels of caesium and other substances are being 
              detected, which usually should not be found in reactor water. There is a
               high possibility that fuel rods are being damaged.' -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Highly radioactive water spreads at Japan plant</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>OSAKA, Japan : Highly radioactive water has leaked from a 
              reactor turbine building at a stricken nuclear plant in Japan, the 
              operator said on Monday, adding to fears the liquid is seeping into the 
              environment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The water, found in 
              an underground tunnel linked to the number two reactor at the Fukushima 
              plant, showed a radiation reading of more than 1,000 millisieverts per 
              hour, a Tokyo Electric Power official told reporters.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>There is estimated to be several thousand cubic metres of water inside the tunnel.<br><br>"We need to check if the water could flow directly into the sea," he said.<br><br>Each reactor turbine building is connected to a maintenance tunnel large enough for workers to walk through.<br><br>In
               the case of the reactor two tunnel, the water has risen to within one 
              metre (three feet) of the top of a 15.9-metre access shaft which is 
              located 55 metres from the sea, raising concerns it could overflow. <br><br>Levels
               of radioactive iodine some 1,850 times the legal limit were reported 
              Sunday several hundred metres offshore, but officials ruled out an 
              immediate threat to marine life and seafood safety.<br><br>Radiation of 
              more than 1,000 millisieverts per hour was earlier found in water in the
               turbine building of the number two reactor, delaying urgent work to 
              restore the cooling systems and bring the facility back under control.<br><br>The
               exposure limit set by the government for workers at the 
              tsunami-stricken plant is 250 millisieverts per year. A single dose of 
              1,000 millisieverts can cause temporary radiation sickness, including 
              nausea and vomiting.<br><br>Workers are trying to pinpoint the exact 
              source of the radioactive water leak, but there are concerns that fuel 
              rod vessels or their valves and pipes are damaged.<br><br>A March 11 
              magnitude 9.0 earthquake and towering tsunami knocked out cooling 
              systems for the six reactors at the Fukushima plant, leading to 
              suspected partial meltdowns in three of them.  <br><br>Huge amounts of 
              seawater has been hosed onto the plant in a bid to keep the fuel rods 
              from being exposed to the air, and prevent a full meltdown.<br><br>The 
              tunnels for reactors one and three are also close to overflowing, but so
               far workers have not detected such high radiation levels in the water 
              in those, the official said.<br><br>Nuclear safety agency spokesman 
              Hidehiko Nishiyama said the operator would focus on trying to pump water
               out of the turbine buildings, which it hopes will ease the problem with
               the water in the tunnels.<br><br>- AFP/al</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Toxic plutonium seeping from Japan's nuclear plant</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - HIGHLY toxic plutonium is seeping from the damaged nuclear 
              power plant in Japan's tsunami disaster zone into the soil outside, 
              officials said on Tuesday, further complicating the delicate operation 
              to stabilise the overheated facility.</p>
              <p>Plutonium has been detected in small amounts at several spots outside
               the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant for the first time, plant operator 
              Tokyo Electric Power Co said.</p>
              <p>Safety officials said the amounts were not a risk to humans but 
              support suspicions that dangerously radioactive water is leaking from 
              damaged nuclear fuel rods - a worrying development in the race to bring 
              the power plant under control.</p>
              <p>'The situation is very grave,' Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio
               Edano told reporters on Tuesday. 'We are doing our utmost efforts to 
              contain the damage.' A tsunami spawned by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake 
              March 11 destroyed the power systems needed to cool the nuclear fuel 
              rods in the complex, 220km north-east of Tokyo.</p>
              <p>Since then, three of the complex's six reactors are believed
               to have partially melted down, and emergency crews have grappled with 
              everything from malfunctioning pumps to dangerous spikes in radiation 
              that have sent workers fleeing.</p>
              <p>Radiation seeping from the plant has made its way into 
              produce, raw milk and even tap water as far away as Tokyo, prompting 
              some nations to halt imports from the region. Residents within a 20km 
              radius of the plant have been urged to leave or stay indoors. -- AP</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Japan PM urges clean energy push</h1>
              <p>OSAKA - JAPAN'S Premier Naoto Kan said on Tuesday the country must 
              push alternative energy sources as it recovers from its quake and 
              tsunami disaster and struggles to contain a nuclear emergency.</p>
              <p>'Taking this as a lesson, we have to lead the world in clean energy, 
              such as solar and biomass, and make it a major pillar of a new Japan,' 
              the centre-left leader told a parliamentary committee.</p>
              <p>His top spokesman, Yukio Edano, later said that the use of clean 
              energy sources would likely be a key feature of a reconstruction plan 
              for the north-eastern region where entire towns were swept away on March
               11.</p>
              <p>'In overcoming the devastation and creating a 
              future-oriented vision, we are looking into the possibility of promoting
               and pushing more for clean energy,' Mr Edano was quoted as saying by 
              Kyodo News agency.</p>
              <p>A massive 14m tsunami sparked by the seabed quake hit the 
              coastal Fukushima nuclear plant north-east of Tokyo, which has since 
              emitted radiation into the air and sea, sparking international concern.</p>
              <p>Resource-poor Japan, highly dependent on Middle Eastern oil,
               meets about one third of its energy needs with nuclear power, but its 
              high-tech companies are also world leaders in many environmental and 
              energy-saving technologies. -- AFP</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Low-level radiation found in Massachusetts rainwater</h1>
              <p><span id="lw_1301291105_2" class="yshortcuts">BOSTON</span> (Reuters) - Trace amounts of radioactive iodine linked to Japan's 
              crippled nuclear power station have turned up in rainwater samples as 
              far away as <span id="lw_1301291105_3" class="yshortcuts">Massachusetts</span> during the past week, state officials said on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The low level of radioiodine-131 detected in precipitation at a 
              sample location in Massachusetts is comparable to findings in 
              California, <span id="lw_1301291105_1" class="yshortcuts">Washington state</span> and <span id="lw_1301291105_5" class="yshortcuts">Pennsylvania</span> and poses no threat to drinking supplies, public health officials said.</p>
              <p>Air samples from the same location in Massachusetts have shown no detectable radiation.</p>
              <p>The samples are being collected from more than 100 sites around 
              the country that are part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 
              Radiation Network monitoring system.</p>
              <p>"The drinking water supply in Massachusetts is unaffected by this short-term, slight elevation in radiation," said <span id="lw_1301291105_4" class="yshortcuts">Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner John Auerbach</span>.</p>
              <p>"We will carefully monitor the drinking water as we exercise an abundance of caution," he said.</p>
              <p>At concentrations found, the radioiodine-131 would likely become 
              undetectable in a "relative short time," according to a statement issued
               by agency.</p>
              <p>Trace amounts of radiation believed to have originated from damaged <span id="lw_1301291105_0" class="yshortcuts">Fukushima</span> Daiichi reactors in the aftermath of Japan's devastating 9.0 earthquake
               on March 11 have also been detected in air samples in several western 
              U.S. states, but at levels so small they posed no risk to human health.</p>
