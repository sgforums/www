              <h1 class="storyheadline">Higher than normal radiation in Tokyo: City govt</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - A HIGHER than normal level of radiation was detected in 
              Japan's capital Tokyo on Tuesday, but a city government official said it
               was not considered at the level where it harms human health.</p>
              <p>Radiation spewed on Tuesday from a crippled nuclear power plant in 
              tsunami-ravaged north-eastern Japan in a dramatic escalation of the 
              4-day-old catastrophe that prompted the government to tell people within
               30km to stay indoors to avoid exposure.</p>
              <p>In a nationally televised statement, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said 
              radiation has spread from the three reactors of the Fukushima Dai-ichi 
              nuclear plant in one of the hardest-hit provinces in Friday's 
              9.0-magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami.</p>
              <p>'The level seems very high, and there is still a very high 
              risk of more radiation coming out,' Mr Kan said. He warned there are 
              dangers of more leaks and told people living within 30km of the Dai-ichi
               complex to stay indoors to avoid potential health risks from the 
              radiation.</p>
              <p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said a fourth reactor at
               the complex was on fire and more radiation had been released. 'Now we 
              are talking about levels that can damage human health. These are 
              readings taken near the area where we believe the releases are 
              happening. Far away, the levels should be lower,' Mr Edano said.</p>
              <p>The death toll from last week's earthquake and tsunami 
              jumped Tuesday as police confirmed the number killed had topped 2,400, 
              though that grim news was overshadowed by a deepening nuclear crisis. 
              Officials have said previously that at least 10,000 people may have died
               in Miyagi province alone.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Radiation level falls in Tokyo: city government</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - THE level of radiation in Tokyo fell on Tuesday afternoon 
              after rising above normal levels in the morning due to radiation 
              emmitted from a quake-hit nuclear power plant, metropolitan officials 
              said.</p>
              <p>Tokyo officials said they detected 0.809 of a micro-sievert between 
              10.00 am (9am Singapore time) and 11.00am in the capital, some 250km 
              southwest of the troubled Fukushima plant on the Pacific coast.</p>
              <p>The normal level is about 0.035-0.036 micro-sieverts. A chest X-ray typically involves a dose of 20 micro-sieverts.</p>
              <p>'We monitored a higher than normal amount of radiation in 
              the morning in Tokyo. But we don't consider it to be at a level where 
              the human body is affected,' said Sairi Koga, an official of the Tokyo 
              Metropolitan Government. The level fell to an average 0.075 
              micro-sieverts four hours later, he said.</p>
              <p>'It is returning closer to the normal level. But we need to 
              keep a close watch on it,' health and welfare official Keiichi Nakaya 
              said.</p>
              <p>The central government warned on Tuesday that radiation 
              levels near the quake-stricken nuclear plant were now harmful to human 
              health, following two explosions and a fire earlier in the day.</p>

              <p>Rescuers pulled a 70-year-old woman from her toppled home Tuesday, 
              five days after an earthquake-spurred tsunami tossed the house off its 
              foundation in Japan's northeast.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1300192568_2" class="yshortcuts">The rescues</span> of 
              the elderly Sai Abe and a younger man pulled from rubble elsewhere in 
              the region were rare good news following Friday's disaster that killed 
              at least 2,700 people and left thousands missing.</p>
              <p>Abe's son said he had tried to save his mother but could not get her to flee her home in the port town of <span id="lw_1300192568_0" class="yshortcuts">Otsuchi</span>. His relief at her rescue, he said, was tempered by the fact that his father is still missing.</p>

              <p>The elderly woman was suffering from <span id="lw_1300192568_3" class="yshortcuts">hypothermia</span> and was sent to a hospital, but appeared to have no life-threatening injuries, said Yuko <span id="lw_1300192568_4" class="yshortcuts">Kotani</span>, a spokesman for <span id="lw_1300192568_5" class="yshortcuts">Osaka fire department</span>.</p>

               survivor, described as being in his 20s, was shown on television being 
              pulled from a building further down the coast in the city of Ishimaki 
              after rescue workers heard him calling for help.</p>
              <p>Conditions for 
              those still alive in the rubble worsened as a cold front arrived 
              Tuesday, further pushing down temperatures. Snow is forecast over the

            <div class='col-md body'><p>With so many things happening, Singapore should really prepare ourselves for natural disasters like this, its the least we can do to protect ourselves. The Japanese are really lucky to have been trained in handling this kind of situations, if it were Singapore, we could all have been in a state of panic and not know what to do, which is potentially fatal for the entire population. Plus, us being kiasu is another negative factor, japan is able to handle the earthquake well because they are people with big hearts, and even the yakuza came out to help, but if it was Singapore...man i can already imagine all the aunties and uncles pushing around to get to higher ground and getting the last of the food reserves, pushing away all the other people(which would unfortunately include the young and the elderly) so we should also change this mindset of ours if we want to survive, because survival is not about ourselves, its about everybody.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Japan's nuclear crisis deepens, emperor addresses nation</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SENDAI : Japan's emperor gave a rare address to a jittery nation
               on Wednesday as a nuclear emergency deepened and millions struggled in 
              desperate conditions after last week's quake and tsunami disaster.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The television 
              appearance by Emperor Akihito emphasised the severity of the crisis 
              gripping Japan after the 9.0-magnitude quake and the waves it unleashed,
               killing thousands and crippling a nuclear power plant.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Akihito said he was 
              "deeply concerned" about the "unpredictable" situation at the stricken 
              Fukushima No.1 power plant, which has been hit by a series of explosions
               after the quake knocked out reactor cooling systems.<br><br>"I 
              sincerely hope that we can keep the situation from getting worse," 
              Akihito said, in an historic televised address that marked the first 
              time he has intervened in a national crisis.<br><br>He added: "I have 
              received messages of condolence from heads of state of various countries
               with kind words that their hearts are with the victims. Allow me to 
              convey the words to people in the afflicted areas."<br><br>Japanese 
              crews grappling with the world's worst nuclear incident since Chernobyl 
              briefly suspended work after a spike in radiation levels at the plant 
              250 kilometres (155 miles) northeast of Tokyo.<br><br>And already jangled nerves were frayed further by a strong 6.0-magnitude earthquake that swayed buildings in Tokyo.<br><br>The
               official toll of the dead and missing after the quake and tsunami 
              flattened Japan's northeast coast on Friday rose to more than 11,000, 
              with 3,676 confirmed killed, police said.<br><br>After the Tokyo stock 
              exchange's biggest two-day sell-off in 24 years sparked a global market 
              rout, the headline Nikkei share index closed up 5.68 per cent on bargain
               hunting.<br><br>The Bank of Japan pumped another 3.5 trillion yen 
              (US$43.3 billion) into the financial system, adding to trillions spent 
              this week since the disaster crippled a large swathe of the economy.<br><br>The
               evacuation order at the Fukushima nuclear power plant came as a tall 
              white cloud was seen billowing into the sky over the stricken complex.<br><br>Earlier,
               crews at Fukushima contended with a new fire and feared damage to the 
              vessel containing one of the plant's six reactor cores.<br><br>The 50 or so workers at the plant have been hailed as heroes.<br><br>"Please
               don't forget that there are people who are working to protect 
              everyone's lives in exchange for their own lives," said one post on 
              Japanese social networking site Mixi.<br><br>Japanese military 
              helicopters were due to dump water on the nuclear plant, which has been 
              hit by four explosions and two fires, to help contain the overheating, 
              but were forced back due to radiation, reports said.<br><br>Engineers 
              have been desperately battling a feared meltdown at the 40-year-old 
              plant since the earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems and 
              fuel rods began overheating.<br><br>But chief government spokesman Yukio
               Edano said radiation levels from the plant posed no immediate health 
              threat outside a 20-kilometres exclusion zone that has already been 
              evacuated.<br><br>France's Nuclear Safety Authority said the disaster 
              now equated to a six on the seven-point international scale for nuclear 
              accidents, ranking the crisis second only in gravity to the level-seven 
              Chernobyl disaster in 1986.<br><br>But Yukiya Amano, the Japanese chief 
              of the International Atomic Energy Agency, insisted on Tuesday there was
               no comparison to the Chernobyl crisis, when radiation spewed across 
              Europe.<br><br>Aside from the nuclear threat, the full scale of the 
              quake and tsunami disaster was becoming clear as more details emerged of
               the staggering death and devastation in the worst-hit northeast.<br><br>"The
               number of people killed is increasing day by day and we do not know how
               many people have fallen victim," said the emperor, who is held in deep 
              respect by many Japanese. <br><br>"I pray for the safety of as many 
              people as possible. People are being forced to evacuate in such severe 
              conditions of bitter cold, with shortages of water and fuel... I cannot 
              help praying that rescue work is done swiftly and people's lives get 
              better, even a little."<br><br>He also thanked emergency personnel - 
              both from Japan and abroad - for their efforts to locate the many 
              missing and help survivors battling difficult conditions including 
              increasingly cold temperatures in the affected zone.<br><br>Millions of 
              Japanese have been left without water, electricity, fuel or enough food 
              and hundreds of thousands more are homeless, stoically coping with 
              freezing cold and wet conditions in the northeast.<br><br>Aomori governor Shingo Mimura said he desperately needed central government assistance to get hold of oil and relief supplies.<br><br>"We cannot possibly get out to rescue survivors nor reconstruct the devastated areas without oil," he said.<br> <br>"There
               are a variety of problems, such as shortages of water, food and 
              blankets as well as difficulties in delivering supplies," added Ryu 
              Matsumoto, state minister in charge of disaster management.<br><br>Tokyo Electric Power Co said three-hour power outages on Wednesday would affect 10.89 million households.<br> <br>The governor of Fukushima prefecture, home to the crippled nuclear plant, said people were at breaking point.<br><br>"The worry and anger of the people of Fukushima has been pushed to the limit," Yuhei Sato told public broadcaster NHK.<br><br>With
               nerves on edge across the world's third-biggest economy and beyond, 
              people across Asia have been stripping shelves of essentials for fear of
               a major emission of radiation from the power plant on the east coast.<br><br>The
               Japanese government has warned that panic buying in towns and cities 
              that have not been directly affected by the twin disasters could hurt 
              its <br>ability to provide aid to the devastated areas.<br><br>The 
              normally heaving streets and subways of Tokyo were quieter than usual on
               Wednesday morning. The number of people sporting paper face masks has 
              shot up, although the masks offer no real protection against radiation.<br><br>Radiation
               levels in the capital's vast urban sprawl of 30 million people have 
              see-sawed without ever reaching harmful levels, according to the 
              government.<br><br>But it has warned people living up to 10 kilometres 
              (six miles) beyond a 20-kilometre exclusion zone around the Fukushima 
              plant to stay indoors. More than 200,000 people have already been 
              evacuated from the zone.<br><br>Beyond Japan, Asian nations vowed to 
              crack down on hoax messages warning about radiation spreading beyond 
              Japan, which have helped stoke growing unease over the unfolding crisis.<br><br>- AFP/ms</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Japan choppers dump water on stricken nuke plant</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>TOKYO: Japanese military helicopters dumped water Thursday onto 
              the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant northeast of Tokyo in a bid 
              to douse fuel rods and prevent a disastrous radiation release.</span></span></p>

              CH-47 Chinooks of the Self-Defence Forces ran the first mission to empty
               large buckets that hold more than seven tonnes of water each onto the 
              facility damaged by Friday's massive earthquake and tsunami.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The operation aims 
              to keep the fuel rods inside reactors and containment pools submerged 
              under water, to stop them from degrading when they are exposed to air 
              and emitting dangerous radioactive material.<br><br>The helicopter 
              mission started in the morning under a clear sky after a similar effort 
              the previous day was called off by officials citing strong radiation and
               high winds, shortly before darkness fell.<br><br>Police water cannon 
              were also set to support the effort Thursday, along with firefighting

               was preparing to restore outside power lines from Tohoku Electric Power
               Co., which serves the region, and connect its damaged electric

              Japan, knocked down electricity pylons which Tohoku had used to supply

              pumps to pour seawater to cool reactors at the plant, according to media

              earthquake and tsunami that flattened Japan's north-east coast has 
              passed 13,000, police said on Thursday, but reports hinted at a much 
              higher toll.</p>
              <p>The number of confirmed dead from Friday's twin disasters stood at 
              5,178, while the official number of missing remained at 8,606, the 
              national police agency said in its latest update.</p>
              <p>A total of 2,285 people were injured in the disaster. But reports 
              continued to come in which indicated that the final toll could be much

              <p>JAKARTA - INDONESIA has pledged US$2 million (S$2.56 million) in 
              emergency aid to earthquake and tsunami-wrecked Japan, reports said on 
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>'Indonesia is giving US$2 million in aid to Japan to help the 
              emergency situation as a result of the earthquake and tsunami,' 
              Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa told reporters late on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'It's still possible to provide more aid later,' he was quoted as saying by Antara state-owned news agency.</p>
              <p>Indonesia will be sending a team of search and rescue 
              experts, medical personnel and soldiers to help in the relief and 
              rehabilitation efforts, Natalegawa was quoted as saying by the Jakarta

              <h1>Indonesia pledges $2.56m aid for Japan: Reports</h1>
              <p>JAKARTA - INDONESIA has pledged US$2 million (S$2.56 million) in emergency aid to earthquake and tsunami-wrecked Japan, reports said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>'Indonesia is giving US$2 million in aid to Japan to help the emergency situation as a result of the earthquake and tsunami,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa told reporters late on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'It's still possible to provide more aid later,' he was quoted as saying by Antara state-owned news agency.</p>
              <p>Indonesia will be sending a team of search and rescue experts, medical personnel and soldiers to help in the relief and rehabilitation efforts, Natalegawa was quoted as saying by the Jakarta Globe newspaper.</p>
              <p>'Whenever Indonesia is faced with disaster, Japan... has given us much aid, such as funds to help rebuild infrastructure,' he added. 'This is the right time for us to repay them.'</p>
              <p>According to the World Bank's website, in 2009 Japan's GDP per capita was almost eight times higher than Indonesia's.</p>
              <p>Like Japan, Indonesia sits on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire', where the meeting of continental plates causes high seismic activity. A powerful 9.1-magnitude undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra island in 2004 triggered a tsunami which killed 220,000 in countries around the Indian Ocean, including 168,000 in Indonesia.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Japan disaster dead, missing at 14,650</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - THE official number of dead and missing after a devastating 
              earthquake and tsunami that flattened Japan's north-east coast has hit 
              14,650, police said on Thursday, a rise of nearly 1,000 in just a few 
              hours.</p>
              <p>The number of confirmed dead from Friday's twin disasters rose to 
              5,321, while the official number of missing increased to 9,329, the 
              national police agency said in its latest update.</p>
              <p>A total of 2,383 people were injured in the disaster. But reports have indicated that the final toll could be much higher.</p>
              <p>The mayor of the coastal town of Ishinomaki in Miyagi 
              prefecture said late Wednesday that the number of missing there was 
              likely to hit 10,000, Kyodo News reported.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported that around 
              10,000 people were unaccounted for in the port town of Minamisanriku in 
              the same prefecture.</p>
              <p>Amid a mass rescue effort there were grim updates indicating
               severe loss of life along the battered east coast of Honshu island, 
              where the monster waves destroyed or damaged more than 55,380 homes and 
              other buildings.</p>
