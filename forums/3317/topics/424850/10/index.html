              <h1 class="storyheadline"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Magnitude 7.4 earthquake hits off Japan coast </span></h1>
              <p>TOKYO - JAPAN was rattled by a strong aftershock and tsunami warning 
              on Thursday night nearly a month after a devastating earthquake and 
              tsunami flattened the north-eastern coast.</p>
              <p>The Japan meteorological agency issued a tsunami warning for a wave 
              of up to two metres. The warning was issued for a coastal area already 
              torn apart by last month's tsunami, which is believed to have killed 
              some 25,000 people and has sparked an ongoing crisis at a nuclear power 
              plant.</p>
              <p>Officials say Thursday's aftershock was a 7.4-magnitude and hit 40km 
              under the water and off the coast of Miyagi prefecture. The quake that 
              preceded last month's tsunami was a 9.0-magnitude. Buildings as far away
               as Tokyo shook for about a minute.</p>
              <p>In Ichinoseki, inland from Japan's eastern coast, buildings shook 
              violently, knocking items from shelves and toppling furniture, but there
               was no heavy damage to the buildings themselves. Immediately after the 
              quake, all power was cut. The city went dark, but cars drove around 
              normally and people assembled in the streets despite the late hour.</p>
              <p>US Geological Survey gave the preliminary magnitude as 7.4 and it 
              struck off the eastern coast 100km from Sendai and 140km from Fukushima.
               It was about 345km from Tokyo. The depth was 40km. Shallower quakes 
              tend to be more destructive.</p>
              <p>Workers battling to control the stricken 
              nuclear plant on were ordered to evacuate, operator 
              Tepco said. -- AP, AFP</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Two killed, 100 hurt in Japan aftershock</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - A POWERFUL aftershock that rocked an area of Japan still 
              reeling from last month's earthquake and tsunami disaster killed two 
              people and injured around 100, emergency services said on Friday.</p>
              <p>The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said a 63-year-old woman in 
              Yamagata prefecture died after her respirator failed when the power was 
              knocked out by the 7.1 magnitude tremor.</p>
              <p>'Her respiratory equipment was found turned off. We believe the 
              machine was turned off due to the outage,' a spokesman for the agency 
              said. The agency said one person also died in Miyagi prefecture - the 
              area worst hit by the 9.0 magnitude quake of March 11 and the tsunami it
               spawned.</p>
              <p>A tsunami alert issued earlier was cancelled after no deadly wave 
              materialised. Workers battling to control the stricken Fukushima Daiichi
               nuclear plant on the north-east coast were temporarily ordered to 
              evacuate, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) said.</p>
              <p>The evacuation order came less than 24 hours after they 
              began pumping nitrogen, an inert gas, into reactor No. 1, where 
              engineers were concerned a build-up of hydrogen might react with oxygen 
              to cause an explosion. Work at the plant was remotely controlled and was
               continuing, the company said. A Tepco spokesman told a press conference
               there was 'no information immediately indicating any abnormality at 
              Fukushima Daiichi plant'.</p>
              <p>A nuclear safety agency official told reporters: 'There are 
              no abnormal readings at the Fukushima Daiichi's monitoring posts", 
              adding: 'We have not seen any problem... with regard to the injection of
               nitrogen.'</p>
              <p>The official said some external power sources used to cool 
              reactor cores had been lost at plants in Onagawa in Miyagi prefecture 
              and at Rokkasho and Higashidori in Aomori prefecture, but at least one 
              emergency source remained operational at each. -- AFP</p>

              agency said.</p>
              <p>Reports said two men aged 79 and 85 were killed in Myagi prefecture -
               the area worst hit by the 9.0 magnitude quake of March 11 and the 
              tsunami it spawned.</p>
              <p>Broadcaster NHK said the 79-year-old was found unconscious 
              after the quake and taken to hospital, where he was confirmed dead, 
              while Jiji Press said an 85-year-old man also died in the quake, but 
              gave no further details.</p>
              <p>The disaster management agency said at least 93 people were 
              confirmed injured as of 9.30am (0030 GMT, 8.30am Singapore time) while 
              Jiji Press said about 130 were injured. Power remains off for about 3.6 
              million households in the north-eastern region, Jiji said. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Japan's 7.1-quake causes radioactive water spill</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>TOKYO - A powerful earthquake in northeast Japan rocked a 
              nuclear plant, causing a small amount of radioactive water to spill, 
              officials said Friday, but the operator said there was no immediate 
              danger.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 7.1-magnitude 
              quake that hit late Thursday caused liquid to overflow from spent fuel 
              pools in all three reactor buildings at the Onagawa plant, the Nuclear 
              and Industrial Safety Agency said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Most seriously 
              affected was reactor number two, where 3.8 litres from the spent fuel 
              pool ended up on the floor of the operation room.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But operator Tohoku-Electric Power Co. said no radioactive liquid had leaked out of the plant.<br><br>"It's not like the Fukushima nuclear plant, where water kept running out," said a spokesman.<br><br>"We're
               currently investigating where the water came from. The radiation levels
               in the wet areas are far below the level that would require us to 
              report to authorities."<br><br>The Onagawa plant lies more than 100 
              kilometres from the Fukushima Daiichi facility, where the March 11 quake
               and tsunami knocked out cooling systems causing a series of explosions.<br><br>Radioactive
               water was found to be seeping from Fukushima into the Pacific Ocean 
              after the disaster, although plant officials say that leak has now been 
              fixed.<br><br>Tohoku-Electric Power said all three reactors at the 
              Onagawa plant were placed in a state of cold shut-down after the 
              magnitude 9.0 earthquake on March 11 and were no longer operating when 
              the latest quake struck.<br><br>"The water in the spent fuel pools 
              spilled over the edges," the spokesman added. "It's not like water is 
              continuously dripping from a crack or anything."<br><br>Japan Nuclear 
              Fuel Ltd, which operates the nuclear reprocessing facilities in 
              Rokkasho, Aomori prefecture, said its external power supply was cut off 
              by Thursday's quake, but later returned.<br><br>At the Higashidori 
              nuclear plant, the external power source was also partially cut off and 
              the cooling system for the spent fuel rod pool temporarily halted, the 
              safety agency said, adding the power was now back up.<br><br>- AFP/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Four dead as new tremor hits Japan disaster zone</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SENDAI, Japan: A powerful aftershock rocked Japan's tsunami 
              disaster zone, killing at least four and triggering new concerns over 
              nuclear power plants in a region still grappling with an atomic 
              emergency.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Electricity was cut 
              across a huge area of northern Japan, forcing cooling systems at three 
              nuclear plants to switch to emergency power and plunging more than 3.3 
              million households into darkness late Thursday night.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At least one backup 
              supply remained online at all three plants, but the aftershock 
              highlighted the potential risks of nuclear generation in an earthquake 
              zone amid a battle to stabilise reactors at tsunami-hit Fukushima.<br><br>Officials
               and reports said four people had been killed by the 7.1 magnitude 
              tremor, which struck off the coast near Sendai -- one of the most 
              powerful to hit Japan since the country's worst post-war disaster four 
              weeks ago.<br><br>Thursday's quake swayed buildings in the capital 
              Tokyo, more than 300 kilometres away from the epicentre, and generated 
              unease even well away from the coast.<br><br>In the town of Kitakami, 
              northwest of the epicentre, an AFP reporter witnessed queues forming at 
              convenience stores as people tried to stock up anew on food, water and 
              batteries.<br><br>"It was so scary," said Kazuyuki Shiroiwa, who had been to four shops in central Kitakami in a vain effort to find batteries.<br><br>"The midnight quake reminded me of the fear I felt a month ago," he said. "I'm fed up with earthquakes. No more quakes, please."<br><br>Workers
               battling to control the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on the
               northeast coast were ordered to evacuate temporarily but have since 
              returned, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) said.<br><br>The
               evacuation order came less than 24 hours after the workers began 
              pumping nitrogen, an inert gas, into reactor No. 1, where engineers were
               concerned a build-up of hydrogen might react with oxygen to cause an 
              explosion.<br><br>Work at the plant was remotely controlled and had continued uninterrupted, the company said.<br><br>The
               loss of external power sources at Fukushima in the March 11 tsunami 
              left reactor cores heating up uncontrollably, resulting in the world's 
              worst nuclear emergency since Chernobyl 25 years ago.<br><br>The 
              crippled plant has leaked radiation which has made its way into tap 
              water and farm produce, sparking food export bans covering a large area.<br><br>Some
               highly radioactive water has leaked into the Pacific Ocean and this 
              week TEPCO began dumping 11,500 tonnes of low-level radioactive water 
              from the plant into the sea to free up urgently needed storage space.<br><br>The
               move has angered the Japanese fishing industry and raised concerns in 
              neighbouring countries including China, which on Friday urged Tokyo to 
              ensure the marine environment was protected.<br><br>The nuclear agency 
              said Thursday's quake had knocked out some external power sources used 
              for cooling at plants in Onagawa in Miyagi prefecture and at Rokkasho 
              and Higashidori in Aomori prefecture.<br><br>But at least one emergency 
              power source remained operational at each, and there was no indication 
              that the loss of regular power was causing a problem.<br><br>Operator 
              Tohoku Electric Power said some water overflowed from pools housing 
              spent fuel at the Onagawa plant and spilled onto the floor, but that 
              radiation levels remained normal.<br><br>The Onagawa plant was already 
              in cold shut-down, while the Higashidori plant's only reactor was under 
              maintenance and the Rokkasho plant is a reprocessing facility.<br><br>A 
              spokesman for the plant's operator, Tohoku-Electric Power Co, said 
              radiation levels were still "far below the level that would require us 
              to report to authorities".<br><br>Hundreds of aftershocks have rocked 
              Japan since the 9.0 magnitude quake last month and the resulting 
              tsunami, which killed more than 12,600 people and left around 15,000 
              unaccounted for.<br><br>March's record quake has exacted a heavy cost on
               the world's number three economy, and rippled across industries 
              worldwide as parts supplied from Japan run short.<br><br>But auto giant Toyota Friday announced it would be resuming operations at all of its Japanese assembly plants on April 18.<br><br>Japan
               said it would ease shipping restrictions on milk and some vegetables 
              from near the Fukushima plant, while New Delhi overturned a blanket ban 
              on importing Japanese produce.<br><br>Several countries, including 
              China, Taiwan, Singapore and the United States, have banned shipments of
               produce from certain Japanese prefectures near the plant, but India had
               been the first to announce a complete ban.</span><span><br><br>-AFP/ac</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">More than half Japan tsunami victims elderly</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - MORE than half of those killed by Japan's massive quake-tsunami were elderly, a report said on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Of the nearly 8,000 dead whose ages are known, around 4,400 were aged
               65 or older, the Asahi Shimbun said, citing police figures.</p>
              <p>Fishing villages and small communities along the country's north-east
               coast were badly hit by the March 11 tsunami that roared ashore after a
               9.0 magnitude undersea quake struck in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
              <p>Those aged 65 or over make up around a quarter of the 
              population of fast-greying Japan, where a declining birthrate is adding 
              to demographic woes.</p>
              <p>The figure is slightly higher in rural communities whose 
              young people, citing work opportunities and lifestyle choices, have for 
              many years been decamping to the cities.</p>
              <p>The paper said the elderly in tsunami-hit areas could have 
              been disproportionately affected because of their lack of mobility. --

              <p>SENDAI - A MAGNITUDE-7.1 aftershock has rattled Japan on the 
              one-month anniversary of a massive earthquake that spawned a deadly 
              tsunami.</p>
              <p>A warning was issued for a one-metre tsunami, the same as after 
              another 7.1 aftershock that shook the north-east coast last week. There 
              was no tsunami after that quake. The tsunami alert was lifted soon 
              after.</p>
              <p>People at a large electronics store in central Sendai screamed and 
              ran outside, though the shaking made it hard to move around. Mothers 
              grabbed their children, and windows shook. After a minute or two, people
               returned to the store.</p>
              <p>Workers battling to contain a crisis at a stricken 
              nuclear plant in Japan were ordered to evacuate on Monday after a 
              powerful 7.1 magnitude aftershock, operator Tepco said.</p>
              <p>'The company ordered workers to withdraw and stay in a 
              quake-proof building,' a spokesman for the operator said. 'We don't know
               many workers were involved.'</p>
              <p>The power supply to three stricken reactors at the Fukushima
               Daiichi nuclear plant were cut by the quake, but was quickly, the 
              operator said. -- AP, AFP</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Japan police find 10 bodies in nuclear zone</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - JAPANESE police on Thursday found the bodies of 10 tsunami 
              victims in the first search of a 10km zone around an atomic plant, as 
              emergency crews battled to contain a nuclear crisis.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of police wearing white protective suits and face masks 
              scoured rubble-strewn neighbourhoods near the plant for victims of the 
              giant wave that smashed into Japan's north-east coast more than a month 
              ago.</p>
              <p>Some of the remains were found inside cars and others were 'buried in
               debris, so that the sight of just a foot or other body part would lead 
              to the discovery of a whole body,' a Fukushima police spokesman told 
              AFP.</p>
              <p>The 300-strong force was to continue their search on Friday 
              in the no-man's land - pushing closer towards the facility after they 
              started a wider search on April 3 that covered the outer areas of the 
              20km exclusion zone.</p>
              <p>Before the search began, police said it was difficult to 
              estimate how many bodies were in the 10km danger zone around the plant, 
              although the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper put the figure at around 1,000 
              tsunami victims.</p>
              <p>At the plant itself, emergency crews continued efforts to 
              stop radioactive leaks into the Pacific, erecting a seabed silt fence to
               slow the spread of contaminants to sea and pumping highly toxic runoff 
              water into tanks. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Japan nuclear plant operator promises compensation</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>TOKYO : The embattled operator of Japan's crippled nuclear power
               plant on Friday promised an initial one million yen (US$12,000) in 
              compensation to each family living close to the facility.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"We have decided to 
              offer necessary payment as provisional compensation so that we can 
              provide as much support as possible," Masataka Shimizu, president of 
              Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), told a news conference.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tens of thousands of
               people living in a 20-kilometre (13-mile) zone around the plant were 
              ordered to leave due to radiation fears, and people within 30km were 
              first told to stay indoors and later encouraged to also evacuate.<br><br>"We
               will pay the provisional payment to families who lived in areas where 
              people were ordered to evacuate or stay inside their houses," Shimizu 
              said.<br><br>Japan's economy suffered a big blow in the triple 
              earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, but the country should have no
               problem financing reconstruction, the central bank chief said in a 
              speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.<br><br>Bank of 
              Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa conceded problems in the economic 
              supply chain, power generation, tourism and other important sectors.<br><br>But he said the financial system could cope.<br><br>"As long as Japan continues to work tirelessly towards rebuilding it is unlikely that financing problems will arise," he said.<br><br>Shirakawa
               said the three-pronged disaster struck "at a time when Japan's economy 
              was gradually returning" to strength. He said the disruption mean "it is
               inevitable" that production and supply will suffer.<br><br>And given 
              the global nature of economy, closely linked countries such as China and
               the United States could also be affected. "The impact on supply chain 
              could spread internationally," he said.<br><br>However, Shirakawa insisted that Japan has the resources to bounce back.<br><br>"Japanese society has shown resilience. The work of rebuilding has started to get underway gradually but steadily," he said.<br><br>"The
               first challenge is ensuring the necessary financing for rebuilding. In 
              this regard, Japan has had an excess of saving over investment for a 
              protracted period. From a macro-economic perspective, this financing 
              will not be difficult," he said.<br><br>"Japan's capacity for foreign 
              currency funding is extremely strong, given that the country is the 
              biggest creditor nation in the world."<br><br>"Private financial 
              institutions are fully able to meet an increase in financing demand for 
              rebuilding. Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds have been issued quite 
              smoothly," he said.<br><br>"Most private economists believe that Japan's GDP growth rate will turn positive again from the third quarter of 2011."<br><br>Power
               cuts are now the greatest threat to Japan's economic recovery, the 
              Asian Development Bank's top economist said Thursday, as the pain from 
              the disaster showed few signs of relenting. <br><br>After initial 
              concerns that the disaster would wreck Japanese and global manufacturing
               supply chains, Changyong Rhee said the main fear had become a prolonged
               power cuts and brownouts.<br><br>Power cuts "can hurt not just the 
              affected area, but the whole of Japan," Rhee said, pointing to 
              disruptions that could hobble the economy for months to come.<br><br>"Initially,
               we thought that power supply would be normalized by the end of April; 
              it looks like it is going to be a bit longer than that."<br><br>Power 
              shortages have plagued the country since the quake, which caused 11 of 
              Japan's 55 nuclear reactors to be at least temporarily closed.<br><br>The
               government has already imposed electricity-saving targets to reduce 
              consumption by up to 25 percent, even as it battles to contain leaks at 
              the ailing Fukushima plant.<br><br>More than a month after a devastating
               9.0-magnitude earthquake hit the country, Rhee and other economists are
               still trying to understand the long-term impact on the world's third 
              largest economy and its neighbours.<br><br>The biggest question mark 
              might now be the fate of those 11 nuclear power plants, which account 
              for around six percent of the country's electricity production.<br><br> - AFP/ir</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Japan travel is safe, says UN tourism body</h1>
              <p>MADRID - THERE is no reason to avoid travel to and from Japan as 
              radiation levels at the country's airports and ports are 'well within 
              safe limits', the UN World Tourism Organisation said on Friday.</p>
              <p>Emergency crews have struggled to prevent a catastrophic meltdown at 
              the Fukushima plant in north-eastern Japan since a massive earthquake 
              and tsunami struck on March 11, leading many foreign governments to urge
               their citizens to stay away from the country.</p>
              <p>Just 352,800 foreigners arrived in Japan in March, 50.3 percent fewer
               than the same month in 2010 and the largest decline ever recorded, 
              according to the Japan National Tourism Board.</p>
              <p>But the Madrid-based UN World Tourism Organisation said the 
              'current situation poses no risk to travel to and from Japan'. 
              'Radiation monitoring around airports and seaports in Japan continues to
               confirm that levels remain well within safe limits from a health 
              perspective,' it said in a statement.</p>
              <p>'In addition, monitoring of passengers, crew and cargo from 
              Japan carried out to date in other countries, in accordance with their 
              national policy, does not suggest any health or safety risk.'</p>
              <p>A total 8.6 million people travelled to Japan last year, 
              marking a healthy rebound from the 6.8 million in 2009 when the swine 
              flu pandemic and global economic downturn curbed international travel. 
              The March 11 disaster was the worst to hit Japan since World War II, and
               is now known to have killed 13,456 people, with another 14,851 still 
              missing. -- AFP</p>

              <p>A strong earthquake of magnitude 5.8 hit central <span id="lw_1302923917_3" class="yshortcuts">Japan</span> on Saturday morning, according to the US Geological Survey.</p>
              <p>The quake, which shook buildings in <span id="lw_1302923917_2" class="yshortcuts">Tokyo</span>, struck at 11:19 am (0219 GMT), 83 kilometres (52 miles) north of the capital and at a depth of 20 kilometres, the USGS said.</p>
              <p>Operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) said the tremor did not 
              disrupt the emergency crews who are working around the clock to cool 
              crippled reactors at a nuclear plant hit by a devastating earthquake and
               tsunami last month.</p>
              <p>That earthquake -- the biggest ever recorded in Japan -- struck on 
              March 11, triggering a huge tsunami and leaving 13,591 people dead, with
               another 14,497 still unaccounted for.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands of people lost their homes, while many others were forced to evacuate after a series of explosions at the <span id="lw_1302923917_1" class="yshortcuts">Fukushima</span> Daiichi nuclear plant sent radiation spewing into the air.</p>
              <p>The radiation leaks have resulted in bans on produce from the 
              affected area and hurt the fishing and farming industries because of 
              public fears over radioactivity in food.</p>
              <p>On Friday, Japan's government ordered TEPCO to offer payouts to tens of thousands of people made homeless by the ongoing crisis.</p>
              <p>The total cost from collapsed or damaged houses, factories and 
              infrastructure such as roads and bridges is estimated to reach 16-25

              Office.</p>
              <p>There were no immediate reports of any damage or casualties from Saturday's quake, which the <span id="lw_1302923917_0" class="yshortcuts">Japan Meteorological Agency</span> said had a magnitude of 5.9 and struck at a depth of 70 kilometres underground.</p>
