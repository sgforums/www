              <h1 class="storyheadline">Hundreds along coast killed in tsunami</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - A FEROCIOUS tsunami spawned by one of the largest earthquakes
               ever recorded slammed Japan's eastern coast on Friday, killing hundreds
               of people as it swept away boats, cars and homes while widespread fires
               burned out of control. Tsunami warnings blanketed the entire Pacific, 
              as far away as South America, Canada, Alaska and the entire U.S. West 
              Coast.</p>
              <p>Police said 200 to 300 bodies have been found in the northeastern 
              coastal city of Sendai. Police said another 88 were confirmed killed and
               349 were missing.</p>
              <p>The death toll was likely to continue climbing given the scale of the disaster.</p>
              <p>The magnitude 8.9 offshore quake unleashed a seven-metre 
              tsunami and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks for hours, many of 
              them of more than magnitude 6.0.</p>
              <p>The government ordered thousands of residents near a nuclear
               power plant in Onahama city to evacuate because the plant's system was 
              unable to cool the reactor. The reactor was not leaking radiation but 
              its core remained hot even after a shutdown. The plant is 270km 
              northeast of Tokyo.</p>
              <p>Dozens of cities and villages along a 2,100-kilometre 
              stretch of coastline were shaken by violent tremors that reached as far 
              away as Tokyo, hundreds of kilometres from the epicentre.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Waves cause no damage in the Philippines, Indonesia</h1>
              <p>MANILA - SMALL tsunami waves hit the Philippines hours after a 
              massive quake struck Japan on Friday, but there were no reports of local
               damage or casualties, its chief state seismologist said.</p>
              <p>'This looks like good news,' Philippine Institute of Volcanology and 
              Seismology director Renato Solidum told a news conference after 
              reporting waves ranging from 30cm to one metre.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Indonesian meteorology and geophysics agency said that
               the tsunami reached Indonesia's eastern coastline without causing any 
              damage.</p>
              <p>'A tsunami of only 10cm triggered by the earthquake in Japan
               was detected in the North Sulawesi and Maluku islands,' the agency's 
              official Rachmat told AFP.</p>
              <p>'We have just lifted the tsunami alert in Indonesia.'</p>
              <p>At least 60 people were killed and 56 missing in the massive
               8.9-magnitude earthquake that hit Japan on Friday, unleashing huge 
              tsunamis along its Pacific coast, police said.</p>

              <p><strong>No reports so far of any S'porean injured in Japan quake: MFA</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said 
              there are no reports so far of any Singaporean injured in the 
              8.9-magnitude earthquake which struck off Japan's coast on Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The ministry said 
              the Singapore Embassy in Tokyo has activated the Emergency Contact 
              Network (ECN) system, and will continue to contact registered 
              Singaporeans in affected areas. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Channel NewsAsia was in touch with some Singaporeans living or working in Japan on Friday.<br><br>29-year
               old Singaporean engineer Abel Li, who is in Yokohama city, said the 
              electricity supply was cut off when the earthquake struck.<br><br>Mr Li,
               who is on work attachment there with two other Singaporeans, said they 
              all ducked under the table for safety and were safely evacuated from the
               building.<br><br>He said: "When we walked down the stairs, we could see
               a lot of the ceiling panels dropping, (and) there were a lot of the 
              cracks on the wall. And even outside, after the quake, you could still 
              see the signboards and the building swaying quite a bit.<br><br>"The 
              traffic signals are out, so there are traffic jams almost everywhere. 
              The telephone signals are quite intermittent, so you could see a lot of 
              Japanese colleagues who are trying to call back their friends and 
              families - it was very hard to get through."<br><br>Those in Tokyo also felt the tremors.<br><br>30-year
               old Singaporean Rita Pang, who was in her office in Roppongi district, 
              said she had to walk home as the trains stopped operating.<br><br>She 
              said: "It does happen pretty often, that we have this kind of swaying 
              and shakes, but usually they end pretty soon, like within a minute. But 
              this time, the building started shaking and swaying for a long while. 
              And it got worse by the minute. <br><br>"So after about 5 minutes or so,
               they finally made an announcement through the building (PA system) to 
              ask us to go down and get evacuated from the building."<br><br>Ms Pang has since stocked up on food and water in case there are aftershocks.<br><br>24-year-old
               Singaporean student Amanda Lin was in a subway train when the incident 
              happened. She said she went to a cafe next to a park to wait out the 
              tremors.<br><br>"The train started swaying, but all of us thought it was
               just a normal, regular earthquake because it happens quite often. But 
              then it started to move very violently, (and) people started grabbing 
              onto the poles. And it actually stopped for about 15 minutes before it 
              crawled to the next station," she added.<br><br>Japan's north-eastern region of Sendai bore the brunt of the tsunami.<br><br>In
               an email to Channel NewsAsia, Singaporean Melissa Heng - who is working
               as a teacher there - said the situation is very bad. She said there is 
              massive damage to the school and the "aftershocks are scary".<br><br>Ms 
              Heng said she is holding up with colleagues and students in a shelter. 
              Her email read: "Situation in Sendai very bad. Temperatures sub-zero and
               snowing. Massive damage in school. I haven't been out in the streets, 
              but the aftershocks are just as scary. <br><br>"I'm in shelter now with 
              colleagues and students - no signal, water or electricity. But I'm safe.
               Earlier I heard magnitude in Miyagi - which is the prefecture that 
              Sendai is in - was 7.9. Sendai airport was shutdown. But I have no 
              information where I am. We all just want to get through this unhurt."<br><br>At least 300 Singaporeans are currently on holiday in Japan.<br><br>CTC
               Travel said its four tour groups in Tokyo and Hokkaido are safe. The 
              company has not received any tour cancellations to Japan as yet.<br><br>Alicia
               Seah, senior vice-president, Marketing, CTC Travel, said: "We have 
              almost 1,000 customers who will be departing from tomorrow onwards till 
              the early part of April. To date, we have not received any 
              cancellations, but there are calls of concern."<br><br>Chan Brothers said its six tour groups of 160 people across Japan are not affected by the quake.<br><br>Scheduled
               fights have been affected. Singapore Airlines said it had to cancel one
               flight (SQ634) to Japan's Haneda airport that was supposed to depart at
               3.40pm. Passengers were already on board when they were informed that 
              the flight could not take off, and had to disembark.<br><br>SIA said it has arranged accommodations for affected passengers not living in Singapore.<br><br>MFA said it is closely monitoring the situation and will render necessary consular assistance to affected Singaporeans.<br><br>Singaporeans who require assistance are advised to contact the Singapore Embassy in Tokyo or the MFA Duty Officer at:<br><br>Embassy of the Republic of Singapore<br>Tel: +81-90-3208-4122 / +81-90-2435-5543<br>Email: singemb_tyo@sgmfa.gov.sg<br><br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br>Tel: +65-6379-8800, +65-6379-8855<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="headline">Explosion at Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant - media</h1>
              <p><span id="lw_1299920465_1" class="yshortcuts">FUKUSHIMA, Japan</span> (Reuters) - <span id="lw_1299920465_3" class="yshortcuts">Japan</span> scrambled on Saturday to avert a disastrous meltdown at a nuclear plant
               damaged when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the northeast 
              coast, killing at least 1,300 people.</p>
              <p>Jiji news agency said there had been an explosion at the stricken
               40-year-old Daichi 1 reactor and TV footage showed vapour rising from 
              the plant, which lies 240 km (150 miles) north of <span id="lw_1299920465_2" class="yshortcuts">Tokyo</span>.</p>
              <p>The country's nuclear safety agency could not confirm the 
              reported incident, which came as plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co 
              (Tepco) worked desperately to reduce pressures in the core of the 
              reactor that -- if not contained -- could lead to a release of radiation
               into the atmosphere.</p>
              <p>"An unchecked rise in temperature could cause the core to 
              essentially turn into a molten mass that could burn through the reactor 
              vessel," political risk information service Stratfor said in a report. 
              "This may lead to a release of an unchecked amount of radiation into the
               containment building that surrounds the reactor."</p>
              <p>NHK television said the outer structure of the building that 
              houses the reactor appeared to have blown off, which could suggest the 
              containment building had already been breached.</p>
              <p>Earlier the operator released what it said was a tiny amount of 
              radioactive steam to reduce the pressure and the danger was minimal 
              because tens of thousands of people had already been evacuated from the 
              vicinity.</p>
              <p>Media reports estimate at least 1,300 people may have been killed
               by the 8.9 quake, the biggest since records began in Japan 140 years 
              ago, and the 10-metre tsunami that swept ferociously inland after it 
              struck.</p>
              <p>Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology said the
               earth's axis had shifted 25 cm as a result of the quake and the U.S. 
              Geological Survey said the main island of Japan had actually shifted 2.4
               metres.</p>
              <p>Japanese officials and experts have been at pains to say that 
              while there would be radiation leaks, they would be very small and have 
              dismissed suggestions of a repeat of a Chernobyl-type disaster.</p>
              <p>THOUSANDS FLEE</p>
              <p>Friday's tremor was so huge that thousands fled their homes from 
              coastlines around the Pacific Rim, as far away as North and South 
              America, fearful of a tsunami.</p>
              <p>Most appeared to have been spared anything more serious than some
               high waves, unlike Japan's northeast coastline which was hammered by 
              the huge tsunami that turned houses and ships into floating debris as it
               surged into cities and villages, sweeping aside everything in its path.</p>
              <p>"I thought I was going to die," said <span id="lw_1299920465_0" class="yshortcuts">Watauga</span> Fuji, a 38-year-old sales representative in Koriyama, Fukushima, north of <span id="lw_1299920465_4" class="yshortcuts">Tokyo</span> and close to the area worst hit by the quake.</p>
              <p>"Our furniture and shelves had all fallen over and there were 
              cracks in the apartment building, so we spent the whole night in the 
              car... Now we're back home trying to clean."</p>
              <p>The unfolding natural disaster, which has been followed by dozens
               of aftershocks, prompted offers of search and rescue help from 50 
              countries.</p>
              <p>The central bank said it would cut short a two-day policy review 
              scheduled for next week to one day on Monday and promised to do its 
              utmost to ensure financial market stability.</p>
              <p>The disaster struck as the world's third-largest economy had been
               showing signs of reviving from an economic contraction in the final 
              quarter of last year. It raised the prospect of major disruptions for 
              many key businesses and a massive repair bill running into tens of 
              billions of dollars.</p>
              <p>The earthquake was the fifth most powerful to hit the world in 
              the past century. It surpassed the Great Kant quake of Sept. 1, 1923, 
              which had a magnitude of 7.9 and killed more than 140,000 people in the 
              Tokyo area.</p>
              <p>The 1995 Kobe quake caused $100 billion in damage and was the most expensive natural disaster in history.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Radiation leaking from Japan's quake-hit nuclear plant</h1>
              <p><span id="lw_1299933430_2" class="yshortcuts">FUKUSHIMA, Japan</span> (Reuters) - Radiation leaked from a damaged Japanese nuclear reactor 
              north of Tokyo on Saturday, the government said, after an explosion blew
               the roof off the facility in the wake of a massive earthquake.</p>
              <p>The developments raised fears of a meltdown at the plant as 
              officials scrambled to contain what could be the worst nuclear disaster 
              since the Chernobyl explosion in 1986 that shocked the world.</p>
              <p>The Japanese plant was damaged by Friday's 8.9-magnitude 
              earthquake, which sent a 10-metre (33-foot) tsunami ripping through 
              towns and cities across the northeast coast. Japanese media estimate 
              that at least 1,300 people were killed.</p>
              <p>"We are looking into the cause and the situation and we'll make 
              that public when we have further information," Chief Cabinet Secretary 
              Yukio Edano said after confirming the explosion and radiation leak at 
              the plant.</p>
              <p>Edano said an evacuation radius of 10 km (6 miles) from the stricken 40-year-old Daiichi 1 reactor plant in <span id="lw_1299933430_1" class="yshortcuts">Fukushima prefecture</span> was adequate, but an hour later the boundary was extended to 20 km (13 
              miles). TV footage showed vapour rising from the plant, 240 km (150 
              miles) north of Tokyo.</p>

              <p>Along Japan's northeast coast, rescue workers searched through 
              the rubble of destroyed buildings, cars and boats, looking for survivors
               in hardest-hit areas such as the city of Sendai, 300 km (180 miles) 
              northeast of Tokyo.</p>
              <p>Dazed residents hoarded water and huddled in makeshift shelters 
              in near-freezing temperatures. Aerial footage showed buildings and 
              trains strewn over mudflats like children's toys.</p>
              <p>"All the shops are closed, this is one of the few still open. I 
              came to buy and stock up on diapers, drinking water and food," Kunio 
              Iwatsuki, 68, told Reuters in Mito city, where residents queued outside a
               damaged supermarket for supplies.</p>
              <p>Across the coastline, survivors clambered over nearly impassable 
              roads. In Iwanuma, not far from Sendai, people spelled S.O.S. out on the
               roof of a hospital surrounded by water, one of many desperate scenes.</p>
              <p>The earthquake and tsunami, and now the radiation leak, present 
              Japan's government with its biggest challenge in a generation.</p>
              <p>The explosion at Chernobyl's nuclear plant's fourth reactor in 
              1986 sent thousands of tonnes of toxic nuclear dust billowing across the
               Ukraine, <span id="lw_1299933430_0" class="yshortcuts">Russia</span> and Belarus. It was the worst civil nuclear disaster.</p>
              <p>The blast at the Japanese nuclear facility came as plant operator
               Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) worked desperately to reduce pressures 
              in the core of the reactor.</p>
              <p>The company has had a rocky past in an industry plagued by 
              scandal. In 2002, the president of the country's largest power utility 
              was forced to resign along with four other senior executives, taking 
              responsibility for suspected falsification of nuclear plant safety 
              records.</p>
              <p>NHK television and Jiji news agency said the outer structure of 
              the reactor building that houses the reactor appeared to have blown off,
               but nuclear experts said this did not necessarily mean the nuclear 
              reactor had been breached.</p>
              <p>Earlier the operator released what it said was a tiny amount of 
              radioactive steam to reduce the pressure and the danger was minimal 
              because tens of thousands of people had already been evacuated from the 
              vicinity.</p>
              <p>Reuters journalists were in <span id="lw_1299933430_5" class="yshortcuts">Fukushima prefecture</span>,
               about 70 km (40 miles) from the plant. Other media have reported police
               roadblocks in the area to prevent people getting closer.</p>
              <p>INTERNATIONAL RELIEF EFFORT</p>
              <p>Friday's tremor was so huge that thousands fled their homes from 
              coastlines around the Pacific Rim, as far away as North and South 
              America, fearful of a tsunami.</p>
              <p>Most appeared to have been spared anything more serious than some

               surged into cities and villages, sweeping aside everything in its path.</p>
              <p>"I thought I was going to die," said Wataru Fujimura, a 
              38-year-old sales representative in Koriyama, Fukushima, north of Tokyo 
              and close to the area worst hit by the quake.</p>
              <p>"Our furniture and shelves had all fallen over and there were 
              cracks in the apartment building, so we spent the whole night in the car
               ... Now we're back home trying to clean."</p>
              <p>In one of the worst-hit residential areas, people buried under 
              rubble could be heard calling out for rescue, Kyodo news agency reported
               earlier.</p>
              <p>The international community started to send disaster relief teams on Saturday to help <span id="lw_1299933430_3" class="yshortcuts">Japan</span>, with the United Nations sending a group to help coordinate work.</p>
              <p>The disaster struck as the world's third-largest economy had been
               showing signs of reviving from an economic contraction in the final

              many key businesses and a massive repair bill running into tens of 
              billions of dollars.</p>
              <p>Toyota Motor Corp, the world's largest carmaker,  said it would 
              suspend operations at all of its 12 factories in Japan on Monday to 
              confirm the safety of its employees.</p>
              <p>Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology said the
               earth's axis shifted 25 cm as a result of the earthquake, and the U.S.

              the stricken reactor with sea water to try to avert catastrophe, Japan's
               Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the chaos unleashed by Friday's 
              8.9-magnitude quake was an "unprecedented national disaster".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The quake, one of 
              the biggest ever recorded, unleashed a terrifying 10-metre (33-foot) 
              wave that tore through towns and cities on Japan's northeastern coast, 
              destroying everything in its path.<br><br>In the small port town of 
              Minamisanriku alone, some 10,000 people are unaccounted for -- more than
               half the population -- public broadcaster NHK reported.<br><br>Even as 
              Japan struggled to assess the full extent of the devastation, the nation
               faced an atomic emergency as cooling systems damaged by the quake 
              failed at two nuclear reactors.<br><br>Smoke billowed from the Fukushima
               No. 1 atomic plant about 250 kilometres (160 miles) northeast of Tokyo,
               after an explosion blew off the roof and walls of the structure around 
              the reactor.<br><br>Kyodo News agency cited the nuclear safety agency as saying that radioactive caesium had been detected near the ageing facility.<br><br>Kan's
               top spokesman Yukio Edano said the plant's operator had reported the 
              reactor container was not damaged and that radiation levels had fallen 
              after the blast, but indicated that work to bring it under control was 
              ongoing.<br><br>"We have decided to douse the (reactor) container with 
              sea water in order to reduce risks as quickly as possible," Edano told 
              reporters.<br><br>Kyodo and Jiji reported before the explosion that the 
              plant "may be experiencing nuclear meltdown", while NHK quoted the 
              safety agency as saying metal tubes that contain uranium fuel may have 
              melted.<br><br>Tens of thousands of residents were evacuated within a 
              20-kilometre radius of the stricken plant, and thousands more were 
              shifted from another damaged plant, Fukushima No. 2.<br><br>Ron Chesser,
               director for the Center for Environmental Radiation Studies at Texas 
              Tech University, said it was critical to cool the reactor core to avoid a
               meltdown that would result in "a large release of radiation".<br><br>"Reactors
               are not like your car that you can turn off and walk away. They're 
              going to continue generating a great amount of heat until the core is 
              disassembled," he told the US-based ScienceDaily website.<br><br>The 
              wall of water unleashed by the strongest quake ever recorded in Japan 
              pulverised towns and cities along the northeastern coast. Police 
              reportedly said 200-300 bodies had been found in the city of Sendai.<br><br>Some
               300-400 bodies were recovered in Rikuzentakata, a coastal town of some 
              23,000 people, NHK quoted the military as saying. Other authorities said
               the tsunami had obliterated the town.<br><br>The premier's spokesman 
              said at least 1,000 people were believed to have lost their lives. 
              Police said more than 215,000 people were huddled in emergency shelters.<br><br>"What
               used to be residential areas were mostly swept away in many coastal 
              areas and fires are still blazing there," Kan said after surveying the 
              damage by helicopter.<br><br>The raging tsunami picked up shipping 
              containers, cars and the debris of shattered homes. It crashed through 
              the streets of Sendai and across open fields, forming a mud slick that 
              covered vast tracts of land.<br><br>"There are so many people who lost 
              their lives," an elderly man told TV reporters before breaking down in 
              tears. "I have no words to say."<br><br>In the shattered town of 
              Minamisoma, 34-year-old housewife Sayori Suzuki recalled the utter 
              horror of the moment the quake hit, shaking her home violently and 
              washing away the house of a relative.<br><br>"It was a tremor like I've never experienced before," she told an AFP reporter.<br><br>"Another
               relative said he was fleeing in a car but watched in the rear-view 
              mirror as the waves were catching up on him from behind. He escaped very
               narrowly."<br><br>"My brother works at the Fukushima No.2 nuclear power
               plant," Suzuki added. "He worked all through the night. I'm so worried 
              about him because of the risk of radiation exposure."<br><br>Some 50,000
               military and other rescue personnel were spearheading a Herculean 
              rescue and recovery effort with hundreds of ships, aircraft and vehicles
               headed to the Pacific coast area.<br><br>The towering wave set off alerts across the Pacific, sparking evacuations in Hawaii and on the US West Coast.<br><br>The
               Bank of Japan said it would do its "utmost" to ensure the stability of 
              financial markets after the quake brought huge disruption to key 
              industries, raising short-term concerns for the nation's struggling 
              economy.<br><br>In quake-hit areas, 5.6 million households had no power 
              Saturday and more than one million households were without water. 
              Telecommunications networks were also hit.<br><br>In a rare piece of 
              good news, a ship that was earlier reported missing was found swept out 
              to sea and all 81 people aboard were airlifted to safety.<br><br>Leading
               international offers of help, President Barack Obama mobilised the US 
              military to provide emergency aid after what he called a "simply 
              heartbreaking" disaster.<br><br>The United States, which has nearly 
              50,000 military personnel in Japan, ordered a flotilla including two 
              aircraft carriers and support ships to the region to provide aid.<br><br>The
               quake hit at 2:46 pm (0546 GMT) and lasted about two minutes, making 
              buildings sway in greater Tokyo, the world's largest urban area and home
               to some 30 million people.<br><br>More than a day after the first, 
              massive quake struck just under 400 kilometres northeast of Tokyo, 
              aftershocks were still rattling the region, including a strong 6.8 
              magnitude tremor on Saturday.<br><br>Japan sits on the "Pacific Ring of 
              Fire" and Tokyo is in one of its most dangerous areas, where three 
              continental plates are slowly grinding against each other, building up 
              enormous seismic pressure.<br><br>The government has long warned of the 
              likelihood that a devastating magnitude-eight quake will strike within 
              the next 30 years in the Kanto plains, home to Tokyo's vast urban 
              sprawl.<br><br>-AFP/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>TOKYO - JAPAN has been shaken by a strong earthquake off its eastern 
              coast, closer to Tokyo than the massive quake that hit Friday. The 
              latest temblor swayed buildings in the capital.</p>
              <p>The US Geological Survey says the temblor had a magnitude of 6.2 and 
              struck at 10.26 am (9.26am S'pore time) on Sunday. It was centered about
               179km east of Tokyo, at a depth of 24.5km.</p>
              <p>Japan's northeastern coast was battered on Friday by a magnitude 8.9 
              quake, the largest on record in Japan, and an ensuing tsunami that 
              washed over hundreds of miles of coastline, causing widespread 
              destruction.</p>
              <p>Japan has been rattled by more than 150 aftershocks since Friday's massive quake.</p>
