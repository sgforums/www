              <h1 class="storyheadline">At a glance - Japan disaster timeline</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - THE 8.9 magnitude earthquake off the coast of north-east 
              Japan spawned a ferocious tsunami that's caused massive destruction; 
              flattening whole towns, starting raging fires, and killing thousands of 
              people.</p>
              <p>The following is a list of key events since the two natural disasters devastated north-eastern Japan on Friday (March 11):</p>
              <p><strong>Friday, March 11: </strong></p>
              <p>- An undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 8.9, one of the
               most powerful ever recorded, strikes off Japan's north-eastern coast 
              just before 3.00pm local time (2pm Singapore time). The authorities 
              issued a tsunami warning.</p>
              <p>- A 10m tsunami wave smashes over the north-eastern Japanese
               coast, causing massive damage and flooding. A series of aftershocks 
              follows, many exceeding a magnitude of 7.0.</p>
              <p>- Japanese authorities announce that four nuclear power 
              stations in quake-hit areas have been shut down. Eventually 11 of the 
              nation's roughly 50 plants stop producing power.</p>
              <p>- The US Geological Service announces the quake was the most powerful to hit Japan since records began.</p>
              <p><strong>Saturday, March 12: </strong></p>
              <p>- The Japanese government orders the evacuation of residents
               living close to the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, where the 
              disaster has caused cooling systems to fail and raised fears of a 
              meltdown.</p>
              <p>- An explosion occurs in a building housing one of the plant's reactors.</p>
              <p>- Japan mobilises some 100,000 military and other rescue 
              personnel. Aid pours in from around the world, including from the US 
              military stationed in Japan.</p>
              <p>- Video images show the extent of the damage, with the 
              tsunami washing away houses and cars and hurling ships far inland, while
               fires blaze over large areas.</p>
              <p>The US Geological Survey says the force of the quake moved Honshu - the main Japanese island - by 2.4m.</p>
              <p><strong>Sunday, March 13: </strong></p>
              <p>- The government says 230,000 people have been evacuated from the vicinity of the crippled nuclear reactors.</p>
              <p>- While the overall toll remains unclear, the police chief 
              in badly-hit Miyagi prefecture said the number of deaths was certain to 
              exceed 10,000 in his region alone.</p>
              <p>- A man who was swept out to sea on a piece of the roof of his house is rescued by a naval vessel.</p>
              <p>- The Japanese government announces energy rationing due to 
              the shutdown of nuclear power stations. Millions of residents are 
              without any power or water.</p>
              <p>- The Japanese weather service says there is a 70 per cent 
              chance that a further aftershock with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher could
               occur within three days.</p>
              <p><strong>Monday, March 14: </strong></p>
              <p>- A second explosion occurs at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power station.</p>
              <p>- Rescuers say they have found 2,000 bodies in Miyagi prefecture.</p>
              <p>- Share prices plunge 6.18 per cent on the Tokyo stock exchange.</p>
              <p>- A United Nations humanitarian agency says 1.4 million 
              Japanese are without running water and more than half a million have 
              been evacuated.</p>
              <p>- The International Atomic Energy Agency says it is 'very unlikely' Fukushima will turn into a Chernobyl-like situation.</p>
              <p>- The US Geological Survey upgrades the magnitude of Friday's quake to 9.0.</p>
              <p><strong>Tuesday, March 15:</strong></p>
              <p>- Two more blasts and a fire rock the Fukushima plant and 
              radiation levels around the facility reach dangerous levels, prompting 
              the government to advise people up to 30km from the reactor to stay 
              indoors.</p>
              <p>- Officials say that higher than normal radiation levels are detected in Tokyo.</p>
              <p>- The official death toll from the disaster passes 2,400.</p>
              <p>- Japan stocks fall more than 14 per cent before clawing back ground with shares ending down 10.55 per cent.</p>
              <p>- The Bank of Japan pumps eight trillion yen (almost S$130 
              billion) into the financial system to soothe shaken money markets 
              following a record 15-trillion yen injection on Monday.</p>
              <p><strong>Wednesday, March 16</strong></p>
              <p>- A new fire erupts at the troubled Fukushima plant. Workers
               are briefly evacuated, as a tall white cloud is seen billowing into the
               sky over the complex.</p>
              <p>- Radiation levels at the plant's entrance spike before decreasing.</p>
              <p>- Another strong 6.0-magnitude aftershock hits. Buildings in Tokyo sway.</p>
              <p>- Emperor Akihito delivers a rare address to the nation, 
              offering his prayers and expressing his deep concern over the escalating
               nuclear crisis.</p>
              <p>- The official number of dead and missing surpasses 11,000.</p>
              <p>- Tokyo shares rebound after the biggest two-day sell-off in
               24 years. The headline Nikkei share index closed up 5.68 per cent on 
              bargain hunting.</p>
              <p>- The Bank of Japan pumps another 3.5 trillion yen (S$55.5 billion) into the financial system.</p>
              <p><strong>Thursday, March 17</strong></p>
              <p>- The official number of dead and missing hits 14,650, a rise of nearly 1,000 in just a few hours.</p>
              <p>- Foreign governments urge their citizens to leave Tokyo and
               US State Department authorises the voluntary departure of US embassy 
              family members.</p>
              <p>- Chinook helicopters dump tonnes of water in a desperate effort to cool overheating nuclear reactors.</p>
              <p>- The government says Japan faces major blackouts unless energy use falls.</p>
              <p>- Tokyo shares close down 1.44 per cent as the central bank 
              injects another five trillion yen (S$80.9 billion) into its buckling 
              financial system.</p>
              <p>- US President Barack Obama offers to give Japan any support that it needs, the Tokyo government says.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Japan to start screening food for radioactivity</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - JAPAN instructed local authorities on Thursday to start 
              screening food for radioactivity after accidents at an earthquake-hit 
              nuclear power plant sparked fears of wider contamination.</p>
              <p>It is the first time Japan has set radiation limits on domestically produced food, a health ministry official said.</p>
              <p>The limits are in line with an anti-disaster programme prepared in 
              advance by the government's atomic power safety commission, said the 
              official.</p>
              <p>Limits vary depending on the type of foodstuff but have been
               set in consultation with internationally accepted levels and average 
              intake in the Japanese diet.</p>
              <p>Radioactivity leaked into the air after explosions at the 
              Fukushima No. 1 plant, where last week's quake and tsunami knocked out 
              the reactor cooling systems.</p>
              <p>Several Asian nations have said they will screen food 
              imported from Japan for radiation while the European Union has called 
              for similar checks.</p>

              it has acquired supplies for about half of the S$500,000 given by the 
              Singapore government as seed funding on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The initial plan was to send over the items to Japan within 48 hours.<br><br>The first batch of supplies, comprising blankets, mattresses and water bottles, was to have been sent on Thursday morning. <br><br>However, the Japanese Embassy sent out an alert to say it was not ready to receive the supplies yet.<br><br>Singapore
               Red Cross Society secretary-general Christopher Chua said: "At the 
              moment, what we've done is that we've stockpiled some of the 
              requirements. The Japanese Ambassador has asked for bottled water, 
              mattresses, blankets as well as collapsible water containers. <br><br>"We've all these stockpiled and we're awaiting the green light from the Japanese Embassy to send these things there. <br><br>"I

              locked-jam. All the things cannot move out of the airport at this point 
              in time. So we're just waiting for clearance". <br><br>Meanwhile, the

              turning up at the Red Cross' premises in Penang Lane since Monday<br><br>The organisation on Thursday also got more help from corporate donors.<br><br>A

              Friday's massive earthquake and tsunami.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The operation aims

               of the Japanese capital.<br><br>A police water cannon was unable to operate, however, due to strong radiation at the facility.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Defence Minister 
              Toshimi Kitazawa said that more military vehicles would be deployed to 
              help with efforts to cool the reactors, while pumps supplied by the US 
              armed forces were also being transferred.<br><br>The government's 
              nuclear safety agency has said the top priority should be pouring water 
              into the fuel-rod pools at reactors three and four, which may be boiling
               and are not fully covered by roofs that would reduce radiation leaks.<br><br>An
               official at plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) said 
              Thursday the pool at the number-four reactor "seemed to have water" on 
              Wednesday, based on aerial observations carried out by the military 
              helicopters.<br><br>Another TEPCO spokesman said: "We have not confirmed
               how much water was left inside but we have not had information that 
              spent fuel rods are exposed."<br><br>Chief government spokesman Yukio 
              Edano said it would take some time to know whether the operation had led
               to any significant improvement.<br><br>"Based on what experts have told
               us, it's important to have a certain level of water (in the pools) 
              before we can start to see any positive effect," Edano told reporters.<br><br>"We are closely monitoring the data," he said.<br><br>TEPCO
               said earlier it was concentrating on restoring the power supply to 
              reactivate its crippled cooling systems, which were knocked out in the 
              dual calamity that hit Japan.<br><br>"We cannot tell when, but we want to restore the power source as soon as possible," TEPCO spokesman Naohiro Omura told AFP.<br><br>TEPCO
               was preparing to restore outside power lines from Tohoku Electric Power
               Co., which serves the region, and connect its damaged electric 
              transmission system with unaffected lines.<br><br>"At the moment, we are concentrating our efforts on this work," the spokesman said.<br><br>"If
               the restoration work is completed, we will be able to activate various 
              electric pumps and pour water into reactors and pools for spent nuclear 
              fuel."<br><br>The 9.0-magnitude quake, the biggest on record to strike 
              Japan, knocked down electricity pylons which Tohoku had used to supply 
              power to the TEPCO plant.<br><br>Some 70 workers have been using pumps 
              to pour seawater to cool reactors at the plant, according to media 
              reports, using electricity from borrowed mobile generators.<br><br>In 
              Fukushima prefecture, where a zone within 20 kilometres of the plant has
               already been evacuated, about 10,000 people were to be screened at 26 
              locations for radiation exposure, Kyodo News reported, citing local 
              officials.<br><br>So far, radioactivity has been detected on six people, whose faces and hands were wiped clean, the report said.</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Japan disaster dead, missing toll tops 16,600</h1>
              <p>TOKYO - THE official number of dead and missing after the devastating
               earthquake and tsunami that flattened Japan's north-east coast a week 
              ago has topped 16,600, with 6,405 confirmed dead, police said on Friday.</p>
              <p>The number of people unaccounted for following the March 11 twin 
              disasters increased to 10,259, the National Police Agency said in its 
              latest update. A total of 2,409 people were injured.</p>
              <p>The toll has increased steadily in recent days, and reports suggest it could eventually be much higher.</p>
              <p>The mayor of the coastal town of Ishinomaki in Miyagi 
              prefecture said late Wednesday that the number of missing there was 
              likely to hit 10,000, Kyodo News reported.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported that around 
              10,000 people were unaccounted for in the port town of Minamisanriku in 
              the same prefecture.</p>
              <p>Amid a mass rescue effort there were grim updates indicating
               severe loss of life along the battered east coast of Honshu island, 
              where the monster waves destroyed or damaged more than 55,380 homes and 
              other buildings.</p>

              <p>TOKYO - JAPAN conducted new water cooling operations at a quake-hit 
              nuclear plant on Friday, using a fleet of fire trucks as workers racing 
              to avert a catastrophe also ran a power cable to the site.</p>
              <p>Tonnes of water were used to douse overheating fuel rods at the 
              Fukushima No.1 power station, which suffered critical damage in the 
              massive earthquake and tsunami that rocked Japan a week ago.</p>
              <p>The trucks unleashed high-powered streams of water on the facility, 
              located 250km north-east of Tokyo, NHK footage showed. A defence 
              ministry official told AFP they were targeting the number-three reactor.</p>
              <p>Air Self-Defence Force chief of staff Shigeru Iwasaki told 
              reporters that six fire engines and one truck were involved in the 
              operation.</p>
              <p>The twin disasters knocked out the plant's reactor cooling 
              systems, sparking a series of explosions and fires. Authorities have 
              since struggled to keep the fuel rods inside reactors, and fuel storage 
              containment pools, under water.</p>
              <p>If they are exposed to air, they could degrade further and emit large amounts of dangerous radioactive material.</p>

              <p>OSAKA - PRIME Minister Naoto Kan on Friday vowed the nation would 
              overcome its biggest postwar crisis and 'once more rebuild' after being 
              struck by a devastating earthquake and tsunami.</p>
              <p>In a rallying cry to his disaster-hit nation Mr Kan voiced confidence
               that the government could take 'firm control' of the crisis at the 
              crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant as Japan battles to avert a 
              radioactive disaster.</p>
              <p>'We will overcome this tragedy and recover,' he said in a strident televised address. 'We will once more rebuild Japan'.</p>
              <p>The centre-left leader, wearing an emergency services 
              uniform, was speaking one week after the country's worst ever quake 
              struck, wiping out swathes of coastal areas and knocking out key cooling
               systems on nuclear power plants.</p>
              <p>Mr Kan said Japan was still facing 'huge difficulties' in 
              tackling the problems at the plant, which has been hit by a series of 
              explosions.</p>
              <p>As workers faced massive danger in trying to avert a full 
              meltdown, Mr Kan said that 'although we cannot let our guard down, we 
              will take firm control of the situation and we will be able to emerge 
              from this situation.' Seeking to raise spirits, Mr Kan reminded his 
              people of the nation's post-war recovery.</p>

              <p>RIKUZENTAKATA (Japan) - LIFE is brutally hard for survivors of last week's earthquake and tsunami, as is the business of death.</p>
              <p>Rescue missions have ended in the small coastal town of Rikuzentakata
               where nearly 1,800 people are missing, many undoubtedly buried under 
              the rubble of cars, houses, boats and factories which lie strewn around 
              in one giant heap.</p>
              <p>From Saturday, workers are focusing on clearing that heap.</p>
              <p>The bodies that have been found so far have been laid out in schools and halls awaiting identification.</p>
              <p>Those looking for loved ones submit a description to 
              police - hairstyle, birthmarks, moles or scars. The police 
              cross-reference the descriptions with bodies lying in neat rows and if 
              there is a possible match, show them to the survivors.</p>
              <p>In Japan, the vast majority of people are cremated when they
               die as there is not enough land for burials. Once a body is identified,
               it can be cremated, but the town's small, hilltop crematorium can only 
              cremate eight bodies a day.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Japan detects abnormal radiation in milk, spinach</h1>
              <p>OSAKA - JAPAN has detected abnormal levels of radioactivity in milk 
              and spinach in areas near a stricken nuclear plant, but the foods pose 
              no immediate threat to humans, government spokesman Yukio Edano said on 
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>The contaminated milk was found in Fukushima prefecture, where the 
              quake-damaged atomic power station is located, while the tainted spinach
               was discovered in neighbouring Ibaraki prefecture, Mr Edano told 
              reporters.</p>
              <p>'Radiation exceeding the limit under Japanese law was detected,' he said.</p>
              <p>The spokesman said the health ministry has ordered 
              authorities in both prefectures to investigate where the products came 
              from, how they were distributed and - depending on their findings - 
              suspend sales.</p>
              <p>He urged consumers to remain calm, noting that even if a 
              consumer were to drink the contaminated milk for a year, the radiation 
              level would be the equivalent of one CT scan.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Over 18,600 dead, missing in Japan disaster</h1>
              <p>OSAKA - THE number of people confirmed as dead or listed as missing 
              by Japan's national police agency topped 18,600 on Saturday, eight days 
              after the massive earthquake and tsunami struck.</p>
              <p>There were fears of a far higher death toll from the disaster that 
              wiped out vast residential areas along the Pacific coast of northern 
              Honshu island.</p>
              <p>The national police agency said 7,320 people had been confirmed dead 
              and 11,370 officially listed as missing - a total of 18,690 - as of 
              3.00pm (0600 GMT, 2.00pm Singapore time) on Saturday as a result of the 
              March 11 catastrophe.</p>
              <p>Hopes of finding many more survivors amid the rubble have 
              diminished after a cold snap hit Japan's northeast, covering much of the
               disaster area in snow earlier this week.</p>
              <p>The death toll has now well surpassed that of the 
              7.2-magnitude quake that struck the western Japanese port city of Kobe 
              in 1995, killing 6,434 people.</p>
              <p>The March 11 quake is now Japan's deadliest natural disaster
               since the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, which killed more than 142,000 
              people.</p>
