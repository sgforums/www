              <p>TOKYO - JAPAN'S police agency says 7,700 are dead and more than 11,600 are missing after last week's earthquake and tsunami.</p>
              <p>A week after the disasters devastated the northeast coast, the 
              National Police Agency said Sunday that 7,700 people died and 11,651 
              were missing.</p>
              <p>Some of the missing may have been out of the region at the time of the 
              disaster. In addition, the massive power of the tsunami likely sucked 
              many people out to sea. If the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is any guide, 
              most of those bodies will not be found.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Fukushima plant operator faked repair records</h1>
              <p>OSAKA - DAYS before Japan plunged into an atomic crisis after a giant
               earthquake and tsunami knocked out power at the ageing Fukushima 
              nuclear plant, its operator had admitted faking repair records.</p>
              <p>The revelation raises fresh questions about both Tokyo Electric Power
               Co (Tepco)'s scandal-tainted past and the government's perceived soft 
              regulation of a key industry.</p>
              <p>The operator of the Fukushima No. 1 plant submitted a report to the 
              country's nuclear watchdog ten days before the quake hit on March 11, 
              admitting it had failed to inspect 33 pieces of equipment in its six 
              reactors there.</p>
              <p>A power board distributing electricity to a reactor's 
              temperature control valves was not examined for 11 years, and inspectors
               faked records, pretending to make thorough inspections when in fact 
              they were only cursory, Tepco said.</p>
              <p>It also said that inspections, which are voluntary, did not 
              cover other devices related to cooling systems including water pump 
              motors and diesel generators. The report was submitted after the 
              regulator ordered operators to examine whether inspections were suitably
               thorough.</p>
              <p>'Long-term inspection plans and maintenance management were 
              inadequate,' the nuclear safety agency concluded in a follow-up report 
              two days after Tepco's admission. 'The quality of inspection was 
              insufficient.' The safety agency ordered the operator to draw up a 
              corrective plan by June 2.</p>

              <p><strong>Japan quake dead, missing nears 21,000</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>KAMAISHI, Japan : Workers were close to restoring power to a 
              nuclear plant's overheating reactors on Sunday as the toll of dead or 
              missing from Japan's worst natural disaster in nearly a century neared 
              21,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Amid the devastation
               on the northeast coast left by a March 11 quake and tsunami, police 
              reported an astonishing tale of survival with the discovery of an 
              80-year-old woman and her 16-year-old grandson alive under the rubble.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"Their temperatures 
              were quite low but they were conscious. Details of their condition are 
              not immediately known. They have been already rescued and sent to 
              hospital," a spokesman for the Ishinomaki Police Department said.<br><br>They
               were in the kitchen when their house collapsed but the teenager was 
              able to reach food from the refrigerator, helping them survive for nine 
              days, broadcaster NHK quoted rescuers as saying.<br><br>But with half a 
              million tsunami survivors huddled in threadbare, chilly shelters and the
               threat of disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant stretching 
              frayed nerves, the mood in the world's third-biggest economy remained 
              grim.<br><br>Food contaminated with radiation was found for the first 
              time outside Japan - where milk and spinach have already been tainted by
               a plume from Fukushima - as Taiwan detected radioactivity in a batch of
               imported Japanese fava beans.<br><br>The discovery of traces of 
              radioactive iodine in Tokyo tap water, well to the southwest of the 
              crippled atomic power plant on the Pacific coast, compounded public 
              anxiety but authorities said there was no danger to health.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Fukushima plant 
              was struck on March 11 by a massive earthquake and tsunami which, with 
              8,199 people confirmed killed, is Japan's deadliest natural disaster 
              since the Great Kanto quake levelled much of Tokyo in 1923.<br><br>Another 12,722 are missing, feared swept out to sea by the 10-metre (33-foot) tsunami or buried in the wreckage of buildings. <br><br>In
               Miyagi prefecture on the northeast coast, where the tsunami reduced 
              entire towns to splintered matchwood, the official death toll stood at 
              4,882.<br><br>Miyagi police chief Naoto Takeuchi, however, told a task 
              force meeting that his prefecture alone "will need to secure facilities 
              to keep the bodies of more than 15,000 people", Jiji Press reported.<br><br>Cooling
               systems that are meant to protect the Fukushima plant's six reactors 
              from a potentially disastrous meltdown were knocked out by the tsunami, 
              and engineers have since been battling to control rising temperatures.<br><br>The
               radiation-suited crews were striving to restore electricity to the 
              ageing facility 250 kilometres (155 miles) northeast of Tokyo, after 
              extending a high-voltage cable into the site from the national grid.<br><br>A
               spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency said electricity had 
              apparently reached the power distributor at the No. 2 reactor, which in 
              turn would feed power to the No. 1 reactor.<br><br>Plant operator TEPCO 
              confirmed an electricity supply had been restored to the distributor but
               said power at the reactor unit was not back on yet.<br><br>Engineers were checking the cooling and other systems at the reactor, aiming to restore power soon, TEPCO said late on Sunday.<br><br>"It will take more time. It's not clear when we can try to restore the systems," spokesman Naohiro Omura said.<br><br>Fire
               engines earlier aimed their water jets at the reactors and fuel rod 
              pools, where overheating is an equal concern, dumping thousands of 
              tonnes of seawater from the Pacific.<br><br>Six workers at the Fukushima
               plant have been exposed to high levels of radiation but are continuing 
              to work and have suffered no health problems, TEPCO said.<br><br>According
               to the charity Save the Children, around 100,000 children were 
              displaced by the 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami, and signs of trauma 
              are evident among young survivors as the nuclear crisis and countless 
              aftershocks fuel their terror.<br><br>"We found children in desperate 
              conditions, huddling around kerosene lamps and wrapped in blankets," 
              Save the Children spokesman Ian Woolverton said after visiting a number 
              of evacuation centres in Japan's northeast.<br><br>"They told me about 
              their anxieties, especially their fears about radiation," Woolverton 
              said, adding that several youngsters had mentioned the US atom bomb 
              attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which they know from school.<br><br>The
               government has insisted that there is no widespread threat of 
              radiation. But the discovery of the tainted fava beans by Taiwanese 
              customs officers will do nothing to calm public anxiety that has already
               spread far beyond Japan.<br><br>Several governments in Asia have begun 
              systematic radiation checks on made-in-Japan goods, as well as of 
              passengers arriving on flights from the country.<br><br>But Tsai 
              Shu-chen of Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration stressed that the 
              radioactive iodine and caesium-137 found on the fava beans were well 
              below national safety levels.<br><br>In the disaster epicentre of 
              northeast Japan, authorities have been battling to get more fuel and 
              food to survivors enduring freezing temperatures.<br><br>At shelters, 
              some grandparents are telling children stories of how they overcame 
              hardships in their own childhood during and after World War II, which 
              left Japan in ruins.<br><br>"We have to live at whatever cost," said Shigenori Kikuta, 72.<br><br>"We
               have to tell our young people to remember this and pass on our story to
               future generations, for when they become parents themselves."<br><br>There
               was better news for residents in Rikuzentakata, where construction 
              teams began erecting 36 prefabricated units, the first of many more 
              temporary houses being built for the tsunami homeless.<br><br>"They 
              won't be very big, but whatever they are, it will be better than being 
              in here," said great-grandmother Tokiko Kanno, who has been sleeping on a
               school stage.</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Contamination at Fukushima plant to last 'decades'</h1>
              <p>PARIS - LOCAL contamination from Japan's quake-damaged Fukushima 
              nuclear power plant will be a problem that will last 'for decades and 
              decades,' France's Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) said on Monday.</p>
              <p>Releases of radioactivity from the plant 'are now significant and 
              continuing,' the head of the agency, Andre-Claude Lacoste, told a press 
              conference.</p>
              <p>'We have to assume that Japan will have a long-term issue of managing
               the impacts,' he said. 'It's a problem that Japan will have to deal 
              with for decades and decades to come.' The releases stem in part from 
              deliberate venting of steam and gas, which also contain radioactive 
              particles, to ease pressure in overheating reactor vessels, he said. 
              Another source is 'leaks' of as-yet unknown origin, he said.</p>
              <p>'Ground deposits of radioactive particles (around the plant)
               are significant,' said Jean-Luc Godet, in charge of ionising radiation 
              management at the ASN.</p>
              <p>'The Japanese authorities have not drawn up, or 
              communicated, a map of these deposits, and it is not vain thinking to 
              believe that this (contaminated) zone extends beyond 20 kilometres,' he 
              said, referring to the 12-mile zone within which local inhabitants have 
              been evacuated.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, the Japanese government said it had detected 
              'abnormal levels' of radiation in milk and spinach taken from areas near
               Fukushima, but this did not pose any threat to health.</p>

              <p>OSAKA - A SERIES of strong earthquakes rattled north-east Japan on 
              Tuesday, keeping residents on edge more than a week after a devastating 
              tremor and tsunami battered the region.</p>
              <p>Two 6.6-magnitude tremors and one 6.4 quake struck within two and a 
              half hours off Japan's tsunami-stricken north-east coast, starting from 
              0718 GMT (3.18pm Singapore time), the US Geological Survey reported.</p>
              <p>There were no reports of casualties or damage and no tsunami warnings.</p>
              <p>A record 9.0 magnitude which spawned a towering tsunami 
              battered Japan's north-east coast on March 11, leaving more than 21,000 
              people dead or missing and triggering a crisis at a nuclear power plant 
              in Fukushima.</p>
              <p>Around 20 per cent of the world's most powerful earthquakes 
              strike Japan, which sits on the 'Ring of Fire' surrounding the Pacific 
              Ocean.</p>

              <p>TOKYO - JAPAN'S police agency says nearly 9,100 people are dead after an earthquake and tsunami. Another 13,800 are missing.</p>
              <p>Those tallies are likely to overlap, but police officials estimate that the final figure will likely exceed 18,000 deaths.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman from one of the of the hardest-hit prefectures, 
              Miyagi, estimates that the deaths will top 15,000 in that region alone.</p>
              <p>Police in other devastated areas declined to estimate 
              eventual tolls, but said the confirmed deaths in their areas already 
              number nearly 3,400.</p>
              <p>The National Police Agency said the overall number of bodies
               collected so far stood at 9,080, while 13,561 people have been listed 
              as missing. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Tokyo water unsafe for babies, farm food blocked</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>TOKYO: Tokyo on Wednesday warned that radioactive iodine over 
              twice the safe level for infants had been detected in its tap water due 
              to the disaster at a quake-hit nuclear plant northeast of Japan's 
              capital. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The news compounded 
              fears over the impact of the crippled Fukushima power station that also 
              led the government to ban farm produce from areas near the charred 
              complex, where emergency crews were battling to prevent a meltdown. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The United States 
              blocked imports of dairy and other produce from areas near the plant, 
              which has been belching radiation since it was hit by a powerful quake 
              and tsunami on March 11, followed by a series of explosions and fires. <br><br>France urged the European Union to also control Japanese food imports. <br><br>In
               one Tokyo ward, a water sample contained 210 becquerels of iodine per 
              kilogramme, more than double the legal limit, a city official said at a 
              press conference - news that triggered a 1.6 per cent dive on the Tokyo 
              stock market. <br><br>"Under government guidelines, water containing a 
              radioactive substance of more than 100 becquerels per kilogramme should 
              not be used for milk for babies," the city official told reporters. <br><br>The government advised residents throughout the city to avoid using tap water to make infant formula until further notice. <br><br>Prime
               Minister Naoto Kan earlier ordered a stop of shipments of untreated 
              milk and vegetables including broccoli, cabbage and parsley from areas 
              near the Pacific coast plant, about 250 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. <br><br>Farm
               produce shipments were halted from Fukushima and three nearby 
              prefectures - Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma - while radiation monitoring of
               farm and seafood products was stepped up in six others, officials said.
               <br><br>The new inspection zone extends to Saitama and Chiba, part of 
              the greater Tokyo urban sprawl that is home to more than 30 million 
              people. <br><br>The health ministry said radioactivity drastically 
              exceeding legal limits had been found in 11 kinds of vegetable grown in 
              Fukushima. <br><br>Radioactive caesium at 82,000 becquerels - 164 times the legal limit - was detected in one type of leaf vegetable, it said. <br><br>The
               ministry said that if people eat 100 grams a day of the vegetable for 
              about 10 days, they would ingest half the amount of radiation typically 
              received from the natural environment in a year. <br><br>"Even if these 
              foods are temporarily eaten, there is no health hazard," said top 
              government spokesman Yukio Edano, following reports that some products 
              may have already entered the market. <br><br>"But unfortunately, as the 
              situation is expected to last for the long term, we are asking that 
              shipments stop at an early stage, and it is desirable to avoid intake of
               the foods as much as possible." <br><br>Even if the short-term risk is 
              limited for now, scientists pointing to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster warn
               that some radioactive particles concentrate as they travel up the food 
              chain and stay in the environment for decades. <br><br>The US Food and 
              Drug Administration said it had placed an import alert on all milk, 
              dairy products, fresh vegetables and fruits from four prefectures. <br><br>"In
               addition, FDA will continue to flag all entries from Japan in order to 
              determine whether they originated from the affected area," it said. <br><br>"FDA will test all food and feed shipments from the affected area." <br><br>France
               urged the European Commission to impose "systematic controls for all 
              fresh produce reaching Europe's borders" from Japan, while stressing 
              that it was not calling for a total embargo on Japanese food products 
              "at this stage". <br><br>Around Asia, many Japanese restaurants and 
              shops are reporting a decline in business and governments have stepped 
              up radiation checks on the country's goods. <br><br>Tainted fava beans from Japan have already cropped up in Taiwan. <br><br>Japan - a highly industrialised and mostly mountainous island nation - is a net food importer. <br><br>According to the European Commission, the EU imported 9,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables from Japan in 2010. <br><br>In
               Japan, any further food shortages threaten to compound the misery for 
              hundreds of thousands made homeless by the 9.0-magnitude quake and the 
              jet-speed tsunami it spawned that erased entire communities. <br><br>The confirmed death toll rose Wednesday to 9,408, and Japan holds out little hope for 14,716 officially listed as missing. <br><br>Japan estimated the economic cost at up to 25 trillion yen (US$309 billion). <br><br>As
               grieving survivors huddled in evacuation shelters amid the rubble of 
              their former lives, their fate was overshadowed by the struggle to avert
               another massive catastrophe - a full nuclear meltdown at Fukushima. <br><br>Fire
               engines and giant concrete pumps have poured thousands of tonnes of 
              seawater onto its reactors and into spent fuel rod pools, to cool them 
              and stop fuel from being exposed to the air and releasing large-scale 
              radiation. <br><br>Engineers hope to restart the cooling systems of all 
              six reactors that were knocked out by the 14-metre (46-foot) tsunami, 
              and they have already reconnected the wider facility to the national

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Power back at Japan's reactor one control room</h1>
              <p>OSAKA - TECHNICIANS restored power to the reactor number one control 
              room of Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant on Thursday, even as white steam
               wafted from four reactors at the tsunami-damaged seaside facility.</p>
              <p>The incremental progress means workers can now use two crucial 
              control rooms - at reactors one and three - which they were earlier 
              forced to abandon after a series of explosions and amid strong radiation
               and in darkness.</p>
              <p>The March 11 quake and tsunami cut electricity to the plant and 
              knocked out backup systems, causing the cooling systems to fail. This 
              left the fuel rods inside to heat up and evaporate water, threatening a 
              full meltdown.</p>
              <p>Fire engines have hosed down the reactors and topped up 
              spent fuel rod pools to prevent the uranium and plutonium from being 
              exposed to the air - desperate steps intended to stop a major disaster, 
              but also creating radioactive steam.</p>
              <p>Reconnecting the reactor control rooms was seen as a key 
              step as workers hope to restart the original cooling systems. Previously
               they had to work with flashlights, and without air-conditioning that 
              would have extracted some radiation.</p>
              <p>'The light went on in the control room of the number one 
              reactor at 11.30am (0230 GMT, 10.30am Singapore time),' a nuclear safety
               agency official said. 'But we are still unsure whether this means the 
              cooling system will be restored.' -- AFP</p>

              <p>OSAKA - THE number of people confirmed dead or listed as missing in 
              Japan rose above 26,000 on Thursday, nearly two weeks after a massive 
              earthquake and tsunami struck the country's north-east coast.</p>
              <p>There are fears of a much higher toll from the disaster, which 
              flattened entire towns along the Pacific coast of northern Honshu 
              island.</p>
              <p>The National Police Agency said in its latest update that 9,737 
              people had been confirmed dead and 16,423 officially listed as missing -
               a total of 26,160 - as a result of the March 11 catastrophe.</p>
              <p>A total of 2,777 people have been injured.</p>
              <p>The quake has become Japan's deadliest natural disaster 
              since the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, which killed more than 142,000 
              people.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes and have taken shelter in emergency facilities. -- AFP</p>
