              <p>THE newborn baby boy was not only found with a trash bag twisted like
               a rope around his neck, but he had also been - for good measure - 
              buried in a rooftop garden of a Eunos Crescent block.</p>
              <p>But the person or persons who did this did not count on the infant's will to live - and to cry.</p>
              <p>Retiree Tay Kim Sia, 60, looking for the source of a mewing noise, 
              unearthed the baby from his shallow grave in the garden atop Block 31A, a
               multi-storey carpark block, on Monday.</p>
              <p>The child, his mouth stuffed with mud and dried leaves and 
              his umbilical cord still attached, has since been taken to the KK 
              Women's and Children's Hospital, where he is in a stable condition.</p>
              <p>The police are still trying to track down his next of kin.</p>
              <p>Mr Tay said he was smoking at the sixth-floor garden at around 2pm when he heard soft mews.</p>

              I hope the culprits are charged for attempted murder, rather than child abandoment.
              
              The trash bag twisted round the neck and burying is definitely an attempt to silence and kill the baby.
              
              I can sympathise with the girl, if she just abandon the baby, but to try and kill, or allow the guy to do it, is just too much.

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Mother of baby found buried alive arrested</h1>
              <p>THE mother of the newborn baby found buried in a rooftop garden in Eunos Crescent has been arrested.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old was nabbed near Eunos MRT station at around 9pm on 
              Sunday. She is believed to be an Indonesian who overstayed here.</p>
              <p>Her newborn son was found buried in a flower bed at the sixth-floor 
              garden of a multi-storey carpark on Monday last week. A plastic bag had 
              been tied around his neck.</p>
              <p>Retiree Tay Kim Sia, 60, found the baby after he heard what 
              he thought was a cat mewing while he was having a smoke in the garden. 
              He looked among the plants and saw a tiny foot sticking out from the 
              soil. His friend told him it was probably a battery-operated toy but he 
              decided to investigate further. What he dug out that afternoon was a 
              baby boy, muddied but still alive.</p>
              <p>Police investigations are ongoing, but it is believed the 
              boy was delivered among the plants, in the same spot where he was 
              buried. Police that day recovered some bloodied clothing just metres 
              away from where the baby was found. There were also drops of blood at a 
              stairwell on the same floor.</p>
              <p>The baby's mother is believed to have worked here as a maid.
               But her work permit had already expired when she was arrested. She will
               be charged today with overstaying while the police continue to 
              investigate her role in her son's abandonment.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Maid who buried newborn suffered depression</h1>
              <p>HER major depressive disorder led a mother to bury her newborn baby 
              in a rooftop garden of a multi-storey carpark in Eunos Crescent in on 
              April 11. The infant, his mouth stuffed with mud and dried leaves and 
              his umbilical cord still attached, was found alive that same day by a 
              retiree having a smoke.</p>
              <p>On Friday, Indriani, 28, an Indonesian who goes by one name, was 
              jailed six weeks for child abandonment. She was also jailed four weeks 
              and fined $2,000 for overstaying here for 273 days. As she is unable to 
              pay up, she will serve the one week default sentence. The jail term was 
              backdated to April 26, the date of her remand.</p>
              <p>She had pleaded guilty to both charges on Wednesday. Then, the 
              district court heard that Indriani came here on March 6 last year to 
              work as a maid. She ran off after four months and was deemed an 
              overstayer from July 19, 2010.</p>
              <p>According to investigations, she hid out at various 
              parks. To earn money, she prostituted herself in Geylang. Last October, 
              she discovered she was pregnant and had no idea who the father was.</p>
              <p>She went into labour on the night of April 17 and sought 
              refuge at the rooftop garden of Block 31A Eunos Crescent. At about 2am 
              the next day, she gave birth to a baby boy. The mother hid the newborn 
              in a 10cm deep hole she dug near some plants, and covered it with some 
              soil and leaves. Indriani then left. The baby has since been placed in 
              foster care by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.</p>
              <p>A psychiatric evaluation by the Institute of Mental Health 
              indicated that she was suffering from a major depressive disorder when 
              she abandoned the child. Shoulder-length hair tied neatly in a ponytail,
               the slim, 1.7m tall woman showed no expression throughout the hearing.</p>
