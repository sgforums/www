              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The need to look better and feel better has been driving Singapore's multi-million dollar aesthetics industry for many years.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">But lately, aesthetic doctors say their patients are getting younger, from those in their 40s to those in their 20s. <br> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">In fact, doctors say they have seen more patients despite the unstable economy.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">For those who say beauty is only skin deep, think again.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Aesthetic doctors say more and more people are
              turning to minimally-invasive treatments to spruce up their appearance,
              even during the downturn.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">And looking more attractive isn't the only aim.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Dr Kevin Teh, who specialises in breast enhancements and sculpting of body is from the Singapore Lipo, Body and Face Centre.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">"First of all, the procedures are not terribly
              expensive. When times are bad, there are some patients who find that
              looking better helps them in their job prospects." <br> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Over the past one year, Dr Teh has easily seen a two-fold increase in the number of regular patients.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">"Initially you get the traditional clientele that
              you expect, the expats, the Tai Tais, the aunties in their 40s and 50s
              who want to look better. But increasingly in the last few months or
              last half a year, I found that younger patients are coming to see me.
              I've had NSFs, that means NS boys who are still going through army,
              coming to look for treatments like these. And I've had a lot of young,
              fresh (adults) working in their 20s. So it's very, very prevalent now."</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Echoing similar sentiments is Dr Yeak Hwee Lee who specialises in botox and skin treatments.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Dr Yeak, whose from the Singapore Aesthetic Centre says her youngest patient was an 11 year-old who went for leg hair removal.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">She adds that business is brisk, particularly during the festive seasons.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Already, Dr Yeak says there's a waiting list.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">"On average, if let's say you're doing 20 to 30,
              then when it's peak season it's 20 to 30. But we're limited by the
              number of patients we can see because it takes time to do each case you
              see." <br> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">And time is money, that's why many patients opt for treatments that can be done in a few hours.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Dr Teh elaborates.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">"What they specifically especially want is low-down
              time procedures because all of them, most of them are working and when
              you're working it's not easy to just take one week off." <br> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">The fact that these treatments are relatively
              affordable - from 15 dollars for botox to less than 1,400 dollars for
              fat removal, is perhaps another reason why quick cosmetic procedures
              are gaining popularity.</span></p>
