              <p>STOMPer MAO came across a letter by a Chinese national 
              who suggested that bus stops here be renamed to 'make it easier for 
              foreigners'. According to the writer, Singapore should label its bus 
              stops and routes like what China is doing.<br><br>The STOMPer said:<br><br>"A Chinese national has asked Singapore to abolish its way of naming bus stops and also to stop wasting electricity.<br><br>"Pu
               Liangzhong, in his March 31, 2011, letter which was published by Lianhe
               Zaobao, raised issues with the way the bus stops and routes in 
              Singapore are named and claims that he had to contact his son every time
               he needed to get home from an outing.<br><br>"Mr Pu suggested that 
              Singapore should label its bus stops and routes like what China is doing
               to make it easier for the large number of foreigners who are residing 
              in Singapore."<br><br>According to the forum letter, Mr Pu said the bus 
              stop names for the bus stops for both directions of the route should be 
              the same, and not different, to make things easier.<br><br>"Commenting on the lighting in various HDB flats, Mr Pu added that they are overly bright and a waste of electricity.<br><br>"In
               this respect, Mr Pu continued that Singapore should take its cue from 
              China whereby they (China) use sound/sensor bulbs which turn 
              automatically themselves off when not in use.<br><br>"Mr Pu also added 
              that with the world calling for energy-saving meausures, Singapore would
               be seen as wasting its electricity on non-essential lighting."</p>

              <p>I dun think u get it.  It is not the case of improving but it just the FT want us to change our way so that it will be easier for them.  Had u been to china before?  Do u know how tough will it be for us if it change into their method.  If u think abt this, labelling of bus stops/routes etc, there isn't really any better way but more like way that plp had get use to.  It just like left-hand drive and right-hand drive.</p>
              <p>Sound to me more like that the foreigner feel that we shld make them easier at our own expense.  How abt our older gen that need to adept to it, how abt those older malay/india singaporean that dun understand mandarin?</p>
