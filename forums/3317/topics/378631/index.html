              <p><strong>New RP chairman Richard Seow wants to improve poly's branding</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: He would like to build up the brand of Singapore's
              youngest polytechnic, and hopefully improve its image and popularity
              among prospective students – many of whom may still not understand what
              Republic Polytechnic (RP) has to offer. </span></p>
              <p><span>Even as its previous board has done a "tremendous job" in
              establishing RP, Mr Richard Seow, who took over as chairman of RP's
              board of governors in July, feels the public does not know what the
              "relatively new" institution, opened in 2002, stands for.
              <br> <br>The school is not "unpopular", stressed Mr Seow, who is also the
              chairman of Parkway Holdings. Rather, it is a matter of publicising its
              unique brand of polytechnic education. "I thought I understood
              problem-based learning (PBL), but at my first PBL class at RP, I was
              really surprised by how it works," said Mr Seow.
              <br> <br>Under this approach, students solve one problem a day and present
              solutions to their peers at the end of the school day – much as one
              would in a real work environment, he said.
              <br> <br>And while the polytechnic has learnt that not every class can be
              taught with the PBL approach, such as more skills-oriented courses, it
              is also working to improve any shortcomings through symposiums on PBL
              where practices and research are shared.
              <br> <br>"It's still one of our fundamentals," said Mr Seow, who spoke to
              the media at the opening of RP's new Experiential Learning Centre@Ubin.
              The S$20,000 centre located on Pulau Ubin will allow students to learn
              how to solve problems in an outdoor environment.
              <br> <br>Over there, students can build hard skills, as well as soft skills
              such as learning to communicate well to perform tasks effectively. <br> <br> It will also support RP's Outdoor and Adventure Learning modules, and
              could be used for other course work in future. For example, as flooding
              is one occasional hazard at the quarry, School of Applied Sciences
              students could look at ways of addressing this problem, said Mr Ang
              Keng Loo, senior director for student services at RP.

              <p>i would rather they forget about putting efforts into this giant wayang created by PR firms called "branding" and concentrate on education..</p>
              <p>if they educate their students well, their brand will naturally become more respected...</p>
              <p>concerted "branding" efforts only serve to show that the organisation is more interested in their own status than their mission.. and that's a fricken quick way to lose their focus and everyone's respect for them</p>
