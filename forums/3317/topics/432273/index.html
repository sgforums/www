              <p>Police have arrested two Filipino men on Thursday for their involvement in two cases of <span id="lw_1307695632_1" class="yshortcuts">armed robbery</span> at separate Burger King outlets.</p>
              <p>In the most recent case, the assailants carried out their modus operandi at a International Plaza branch on Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>One of the suspects, a 32-year-old, allegedly walked into the 
              fast-food outlet and held a female staff, 61, in a headlock while 
              placing a knife under her throat.</p>
              <p>The man, whose face was covered with a <span id="lw_1307695632_5" class="yshortcuts">surgical mask</span>,
               then demanded that a male staff hand over all the money that was in the
               safe. The other man, a 30-year-old believed to be his accomplice, 
              waited outside the building.</p>
              <p>The robbery attempt was thwarted after a third crew member ran out of
               the outlet and sought help. It was said that the startled robber threw 
              his knife to the ground and fled empty-handed. The staff gave chase but 
              eventually lost sight of him.</p>
              <p><em>The Straits Times</em> reported that the suspect left a trail of clues behind, including a <span id="lw_1307695632_9" class="yshortcuts">bicycle chain</span>, which he intended to use to lock the doors of the outlet — and two rolls of duct tape.</p>
              <p>Police said they had received a call at about 7.30am informing them 
              of the incident. Through follow-up investigations, they managed to 
              establish the identity of the suspect by inspecting closed-circuit 
              television (CCTV) footage.</p>
              <p>He was arrested at Changi Airport later that night as he attempted to flee the country.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile on Thursday morning, the police managed to apprehend his accomplice who was in the vicinity of <span id="lw_1307695632_0" class="yshortcuts">Marina Bay</span>.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old suspect will be charged in court for 'attempt to commit <span id="lw_1307695632_2" class="yshortcuts">armed robbery</span>'
               and if convicted, faces imprisonment of up to seven years and not less 
              than 18 strokes of the cane. Police said that investigations against the
               30-year-old suspect are ongoing.</p>
              <p>However, the police believe that the older suspect might also be 
              involved in another armed-robbery attempt which occurred on 16 April 
              this year.</p>
              <p>The man had entered a Burger King outlet located at the underground <span id="lw_1307695632_7" class="yshortcuts">shopping mall</span> Esplanade X-change around 1am on the pretext of conducting maintenance work.</p>
              <p>Soon after, he confronted a female staff — who was alone at that time
               — and held a knife to her throat while demanding that she open the 
              safe.</p>
              <p>After emptying the safe of S$7,000, he gagged her and bound her 
              wrists and ankles with duct tape. The staff eventually managed to free 
              herself and call for help.</p>
              <p>The police are still investigating whether there were others involved in the attempt.</p>

              <p>probably they will serve time in sg prison. damn no wonder we have to pay so many taxes - to feed people who commit crimes here. the enxt time such floor traps commit crimes, citizens should take the law in their hands and kill them on the spot. by doing this we do a great deed. we safe ourselves some taxes, and dispose off some unwanted trashe just in case they flow to block drains during floods. i can;t wait to see their marked graves - to die manu miles away from home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see we should change our laws, they can come here bring their shit here and after all teh shit they can eat black beans rice in a five star hotel here in sg. nothhing to lose.</p>

              <p>haha I remembered a story by my taichi coach, who is in his 60s.</p>
              <p>he said once, he entered a lift in his HDB block, but suddenly a bangala ran in and stood behind my coach. My coach then didnt took a chance, gave him an elbow behind the bangala lol. then the bangala quickly pressed a button and exited the lift. he thought this old man is defence less and ripe for pickings,lol, how wrong was he.</p>

              <p>haha I remembered a story by my taichi coach, who is in his

              <p>he said once, he entered a lift in his HDB block, but suddenly a
              bangala ran in and stood behind my coach. My coach then didnt took
              a chance, gave him an elbow behind the bangala lol. then the
              bangala quickly pressed a button and exited the lift. he thought
              this old man is defence less and ripe for pickings,lol, how wrong
              was he.</p>

              <p>A BURGER King assistant manager pulled off a $6,000 armed robbery at one of the fast food chain's restaurants.</p>
              <p>Charlie Cabo Perez later tried to do it again at another branch but 
              fled empty handed when he suspected that one of the staff had called the
               police.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old Filipino - who also misappropriated $800 of his 
              employer's money - was yesterday sentenced to five years in jail and 24 
              strokes of the cane.</p>
              <p>Perez started off by robbing the chain's Esplanade Xchange branch on April 16, the court heard.</p>
              <p>He turned up just before closing time posing as a building 
              maintenance officer, armed himself with a bread knife, then walked up to
               assistant manager Vito Lorielyn Mesajon. He asked her to read three 
              words he had written by hand in a book: 'Open the safe'.</p>
              <p>The robber then took $6,056 and tied up the victim, taping her mouth and legs.</p>
