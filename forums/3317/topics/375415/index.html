              <p><strong>Police: Found body is likely missing Yale student</strong></p>
              <p class="first">NEW HAVEN, Conn. - Police on Sunday said they found
              what they believe is the body of a Yale University graduate student and
              bride-to-be hidden inside the wall of a university building where she
              was last seen five days before.</p>
              <p>New Haven Assistant Police Chief Peter Reichard said officials are
              presuming the body was that of doctoral student Annie Le, who has been
              the focus of a massive police search since Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"It hasn't
              been positively identified as of this time," Reichard told reporters
              Sunday night. "However, we are assuming it is her ... so we are
              treating it as a homicide."</p>
              <p>State police found the body at around
              5 p.m. Sunday in an area of the building that houses utility cables
              that run between floors. The building is in the Ivy League school's
              medical complex, about a mile from the main campus.</p>
              <p>Reichard said police also recovered "a large amount" of physical evidence, but he would not discuss what that included.</p>
              <p>Yale
              President Richard Levin offered support to Le's family and her fiance,
              Columbia University graduate student Jonathan Widawsky. The couple was
              to marry Sunday in Syosset, N.Y., on Long Island's north shore.</p>
              <p>"The
              family and fiance and friends now must suffer the additional ordeal of
              waiting for the body to be positively identified," Levin said. "I met
              earlier this evening with Annie's family, with her fiance and his
              family and I conveyed to them all the deeply felt support of the entire
              university community."</p>
              <p>Police on Sunday would not say if they
              have any suspects. They previously have said Widawsky is not a suspect
              and is assisting with the investigation.</p>
              <p>Le, 24, was last seen
              Tuesday morning in the five-story building that housed the laboratory
              where she worked. Surveillance video shows her arriving around 10 a.m.,
              but police had been baffled since the investigation began because there
              was no video of Le leaving, despite some 75 surveillance cameras
              operating around the complex. Her ID, money, credit cards and purse
              were found in her office.</p>
              <p>More than 100 local, state and federal
              police had been searching the building for days, using blueprints to
              uncover any place where evidence or Le's body could be hidden.</p>
              <p>Investigators
              on Saturday said they recovered evidence from the building, but would
              not confirm media reports that the items included bloody clothing.</p>
              <p>On
              Sunday morning, a state police van drove down a ramp into the basement
              area of the building where the lab is located. Authorities also sifted
              through garbage at a Hartford incinerator Sunday, looking through trash
              that was taken from the building in the days since Le went missing.</p>
              <p>Le,
              a a pharmacology student from Placerville, Calif., wrote a magazine
              article earlier this year about how to stay safe around the Ivy League
              campus.</p>
              <p>The article, titled "Crime and Safety in New Haven," was
              published in February in a magazine produced by Yale's medical school.
              It compares higher instances of robbery in New Haven with cities that
              house other Ivy League schools and includes an interview with Yale
              Police Chief James Perrotti, who offers advice such as "pay attention
              to where you are" and "avoid portraying yourself as a potential victim."</p>
              <p>"In
              short, New Haven is a city and all cities have their perils," Le
              concludes. "But with a little street smarts, one can avoid becoming yet
              another statistic."</p>
              <p>Le's disappearance weighed heavily on Yale
              students, who prayed for her safe return Sunday at The University
              Church on Yale's campus.</p>
              <p>"It has been a week that has tested many
              people in many different ways," the Rev. Ian Buckner Oliver said just
              before he gave the Sunday morning sermon. "It has brought up a lot of
              fears for people. It has brought up a lot of worry and concern for her
              and for all our safety."</p>
              <p>The student-dominated congregation
              offered a moment of silence and prayer, "for Annie, and her family, who
              have arrived here in New Haven, for her fiance, on this, what would
              have been their wedding day. Let's lift them up in our prayers," Oliver
              said.</p>

              <p><strong>Technician in custody in Yale grad student slaying</strong></p>
              <p class="first">NEW HAVEN, Conn. - Police and FBI agents searched the
              home of a Yale University animal research technician Tuesday night and
              led him away in handcuffs to the cheers of neighbors in a hunt for
              evidence that might tie him to the slaying of a graduate student.</p>
              <p>No charges were filed against 24-year-old Raymond Clark III in
              Middletown, but police took him into custody while searching for DNA
              and other physical evidence. Police said Clark would be released after
              they obtain evidence they need from him and his Middletown apartment.</p>
              <p>Clark
              was escorted out of the apartment building in Middletown and into a
              silver car. Neighbors leaned over the apartment building's iron
              railings and cheered as police led him away.</p>
              <p>New Haven Police
              Chief James Lewis described Clark as a person of interest, not a
              suspect, in the death of 24-year-old Annie Le. The Yale graduate
              student's body was found stuffed behind a wall in a campus research
              building Sunday, the day she was to be married.</p>
              <p>Lewis said police
              were hoping to compare DNA taken from Clark's hair, fingernails and
              saliva to more than 150 pieces of evidence collected from the crime
              scene. That evidence may also be compared at a state lab with DNA
              samples given voluntarily from other people with access to the crime
              scene.</p>
              <p>"We're going to narrow this down," Lewis said. "We're going to do this as quickly as we can."</p>
              <p>Police
              have collected more than 700 hours of videotape during the probe and
              sifted through computer records documenting who entered what parts of
              the research building where Le was found dead.</p>
              <p>Investigators
              began staking out Clark's home Monday, a day after they discovered Le's
              body hidden in a basement wall of a facility at Yale's medical school
              that housed research animals. She vanished Sept. 8.</p>
              <p>Clark shares
              the apartment with his girlfriend, Jennifer Hromadka, whom he is
              engaged to marry in December 2011, according to the couple's wedding
              Web site.</p>
              <p>"He seemed like a normal guy to me, no big deal," said
              Ivan Hernandez, 22, who lives directly above Clark and would often see
              him sitting on a bench outside their apartment building and smoking. "I
              thought he was nice, actually."</p>
              <p>Neither the couple nor Clark's parents returned repeated telephone calls Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Clark
              moved to Middletown from New Haven six months ago, where he shared an
              apartment with his girlfriend and three cats, according to former
              neighbor Taylor Goodwin, 16.</p>
              <p>Police have said Clark is a lab
              technician at Yale. It's unclear how long he worked there and Clark's
              supervisors would not comment Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Le worked for a Yale laboratory that conducted experiments on mice. Clark works in the same lab.</p>
              <p>Authorities
              had been tightlipped since Le was reported missing last week. Police
              say they have ruled out her fiancee, a Columbia University graduate
              student, as a suspect but have provided little additional information.</p>
              <p>Officials
              had promised Tuesday to release an autopsy report that would shed light
              on exactly how Le died. But then prosecutors blocked release of the
              results out of concern that it could hinder the investigation.</p>
              <p>Investigators
              usually have reasons for keeping information secret during a criminal
              probe, said David Zlotnick, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law
              at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I.</p>
              <p>Secrecy helps
              police confront possible suspects with little-known evidence about a
              crime and makes it harder them to fabricate a cover story.</p>
              <p>"Having
              that information secret or private helps the investigators know, first
              of all, what buttons to push on the person, and it makes sure they
              haven't tainted the investigation," Zlotnick said.</p>
              <p>The Le family
              issued a statement Tuesday through a family friend, the Rev. Dennis
              Smith, that thanked friends and the Yale community for their support
              during their grieving. The family also asked for privacy.</p>
              <p>The secrecy surrounding the case has bred confusion in some quarters, and officials have repeatedly denied media reports.</p>
              <p>"You
              guys made up the fact that we had somebody in custody, the media in
              general," New Haven police spokesman Joe Avery told reporters outside
              the police department Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The lack of information also has
              led to some measure of fear at Yale, which last dealt with a homicide
              in 1998 _ the sensational and still-unsolved stabbing death of
              21-year-old Suzanne Jovin about 2 miles from campus.</p>
              <p>Yale
              President Richard Levin was more forthcoming to Yale medical students,
              telling them Monday that police have narrowed the number of potential
              suspects to a small pool because security systems at the building where
              Le's body was found recorded who entered the building and what times
              they entered.</p>
              <p>The building is accessible to Yale personnel with identification cards. Some 75 video surveillance cameras monitor all doorways.</p>
              <p>Several
              news organizations have reported that police were interviewing a
              possible suspect who failed a polygraph test and had defense wounds on
              his body. At least one reported Tuesday that it was the lab technician
              in Middletown.</p>
              <p>Along the way, various media have reported that Le
              was stabbed, that police found her bloody clothes and that a professor
              was a prime suspect _ virtually all claims unconfirmed by police or met
              by flat denials.</p>
              <p>New Haven police said they would restrict
              information even more in coming days after an NBC producer was injured
              Tuesday as reporters outside the police department pushed to surround a
              spokesman during a briefing.</p>
              <p>"That this horrible tragedy happened
              at all is incomprehensible," said Le's roommate, Natalie Powers. "That
              it happened to her, I think is infinitely more so. It seems completely
              senseless."</p>

              <p><strong>Police focus on Yale murder suspect's attitude</strong></p>
              <p>NEW HAVEN, Conn. – Staffers in white coats reported to work Friday
              at the end of an extraordinary week at Yale as police considered
              whether a graduate student's grisly death might have stemmed from a
              dispute with an animal research technician described as an overbearing
              "control freak."</p>
              <p>A law enforcement official said police are
              looking into the possibility that Raymond Clark III's attitude led to a
              deadly workplace confrontation with 24-year-old Annie Le. She vanished
              Sept. 8, and her body was found in a utility compartment in a Yale
              medical school building five days later, on what was to be her wedding
              day.</p>
              <p>Police charged Clark, 24, with murder on Thursday,
              arresting him at a motel a day after taking hair, fingernail and saliva
              samples to compare with evidence from the grisly crime scene.</p>
              <p>Bond
              was set at $3 million for Clark, who kept his head down and said "Yes,
              your honor," when asked whether he understood his rights. He did not
              enter a plea.</p>
              <p>The official, who spoke to The Associated Press
              on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing and many
              details remain sealed, said Yale workers told police that Clark was a
              "control freak" who clashed with scientists and their proteges in the
              lab where they both worked at the Ivy League school.</p>
              <p>Investigators
              haven't decided if the theory will ultimately lead to a motive, but
              don't believe that they'll need to establish one when Clark goes to
              trial because they have an abundance of strong forensic evidence, the
              official said.</p>
              <p>Authorities are offering few details about the
              crime. They would not discuss a motive, largely because Clark will not
              talk to police, and would not disclose the DNA test results or how they
              connected Clark to the slaying.</p>
              <p>Security guards continued
              their street patrols Friday morning and news crews set up for another
              day of staking out the college's medical complex. A makeshift memorial
              of candles and flowers was arranged at the entrance to a park across
              the street from the lab building, in an area of squat, utilitarian
              buildings about a mile from the majestic main campus.</p>
              <p>Yale students are relieved that a suspect is in custody, yet shaken that the crime happened there.</p>
              <p>"I
              think it's important to the community to know that something's been
              done and that somebody's actually being brought to justice," Juliana
              Biondo said Thursday.</p>
              <p>But that doesn't bring full comfort to Doug Lindsay.</p>
              <p>"Despite the fact that they found somebody ... it was still, to me, kind of scary," he said.</p>
              <p>Le's
              work at the university involved experiments on mice that were part of
              research into enzymes that could have implications for treatment of
              cancer, diabetes and muscular dystrophy, while Clark's technician job
              involved cleaning floors and mouse cages.</p>
              <p>At a news conference
              Thursday, New Haven Police Chief James Lewis called Le's death a case
              of workplace violence. He would not elaborate except to say reports
              that the two had a romantic relationship were untrue.</p>
              <p>"It is
              important to note that this is not about urban crime, university crime,
              domestic crime but an issue of workplace violence, which is becoming a
              growing concern around the country," Lewis said, adding that he would
              not rule out additional charges.</p>
              <p>The Rev. Dennis Smith, a Le
              family spokesman, said he was not authorized to comment on the arrest.
              Smith said he did not know whether Le had ever complained about Clark.</p>
              <p>Clark
              appeared in court with two public defenders who were new to the case. A
              private-practice attorney who had represented him during the
              investigation did not attend the hearing and said Thursday he no longer
              represents Clark. The attorney declined to give a reason.</p>
              <p>Public defender Joseph Lopez said he was still reviewing the case and declined to comment.</p>
              <p>Two
              friends of Clark's since childhood, appearing on CNN's Larry King Live
              on Thursday night, said they were stunned by the murder allegations and
              could not reconcile them with the young man they've known for years.</p>
              <p>"That's not the Raymond Clark I've talked to my whole entire life," Bobby Heslin said.</p>
              <p>"I just can't picture him doing something like this," Maurice Perry said.</p>
              <p>The
              New York Times reported that Clark at times grew angry if lab workers
              did not wear shoe covers. "He would make a big deal of it, instead of
              just requesting that they wear them," said a researcher who asked not
              to be identified.</p>
              <p>ABC News reported that Clark sent a text
              message to Le on the day she vanished requesting a meeting to discuss
              the cleanliness of mouse cages in the research lab.</p>
              <p>Reached at their homes after work Thursday, several of Le's co-workers at the lab declined to comment on her or Clark.</p>
              <p>The
              Connecticut medical examiner said Wednesday that Le died of "traumatic
              asphyxiation," which could indicate a choke hold or some other form of
              suffocation caused by a hand or an object such as a pipe.</p>
              <p>Investigators
              focused on Clark early in the investigation and searched his apartment
              Tuesday, when they labeled him a person of interest. He remained under
              constant surveillance after he was released early Wednesday and found a
              room at the Super 8 motel in Cromwell, Conn.</p>
              <p>Clark was arrested about 8 a.m. Thursday. Details of the warrant remained sealed.</p>
              <p>The
              New Haven Register printed a rare extra edition announcing Clark's
              arrest, wrapping it around Thursday's daily newspaper and selling it on
              the streets, editor Jack Kramer said.</p>
              <p>Brian Garnett, a
              spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Correction, confirmed that
              Clark was being held Thursday night at the MacDougall-Walker
              Correctional Institution, a high-security facility in Suffield, about
              20 miles north of Hartford.</p>
              <p>Garnett said it was unclear whether Clark would remain there until his next scheduled court date Oct. 6.</p>
              <p>Yale
              President Richard Levin released a statement shortly after the arrest,
              saying Clark's employment history raised no suspicions.</p>
              <p>"This
              incident could have happened in any city, in any university, or in any
              workplace. It says more about the dark side of the human soul than it
              does about the extent of security measures," Levin said in a message
              sent to the Yale community.</p>
