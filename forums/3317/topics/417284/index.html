              <p>BEIJING – Only three weeks after the idea was first 
              publicly floated, China has cobbled together its own peace prize and 
              plans to award it Thursday — the day before the <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101208/ap_on_re_as/as_china_nobel#"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Nobel </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Committee</span></span></a> honors an imprisoned Chinese dissident in a move that has enraged Beijing.</p>
              <p>Since Liu Xiaobo's selection, China has vilified the 
              54-year-old democracy advocate, called the choice an effort by the West 
              to contain its rise, disparaged his supporters as "clowns," and launched
               a campaign to persuade countries not to attend Friday's ceremony in 
              Oslo. The government is also preventing Liu — who is serving an 11-year 
              sentence for co-authoring a bold appeal for political reforms in the 
              Communist country — and his family members from attending.</p>
              <p>Amid the flurry of action came a commentary published
               on Nov. 17 in a Communist Party-approved tabloid that suggested China 
              create its own award — the "Confucius Peace Prize" — to counter the 
              choice of Liu.</p>
              <p>Three weeks later, The Associated Press has learned, China is doing just that.</p>
              <p>Named after the famed philosopher, the new prize was 
              created to "interpret the viewpoints of peace of (the) Chinese 
              (people)," the awards committee said in a statement it released to the 
              AP on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Awards committee chairman Tan Changliu said his group
               was not an official government body, but acknowledged that it worked 
              closely with the Ministry of Culture. He declined to give specifics 
              about the committee, when it was created and how the five judges were 
              chosen, saying it would be disclosed later.</p>
              <p>The first honoree is Lien Chan, Taiwan's former vice 
              president and the honorary chairman of its Nationalist Party, for having
               "built a bridge of peace between the mainland and Taiwan." A staffer in
               his Taipei office said she could not comment Tuesday because she knew 
              nothing about the prize.</p>
              <p>Lien was chosen from among eight nominees — some of 
              whom are regularly mentioned for, or have already won, that other peace 
              prize: including billionaire Bill Gates, former South African President 
              Nelson Mandela, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Palestinian leader 
              Mahmoud Abbas and the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan
               Buddhism.</p>
              <p>While China regularly disparages the Dalai Lama, the 
              religion's spiritual leader, the current Panchen Lama is a 20-year-old 
              who was hand-picked by Beijing. The original boy named by the Dalai Lama
               has disappeared.</p>
              <p>"We should not compete, we should not confront the 
              Nobel Prize, but we should try to set up another standard," said Liu 
              Zhiqin, the Beijing businessman who suggested the prize in The Global 
              Times. "The Nobel prize is not a holy thing that we cannot doubt or 
              question. Everyone has a right to dispute whether it's right or wrong." 
              Liu said in the phone interview that he was not involved in setting up 
              the new awards.</p>
              <p>Tan, who leads the awards committee, acknowledged 
              that the new prize, which comes with a purse of 100,000 yuan ($15,000), 
              doesn't have international recognition: "It needs to grow gradually, and
               we hope people will believe the award is of global significance."</p>
              <p>China is not the first nation to be rankled by a 
              Nobel Peace Prize. During Nazi Germany era, Adolf Hitler created the 
              German National Prize for Art and Science in 1937 as a replacement for 
              the Nobel. He had forbidden German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky from 
              accepting his Nobel awarded in 1935.</p>
              <p>This year, China's clampdown against Liu and his 
              supporters means the Nobel medal and money won't be handed out for the 
              first time since that period. Nobel officials say the prestigious $1.4 
              million award can be collected only by the laureate or close family 
              members.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, China is chipping away at the Nobel:
               It succeeded in persuading 18 other countries to boycott the upcoming 
              ceremony, including longtime allies like Pakistan, Venezuela and Cuba as
               well as business partners Saudi Arabia and Iran, Nobel officials said 
              Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Beijing sharpened its denunciations, with Foreign 
              Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu accusing the Nobel committee of 
              "orchestrating an anti-China farce by themselves."</p>
              <p>"We are not changing because of interference by a few clowns and we will not change our path," she said.</p>
              <p>But Beijing's hastily arranged efforts to provide a 
              distraction to the Nobel ceremony are counterproductive, said Oxford 
              University China scholar Steve Tsang.</p>
              <p>"The whole thing is too obviously being rushed to 
              counter the Nobel Prize to Liu Xiaobo. People will see it for what it 
              is. That being the case, it's not going to be very credible," he said.</p>
              <p>If anything, China's heavy-handed reactions in the wake of the 
              announcement, which include putting Liu's wife and other supporters 
              under house arrest and barring dozens of activists from traveling to 
              Oslo, "simply give the rest of the world the impression that human 
              rights is really in trouble in China," he said.</p>

              <p>there are many such asian prizes established before but none could still outperform the glamour of the Nobel ......or only being a second to the Nobel i.e. ramon magsaysay...etc</p>
              <p>however it is not at all impossible that China or any asian countries could not perform that feat.....but they would need to study first on the success factors for the Nobel....they would need to establish very great and neutral principles of humanity contrary to conventional beliefs/ ideologies and to conduct the same themselves as an example before such a great prize could be established...and aside to the aforesaid, also the numerous acceptance and adoption by established academic universities and communities...</p>
