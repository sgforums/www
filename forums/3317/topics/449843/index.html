              SOURCE: The Straits Times
              
              A DOCTOR accused of failing to stop after an accident and not helping the injured said yesterday that he did not know that he was involved in one.
              
              Teo Tiong Kiat, 64, said in his defence that if he had known that he had injured someone, he would have extended help.
              
              As a doctor, he added, it was his duty to help the injured.
              
              The general practitioner, who runs a clinic in Clementi, admitted to causing the death of freelance writer Mok Chee Kong, 35, and injuring another cyclist, Mr Bertram Leong Poh Meng, 24, along Clementi Road on March 21, 2010 through his negligence.
              
              But he denied three other charges of not stopping, rendering assistance and moving his vehicle without lawful authority.
              
              The court heard that Teoâ€™s car had suddenly swerved to the extreme left lane where the cyclists were, hitting Mr Mokâ€™s bicycle and then Mr Leongâ€™s.
              
              The impact caused both cyclists to land on the carâ€™s bonnet, severely denting it. They also hit the windscreen, breaking it.
              
              Mr Mok died without regaining consciousness three days later. Mr Leong was in hospital until March 29.
              
              Asked by his lawyer, Senior Counsel Sant Singh, yesterday what his feelings were about the incident, Teo said he was still extremely upset and very sorry about what had happened.
              
              Since the accident, he has not driven as he was â€œfearfulâ€�.
              
              Earlier, Teo testified that he had begun that day at dawn with a house call to certify the cause of death of a five-year-old boy from a brain tumour.
              
              He then went to church with his family, had lunch and tried to sleep when he went home but could not. He went to his clinic to clear some paperwork. He had dinner with his office manager, Ms Celine Lee, and had a glass of wine.
              
              On his way home, he felt the car swerving to the left and wobbling along Clementi Road. He lost control and heard a loud sound.
              
              He eventually brought the vehicle under control and took the slip road to Upper Bukit Timah Road. He parked at the Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre carpark to inspect the tyre.
              
              He was shocked the see the extensive damage to the bonnet, windscreen and roof. He told a man called Mr Michael Teo, who was having dinner with his family, that it was amazing he was not injured given that his car was so badly damaged.
              
              Teo said he took photographs of the car. So did Mr Teoâ€™s daughter, and both men exchanged name cards.
              
              Subsequently, when his office manager arrived, Teo again said it was a miracle that he was alive. She pointed out that the carâ€™s front number plate was missing.
              
              They decided to walk back. It was only when he saw the police, the two bicycles and a pool of blood in Clementi Road that he realised his car must have hit the bicycles.
              
              The number plate was also found by the roadside.
              
              Under cross-examination, Deputy Public Prosecutor Adrian Loo suggested that Teo had returned to the scene after he discovered that his licence plate was missing. Teo did not agree.
              
              â€œI put it to you that you knew or ought to have known from the cracked windscreen and dented roof at the point of collision that you had hit the two cyclists,â€� DPP Loo said.
              
              Teo disagreed.
              
              District Judge John Ng will hear submissions from both sides on Friday.

              Doctor gets jail, driving ban for causing cyclist's death
              
              SINGAPORE: A doctor who caused the death of a cyclist and seriously injured another was on Friday jailed four weeks and banned from driving for five years. 
              
              64-year-old Teo Tiong Kiat admitted to causing the death of 35-year-old Mok Chee Kong along Clementi Road towards Upper Bukit Timah Road on March 21, 2010.
              
              Teo pleaded guilty to five charges, including failing to keep a proper lookout, causing grievious hurt and failing to render assistance to the victims.
              
              The court heard that Teo, who runs his own clinic at Clementi, had a glass of red wine before the accident.
              
              Investigations revealed that Mok, along with two others -- 24-year-old Bertram Leong Poh Meng and 18-year-old Douglas Sim Chun Ya -- were cycling on the extreme left lane of a four-lane road. 
              
              Teo was driving in the second lane when he suddenly swerved into the cyclists' lane.
              
              Teo then collided into the back of the bicycles which Mok and Leong were riding, throwing both men onto the bonnet of his car. 
              
              The court heard that Mok and Leong flipped over the car's roof and landed on the road.
              
              Teo left the scene after the accident and returned less than an hour later. 
              
              He then informed a police officer at the scene that he was the driver.
              
              Mok, who was sent to hospital unconscious, passed away three days later from multiple injuries, including severe head injury. 
              
              His friend, Leong, suffered serious head and neck injuries.
              
              Speaking to the media after the sentence was passed, Teo said he was remorseful and asked for forgiveness from the victims' families.
