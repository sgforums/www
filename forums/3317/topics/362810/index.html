              <p>North Korea continued producing high-quality counterfeit US dollar bills
                  known as "supernotes" even after Washington lifted financial
                  sanctions in 2007, a South Korean newspaper said.</p>
              <p>Dong-A Ilbo quoted a source in Washington as saying that a joint probe by
                  Seoul and Washington has been under way since the fake 100 dollar bills
                  surfaced in South Korea's southern port city of Busan last November.</p>
              <p>The two countries "have been keeping tabs on the case as it is likely
                  to have considerable fallout on US-North Korea and inter-Korean ties," the
                  source was quoted as saying by the conservative daily. "When the UN
                  Security Council wraps up discussions on imposing sanctions, the North is
                  likely to be hit by tough financial sanctions," the source said.</p>
              <p><span> </span>The five permanent Council members
                  plus Japan and South Korea are negotiating a resolution that could impose new
                  sanctions on the North for its May 25 nuclear test.</p>
              <p>Police in Busan confirmed they had arrested four people for smuggling in
                  9,904 fake 100 dollar bills and had asked Interpol for help to locate their
                  leader, who is believed to live in China. Agents from the US Secret Service
                  have sought cooperation from South Korean police to track an international ring
                  that circulated the "supernotes," a detective in the city told AFP by
                  phone. "We don't know where the counterfeit money was manufactured or who
                  made it," the detective said on condition of anonymity. Dong-A quoted a
                  diplomatic source as saying the case showed the communist North kept producing
                  counterfeit dollars despite the lifting of US financial sanctions in 2007.</p>
              <p>The US Treasury in September 2005 blacklisted a Macau bank for allegedly
                  helping North Korea to launder money, freezing Pyongyang's accounts there. The
                  accounts were unblocked in 2007 as part of efforts to push ahead with a nuclear
                  disarmament pact.</p>
              <p>The daily said South Korean and US intelligence authorities met in Seoul
                  Wednesday to discuss ways to strengthen surveillance and prevent materials for
                  supernote production from entering North Korea.</p>
              <p>The National Intelligence Service declined to comment. Yonhap news agency
                  quoted a diplomatic source in Washington as saying that the United States is
                  seeking to tighten the screws on the North over the counterfeiting.</p>
              <p>A US delegation that has been touring East Asia to discuss a response to the
                  nuclear test will raise the counterfeiting issue when it visits China Friday,
                  the agency said. Headed by US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, the
                  team includes Treasury Undersecretary Stuart Levey, who led the action against
                  the Macau bank.</p>
