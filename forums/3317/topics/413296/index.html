              <p>quick summary of the article..</p>
              <p>Intensive bodybuilding and steroid abuse has turned this 29 year old 
              Ipoh woman, Elaine Lye, into a muscled hunk, and this had scared away 
              her boyfriend of 7 years. They broke up because her boyfriend could not 
              accept her being fitter than him. <br><br>Miss Lye's interest in 
              bodybuilding began when she is just 8 years old. She had seen a man 
              doing weight-lifts and was so mesmerized. In 2007, she set up a gym 
              called Muszle Warrior, which now has 100 odd regular members. Her dream 
              is to take part in a professional bodybuilding competition for women. <br><br>Miss
               Lye now uses the male toilet instead of female because she was often 
              mistaken for a guy. She told The New Paper in an interview that she has 
              the heart of a woman although she has a body of a man. She yearns for a 
              man to accept and love her as she is.</p>

              <p>The problem here is not so much the bodybuilding..... it was the steroid abuse.</p>
              <p>Bodybuilding by itself won't do that to you.... but taking lots of illegal steroids can. The East German swimming team in the 1970s comes to mind.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty sure her boyfriend broke up with her not because he '<em>could not accept her being fitter than him</em>', but rather, because the steroids effectively turned her into a man.</p>

              <p>quick summary of the article..</p>
              <p>Intensive bodybuilding and steroid abuse has turned this 29 year
              old Ipoh woman, Elaine Lye, into a muscled hunk, and this had
              scared away her boyfriend of 7 years. They broke up because her
              boyfriend could not accept her being fitter than him.<br> <br> Miss Lye's interest in bodybuilding began when she is just 8 years
              old. She had seen a man doing weight-lifts and was so mesmerized.
              In 2007, she set up a gym called Muszle Warrior, which now has 100
              odd regular members. Her dream is to take part in a professional
              bodybuilding competition for women.<br> <br> Miss Lye now uses the male toilet instead of female because she was
              often mistaken for a guy. She told The New Paper in an interview
              that she has the heart of a woman although she has a body of a man.
              She yearns for a man to accept and love her as she is.</p>
