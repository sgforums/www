              <p><strong>MAS reviews deposit insurance scheme to give customers more protection</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is looking
              at measures to boost investors' confidence in the financial system. It
              is also tightening its supervision of financial institutions (FIs) that
              sell investment products.
              <br> <br>For the average man-in-the street, one worry has always been the
              kind of protection he would get if his bank or finance company goes
              bust. To protect such individual depositors, Singapore started the
              Deposit Insurance Scheme in April 2006.
              <br> <br>A limit of S$20,000 per individual investor per institution was
              set, allowing 87 per cent of individual investors to be fully insured.
              The coverage ratio has since dipped to 83 per cent, which is the lower
              end of MAS' targeted range.
              <br> <br>Now, in the wake of the global financial crisis, MAS wants to raise
              the coverage limit to above S$20,000 to better protect bank customers
              and to ensure that the scheme is relevant and in line with
              international practice.
              <br> <br>At the same time, MAS said this should not lead to a substantial
              increase in costs to the industry which could be passed on in some form
              to bank customers.
              <br> <br>The regulator will consult the public and industry over the next
              six to nine months before implementing the revised scheme next year. <br> <br> FIs will also come under closer scrutiny after the recent fiasco where
              many retail investors lost money when the complex structured notes they
              bought became worthless.
              <br> <br>While ten financial institutions have been banned from selling such
              products and some investors have received varying settlements, there
              are still questions as to the responsibility that senior bank
              management and even MAS itself, should bear.
              <br> <br>Shane Tregillis, deputy managing director, Market Conduct, MAS,
              said: "MAS' role was to check the disclosure agreements, but not the
              merits of the investment. There are lessons clearly for FIs on what
              they need to do better and clearly, we need to reflect on the types of
              issues going forward in our supervision."
              <br> <br>In the pipeline are measures to further safeguard consumer interest
              and boost industry standards â€“ from stricter training of frontline
              staff to all-round financial education for consumers.
              <br> <br>In terms of staff training, MAS is proposing a new Capital Markets
              and Financial Advisory Services examination module on product knowledge
              for bank staff who want to sell complex investment products.
              <br> <br>It will also intensify its supervision of financial institutions
              and probe steps taken by its senior management to ensure fair dealings
              with customers.
              <br> <br>MAS said it would also need to focus on new products when they are
              launched and plans to develop a financial literacy core programme that
              will aid the average man-in-the street make informed financial
              decisions at all stages of his life.
