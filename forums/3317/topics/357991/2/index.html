              <p><strong>NDP stage modified to bring audience closer to performers</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The main stage for this year's National Day Parade has
              been modified to bring the show closer to the audience. There will also
              be 24 smaller stages or podiums scattered throughout the venue.
              <br> <br>The water gap that used to separate the audience from the stage has
              been filled and the backdrop has been brought 30 metres forward so that
              performers can get closer to the audience.
              <br> <br>Ivan Heng, creative director of the 44th National Day Parade, said:
              "Last year's show was good, but I felt it was a bit distant. For me as
              an artist, I wanted to create a show that was closer to heart and home.
              I also want to make people laugh... that's when you plant something
              emotional.
              <br> <br>"It's very hard to pin down this idea of emotion. But I think it
              comes down to this idea of belonging or feeling that we are part of
              something that is greater than ourselves."
              <br> <br>Unlike last year, this year's Combined Schools Choir will move
              around the stage during its performance. Large puppets will also make a
              grand entrance from the Singapore River, docking at the Marina Bay
              floating platform before making their way to the stage.
              <br> <br>Besides Chinook helicopters and the Red Lions, stunt performers
              will also be a highlight at the parade - dangling from large high-rise
              grids flanking the centre backdrop.
              <br> <br> Moreover, homegrown band Electrico will be the first local indie band to perform the parade's theme song, "What Do You See". 
              <br> <br>Dave Tan, lead singer of Electrico, said: "I was like, 'Wow, we are
              finally getting recognised by the government'. We are very proud to be
              representing the local music scene. There was a time they would never
              let rockers near a National Day Parade, let alone on stage singing the
              National Day song.
              <br> <br>"It's obvious we have progressed a lot and we are very proud to be
              recognised as the people whom they would like to make the change with,
              and we are very proud to be making history." <br> <br> This year's National Day Parade is based on the National Pledge and
              excerpts of the pledge will be showcased in ten acts or chapters. <br> <br> - CNA/so </span></p>

              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>THIS year's National Day Parade (NDP) will have a distinctly rock vibe.</p>
              <p>Local indie rock band Electrico will take centre stage to perform this year's theme song, which it penned.</p>
              <p>It is the first time a local rock band has been picked and given
                  the honour of singing for the nation. Solo local pop artists like
                  Stephanie Sun and Kit Chan have usually been the choice.</p>
              <p>The band's frontman David Tan said: 'It shows we have
                  progressed...We are proud to be recognised as the people the NDP
                  organisers would like to make the change with.'</p>
              <p>Electrico has appeared before at the NDP, but those performances
                  were before the main event. Mr Tan, 33, said it took him two weeks to
                  compose the song What Do You See? The final version of the song was
                  approved by the NDP organisers two weeks later.</p>
              <p>'It's a song that goes out to four million people...We wanted it to
                  be poetic as well as simple, so that aunties and uncles in the coffee
                  shops can sing it as well,' he said.</p>
              <p>The four-minute song started airing on television on Thursday night.</p>
              <p>The performance on Aug 9 will also be the first time Electrico will
                  perform without their keyboardist Amanda Ling, who left the band last
                  month.</p>
              <p>The band members said they hope to give goose pimples when they
                  perform in front of 27,000 spectators and more than a million
                  television viewers.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, show committee chairman Colonel Desmond Tan revealed
                  more about the two-hour production, titled One Show. It will trace the
                  Singapore story from its start as a fishing village to its status as a
                  metropolis today.</p>

              <p><strong>Families of NDP participants get sneak peak of parade at rehearsal</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It was a proud moment for families of those taking
              part in this year's National Day Parade. They were invited for a
              rehearsal of the show on Saturday afternoon.
              <br> <br> But it was safety first as spectators had to walk pass thermal scanners to ensure they were not running a temperature.
              <br> <br> Participants were also checked near the Formula One Pit besides the floating platform.
              <br> <br> These are efforts by the organisers to ensure the H1N1 virus is kept at bay.
              <br> <br>Once the checks were completed, proud parents and siblings managed
              to be one of the first few in the country to get a sneak peak of this
              year's parade. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Month-long events to get more to take part in National Day festivities</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: National Day Parade organisers are already working to build up excitement for the event. 
              <br> <br> It is less than a month to National Day but Singaporeans will not have
              to wait till then to celebrate. This year's parade organisers have
              planned a month's worth of events to kick start the nation's birthday.
              <br> <br>Col Ang Heng, chairman, Sponsorship and Celebrations, National Day
              Parade Committee, said: "We believe National Day belongs to all
              Singaporeans. That's why we want as many Singaporeans as possible to
              participate in and own part of this National Day. <br> <br> "That's why this string of activities will help encourage Singaporeans
              to come on board and participate in the various degrees in different
              ways."
              <br> <br> There will be a series of weekly roadshows at several shopping malls to bring National Day closer to Singaporeans.
              <br> <br>The roadshow will travel to HDB Hub on July 18, Jurong Point on
              July 25, Tampines Central on August 1 and Marina Square on August 8. It
              will include winning entries from the photo contest "Singapore My Home"
              and short film competition "My Pledge".
              <br> <br> Lead-up activities will also be held at the Esplanade and eight community clubs.  
              <br> <br>Koh Tong Seng, chairman, Changi Simei Citizen's Consultative
              Committee, said: "There's limited tickets to go to the Marina platform,
              so we wanted to bring more residents out from their homes to celebrate
              together." <br> <br> Other events include a concert at West Coast Park on August 2 and a
              behind-the-scenes exhibition of the parade. Singapore will also see its
              very first National Day Countdown Party held at Clarke Quay on August
              8. <br> <br> The National Trades Union Congress' Youth Wing will also hold celebrations at the Padang with a candlelight vigil.
              <br> <br> Overseas Singaporeans will be able to join in the action as well. Aside
              from catching the live feed of the parade on Channel NewsAsia's
              international feed, they can log on and create an online avatar to take
              part in the celebrations in a virtual Orchard Road.
              <br> <br> Users will have to register and download software from the </span><a href="http://www.twinity.com/"> website</a><span> before they will be able to access the virtual areas.
              <br> <br>If one cannot physically be at the parade itself, one can take part
              in the Pledge Moment. The Singapore Civil Defence chime will ring at
              8.22pm during the parade to prompt all Singaporeans to recite the
              pledge together as one nation. </span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Some 22,190 primary school students got a preview of this year's National Day Parade. 
              <br> <br> It is one of three National Education shows aimed at developing national cohesion amongst Singaporeans.
              <br> <br> Excitement was in the air as these primary five students from 83 different schools gathered at the Marina Bay floating platform.
              <br> <br> Temperature checks were made before the programme started. 
              <br> <br> But after passing through the thermal scanners, it was clear skies ahead, forming the perfect backdrop for the evening's event. 
              <br> <br> Attendance at the event is a compulsory part of the National Education programme carried out in schools.
              <br> <br> Students were entertained by some 12,000 participants in a three-hour performance.
              <br> <br> This event marks the first of three shows that will be held over the next few weeks leading up to August 9.
              <br> <br> The next two shows will be held on July 18 and 25.

              <br> <br>The flag may also be flown on both private and commercial vehicles
              or on costumes or personal attire during this period, as long as it is
              treated with respect at all times.
              <br> <br>With steps in recent years to allow greater flexibility in the use
              of the national flag, businesses in Singapore are encouraged to fly the
              flag outside their buildings throughout the year.

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">IMH patients help prepare NDP funpacks</span></strong></p>
              <p>Some had wide grins on their faces as they set about their tasks.</p>
              <p>Sitting side by side, they would receive a bag from their neighbour,
              put something inside, and then pass the bag on to the next person.</p>
              <p>It's a simple, but significant task.</p>
              <p>For the first time ever, patients from the Institute of Mental
              Health or IMH are playing a part in the National Day celebrations.</p>
              <p>About 35 of them helped to pack this year's NDP funpacks today.</p>
              <p>According to occupational therapist Teh Chiu Ling, this is one way they can give back to society.</p>
              <p>"Our objective is to get them to engage in meaningful, productive
              activities as well as to contribute to the community and society. This
              gives them a chance to practice some of the skills they have learnt,
              they have been doing regular work to train up their tolerance,
              concentration as well. And also, the chance to pack goodie bags for the
              community also gives them a sense of belonging as well."</p>
              <p>The patients will be preparing up to 500 goodie bags this year.</p>
              <p>And in them will be personal messages written by the patients themselves.</p>
              <p>47 year old Joy is one of those who helped out today.</p>
              <p>She says the packaging made her feel happy and accepted by society.</p>
              <p>"I feel very high, very happy. I feel very proud. I can join them,
              become a group. Not alone, not like last time when we're sick, we
              always feel ourselves very lonely, people don't want us. But now I can
              feel that the country also come out, include us inside. I feel that
              that's very important for us."</p>

              <p><strong>Mark Lee commissioned to host National Day Parade for first time</strong></p>
              <p class="first">It is two weeks to the nation's 44th birthday and
              participants have been heavily engaged in rehearsals. This is the first
              time that local host Mark Lee will be standing on the floating platform
              to host the National Day Parade (NDP). Winner of Project Superstar
              Season One, Kelvin Tan, will also be singing the National Day theme
              song for the first time.</p>
              <p>The NDP costume performance will be divided into 10 chapters this
              year. These 10 chapters will surround the theme of our National Pledge
              to encourage Singaporeans to reflect on its meanings.</p>
              <p>Besides acting in a skit for the parade, Lee will also be hosting the parade with Michelle Chong and Gurmit Singh.</p>
              <p>"Though
              it is not August 9 yet, I can already feel the celebratory atmosphere
              of National Day hanging in the air. Hosting the parade rehearsals has
              been exciting and fun."</p>
              <p>Tan has been commissioned to sing the Mandarin version of the NDP theme song "What Do You See?"</p>
              <p>"This song is very different from the styles I used to do. It is also the first time that I'm doing a rock tune," Tan said.</p>
              <p>Tan will also be singing a medley of classic NDP songs alongside Singapore Idol Season Two finalist Gayle Nerva.</p>
              <p>Tan added, "I'm still feeling pressurized and nervous. But I think I'll enjoy the moments and atmosphere."</p>
              <p>The NDP Preview will be held on August 1.</p>

              <p><strong>Hospice patients join in NDP celebrations for first time</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The National Day Parade's (NDP) National Education
              show on Saturday played host to some very special guests - two
              terminally ill patients watching the parade for the first time.
              <br> <br> But it could also be their last.
              <br> <br> 63-year-old Yeo Sim Bin has never been to the National Day Parade, and he couldn't contain his excitement.
              <br> <br>Yeo balloted for tickets many times in the past, but was not
              successful. And Saturday's family outing is especially poignant for him
              for another reason - he has end-stage lung cancer.
              <br> <br>"This is my last chance already, I think I won't come next year. I
              fear... I'm very excited here, can spend (time) with my family here -
              my daughter, my wife, and my grandson," said Yeo, a patient at HCA
              Hospice Care. <br> <br> Yeo is one of two terminally ill patients from HCA Hospice Care, who
              are invited for the first time to join in the celebrations to mark
              Singapore's 44 years of independence.
              <br> <br> Another is Madam Daniar Zainudin, who has breast cancer.
              <br> <br> Despite the July heat, she was determined to have a good time with her children and grandchildren.
              <br> <br>It is Madam Daniar's first time attending the National Day Parade,
              and to mark the occasion, she and her daughter went out shopping on
              Friday night to get a brand new outfit - red blouse, red scarf, and a
              red clapper to cheer on the Red Lions.
              <br> <br> As the show went on, the joy on both Yeo and Daniar's faces made it clear - this was surely a night to remember. </span></p>

              <p>Roads around the Marina Bay area will be closed to traffic to
              facilitate the preview show this Saturday as well as the National Day
              Parade.</p>
              <p>They include Republic Boulevard, Raffles Avenue and Esplanade Drive.</p>
              <p>Its also to facilitate this year's city march past that will happen between 7pm and 9pm.</p>
              <p>Police advise motorists to plan their routes and if possible, take
              public transport, as traffic congestion is expected at the event venue
              and surrounding roads.</p>
              <p>Head Operations of Traffic Police Department, Super Intendant Chua Chee Wai, explains.</p>
              <p>"Traffic police have actually put advisories signs mounted on the
              lamp posts, that would help motorists in their planning as well. We
              also like to advise motorists against stopping or slowing down along
              the ECP Benjamin Sheares Bridge to watch the fireworks. It's very
              dangerous and also causes congestions."</p>
              <p>Security and crowd management measures will also be put in place.</p>
              <p>Assistant Director of Police's Operations Department, Marc E, says personal belongings will be checked.</p>
              <p>"To speed up security checks, members of the public are advised not
              to bring large bags or prohibited items such as canned products or
              lighters resembling a gun or bullet. Travel light. Don't bring too many
              things, so we don't have too many things to check."</p>
              <p>More than 100 thousand people are expected to crowd the Marina Bay area on the day of the parade.</p>
              <p>Police say they will deploy 1,200 personnel for crowd control.</p>
              <p>If for any reason, the Preview and NDP is postponed to 2nd and 15th August, similar arrangements would apply.</p>

              <p>The organisers of this year’s National Day Parade are inviting Singaporeans to join in the Pledge Moment.</p>
              <p>They’re encouraging Singaporeans to spend 30 seconds to recite the
              Pledge, reflect on its meaning and reaffirm our commitment to the
              nation on its 44th birthday.</p>
              <p>To make the moment, the Singapore Civil Defence Force will sound the
              chime though its islandwide public warning system at 8.22pm on the 9th
              of August.</p>
              <p>As a key partner, MediaCorp is leveraging on its many media
              platforms and star power, to get Singaporeans to come together and say
              the Pledge - with one voice.</p>
              <p>From tomorrow, television and radio trailers, print and online ads
              on The Pledge Moment will be shown across MediaCorp's multiple
              platforms.</p>
              <p>Radio deejays will also be talking about The Pledge Moment and the National Day Parade during their shows.</p>
              <p>For the first time during National Day, MediaCorp's 12 radio
              stations will stop its regular programmes before 8.22pm, to bring The
              Pledge Moment to listeners - wherever they are.</p>
              <p>People on-the-go can also join in The Pledge Moment by catching the
              National Day Parade show on MediaCorp's TV Mobile and certain digital
              outdoor screens operated by MediaCorp.</p>
              <p>MediaCorp will be bringing the National Day Parade show "live" on
              its television channels, radio stations and a specially created
              microsite as a live streaming site.</p>

              <p><strong>NDP organisers promise surprises for audience during aerial display segment</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The aerial display is one of the most highly
              anticipated portions of the National Day Parade. And organisers are
              promising a show to remember this year, with some surprises thrown in
              as well.
              <br> <br> The Black Knights were a big hit last year, delighting crowds with their precision moves and their sweet salute to the nation.
              <br> <br>But this time, the elite aerobatics team from the Republic of
              Singapore Air Force won't be making an appearance. Instead, the
              traditional bomb burst will be executed by three regular F-16s,
              swooping in at 800 kilometres an hour.
              <br> <br>And for the first time, against the fading daylight, the pilots
              will switch on their after-burners, revealing rings of blue behind the
              aircraft.
              <br> <br>The upcoming Integrated Resort and other Marina Bay developments
              form quite a spectacular backdrop to this year's aerial display. But
              with all this construction activity going on, much of it in the last 12
              months, show planners had to make sure that none of the buildings or
              cranes pose any danger to the pilots.
              <br> <br> This year's aerial display will also see the return of familiar crowd pleasers, the Red Lions.
              <br> <br> And in the Total Defence Display segment, a Chinook hovers just three metres above the Singapore River.
              <br> <br>But organisers said the chopper steers clear of lands at all times,
              so spectators get the thrills and perhaps some spills without any
              danger.
              <br> <br>Lt-Colonel Joachim Lee, chairman, Air Participation, NDP 2009,
              said: "When the winds are a little bit stronger and at the right
              direction, at times you will get a little bit of a spray. I think most
              the audience will be okay with that. I guess it gives a little bit of
              atmosphere to NDP itself, it is part of the experience, sensory
              experience for the audience."
              <br> <br>But for some, nothing beats the sight of the Singapore flag borne
              by a single Chinook, escorted by a trio of Apache helicopters. It is a
              symbol of the nation and its people. </span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's four self-help groups (SHGs) got together
              on Monday as part of the Joint SHGs National Day Celebrations 2009.
              <br> <br>They are the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC),
              Eurasian Association (EA), Singapore Indian Development Association
              (SINDA) and Yayasan MENDAKI.
              <br> <br>Reflecting on this year's National Day theme, around 180 staff,
              beneficiaries and volunteers from the four groups recited the pledge in
              the four official languages.
              <br> <br> The "Celebrating Cohesive Diversity" project was also revealed.
              <br> <br> Each art piece was inspired by each different ethnic community's uniqueness.
              <br> <br>Minister, Prime Minister’s Office, Lim Swee Say, said: "This
              celebration is a timely reminder for us that in many other countries,
              being multi-racial, being multi-religious can be a weakness for them.
              But in Singapore, we actually turned this multi-racial society of
              Singapore into our uniqueness, into our strength." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Flyer among popular spots to catch NDP</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The National Day Parade show is one of the most highly
              anticipated events of the year. If you haven't got your ticket, don't
              worry – there are plenty of other spots to catch a view of this year's
              show. </span></p>
              <p><span> Besides the Marina Bay parade area, one could also catch the visual
              feast of aerial acrobatics and colourful costumes from Fullerton Hotel,
              Marina Square and the Esplanade. </span></p>
              <p><span>Some Singaporeans said many of the hotels around the Marina Bay area offer unparalleled views of the show.
              <br> <br> But if a room with a view is a little out of your budget, you won't
              have to go far to find another alternative – just turn on your
              television set and watch the live telecast at home.
              <br> <br> However, if you really want to soak in the atmosphere, going around in circles could be your best bet.
              <br> <br>Patsy Ong, managing director, Adval Brand Group, said: "The
              Singapore Flyer is probably the best place to view the National Day
              Parade. The floating platform is so near us and because it is also a
              moving venue, at every altitude, when the capsule moves, you look at
              different things."
              <br> <br>Many Singaporeans would agree that the higher you go, the better
              the view. With the fireworks being one of the parade's highlights,
              taking a ride on the Singapore Flyer will ensure that National Day will
              be celebrated with a brilliant difference.
              <br> <br>The Singapore Flyer said it has received more than 1,400 advance
              bookings so far. It expects up to 20 per cent of its customers to
              pre-book their tickets.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: This year's National Day Parade (NDP) will feature its first 21-gun salute on water. </span></p>
              <p><span> Organisers decided to move the gun salute from land to water to bring
              it closer to the audience. It is now 200 metres away from the gallery. </span></p>
              <p><span> Those taking part in the gun salute have to go through additional training since April as they have to operate in a small area. </span></p>
              <p><span> To look into the safety aspects, medics will be on the floating
              platform while lifeguards will be on standby should anyone fall into
              the water. </span></p>
              <p><span> The gunmen will also have to start moving the five canons onto the floating platform from noon. </span></p>
              <p><span> Gun positioning commander for National Day Parade 2009, Lieutenant
              Kelvin Soh, said: "The most difficult part will have to be the
              additional hours that we spent on bringing the guns up the M3G (the
              floating platform) because they are bulky and definitely we need a lot

              <p>Two new fireworks effects will be displayed during the National Day Parade this year.</p>
              <p>The Fireworks Committee of NDP09 expects the crowd to be bowled over by the fireworks show.</p>
              <p><em>Saifulbahri Ismail</em> reports.</p>
              <p>Shutter bugs, get out your cameras.</p>
              <p>There will be fire in the sky, as Marina Bay is lit once more with a
              colourful, dazzling spectacle of fireworks this National Day.</p>
              <p>It's arguably the most anticipated segment of the parade.</p>
              <p>And Chairman of the Fireworks Committee, Lieutenant Colonel Tham Tiem Foo has a few surprises in store :</p>
              <p>"So for NDP 2009, there's two new effects that we're bringing in.
              One is a red coloured double heart, and the other one is actually a
              silver star. So, these effects will actually be released at the tail
              end of the theme song, and a little bit after the pledge."</p>
              <p>The fireworks will be fired from three barges anchored around Marina Bay.</p>
              <p>Each will be firing different effects :</p>
              <p>"Right behind at the tail end of he stage there's two mid-level
              barges. Those barges will be firing what we call multiple-short kicks
              to give you the fan effects. And last but not least there's the high
              level barge, it's anchored at the centre of Marina Bay. Those are the
              ones that will give you the high level shell effects and that's where
              the double heart and silver star will be firing from."</p>
              <p>Spectators will only get to enjoy two and a half minutes of the display.</p>
              <p>Too short?</p>
              <p>Lieutenant Colonel Tham says the quality of the show doesn't depend on its duration :</p>
              <p>"Its actually not the amount that you fire, it's how the effect is
              being fired upon and how it actually blend in and complement the show
              that gives you the desired effect that will wow the audience. That's
              more important. The duration sometimes don't really give you the wow
              factor, it's actually how you complement the effect that the creative
              director wanted to come out of the show."</p>
              <p>Besides the main fireworks, the crowd can expect pyrotechnics display throughout the NDP show.</p>

              <p><strong>A cappella, mass chorale singing at NDP 2009</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The National Day Parade (NDP 2009) on Sunday at Marina
                  Bay will kick off with a performance that will get the audience in the
                  festive mood.
                  <br> <br>Cheerleaders, who are students from the various Institute of
                  Education (ITE) campuses, will open the pre-parade segment of the show
                  to the tune of funky music.
                  <br> <br> During the parade, these cheerleaders will also guide the audience in some interactive game segments.
                  <br> <br> And it's not just all dance. There will also be an "a cappella" rendition of the National Anthem.
                  <br> <br> Besides the "a cappella" performance, there will also be mass chorale singing.
                  <br> <br>For the first time, more than 300 participants from the Singapore
                  Dikir Barat Federation will be taking part in the mass chorale singing.
                  <br> <br> That will open the second chapter of the NDP 2009 show.
                  <br> <br>"Selamat Datang" or "welcome".....the leader of the group will
                  start the "call" at the beginning of the segment before everyone joins
                  in, singing in unison.
                  <br> <br> This performance reflects the warmth of the Malay community in welcoming the  immigrants centuries ago.
                  <br> <br>The Singapore Dikir Barat Federation was invited by the NDP 2009
                  EXCO as early as November last year to take part in the NDP, and
                  rehearsals started since March at several army camps before moving to
                  the actual NDP venue.
                  <br> <br>From the fireworks to the NDP goodie bags and even the logistics,
                  everything is made possible with the contributions of sponsors.
                  <br> <br>Despite the economic meltdown, the number of sponsors for this
                  year's NDP is still comparable to those of last year's. In fact, some
                  have increased their sponsorship by some 20 percent.
                  <br> <br> And, the NDP organising committee said it managed to secure some dedicated sponsors.
                  <br> <br>Colonel Ang Heng, chairman of sponsorship &amp; celebrations,
                  National Day Parade Committee, said: "In this financial climate, I
                  think it's particularly valuable and particularly heartwarming to find
                  our long-term sponsors who continue to support us. In some cases, some
                  even (contributed) more than what they used to. It's significant... (to
                  see) how they really believe in NDP, and how they see it as a
                  meaningful role to bring a good birthday celebration to their fellow
                  Singaporeans."
                  <br> <br>It may be the economic downturn now and budgets for National Day
                  decorations in the heartlands may have shrunk - some by as much as 70
                  percent - but celebrations have not been dampened.
                  <br> <br>In one neighbourhood, recycled materials like water bottles and
                  compact discs were used as decorations. These water bottles are lit at
                  night, using bulbs to brighten them up.

              Floating Platform.
              <br> <br>Over 27,000 people watched the NDP from the parade stands while

              <br> <br>In the early part of the show, three F-16s swooped across the bay
              in what is known as the salute to the nation, wowing the crowd.
              <br> <br>There was also a thrilling police boat chase on the Singapore River
              just metres away from the crowd, and some spills too - literally - with
              a Chinook flying low over the water.
              <br> <br> Then it was all eyes on the skies as the audience caught the freefallers parachuting down to the parade ground.
              <br> <br> Pomp and ceremony came in the more formal part of the show, with the 
              <br> guard-of-honour inspection by President SR Nathan as well as the 21-gun salute.
              <br> <br>There was also a march past that for the first time saw contingents
              marching along a 3.2km stretch of road and past famous city landmarks
              just outside the bayfront area.
              <br> <br>In addition, a staple at these annual shows - cultural performances
              to underscore the country's multi-ethnic mix, but with enough twists to
              keep the crowd entertained.
              <br> <br>And what's a party without music? Local rock band Electrico
              performed their special composition for the occasion "What Do You
              See?".
              <br> <br>Then in a special moment for a country which has been through some
              turbulent times this year, the bayfront turned silent at exactly 8.22pm
              for the participants to recite the national pledge.
              <br> <br>It was the exact moment when organisers hoped, for the first time,
              all Singaporeans - even those outside the parade ground - would stop
              what they were doing to put their hand on their heart and recite the
              pledge.
              <br> <br>Following that was an explosive finale to the parade as the
              brilliant fireworks display lit up the skies and dazzled the audience.
              <br> <br> Singaporeans weren't the only ones celebrating the country's 44th birthday.
              <br> <br> Tourists and expatriates were also at the NDP party, and they were impressed.
              <br> <br> "This is on a very big scale compared to local carnivals....." said a British woman.
              <br> <br> "I like how everyone's here for one cause.....there are so many different races," said an American man.
              <br> <br> The parade may be over but the party has only just begun for many others.
              <br> <br>In fact, hundreds of performers were dancing the night away, and
              they've got every reason to celebrate, having put on such a great show
              - full of colour, music and action.
