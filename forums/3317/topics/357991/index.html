              <p>Even though dark clouds still hangs over the economy, the National
                  Day Parade celebrations this year will be a good and meaningful one.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the first NDP 2009 media briefing, chairman of the
                  executive committee Brigadier General Tan Chuan Jin promises it will
                  still be a solid show for Singaporeans to enjoy.</p>
              <p><em>Saifulbahri Ismail</em> with this report :</p>
              <p>It will not be a 'cheap' NDP show that Singapore will see on the 9th of August.</p>
              <p>While keeping mum on the cost of this year's parade, BG Tan indicated that it wouldn't be something down to 'bare bones'.</p>
              <p>Still, the committee is aware of the difficult economic situation and will be prudent and measured in managing costs.</p>
              <p>BG Tan underlined that the NDP celebration is another opportunity to rally Singaporeans in a time of crisis :</p>
              <p>"Singapore deserves to have a good and meaningful NDP celebrations.
                  I think that we should not stop because we have an economic crisis.
                  It's important for us to ask ourselves, what price to you attach to
                  your independence, what price do you attach to your celebrations. This
                  is a celebration for our people, and it's important that it's
                  meaningful for our people, and that's something we're commited to
                  doing."</p>
              <p>To make the celebrations more meaningful, the theme for this year's
                  NDP 'Come Together - Reaching Out, Reaching Up' revolves around the
                  Pledge.</p>
              <p>It's a testimony of the spirit and character of all Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>According to BG Tan, the focal point of the celebration will be the Pledge Moment :</p>
              <p>"For all Singaporeans at that point on national day itself, after
                  the parade and show winds down to a close, at that point when we take
                  our pledge, I think it can be quite a special and magical moment for us
                  to do that."</p>
              <p>For the first time, the NDP committee is also looking at revamping the parade and show format.</p>
              <p>Without letting the cat out of the bag, here's what BG Tan said the public can expect :</p>
              <p>"This year the show and parade is integrated as one show, where the
                  show will actually commence and then the parade will come in and then
                  the rest of it will unfold. The presidential gun salute also, I won't
                  talk about how it's going to be done, but it's definitely in a way
                  which has never been done before and I think that will be quite
                  impressive."</p>
              <p>The NDP Parade and show will also start an hour later at 6 pm, so that more lighting effects can be used.</p>
              <p>Also, the committee will be using the new media in a big way.</p>
              <p>The NDP website was launched today, where the public can register online to customise their own NDP Homepage.</p>
              <p>It will also use other platforms such as Facebook, Flickr and YouTube.</p>

              <p>To reporters during a media briefing at the floating platform at
                  Marina Bay, Brigadier-General Tan Chuan-Jin, chairman of this year's
                  organising committee, said costs would be managed, but that 'the bells
                  and whistles will still be there'.</p>
              <p>The 44th National Day Parade will be orchestrated by his team
                  - the army's Third Division - to the theme of 'Come Together, Reaching
                  Out, Reaching Up'.</p>
              <p>They are managing costs by recycling some props and even trimming the size of the stage.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Singapore deserves to have a good and meaningful
                  National Day celebration and should not stop because of the economic
                  crisis.'</p>
              <p>They are also trying to engage Singapore's different and
                  diverse communities online to generate hype leading up to the Marina
                  Bay celebrations on Aug 9, by using new media such as Facebook,
                  Twitter, Flickr and YouTube.</p>
              <p>Facebook group, NDPeeps, created by the organisers on April
                  7, has more than 3,400 members. And the official NDP website,
                  www.ndp.org.sg, launched yesterday, will contain microsites and online
                  forums to get people to post their views.</p>
              <p>Organisers are hoping to solicit views and reflections about National Day, in line with this year's parade theme.</p>
              <p>'Every voice matters and we are going out in a big way to get
                  everyone to play their part to make the celebrations meaningful,' said
                  BG Tan.</p>
              <p>His goal is to get Singaporeans to remember how far the nation has come since its independence in 1965.</p>

              <p><strong>Stage setup for NDP 2009 allows spectators to get closer to performers</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A new stage setup at this year's National Day Parade
              will allow spectators to get up close and personal with performers.
              <br> <br> The theme of this year's National Day Parade is come together, reaching out, reaching up.
              <br> <br> Organisers are taking the theme quite literally by moving the stage 20 metres forward and some nine storeys upwards.
              <br> <br> But performers won't be seen on the floating platform as it will be used as a holding area instead.
              <br> <br>The show will be moved up four metres up above the original
              floating platform stage. Other changes also include a new performance
              grid and an LED screen.
              <br> <br>The cubic grid consists of two portions, each measuring eight cubes
              high and seven cubes wide. Each grid is six storeys high and will be
              equipped with three scene-changing screens.
              <br> <br> Performers can switch from scene to scene with a simple pull of the blinds.
              <br> <br> The LED screen located between the grids will project images in tandem with the performances. 
              <br> <br> The stage structure is about 80 per cent complete.
              <br> <br> When ready, it can hold 1,500 people.
              <br> <br> Organisers said ensuring the safety of the performers is a priority.
              <br> <br>LTC Peter Tay, chairman, Infrastructure and Decoration, National
              Day Parade 2009, said: "They are equipped with a safety harness hooked
              on to a secured tow line. And for every two grids, there is a safety
              officer to look out for them."
              <br> <br> Organisers have also put in place several measures to deal with wet weather conditions.
              <br> <br>Randy Tan, architect, National Day Parade 2009, said: "As a
              standard operating procedure, for example like staircases, places like
              ramps, there is this non-slip component added to it. So that's one way
              we look at dealing with weather."
              <br> <br> The new stage will have three more entrances to allow performers to make a dramatic entrance. </span></p>

              <p><strong>National Day Parade bag to appeal to all</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: What's a National Day Parade without a funpack? This
              year, the bag which holds the goodies promises to be one that will
              appeal to all.
              <br> <br>This year's National Day Parade bag is a versatile two-in-one bag
              with a detachable flap, which will turn it from a messenger bag into a
              tote bag. <br> <br> LTC Chow Wai Yein, chairman of logistics and finance for the National
              Day Parade 2009, said: "It took some time because when we were doing
              our research, these two bags actually came up to be very popular. We
              took some time to decide whether is it (going to be) one or the other.
              And finally some inspiration struck us and we decided that (the two
              designs) should be combined into one." <br> <br> Parade-goers will be spoilt for choice as the bags come in eight colours. 
              <br> <br> To raise awareness and funds to support the less fortunate, there is
              also a special edition National Day Parade bag. So if you want to do
              your bid for charity, you can contribute S$15 for a special edition
              bag. All proceeds will go to the Community Chest.
              <br> <br> Some 10,000 of the special edition bags will be available and the Community Chest hopes to raise S$150,000. 
              <br> <br>Tan Puay Kern, a member of the Community Chest, said: I'm sure
              Singaporeans are generous. Recently we had the True Hearts show, and
              despite the economic situation, we managed to reach our target, in fact
              a surplus of our target. So I'm sure that Singaporeans will continue to
              be generous despite the economic downturn, and they will continue to
              care for the beneficiaries and help us raise the much-needed funds, so
              that our beneficiaries can continue to lead an independent and
              meaningful life.”
              <br> <br>Some of the funpacks will also be packed by volunteers from
              voluntary welfare organisations under the Community Chest. The
              Institute of Mental Health and the Yellow Ribbon Project will also be
              involved.
              <br> <br> As in previous years, goodies that will be contained in the bags include drinks and snacks. 
              <br> <br>Also in the bags are interactive items such as a heart-shaped
              lantern and a hand-shaped drum which will be used during the parade. <br> <br> In support of the global green movement, organisers also ensured that
              plastic packaging has been reduced. They are also working with a
              partner to recycle the interactive items.

              <p><strong>Presidential Gun Salute on water one of the highlights of NDP 2009</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Spectators can expect the action at this year's National Day Parade to be much closer than in previous years.
              <br> <br> For the first time, the Presidential Gun Salute will be held on water - in full view of spectators in and around Marina Bay. 
              <br> <br> Previously, the gun salute was done out of sight, within the Singapore Flyer area. 
              <br> <br> Colonel Chee Wai Mun, chairman, Parade &amp; Ceremony Committee, NDP
              2009, elaborated: "This idea of bringing the 21-gun salute to the bay
              was first mooted and discussed, and we experimented with it and it was
              do-able. So this concept was really new, and when we thought about
              where to site this 21-gun salute, we realised that the backdrop of the
              Merlion and One Fullerton is really a majestic site. And that was how
              it came about."
              <br> <br> The floating platform carrying the guns will sail into position and stop about 200 metres away from the gallery. 
              <br> <br>Some safety precautions that will be taken include ensuring that
              the spectators nearby are in no danger and that the noise level is
              within limits.
              <br> <br>Major Karen Wong, the first woman officer to be put in charge of
              the gun salute, will be there to make sure everything will be smooth
              sailing.
              <br> <br> One key challenge she faces is to ensure that the floating platform stays in position. 
              <br> <br>Major Wong, chairman, Presidential Gun Salute Committee, NDP 2009,
              explained: "The floating platform is actually controlled by two
              operators - one on the left and one on the right - and it requires a
              lot of skills just to keep the entire platform in position because the
              intent is to use Merlion and One Fullerton as the backdrop." <br> <br> Another highlight is the 23 marching contingents which will enter from five different directions onto the stage.
              <br> <br> And to bring the National Day Parade show closer to Singaporeans, a new
              city march-pass segment will be introduced. The marching contingents
              will move out from the Float@Marina to the city, where they will march
              along a 3.2-km stretch of road. <br> <br> The marching contingents will take a route around the Esplanade and
              will pass landmarks like the Merlion, the Old Supreme Court and the
              City Hall. <br> <br> And although the Black Knights will not be taking part this year,
              spectators can look forward to other exciting aerial displays - with
              the F-16s promising to create a feat that will cause a stir with the
              crowds below.
              <br> <br> The aerial display will also be closer to the spectators at Marina Bay.
              <br> <br> Lieutenant Colonel Yeong Chee Meng is this year's Parade Commander. </span></p>

              <p>This year's National Day Parade will have a special addition - bright yellow ribbons.</p>
              <p>For parade goers, look out for them in your funpacks.</p>
              <p>For home viewers, catch it on your TV screens.</p>
              <p>35,000 National Day funpacks will contain these ribbons and parade
              goers will be encouraged to wear them to show support for prison
              inmates, ex-offenders and their families.</p>
              <p>The funpacks containing the ribbons have been put together by 88 inmates from Tanah Merah Prison.</p>
              <p>It's the first time they're doing so under the Yellow Ribbon Project.</p>
              <p>The project, started in 2004, as an initiative to create awareness
              and support for the rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-offenders.</p>
              <p>Leonie Tan, Manager of Community Reintegration and Partnerships:</p>
              <p>"The theme for the Yellow Ribbon Project this year is to get our
              inmates to give back to society. This little thing that we do doesn't
              take us a lot of effort yet it gives our prisoners a sense of ownership
              that they too can in their own way, play their part to contribute back
              to society. And hopefully Singapore will remember that there's actually
              a group of prisoners who're also part of the larger society in general."</p>
              <p>One of the 88 inmates, Ronald, who put together the funpacks says
              he's happy his bosses trusted him enough to take charge of inventory.</p>
              <p>"Doing inventory I must have zero error on this because I've to
              report to the officer taking down the stock, so I feel the officer
              trusts in me. I feel very encouraged. I just want to tell them that
              we're also someone who can be trusted. It's only that we showed love in
              the wrong way - all these mistakes we've done, some of the mistakes are
              done out of love. I just want to say we're sorry for what we've done
              and I hope that this NDP parade we're taking part in, we'll be able to
              earn their trust. "</p>

              the Home Team in defending Singapore.</p>
              <p>The fast-paced and action-packed show will start with smoke flooding
              the stage, followed by the Singapore Police Force rushing in to secure
              to area.</p>
              <p>The performance promises to be a three-dimensional experience, topped with pyrotechnics, sound effects, videos and music.</p>
              <p>Chairman of the Total Defence Display, Simon Lee, elaborates.</p>
              <p>"We have aerial component, involving the Apache and Chinook
              helicopters. We also have a water segment, whereby the Chinook will
              come down low to drop the divers into the water. We also have a boat
              chase, jointly executed by the Police Coast Guard as well as the Navy
              to intercept unknown intruders that are approaching the Marina Bay
              area. And on the land component, you have armoured columns and a lot of
              SAF vehicles that will be positioned along the promenade."</p>
              <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Lee also hopes that through the Total Defence
              Display, Singaporeans will be reminded of the need for community
              involvement.</p>
              <p>"This is also the 25th year of Total Defence, and since the economy
              is going through a rough patch, they are in line with NDP's theme this
              year of "Come Together". I thought it was timely to use this as an
              avenue to get Singaporeans from all walks of life to come together. And
              this is actually signified in the concept of Total Defence."</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">A seamless NDP show</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>The National Day Parade this year will be woven together as a single show.</p>
              <p>The One Show concept, never done before, brings together the various
              segments of the NDP, including the traditional Parade and Ceremony to
              create a unified storyline for the audience.</p>
              <p>For the first time also, the theme song is composed and performed by local band, Electrico.</p>
              <p>That's the theme song for NDP09 titled "What Do You See?" by Electrico.</p>
              <p>It's a question directed at Singaporeans, a rousing call to look beyond today, and reflect on the future.</p>
              <p>Lead singer and guitarist of Electrico, David Tan, felt priviledged
              and honoured to be able to contribute this song to the nation.</p>
              <p>He tells what inspired him to write it :</p>
              <p>"I decided to write a song that was empowering. Instead of a 'Stand
              Up For Singapore', where you tell people what to do, it's more of a
              song that challenges people. Empowers them in the sense that, let them
              know the future is in their hands and challenges them to ask themselves
              what do they see for themselves in the future. And I think it tied in
              very nicely with the whole concept."</p>
              <p>The concept this year is to integrate the Parade and show segments
              as one seamless flow through 10 chapters of a story, each based on an
              excerpt of the Pledge.</p>
              <p>Colonel Desmond Tan is the Chairman of NDP09 Show Committee :</p>
              <p>"This year we tried to integrate the whole thing so that it is
              seamless and the message can be conveyed in a more integrated and
              coherent manner.</p>
              <p>Integrating the segments is a challenge for the show's Creative Director, Ivan Heng.</p>
              <p>"I felt that I really wanted to create a show that was closer to the
              hearts and home. I felt that last year's show was good, but I felt it
              was a bit distant. I think it just comes down to this idea of
              belonging. Feeling that we are part of something greater than
              ourselves."</p>
              <p>Organisers hope the show would help Singaporeans reflect on the
              obstacles they've overcome, and view the future with hope and optimism.</p>
              <p>First time highlights also include a mobile combined schools choir,
              puppets arriving on large boats and performers on large high-rise grids.</p>
