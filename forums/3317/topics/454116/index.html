              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>BEIJING - China on Saturday launched its most ambitious space 
              mission to date, sending its first female astronaut to the final 
              frontier and bidding to achieve the country's first manual space 
              docking.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Shenzhou-9 -- 
              China's fourth manned space mission -- launched at 6:37 pm (1037 GMT) 
              from the remote Gobi desert in the nation's northwest, state television 
              pictures showed.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The crew was headed 
              by Jing Haipeng, a veteran astronaut who had gone to space twice 
              already. Liu Wang, who has been in the space programme for 14 years, 
              will be in charge of manual docking manoeuvres.<br><br>Meanwhile Liu 
              Yang, 33, who has created a stir in the media and online for becoming 
              China's first woman to travel to space, will conduct aerospace medical 
              experiments and other space tests.<br><br>At a pre-departure ceremony 
              broadcast on state TV Wu Bangguo, chairman of the National People's 
              Congress, told the crew: "The country and the people are looking forward
               to your successful return."<br><br>The mission will last 13 days, 
              during which the crew will perform experiments and the manual space 
              docking -- a highly technical procedure that brings two vessels together
               in high speed orbit.<br><br>Successful completion of the rendezvous 
              between the Shenzhou-9 ("Divine Vessel") and the Tiangong-1 ("Heavenly 
              Palace") module already in orbit will take China a step closer to 
              setting up its own space station in 2020.<br><br>The Asian powerhouse 
              achieved a similar docking in November last year, but that mission was 
              unmanned and the procedure was conducted remotely from Earth.<br><br>"The
               manual space rendezvous... is a huge test for astronauts' ability to 
              judge spatial position, eye-hand coordination and psychological 
              abilities," Jing told reporters ahead of the launch.<br><br>He added 
              that the trio would work well together after months of intense training 
              that saw them rehearse the mission some 16 hours a day.<br><br>"One glance, one facial expression, one movement... we understand each other thoroughly," he said.<br><br>The
               team have rehearsed the procedure more than 1,500 times in simulations,
               Wu Ping, spokeswoman for China's manned space programme, told 
              reporters.<br><br>But more than the upcoming challenge, it is the 
              inclusion in the crew of Liu Yang -- a trained pilot and major in the 
              People's Liberation Army who began astronaut training two years ago -- 
              that has captivated China's people.<br><br>China sent its first person 
              into space in 2003 and has since conducted several manned missions, the 
              latest in 2008, but had never yet included a woman.<br><br>Liu's mission
               made China the third country after the Soviet Union and United States 
              to send a woman into space using its own technology.<br><br>China sees 
              its space programme as a symbol of its global stature, growing technical
               expertise, and the Communist Party's success in turning around the 
              fortunes of the once poverty-stricken nation.<br><br>An editorial in the
               state-run Global Times newspaper on Saturday said that China needed to 
              "cement its strategic gains made during the years," which called for "a 
              stronger presence in outer space".<br><br>"The three astronauts aboard Shenzhou-9 personify China's long-term space aspirations," it added.<br><br>A
               white paper released last December outlined China's long-term ambitions
               to "conduct studies on the preliminary plan for a human lunar landing".<br><br>The
               current programme aims to provide China with a space station in which a
               crew can live independently for several months, as at the old Russian 
              Mir facility or the International Space Station.<br><br>- AFP/ck</span></span></p>
