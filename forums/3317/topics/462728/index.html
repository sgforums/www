              Today's headline  DBS buying building in Marina Bay area financial district woh!  Spending  a billion woh!  BUT.... BUT.... But.... wasn't just a  few years ago when banks were urged by the authorities to divest their real estate holdings/ investments?  Wasn't the DBS towers in Shenton way sold then? Someone said that owning real estate  is not the CORE business of banks  and banks should be in the business of banking not real estate?  True or not? So  another U-turn hah ?

              <p><span class="web_ticker">DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS)</span> agreed to
              buy a 30 percent stake in Singapore’s Marina Bay Financial
              Centre Tower 3, where the move of its headquarters was completed
              in October, for S$1.04 billion ($850 million) in cash.</p>
              <p>DBS, Southeast Asia’s biggest lender, will buy the stake
              from a joint venture of <span class="web_ticker">Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.</span> and <span class="web_ticker">Cheung Kong
              Holdings Ltd.</span>, it said in a statement today. The two companies
              are both controlled by Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest man.</p>
              <p>Expansion by banks, including Standard Chartered Plc and
              Barclays Plc, are driving office demand in Singapore as the
              city-state emerges as Asia’s center of wealth management.
              Singapore’s office rent may see “meaningful recovery” in the
              second half of 2014 after a decline this year, according to
              broker property Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc.</p>
              <p>The transaction “could serve as a leading example showing
              investors are positive on the commercial property sector,”
              Ronald Wan, a Hong Kong-based managing director at China
              Merchants Securities Co., said by telephone today. “Investors
              will generally buy a commercial property when the price is very
              attractive or when they think it will be a good investment. For
              DBS, I think it’s the latter one.”</p>
              <p>Winnie Cheong, a spokeswoman for Cheung Kong in Hong Kong,
              and Hans Leung, a spokesman for Hutchison Whampoa, didn’t
              immediately return calls from Bloomberg News seeking comments on
              the transaction. Li is 12th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index
              with a net worth of $27.9 billion.</p>
              <h2>Financial District</h2>
              <p>Singapore is building a new financial district on reclaimed
              land in the Marina Bay area, adjacent to the Marina Bay Sands
              hotel, casino, shopping and conference development. DBS is a so-
              called anchor tenant in the building that was completed this
              year, with 4,800 of its employees occupying 600,000 square feet
              on 18 of the tower’s 46 floors. Other tenants include legal
              firms WongPartnership LLP and Clifford Chance LLP.</p>
              <p>“This transaction represents a unique opportunity for DBS
              to acquire a sizeable stake in its global headquarters and
              better manage its occupancy costs in the long term,” DBS said
              in the statement. “It also demonstrates DBS’ firm commitment to
              its home base as it further entrenches its leadership position
              in Singapore and the region.”</p>
              <p>The Cheung Kong-Hutchison Whampoa venture currently owns
              one-third of the tower, which is part of the Marina Bay
              Financial Centre development, according to the statement. DBS
              has the right to buy the remaining 3.3 percent owned by the
              venture for S$115 million.</p>
              <p>The remaining two-thirds of Marina Bay Financial Centre
              Tower 3 are equally owned by a subsidiary of Hongkong Land
              International Holdings Ltd. and a subsidiary of Keppel Land
              Properties Pte, according to the statement.</p>

              My question is still not answered....IS THIS A U-TURN?  
              
              Didn' t the Authorities say that  focus and concentrate on their "CORE" business and use their capital  for that purpose rather than in property investments? Wasn't then the fact that others bank like OCBC   and others  were to concentrate on core business and not in property( not their core business right?)
              Doesn't make sense to ask them to sell and to concentrate on banking business only, and  now  to say  "oh better buy  again"...Strange!
