              <p><strong>No Singaporeans on board skidded Thai jet</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on
              Tuesday that no Singaporeans were on board a Bangkok Airways jet, which
              skidded and hit an old control tower as it landed on Thailand's resort
              island of Ko Samui.
              <br> <br>"Our Embassy in Bangkok has been informed by Bangkok Airways that
              there are no Singaporeans on board the flight," an MFA spokesperson
              said.
              <br> <br>Thai aviation authorities confirmed that flight PG266 pilot
              Chartchai Pansuwan was killed and nine passengers were injured - seven
              seriously. <br> <br> It was earlier reported that 42 people were injured in the crash and taken to several hospitals in the province.
              <br> <br> There were 68 passengers and four crew on board the 70-seater ATR-72,
              which was flying from the southwestern tourist town of Krabi to Ko
              Samui in the Gulf of Thailand.
              <br> <br>Thai television showed footage of the crash as the airplane
              ploughed into the old control tower that had been converted into a fire
              station, housing fire trucks. <br> <br> Police Colonel Saharat Saksilchai said it had been raining at the time of the crash.
              <br> <br> Bangkok Airways said the foreign passengers on that flight were from
              Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain and Switzerland.
