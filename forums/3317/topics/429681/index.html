              <p>Liyana Dhamirah, 24, says she and her husband Fazli bin Mohd  
              Jailani, 31, and their three young children lived in a tent on the  
              beach in Singapore for four months in 2009 when their Housing  
              Development Board flat was repossessed as they were unable to service  
              their mortgage loan.</p>
              <p>The  Singapore government provides subsidized housing via the Board 
              to its  citizens. Liyana and Fazli now share a rented flat with another 
              family.</p>
              <p>"It's unfair. I'm a Singaporean, yet I'm not benefiting at all from how rich Singapore has become."</p>
              <p>Liyana  and Fazli say they earn a combined S$800 ($652) a month but 
              have been unable to  make ends meet. "Sometimes I can't even afford a 
              S$1 ($0.80) ice cream  cone for my kids," says Fazli, a former mechanic 
              apprentice, who is now  unemployed and depends on the income from his 
              wife's online handmade  trinkets business.</p>
              <p>Singapore goes to the polls on Saturday and income inequalities have 
              become a major political issue,with the opposition highlighting the 
              rising cost of living and the increase in foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Those rising costs have come during an economic boom, with the 
              country reporting a 23.5 percent increase in gross domestic product 
              (GDP) quarter on quarter and 8.5 percent over the previous year. This 
              was on the back of GDP growth of 15 percent in 2010.</p>
              <p>But not  everyone in this island nation of 5 million people is 
              celebrating. Irvin  Seah, an economist at Singapore bank DBS says, 
              "Plainly, not everyone  has benefited equally from the economic growth 
              that has occurred over  the past decade."</p>
              <p>Median  household incomes have grown only 21 percent in the past 
              decade,  compared to real GDP growth of 72 percent in the same period, 
              according  to government statistics.</p>
              <p>In 2010 when GDP expanded by 14.5 percent, household incomes rose on average just 0.3 percent after adjusting for inflation.</p>
              <p>Take  the case of Rokiah Ahmad, 46, a librarian at the Singapore 
              Department  of Statistics. She says her salary was S$1,500 ($1,222) per 
              month 10 years ago,  and after a decade of small increments, it's now 
              S$1,700 ($1,385) a  month.</p>
              <p>"It's not enough to raise three daughters and one son. We have financial difficulties."</p>
              <p>Chow  Penn Nee, an economist at United Overseas Bank says, "Wage 
              growth is  clearly not keeping up with GDP growth and the divide between
               the rich  and the poor is getting bigger."</p>
              <p>Asked  for the government's response, Singapore's Minister for 
              Manpower, Gan  Kim Yong said income growth cannot be equated with GDP 
              growth, "as the  former is also influenced by other demand and supply 
              factors."</p>
              <p>The  opposition Workers' Party candidate, Chen Show Mao, who was a 
              corporate  lawyer before he joined the largest opposition party in 
              Singapore, said  during the party's election rally that the benefit of 
              Singapore's  economic growth "went to corporate profits and the wages of
               top  earners".</p>
              <p>Government  data showed that last year the bottom 10 percent of the 
              population had a  household monthly income of S$1,400 ($1,141) compared 
              with S$23,684  ($19,308) for households in the top 10 percent.</p>
              <p>Singapore  has the highest concentration of millionaires in the 
              world. According  to the Boston Consulting Group's Global Wealth 2010 
              Report, 11.4 percent  of Singapore's population is millionaires.</p>
              <p>And  it has the second highest income gap among 42 nations "with very
               high  human development," according to the United Nations. Singapore's 
              Gini  coefficient, a measure of income inequality where zero is complete
                equality and one maximum inequality, was 0.472 in 2010.</p>
              <p>CIMB-GK  Research economist Song Seng Wun believes that growth itself
               partly  explains the widening income gap. "In any capitalist society 
              where  profit maximization is key, this gap will widen unless we get 
              heavy  government intervention."</p>
              <p>According  to Leif Eskesen, HSBC's chief economist for India &amp; 
              ASEAN, some  inequality is integral to the effective functioning of a 
              market economy,  "but too much inequality could also hurt growth."</p>
              <p>When  contacted by CNBC, Singapore's Ministry of Finance cited the 
              recent budget in  which the government promised to raise the 
              productivity of Singaporeans  via training and other benefits.</p>
              <p><em class="strong"><em class="strong"><em class="strong">In its budget in February</em></em></em>,
                the government handed out one-time benefits valued at S$3.2 billion  
              ($2.6 billion) targeting lower-income citizens. The ruling People's  
              Action Party has also promised larger bursaries and grants in its  
              manifesto.</p>
              <p>OSK-DMG  economist Enrico Tanuwidjaja says these handouts can only 
              cushion the  impact of inflation temporarily since they are one-offs. 
              "Purchasing  power actually stays the same."</p>
              <p>Liyana  and Fazli say since 90 percent of their wages are used to pay bills,  the extra money</p>
              <p>Singapore's  Ministry of Manpower says the government aims to raise 
              incomes by 30  percent in the next 10 years by improving productivity. 
              The ministry  also says it has committed S$5.5 billion ($4.47 billion) 
              for this  purpose over the next five years.</p>
              <p>Prime  Minister Lee Hsien Loong has promised in his party's political
                broadcasts that the PAP, which is widely expected to win the 
              elections,  will ensure that low-wage workers are not left behind. On 
              Tuesday, the Straits Times reported the Prime Minister apologized for 
              not moving fast enough to address some of the shortfalls in housing and 
              transport. "We're trying our best on your behalf. And if we didn't quite
               get it right, I'm sorry but we will try and do better the next time," 
              the newspaper quoted him as saying.</p>
              <p>71-year-old  cleaner Mr Tan, who only wanted to be identified by his 
              last name, has  been earning just S$4.00 ($3.20) an hour for the past 5 
              years. He says  he's not convinced.</p>
              <p>"They  don't care about us. The profits all go to the bosses and 
              government  ministers. And when we speak up, we're considered as 
              complaining."</p>
