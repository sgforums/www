              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has stressed the need for Singaporeans to build a consensus on the future they want.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>What Singapore will be in 20 years depends on Singaporeans, he said in an interview on Singapolitics.sg.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>If the decision is 
              to have a place that Singaporeans are proud to live in and where others 
              look up to, Mr Lee said the country can get there.<br><br>He said Singapore has the resources and it is prepared to thrive.<br><br>But Singaporeans need to have a "toughness of mind" to do that.<br><br>Should Singaporeans decide on a more relaxed pace of life, with less pressure, Mr Lee warned that new pressures will come.<br><br>The challenge is when a consensus cannot be reached, he said.<br><br>Asked
               if the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) will be dominant in future, 
              Mr Lee said the question is whether Singaporeans can come to a consensus
               on the direction they want to go.<br><br>If 'yes', then there can be one party which has a strong mandate and can work on behalf of citizens effectively.<br><br>He
               cited countries like the US and India where divisive politics has led 
              to gridlock and dysfunction, which can happen to Singapore.<br><br>"If 
              we don't have that consensus within society, like in America where there
               is a deep divide between the Republicans and Democrats... then you have
               gridlock, dysfunction and it can happen to Singapore," said Mr Lee.<br><br>Mr
               Lee noted that coming to an agreement is harder now because interests 
              are more diverse and citizens differ on what they feel are important to 
              them.<br><br>He said the country needs to build more strongly that sense of being Singaporeans together.<br><br>It's a serious question, which he urged citizens to focus on.<br><br>"The
               temptation is always to focus on immediate issues, rather than future 
              things, because it's remote, it's not tangible, it's hard to make sense 
              of what's going to come. But we must ask ourselves... down the road, (if
               our) children want to live in a special and successful place, what must
               we do to help them get there? And I think then we frame the question 
              right and we can decide what we need to do. Otherwise, we are just navel
               gazing and I think that's not constructive," said Mr Lee.<br><br>On 
              whether he sees himself still as prime minister when he's beyond 70 
              years old, Mr Lee, who is 60 now, said if he still is, then "something 
              is seriously wrong".<br><br>He said Singapore needs a younger prime minister who is in tune with "that much younger and very much different generation".<br><br>Asked if he sees a potential PM in the current Cabinet, Mr Lee only said "it's early days to say".<br><br>On what would be Singapore's optimal population size, Mr Lee said he is hesitate to put a figure to it.<br><br>While the country's masterplan puts that figure at 6.5 million, Mr Lee noted that's not a target but a possibility mapped out.<br><br>How
               big the population grows would depend on how Singapore develops, 
              expands its land area and develops as a city while providing a good 
              quality of life for the people in an urban environment, said Mr Lee. <br><br>Singapore's population currently stands at 5.2 million.<br><br><br>- CNA/cc/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>it's not tangible and is remote, the future yet to come. Be the present and let the politic be in the politic amongst the politic arena. Probably PM has to look around a model that is special and successful place for singaporeans, PR and future singaporeans to live on and dream along. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>its not the answer, but its what he wants. why he ask an option for chicken also is becasue he want to spy and see how people answer, and the easons why so. like that he learn and copycat. next time he encounter this type of situation he can apply what he listern and tok rot. my ex-company is like that. got 2. one senior purchase manager tok rot only, and one assistant manaegra lso largi same. listen careful both like to copy other things peope say and tok nonsesne actually in loops. the otehr ah gua ugly dark manager is woprse, listen to some R and D guys bull and go bull in front of suppleirs. i really pity our suppliers. haiz....</p>

              <p>do we even have a say?</p>
              <p>when we make some noises you only hold a few talkshow for show.</p>
              <p>the problem still stays.</p>
              <p>i hope time wind forward to 2016, so we can have elections again.</p>
              <p>see, you implemented policies for free uncontrolled influx of cheap labor, a dupe for our local small and medium company to take. of course now restrict the dosage of the drug side effects sets in feel difficult lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if in the beginning we had not used the open (and i mean too opened) door policies and the main ostrich head poke onto the ground solution, and used alternate source of utilizing our existing manpower to the fullest, from young to old, then things will not be in this posied state like now!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and also, if the f-stop 2, 2 f-stop and stop at 2 ppoliy had not been in effect, sg will not be in this state like now!</p>
