              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A Singaporean woman died in a hit-and-run accident in London on Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span> Local reports said she died on her birthday. </span></p>
              <p><span>London's Metropolitan Police said they were not ready to release 
              the name of the victim, as her body has not been identified by her 
              family.
              <br> <br> They said the woman was hit by a vehicle early Thursday morning outside the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead in north London.
              <br> <br> Her body was dragged for about one and a half kilometres before it came 
              to a stop near Belsize Park train station. She was pronounced dead at 
              about 2am.
              <br> <br> The police said the vehicle did not stop at the scene, and it was 
              possible that the driver was not aware that he or she had hit anyone.
              <br> <br> They are looking at a CCTV footage showing a black car near the train 
              station at the time of death, though some reports said she might have 
              been hit by a truck.
              <br> <br> According to local reports, a student ID was found in her bag, along 
              with her wallet and mobile phone, and that she was about 20 years old.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Foreign Ministry said it has contacted the woman's family and is giving them consular assistance.
              <br> <br> A post-mortem will be done in due time, and investigations are on-going.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: London police have arrested a 50-year-old man believed 
              to be involved in a road accident on Friday that killed Singaporean 
              medical student Tan Mingwei. </span></p>
              <p><span> According to the London Police Press Bureau, the man remains in custody at a North London police station. </span></p>
              <p><span> A bus, believed to be involved in the accident, has also been recovered and is being examined by the authorities. </span></p>
              <p><span>Miss Tan, who was 20 years old, was hit outside the Royal Free Hospital at Pond Street. 
              <br> <br> The Cambridge University undergraduate was dragged almost two kilometres down the road. 
              <br> <br> She was found near Belsize Park Tube station at around 2am London Time on Thursday. 
              <br> <br> Miss Tan, who was about to start her third year at the university's 
              Peterhouse College, was the daughter of Singapore playwright and 
              research fellow Tan Tarn How.
              <br> <br> Mr Tan has left Singapore for London.
              <br> <br> According to Britain's Daily Mail, Dr Philip Pattenden, who is a senior 
              tutor at the college said Miss Tan was doing very well in medical 
              sciences.
              <br> <br> He added she was a popular member of the community and was always full of joy. 
              <br> <br> A post-mortem conducted on Friday at St Pancras mortuary revealed that Miss Tan succumbed to multiple injuries.
              <br> <br> An inquest will be held at the St Pancras Coroner's court on Monday.

              <p><strong>Student's ashes back home</strong></p>
              <p>THE ashes of Cambridge University medical undergraduate Tan Mingwei 
              arrived home with her family last Saturday, more than a week after she 
              was believed to have been hit by a vehicle and her body dragged almost 
              2km.</p>
              <p>The 20-year-old student, who had been due to start her third year, 
              was hit in the early hours of Sept 30 outside the Royal Free Hospital in
               North London.</p>
              <p>Her body was found near the Belsize Park Underground station. A post-mortem showed she had suffered multiple injuries.</p>
              <p>Her remains were cremated last Friday in London, four days 
              after an inquest into her death was opened at St Pancras Coroner's 
              Court.</p>
              <p>She was the younger daughter of playwright and research 
              fellow Tan Tarn How, 49, and his wife, a dentist. The couple have an 
              older daughter.</p>
              <p>In a statement last night, Mr Tan said: 'Besides friends and family, many well-wishers have expressed their condolences.</p>

              <p><strong>Student's ashes back home</strong></p>
              <p>THE ashes of Cambridge University medical undergraduate Tan Mingwei arrived home with her family last Saturday, more than a week after she was believed to have been hit by a vehicle and her body dragged almost 2km.</p>
              <p>The 20-year-old student, who had been due to start her third year, was hit in the early hours of Sept 30 outside the Royal Free Hospital in North London.</p>
              <p>Her body was found near the Belsize Park Underground station. A post-mortem showed she had suffered multiple injuries.</p>
              <p>Her remains were cremated last Friday in London, four days after an inquest into her death was opened at St Pancras Coroner's Court.</p>
              <p>She was the younger daughter of playwright and research fellow Tan Tarn How, 49, and his wife, a dentist. The couple have an older daughter.</p>
              <p>In a statement last night, Mr Tan said: 'Besides friends and family, many well-wishers have expressed their condolences.</p>

              <p><br>Multiple injuries?</p>
              <p>I believed she was probably kidnapped, raped, beaten and killed then dumped.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's no way you can knock down a person and drag for 2km unless your car got hands and can grab onto the victim.</p>
              <p>I wished I'm the one who is dead and not her.</p>
