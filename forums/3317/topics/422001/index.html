              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government is undertaking another 
              review of the Baby Bonus scheme which aims to encourage married couples 
              to have more children and help them defray part of the financial costs.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A survey with some 
              3,000 beneficiaries is in the works. The move comes at a time when 
              Singapore's fertility rate is at a record low.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Observers have said that more comprehensive provisions should be made, to reverse the declining trend.<br><br>Under
               the Baby Bonus scheme, parents are given a cash gift of up to S$4,000 
              each for the first and second child and S$6,000 each for the third and 
              fourth child.<br><br>The government also gives a dollar-for-dollar match
               when parents contribute to their child's Children Development Account 
              (CDA). The savings will be matched up to the cap of S$6,000 each for the
               first and second child, S$12,000 each for the third and fourth child 
              and S$18,000 each for the fifth and subsequent child. Parents can tap on
               the scheme when they register for their child's birth at hospitals and 
              the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA).<br><br>The Baby Bonus
               scheme was introduced in 2001 to encourage more Singaporeans to have 
              babies. However, the country's fertility rate still remains low. The 
              Community Development Youth and Sports ministry (MCYS) said it will 
              carry out a survey between April and June this year, targeting parents 
              who have benefited from the Baby Bonus. The aim is to find out how 
              satisfied they are with the scheme.<br><br>Observers welcomed the move but said processes need to be strengthened further.<br><br>Professor
               Gavin Jones, Research Leader of the Asia Research Institute at the 
              National University of Singapore, said: "I also like to see people who 
              are not married, asked whether such a scheme would a make any difference
               to their marriage, child bearing and so on. Not just those who have 
              already experienced the scheme, but the perceptions among the community 
              of those who have not yet started having children."<br><br>Experts added
               that a higher payout may also be needed, but any such adjustments, they
               said, will only have a short term impact as costs of living go up.<br><br>The
               government gave out some S$230 million in baby bonus payments in 2009, 
              up from S$55 million in 2004. But there was no corresponding increase in
               the total fertility rate. And last year, the rate plummeted to 1.16, a 
              far cry from the replacement rate of 2.1.<br><br>Some said it's time to consider bolder measures, such as making childcare free or legislating paternity leave.<br><br>"Some
               European countries who have had higher birth rates, and also higher 
              proportion of women in the work force, and they allow paternity leave. 
              They allow parents to choose [which spouse will get the off day]. Quite a
               radical thing that has not been done in Singapore. Recognising the 
              husband's role in the child rearing care and so on, more time to help 
              with childcare," said Professor Jones.<br><br>Tackling the low birth rate looks set to be a hot issue in the upcoming budget debate.<br><br>Mr
               Seah Kian Peng, Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for 
              Community Development, Youth and Sports, said: "I will ask the 
              government to continue to review and see if there are some things they 
              should consider. The issue of low TFR (Total Fertility Rate), is a very 
              serious one, so I think we need to think more out of the box. Try new 
              things, some may work, some may not work, but I think we should really 
              venture out of the current schemes that we have talked about.<br><br>"In
               housing...maybe for those who a second child, we give them a chance to 
              upgrade, a priority to upgrade to a bigger flat...they may sound a 
              little bit off, but I hope the spirit is that TFR is a serious issue, we
               should look beyond current schemes, to see what else can be done, and 
              really adopt a whole of a government approach, from accommodation, to 
              housing to paternity, maternity leave and certainly the baby bonus 
              scheme."<br><br>The baby bonus scheme forms part of the enhanced 
              marriage and parenthood package which aims to support couples' decision 
              to get married and have children.<br><br>Since the Baby Bonus scheme was introduced, it has been enhanced twice in 2004 and in 2008.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>the govt will blame us when we refuse to reproduce. They will say they have tried to help us bla bla bla and it's our fault. Then they import chinamen. Haha.</p>
              <p>I think countries in the EU take a different approach. Fathers have paternity leave of a few months, mothers have maternity leave for at least one year. Education is free till a certain age etc etc.</p>

              <p>Putting up new show again.</p>
              <p>Generally, people are taking into consideration the ever constant rising cost of living.  They should just cut the crap and get down to remove the problem of ever rising cost of living they are causing people and place profiteering as the least priority on their list.</p>
              <p>They are really much ado about nothing, crapping all the way and blaming people for not willing to give birth when they keep creating problems for people.   Empty vessels make the most noise.</p>

              <p>The only solution is to import more from overseas since our fertility rate has fallen.</p>
              <p>The same reasons why Europe import so many muslims is due to low birthrates too.</p>
