              <p><strong>National Day Parade returns to the Padang</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Spectators can expect a 360-degree view of the dazzling
               fireworks display at this year's National Day Parade to celebrate 
              Singapore's 45th birthday. </span></p>
              <p><span>The fireworks will be fired from nine locations, including Padang,
               the Esplanade, on the rooftop of City Hall and Suntec Towers. 
              <br> <br> This year, the parade will return to the Padang, with the theme "Live 
              Our Dreams, Fly Our Flag".
              <br> <br> It will have the regular crowd pleasers such as the Aerial FlyPast and 
              the Presidential Gun Salute. 
              <br> <br> Chairman of the NDP 2010 Executive Committee, Colonel Benedict Lim, 
              said: "It is actually a celebration of our achievements and an 
              inspiration to the people to be forward-looking and to build a better 
              future for Singapore. 
              <br> <br> "What is new this year (is that) because we have done some 
              transformation of the Padang, we will be able to bring more props, more 
              things onto the performance area and at the same time the fireworks will
               be something of a spectacular display.
              <br> <br> "There will also be something new in the show segment and there will be a
               digital projection against the City Hall - again, that has not been 
              done before."
              <br> <br> While the main parade is at the Padang,  Singaporeans can also soak in 
              the fun from five other locations islandwide. 
              <br> <br> Celebrations will also be held in Choa Chu Kang, Bishan, Eunos, Sengkang
               and Woodlands. 
              <br> <br> Singaporeans can also get interactive, by going to a website to find out
               more about the parade, take part in the activities, post photos and 
              share their views. 
              <br> <br> Major Alan Toh, chairman of NDP's multimedia and communications, said: 
              "In addition, we are  coming up with this mobile application that allows
               people to have the necessary information on the move.
              <br> <br> "People can actually download an application through the NDP 2010 
              website, come June, and you will be able to share all the necessary 
              activities pertaining to NDP 2010.
              <br> <br> "The app will be able to bring you to the celebration location. For 
              example, if you are in Yishun now, launching the app, you can actually 
              find out where are the NDP celebration locations and it will show you a 
              map on the location." 
              <br> <br> Organisers will make special efforts to minimise the inconvenience 
              caused by the parade rehearsals, as well as the opening ceremony for the
               Youth Olympic Games (YOG), which will take place a few days after 
              National Day. 
              <br> <br> Colonel Benedict Lim said: "There will be two of the rehearsals which 
              will overlap on two Saturdays and we will have the NDP rehearsal first 
              followed by the YOG, so that  members of the public will only need to 
              refer to one set of signs instead of two. 
              <br> <br> "Otherwise, it will be confusing for the people. So, if you are a shop 
              owner at the Bay area you will only be inconvenienced once and not 
              twice." 
              <br> <br> The YOG will kick off on 14 August.

              <p><strong>New elements in this year's NDP</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Organisers of this year's National Day Parade (NDP) 
              have promised to inject something new and refreshing to the nation's 
              birthday bash. </span></p>
              <p><span> Lieutenant-Colonel Lek Seng Khoon has always dreamed of playing a major 
              role in the National Day Parade. </span></p>
              <p><span> This year, the 36-year-old will be able to live his dream - as parade 
              commander. </span></p>
              <p><span>"In the 1980s, I first watched the parade when I was a little 
              child, on television and I remembered vividly that it was a parade 
              conducted in front of the Padang. I can still remember that days after 
              the parade was over, I was still shouting "Baris! Sediya!" and 
              pretending to be the parade commander," recalled LTC Lek. 
              <br> <br> Like him, 15-year-old Jerome Wong is honoured to be leading the National
               Cadet Corps Band, which is making its debut as part of the Combined 
              Marching Band, alongside the Singapore Armed Forces and Singapore Police
               Force bands.
              <br> <br> "(I) was a little worried whether I could take up the challenge, and 
              also nervous and excited to be in this role," said Wong, commander of 
              the National Cadet Corps Band. 
              <br> <br> Organisers have promised many firsts in this year's parade.
              <br> <br> For the first time, the presidential drive-past will be on the Padang, 
              so special arrangements have to be made to harden the grounds there with
               crushed concrete. 
              <br> <br> It is also the first time spectators at the Padang will be able to have 
              closer interactions with the president, during the drive-past. 
              <br> <br> A key highlight in this year's parade is the City March. 
              <br> <br> Organisers hope to make it as impressive as the first march in 1966.
              <br> <br> But this time round, the contingents will be marching towards the new 
              Singapore, along a 2.3-kilometre stretch across the iconic developments 
              in the Marina Bay area.
              <br> <br> "This march is significant because it really represents how the people -
               representing Singapore in the contingent - marching towards our new 
              future," said Colonel Loh Kean Wah, who chairs the NDP 2010 Parade and 
              Ceremony Committee. 
              <br> <br> Perennial crowd-pleasers are also getting a new twist. The ceremonial 
              25-pounder guns of the Presidential Gun Salute will make their way to 
              the War Memorial Park for the first time in 10 years.
              <br> <br> The parade is expected to start at 6.10pm and will last about an hour.
              <br> <br> Some 3,100 participants will be marching in NDP 2010. </span></p>

              <p><strong>F-15SG to soar on National Day</strong></p>
              <p>THE F-15SG Multi-Role Aircraft and the G550 Airborne Early Warning 
              Aircraft will both be making a debut at this year's National Day Parade.</p>
              <p>Built by Boeing, the F-15SG is one of the most technologically 
              advanced military airplanes currently available. It can handle both 
              air-to-air and air-to-ground combat.</p>
              <p>The G550, a threat detector, can best be described as the 
              military variant of the popular Gulfstream jet which is popular with the
               corporate jet set.</p>
              <p>Both aircraft will fly in various formations during the 
              National Day Parade with The Republic's latest fighter jet - the F-15SG -
               headlining the program accompanied by 20 other types of aircraft.</p>

              <p><strong>N-Day parade in 3-D</strong></p>
              <p>THE National Day Parade will become the first large-scale event to be
               recorded in 3-D under a technical trial to bring the format to 
              television here.</p>
              <p>However, it will not be broadcast in 3-D - although, in the course of
               the year-long trial, programmes may become available in the format, 
              said the Media Development Authority (MDA).</p>
              <p>News of the launch of the trial came yesterday from Mr Lui 
              Tuck Yew, the acting Minister for Information, Communications and the 
              Arts, who was at the opening ceremony of the Infocomm Media Business 
              Exchange yesterday, which incorporates BroadcastAsia 2010 and 
              CommunicAsia 2010.</p>
              <p>Together with MediaCorp, StarHub and SingTel, MDA yesterday 
              started the trial to test transmission signals on all platforms - namely
               free-to-air television, cable TV and Internet Protocol Television 
              (IPTV) - as well as other technical issues.</p>
              <p>MDA also launched a $5 million fund that will help the 
              broadcasters pay for the trial, as well as selected developers' efforts 
              to create content and services for 3-D. If and when content becomes 
              available, viewers will need to buy 3-D-ready television sets, versions 
              of which were recently launched here by Samsung and Panasonic.</p>
              <p>Broadcasters SingTel and StarHub are also shopping for new 
              and existing 3-D TV programmes to bring in.</p>

              <p><strong>Padang turf topped with recycled materials for stable platform for NDP</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: For the first time, the Padang grounds have been 
              hardened for the National Day Parade. </span></p>
              <p><span>This is to ensure that the parade, including the presidential 
              drive-past which will be held on the Padang, takes place without a 
              hitch.
              <br> <br> The organisers took about 10 days to complete the job.
              <br> <br> First, they covered the field with a layer of plastic membrane. They 
              then added 30 centimetres of recycled material and topped this with 5 
              centimetres of pre-mix, including tar.
              <br> <br> Some 300 lorry-loads of recycled material were used to create a more 
              stable platform for performers.
              <br> <br> Ltc Boo Chin Tuan, chairman, Infrastructure &amp; Decoration Committee, 
              NDP 2010, says: "By hardening the performance area, we're able to 
              provide stability for the performers. It means that we can put 
              performances that would have heavy props, each of these props for 
              example like a float that will weigh up to five tonnes per float onto 
              the performance area." 
              <br> <br> Organisers say the flattened grass will regrow in four to five weeks' 
              time.
              <br> <br> He continues: "Compared to previous years, whatever solutions we use, 
              the grass will wither, what was important to us was 'how quickly can we 
              regrow back the grass after the event?', and we're satisfied that by 
              using the recycled aggregate it actually doesn't change the underlying 
              soil conditions." - CNA/jy</span></p>

              <p><strong>"Human LCD" display to make debut at NDP</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : This year's National Day Parade (NDP) show promises something different. </span></p>
              <p><span> Instead of the familiar mass placard display, all 1,000 choir 
              participants will be transformed for the first time into what is called a
               "Human LCD". </span></p>
              <p><span> It is showtime for the kids taking part in the NDP show on August 9. The
               way they move or wave their clothes combine to create different images. </span></p>
              <p><span>Khertan Ramanan, a student from Kranji Secondary School, said: 
              "For example I'm saying "Are", I must open like this - "Are". (For the 
              word) "You", I have to close it like this, so that you can only see the 
              white portion. And they also provide gloves, because we're not all 
              white, right?" 
              <br> <br> The kids have been practising since April, first in their respective 
              schools and then coming together for combined rehearsals in June. A lot 
              of it is precision work, and because they are all colour-coordinated, 
              any mistake becomes instantly obvious.
              <br> <br> Tricia Tan, from Coral Secondary School, said: "Sometimes I do the wrong
               dance step, and I'll be like looking around thinking, 'Hey, why are 
              people doing different dance steps from me'. 
              <br> <br> "And I'll ... try to, oh my god, catch up, that kind of thing. So I get 
              nervous, especially if you do a wrong step - it's like, oh my god, 
              everybody is watching me, because I'm the odd one out." 
              <br> <br> In the holding area behind the Padang, the kids are getting ready for the rehearsal.
              <br> <br> It is hours before the show, and the wait - coupled with the mid-afternoon heat - has made them restless.
              <br> <br> As the seating stands start filling up, the choir mistress prepares the students for their opening number.
              <br> <br> Lim Hwee Sian, NDP 2010 Choir Mistress, said: "I have to build rapport 
              together. And you can see all the energy level. I must make sure they 
              can see me from the back - they can mirror what I do, so I myself have 
              to give 100 per cent so they can give their 110 per cent!" 
              <br> <br> Once the music starts, the mix of nervousness and excitement melts away,
               and the students work their magic to give the crowd a show to remember.

              <p><strong>Heartlanders celebrate</strong></p>
              <p>THEY may not have been lucky enough to snag tickets to the Padang 
              celebrations, but they were still part of the biggest birthday bash of 
              the year.</p>
              <p>More than 80,000 residents figured in high-octane celebrations 
              kicking off simultaneously on Monday in the five heartland districts of 
              Bishan, Choa Chu Kang, Sengkang, Woodlands and Eunos.</p>
              <p>Their voices were heard along with some 26,000 people at the Padang, 
              singing the National Anthem and reciting the National Pledge via a 
              two-way video telecast.</p>
              <p>As early as 2.30pm, people from all walks of life, with friends and 
              family in tow, came dressed in the national colours of red and white to 
              revel in the heartland festivities. Not to be outdone by events in town,
               each of the five districts marked the occasion with record-breaking 
              feats, in line with the NDP theme of Live Our Dreams, Fly Our Flag.</p>
              <p>Choa Chu Kang residents proudly displayed their flag, the 
              size of 5.5m by 4.5m, made up of 45,000 red and white heart-shaped 
              origami hearts stapled onto a board making up the backdrop of the stage.
               More than 90 per cent of the paper hearts were already stuck on 
              beforehand by 10,000 people but the guests-of-honour Mr Gan Kim Yong, 
              Mayor Amy Khor and three other MPs, together with representatives from 
              the district, laid the finishing touches on Monday.</p>
              <p>At Woodlands, some 5,500 residents set the record for most 
              number of people holding heart-shaped balloons with the Singapore flag 
              printed on it. The red balloons had 'I love SG' printed on one side, and
               the five stars and crescent printed on the other.</p>
              <p>In the heart of the central district, it was a multicoloured
               spectacular as 2,750 spectators in Bishan drummed up the buzz by 
              shaking multi-coloured clappers while performing a specially 
              choreographed cheer - the largest group in Singapore to do so.</p>
              <p>Over at Sengkang where celebrations for residents from the 
              North East district were held, 5,000 residents popped confetti at the 
              same moment at 5.49pm, setting a new record.</p>
              <p>South East district residents meanwhile, celebrated in Eunos
               by coming together to form the largest human map of Singapore. A 
              record-breaking 3,000 residents gathered on the open field outside the 
              Eunos MRT station to form the shape of the Singapore island.</p>
