              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports, Mr Chan Chun Sing said Singapore needs to grow its social 
              services much more in future.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is in view of 
              the changing demographics and advancements in technology, which may see a
               rising number of elderly singles and people with disabilities outliving
               their caregivers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Social services cater to those who need social support as they may not have family members to fall back on.<br><br>"Singles
               may not have very acute medical and social needs today, because they 
              are healthy... but the challenges will come in 20 years' time, when the 
              young singles become the old singles," said Mr Chan. <br><br>"How do you
               design social services that are within the community so that you do not
               uproot people? These are new challenges down there if 20 to 30 per cent
               of our people remain single throughout their lives."<br><br>Mr Chan said help and support systems will have to evolve with the changing demographics. <br><br>The
               new Social and Family Development ministry intends to better integrate 
              social services at the community level, to make support more accessible.<br> <br>As for manpower, the aim is to attract more retirees and housewives to meet the higher demand for social services.<br> <br>Mr Chan said public expectations of such services have also changed.<br> <br>With the widening income gap, those in the middle income group are also increasingly feeling unsettled.<br><br>Singapore
               already spends about 40 per cent of its budget on social spending - 
              mostly in the form of transfers for housing and education. <br><br>Other areas are in social services, medical subsidies and employment.<br><br>Mr Chan said the government is always ready to do more, but he added resources will be an issue.<br><br>He
               said: "This government will always try do more and try to do better for
               our people - to the extent that some people criticise us for doing too 
              much. The real issue for us is how to get this thing done - where to 
              find the resources... those are the challenges that are real."<br><br>Mr
               Chan said resources will have to be put to better use, such as helping 
              voluntary welfare organisations pool resources, through the formation of
               social service hubs.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
