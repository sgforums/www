              <p><strong>Yvonne Lim's failed relationship caused her depression </strong></p>
              <p class="first">The actress went through a bout of depression and was heavily dependent on sleeping pills after her engagement was called off.</p>
              <p>MediaCorp artiste, Yvonne Lim, was on Celebritea Break a few nights
              ago. In the show, the actress shared her deepest secrets with hosts
              Quan Yi Fong and Guo Liang, and revealed the hurt and depression she
              went through from her failed relationships.</p>
              <p>She is more wary when
              it comes to matters of the heart now as the bubbly actress recounted
              her most heartbreaking relationship to date. Lim shared that her
              relationship with her ex-boyfriend reached the stage of "marriage" and
              he eventually proposed to her. The actress sunk into depression and
              even contemplated suicide after the other party broke off their
              engagement.</p>
              <p>In the interview, Lim revealed that her ex-boyfriend
              was a businessman and they got to know one another through mutual
              friends. During the initial stages of their relationship, the guy was
              extremely doting and caring. "Although there were talks of him being a
              playboy, as I got to know him better, I found him more mature and
              stable. However, I didn't expect that a leopard would never change its
              spots"</p>
              <p>They were in an eight-month long relationship when he
              suddenly proposed to her, "Back then, I just got back from filming
              abroad. He brought me to Sentosa, booked a hotel room, asked me for my
              hand and placed a diamond ring in my finger. I couldn't react to his
              sudden move and was lost, I didn't have the chance to reject or agree!"</p>
              <p>The
              peace-loving actress just wanted everyone to be happy and thus,
              accepted the other party's proposal. They started to look around for a
              love nest to call home, and even had their respective parents meet up
              with one another. The actress warily sighed and revealed that it was
              her frequent overseas trip that made her realise their clash in
              personalities. The last straw came when she discovered his late night
              phone calls with another girl. "I did not know if it was the third
              party that appeared first or a problem between us both."</p>
              <p>In an
              attempt to win back his affections, the actress never questioned him
              about the third party in their relationship, "At that point in time, I
              only wanted to be by his side. He told me not to phone him and not to
              message him. If he wanted to see me, he'll come to look for me. I
              actually followed his instructions and complied!" The actress gave a
              wry smile, "It was as if the girlfriend had turned into the third
              party!"</p>
              <p>With their relationship heading nowhere, their marriage
              plans came to a halt. Lim shared that she grew unhappy with each
              passing day and decided to let go of this heartbreaking relationship.
              "Back then, I was really hurt by it. I stayed by myself for six months
              and eventually sunk into depression. I had to see a doctor and depended
              on sleeping pills to get some rest. I thought about suicide but did not
              do anything foolish when I thought of my family."</p>
              <p>Wiser from her
              previous heartbreaks, the actress believes that it is the feeling and
              connection shared between two parties that matters most in a
              relationship.</p>

              <p><strong>Anita Yuen chides Yvonne Lim for being stupid</strong></p>
              <p class="first">Jokes and laughter aside, the Hong Kong actress shares her honest opinions of friend, Yvonne Lim</p>
              <p class="first">Hong Kong actress, Anita Yuen, chided Yvonne Lim over the phone for
              being too obedient and "stupid". The pair first collaborated in a TV
              drama, Innocently Guilty, which was shot in Hong Kong a few years ago.
              During the recent episode of Celebritea Break, the hosts interviewed
              Yuen via a phone call on her impressions of local actress, Yvonne Lim.</p>
              <p>"If I were to say the good side of her, she is a very kind person.
              If I were to say the ugly side, she is quite stupid!" The
              straightforward actress continued, "I am quite a troublesome person.
              However, as Yvonne is quite a simple-minded person, I did not feel good
              bullying her and even took care of her!" Putting Lim's simple-minded
              ways aside, the actress praised her friend for being an obedient and
              professional artiste albeit one that was "too compliant" with orders
              and instructions.</p>
              <p>"She can have her own opinions and suggestions.
              You don't have to listen to what some people are saying!" In her own
              defense, Lim explained that she was merely trying to be a likeable
              person and did not want to trouble others too much.</p>
              <p>The
              blossoming friendship between Yuen and Lim was evident from their
              interactions with one another. For example, in a bid to get Lim to
              settle down soon, Yuen readily agreed to fly to Singapore to attend her
              wedding. Apart from that, Lim revealed that Yuen is actually quite a
              loud person, however, the latter puts on a very gentle and demure voice
              whenever she is conversing with her husband, Julian Cheung. To that,
              Yuen swiftly responded, "If not, how do you think I managed to keep him
              by my side?"</p>
