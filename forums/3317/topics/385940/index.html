              <p><strong>Spotlight on need for better ways to teach language in schools in 2009</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Better ways to teach language in schools was an issue
              that came under the spotlight following spirited discussions amongst
              the public and policymakers. </span></p>
              <p><span>Results of two separate reviews on the teaching of English and Chinese by the Education Ministry are expected next year.
              <br> <br> In September, the choice of words used by an aspiring beauty queen
              ignited debate over, among other things, the standard of English in
              Singapore.
              <br> <br> The need for clear, effective communication was also a concern of the Education Minister. 
              <br> <br>Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen said: “At the basic level, those
              who can communicate their ideas to market their ideas and products or
              convince others, will have an edge over others."
              <br> <br>Aside from using drama, a ministry taskforce is looking at other
              ways to teach English better at a time when it has become the main
              language for many young Singaporeans.
              <br> <br> But the prevalence of English has led to new challenges in the teaching of mother tongue such as Chinese.
              <br> <br> Some observers said the Chinese language review should build on the current approach of having students learn at their own pace.
              <br> <br>Josephine Teo, chair, Govt Parliamentary Comm for Education, MP,
              Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, said: “Allow people to be tested at different
              levels of competence, but provide an incentive and a recognition of
              effort for those who attempt to do it at a higher level. We can
              continue to build on this system but we just make it more tiered.”
              <br> <br>Changes were also introduced to open up more post-diploma options
              for polytechnic students, by having polytechnic partner foreign
              universities to offer degrees.
              <br> <br> These courses will be managed by the newly set-up Singapore Institute of Applied Technology.
              <br> <br> And authorities hope that by 2015, one in five poly graduates will have a shot at a degree here.
              <br> <br> The government is also spending S$3.5 billion over the next 10 years to develop the polytechnic sector. 
              <br>Adding to these options is the Singapore University of Technology
              and Design, which will open in 2011 with 500 places for the first three
              years.
              <br> <br>SU, as it is known, will have a strong inter-disciplinary focus.
              And with two prestigious foreign partners - MIT in the US, and Zhejiang
              University in China - collaborating on curriculum, the new university
              has ambitious plans to shake up the varsity scene.
              <br> <br>2009 also saw a new Private Education Bill with more stringent
              rules over an industry that had previously seen little regulation.
              <br> <br> The scandal over degree mill Brookes Business School was just one of several high-profile cases.
              <br> <br>But while the laws are no guarantee against sudden school closures,
              students will at least get some of their money back, should that
              happen.
              <br> <br> In December, authorities extended insurance requirements to include not just foreigners, but Singapore students as well.
              <br> <br> The Bill kicked in on December 21 and operators have the next 18 months to register with authorities. </span></p>
