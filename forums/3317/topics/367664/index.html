              <p>IT WAS only his second taekwondo competition and 17-year-old
              Vincent Tan was fighting an opponent two belt levels above him.</p>
              <p>Barely a minute into the sparring match last Sunday, his
              slighter-built opponent, who had a brown belt, gave Tan a kick in the
              neck which ruptured a main blood vessel to his brain.</p>
              <p>Tan, who held a green belt, was seen fumbling with his head guard for a few seconds before tumbling onto the ground.</p>
              <p>First aid was immediately given to him, but he never gained consciousness and died on Thursday afternoon in hospital.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old polytechnic student's death has now prompted the
              People's Association (PA) to suspend all taekwondo competitions while
              it reviews the procedures usually undertaken in such events.</p>
              <p>'We are reviewing our processes to see if any improvements need to
              be made. In the meantime, we have suspended all taekwondo competitions
              pending the review,' said a PA spokesman.</p>
              <p>The police are also investigating.</p>
              <p>PA said the competition, held at the Kampong Kembangan Community
              Club, was organised by the Greenville Residents' Committee and
              Singapore Taekwondo Gymnasium (STG).</p>
              <p>It had attracted over 180 participants and was scheduled to run from 9am to 9pm, but was later cancelled.</p>
              <p>PA said the STG oversaw the technical aspects and publicity of the event, while Greenville booked the venue.</p>

              <p>Guess, due to nature of this sports, there's really no blaming of the other party that "kicked" him <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Due to the violent nature of such contact sports, I really questioned the judgement of the 29 year old instructor of the 15 year old because he/she should not have put that 15 year old in the arena if that student could not control his strength and power enough.

              <p>I don't know any of the parties involved but I thought a personal visit and apology by that instructor, that 15 year old and the parents of the boy should be done as soon as possible.

              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>THE teenager who dealt a fatal kick to his taekwondo opponent last
              week showed up at the wake on Sunday night to pay his respects.</p>
              <p>Accompanied by his parents and sister, the 15-year-old approached
              the mother of the late Vincent Tan mother, sombre, to offer his apology.</p>
              <p>Vincent, 17, died last Thursday, four days after the kick to his neck ruptured a key blood vessel to his brain.</p>
              <p>The teen, dressed in black, kept his head bowed as Vincent's
              grieving mother burst into tears and screamed at him in Malay.</p>
              <p>'Why did you hit so hard? You should have been more careful!' cried Madam Nur Julia, 51.</p>
              <p>The stout lad took the brunt of this stoically, his head bowed, and nodding occasionally.</p>
              <p>It was only when he was taken aside to a table that the dam broke. He turned to his taekwondo instructor and wept.</p>
              <p>His mother, who stood beside him as he faced Madam Nur Julia also cried.</p>
              <p>The teen's father, aged 55, said his son was traumatised by the
              incident and had not eaten or slept well for a week, and that he would
              bar him from taekwondo for the time being.</p>
              <p>Vincent, a first-year polytechnic student, will be cremated on Monday.</p>
