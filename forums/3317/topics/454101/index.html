              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: One former financial broker knows at least two 
              financial instrument brokers who play the "sex for contracts" game: They
               get into the sack with corporate clients even though they have 
              more-than-generous expense accounts with which to woo these clients.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>With each swap going
               for an average of tens of millions of dollars, the payouts are 
              temptingly high for those who manage to clinch the trade, the 
              35-year-old told MediaCorp. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But with very little
               to differentiate the services of one brokerage from another, some women
               brokers resort to sleeping with traders who may then pay them bigger 
              commissions if they are happy with the "service", he said, describing 
              the practice as "rife" within the profession.<br><br>A professional in 
              the IT industry, which also sees stiff competition for 
              multi-million-dollar contracts, knows of at least one peer in her circle
               who has gone to such lengths - usually as part of her after-dinner 
              entertainment for the client.<br><br>According to the 38-year-old, who 
              has been in the IT line for about 15 years, a mix of lucrative 
              incentives and the pressure to deliver makes for powerful motivation.<br><br></span><strong>DISEMPOWERING</strong><span><br><br>Another
               IT industry veteran, Mr H Lim, who has worked for the likes of Oracle 
              and IBM, said the sales quotas at such multinationals are very 
              aggressive.<br><br>"(Employees) need to meet the numbers and most IT procurers are male.<br><br>"Pressure is extremely high and you may get the boot if you don't meet your numbers for two to three quarters.<br><br>"This
               drives some women to desperation," he said, adding that targets are 
              usually in the double-digit millions of dollars per annum.<br><br>"It 
              would be naive to think it is only the high-profile cases. It is 
              happening daily - in the pharmaceutical industry, banking as well as IT 
              ... it's just a matter of not getting caught," he noted.<br><br>In this 
              era of equal opportunity, and with ever more women working their way to 
              success through knowledge, talent and hard work, instances of women 
              sales professionals offering sex in exchange for a quick, sure-fire way 
              of clinching deals have been thrust into the limelight.<br><br>Last 
              week, former Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) chief Peter Lim was 
              charged with 10 counts of corruption for allegedly obtaining sexual 
              favours from three women - two vendors and one potential vendor.<br><br>In return, he would allegedly show favour to their companies in IT-related tenders called by the SCDF.<br><br>There is a certain irony to all this. <br><br>Executive
               Director of the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) 
              Corinna Lim points out that more such incidences may be occurring these 
              days because modern women are getting into career roles that draw the 
              big bucks.<br><br>Yet, this is ultimately "disempowering" for women.<br><br>"Ideologically,
               the using of sex to get ahead reinforces the idea that their greatest 
              asset lies in the fact that they are desired by men.<br><br>"This 
              perpetuates patriarchy as it makes women's value dependent on how much 
              men desire them... they do not have value in their own right," said Ms 
              Lim.<br><br></span><strong>PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR</strong><span><br><br>Academics and
               women's rights organisations that TODAY spoke to suggest various 
              factors may be at play in determining the way some women in business 
              behave.<br><br>Ms Lim, as well as sociology professor Teo You Yenn of 
              the Nanyang Technological University, suggest taking a closer look at 
              organisational cultures that influence how employees act.<br><br>In 
              those with "masculine leadership cultures" and very few women at the 
              top, "sexual predatory behaviour may be implicitly encouraged", Ms Lim 
              added. <br><br>"Although the customer may not outright ask for sex in 
              exchange for sealing the contract, there is still some element of sexual
               harassment, through implicit, subtle suggestions or hints from the 
              customer that the sales representative may not get the deal if they do 
              not offer sex. <br><br>"There is an imbalance of power between the two parties."<br><br>This is happening in industries where clients are mostly male.<br><br>A
               pharmaceuticals sales representative with 12 years' experience said 
              that in the cases she has heard of, doctors are bold in asking for 
              sexual favours due to the strong competition that sales representatives 
              face.<br><br>Ms Lim called for stronger sexual harassment laws, arguing 
              that where it is the norm for transactions to be conducted in such a 
              manner, the professional may find it difficult to lodge complaints.<br><br></span><strong>IT'S COMPLICATED</strong><span><br><br>But is it too simplistic to cast women in such transactions as naive or manipulated victims?<br><br>There
               is, after all, the fact that there are women in the same lines who 
              choose not to exchange sexual favours for a contract. Or who decide to 
              leave the industry altogether. Personal greed, and perhaps also the 
              extent of one's ambition, factor into a woman's choice, some point out.<br><br>Their
               actions earn some detractors' scorn. In a day and age when women 
              advocates and business leaders are calling for more female participation
               on corporate boards and in top management positions, on the basis of 
              their competence and talent, it surely does no good when a female 
              company director or manager or chief executive makes the news for 
              allegedly sleeping with a client to further the company's business.<br><br>Prof
               Teo, who is also an AWARE board member, said: "From a sociological 
              viewpoint, all individual actions have to be understood in a broader 
              social context. We should ask why the system is such that sex is 
              rewarded but capabilities directly related to the job alone are not.<br><br>"Men
               continue to dominate higher positions across almost all organisations 
              and we know with certainty that they are almost never asked for sexual 
              favours in order to get there - why is it that comparably capable women 
              are put in such positions wherein this so-called choice is even a 
              possibility?"<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span><span>/fa</span></span></p>
