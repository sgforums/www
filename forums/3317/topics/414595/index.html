              <p>Several female employees working for an F&amp;B company in Singapore 
              have written in to STOMP to complain about being sexually harassed by 
              the director of the company. <br><br>STOMPer Chin, who sent in an email on behalf of her female colleagues, said:<br><br>"We have a Director who had on several occasions sexually harassed female employees whether single or married.<br><br>"He
               would usually call in female employees to his room on the pretext of 
              'coaching' them. In actual fact, what coaching is there when it all 
              seemed like 'sexual grooming'?<br><br>"On one occasion, he had mentioned to a female employee, 'Do you know that I have always been fantasizing about you?'<br><br>"In
               a separate incident, he placed his hands on another female employee’s 
              thigh. The employee stood up and shouted at him, 'Don’t treat me as a 
              prostitute'. <br><br>"He also resorted to verbal outrage of modesty, using the four-letter word on female employees.<br><br>"Once
               on a business trip, he harassed a female employee in the late hours at 
              night. Although there were computers available in the hotel lobby, he 
              insists on using the female employee’s laptop in her hotel room.<br><br>"Pacing
               up and down in front of her hotel room for more than an hour, the 
              frightened employee called her Manager in Singapore and was advised to 
              not to open the door to the Director for her own safety.<br><br>"When 
              the female employee returned to Singapore, she escalated this matter to 
              the Managing Director who said, 'Would you mind if the company does 
              nothing?'<br><br>"He too wanted to cover things up for the Director.<br><br>"We, female employees (present and former), do not condone such unreasonable behaviour and sexual harassments.<br><br>"Shame on the managing director for not doing anything for his female employees.<br><br>"We would not hesitate to lodge a police report and bring the person to justice if nothing is still being done by the company."</p>
