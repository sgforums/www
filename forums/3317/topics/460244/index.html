              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Cleaning companies which want to land contracts with 
              the government will have to show that they are committed to paying their
               workers more, under the labour movement's progressive wage model.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The wage model, 
              which gives 'wage points' to cleaners who pick up new and better skills,
               is a new criteria that companies must meet to get accredited under the 
              voluntary Clean Mark Accreditation Scheme.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The scheme will take effect in November and companies have until April next year to get accredited.<br><br>The
               scheme was set up in July 2010 to recognise companies that deliver high
               standards of cleaning by training workers and using equipment to 
              improve work processes, as well as ensure fair employment practices to 
              raise standards and professionalism in the cleaning industry.<br><br>Companies
               can apply for either the Clean Mark Silver or Clean Mark Gold award, 
              depending on their ability to fulfil the different sets of accreditation
               criteria.<br><br>The certification is valid for one year and the National Environment Agency (NEA) will assess them.<br><br>Other
               criteria have also been added, such paying salary through GIRO unless 
              otherwise requested by workers, as well as appointing a Productivity 
              Manager to improve work processes.<br><br>These managers will undergo a 
              customised training programme emphasising technology adoption and work 
              process redesign, developed by NEA together with the Workforce 
              Development Agency (WDA).<br><br>Other enhanced criteria state that a 
              company must not have defaulted on Labour Court Orders in the past 
              twelve months preceding the certification, and have attained 
              qualifications in the requisite bizSAFE courses.<br><br>The Ministry of 
              Manpower (MOM), NEA and WDA said in a joint statement on Friday that the
               enhanced accreditation scheme aims to help companies put in place 
              proper structures and systems, especially in human resources and 
              training.<br><br>The scheme will also increase the productivity of the 
              cleaning sector by encouraging companies to use technology and redesign 
              their work processes to optimise their manpower. <br><br>As the 
              government has earlier announced that it will eventually license all 
              cleaning companies, accredited cleaning companies will be better 
              prepared. Currently, there are 61 accredited service providers under 
              this scheme, most of which are medium to large firms.<br><br>But companies should not associate the enhanced criteria with higher costs.<br><br>Second
               Minister for Environment and Water Resources, Grace Fu, said: "If you 
              have a systematic way of going about your cleaning processes using the 
              right equipment, the right tools and solutions, I think you can improve 
              the personal productivity of the cleaner. And we hope the wages can go 
              up in tandem with productivity improvement, in tandem with training. So 
              this will help mitigate the rising wages and costs of cleaning 
              contracts."<br><br>To get more companies on board, WDA will commit S$6.1
               million towards training close to 8,000 cleaners for offices, shopping 
              centres, schools and hawkers centres over two years.<br><br>The labour movement also has schemes to help companies defray the cost of equipment.<br><br>A sum of S$9 million has been set aside under e2i's Inclusive Growth Programme.<br><br>The
               programme was launched in August 2010, it co-funds projects such as 
              purchase of equipment for automation, work processes re-engineering, 
              intellectual property rights registration, and workers training.<br><br>This is dispensed on condition that the company's productivity gains are shared with the workers.<br><br>Cleaning
               companies said that while the current accreditation scheme has resulted
               in more skilled workers, having to meet the enhanced criteria will have
               its challenges.<br><br>Mr Milton Ng, who is director of Ramky Cleantech
               Services, said: "I think the major challenge we face is the tight 
              labour market. As much as we want to train the workers, there are 
              insufficient time and shortages so we have to take staff out for 
              training which sometimes is a bit difficult."<br><br>He added: "It is 
              not impossible to achieve. But from an industry viewpoint, if all the 
              companies strive to do that, it will make this industry what I call a 
              'recession-free' industry - for people to continue to join this industry
               to find a good and decent paying job."<br><br>But Mr Ng hopes that efforts to professionalise the cleaning industry will go some way towards changing negative perceptions.<br><br>The
               cleaning industry, which has about 70,000 workers, has been plagued by 
              problems such as low wages, manpower shortages, and cheap-sourcing.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
