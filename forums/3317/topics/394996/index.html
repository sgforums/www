              <div class="story_headline2">STOMPer Christine is upset with how a Cathay Pacific 
              staff was mocking a girl for her Singaporean accent, saying that she had
               awful English, and posting the comments on a public website.<br><br>Said
               the STOMPer:<br><br>"An overseas friend of mine alerted me to a current
               campaign by Cathay Pacific.<br><br>"A purser with Cathay is recounting 
              how she was inspired by a Singaporean girl whom she met while studying 
              in USA.<br><br>"An excerpt of her comment is as follows: '....even 
              though her English was horrible with a strong Singaporean accent...'<br><br>"Not
               sure about the rest of you but I was rather livid when I read that. 
              Firstly, I think Singaporeans are English educated and when the 
              situation calls for it, we are capable of speaking proper English.<br><br>"I
               have lived overseas for the last 10 years and never had a problem 
              because I always made it a point not to speak Singlish unless I am with 
              Singaporeans.<br><br>"Secondly, I am amazed that Cathay saw it fit on a 
              professional level to post such a comment on a global campaign.<br><br>"I
               am Singaporean and I am not ashamed of my Singaporean accent or 
              speaking in Singlish with my Singaporean friends.<br><br>"I have never 
              lost the accent although I have lived away for so long. It makes me feel
               closer to home everytime I get to speak Singlish with people who 
              understands me. Like it or not, Singlish is part of being a Singaporean.<br><br>"Makes
               me wonder if I ever take a flight with Cathay and the staff is the 
              Purser on the flight, would she then judge me for my 'bad' English?<br><br>"Or
               perhaps she will congratulate me on my good English although I am 
              Singaporean? <br><br>"I cannot help but wonder, in the even of an 
              emergency, would she be able to understand and help me despite my 
              Singaporean accent?<br><br>"No prize for guessing. I will never travel 
              Cathay again. I think I am better off travelling with an airline that 
              respects my accent."</div>

              <p>I don't think the Singaporean was mocked.</p>
              <p>If fact the Singaporean was given kudos, dispite the fact that she speaks awful English. She spoke up as best she could with what she could master of her English. This was what was commented on by the CP staff.</p>
              <p><em>"A purser with Cathay is recounting how she was inspired by a Singaporean girl whom she met while studying in USA."</em></p>
              <p>Poor English did not hamper her confidence in speaking up. That was the lesson learnt by the purser.</p>
              <p>I think the stomper stomped herself.</p>

              <p><strong>Is this anti-social behaviour?</strong></p>
              <p>NETIZENS are up in arms over a Cathay Pacific campaign which 
              showcases a staff member from the airline saying that a Singaporean 
              woman's spoken English sounded awful because of her 'really strong 
              Singaporean accent'.</p>
              <p>While some STOMPers urged their fellow netizens to take the 
              advertisement in a light-hearted manner, others felt it was offensive to
               our local culture.</p>
              <p>Attitudes were also divided when it came to the issue of 
              giving up one's seat on public transport to those in need.</p>
              <p>One STOMPer recounted how a fellow passenger demanded she 
              give up her seat to his pregnant wife even though she was pregnant 
              herself. Another applauded a fellow passenger for giving up his seat to a
               pregnant lady even though his friends made fun of him.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, STOMPers flocked to the story of a teenaged 
              couple who had no qualms about showing off their love on the streets and
               made out openly in broad daylight.</p>
