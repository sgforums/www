              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: It appears that fewer Members of Parliament are holding company directorships now compared to in the past.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Email queries to 52 backbenchers, including the six elected Opposition MPs, found that 16 hold such positions. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In 2005, 26 were directors in public listed companies alone, a survey by The Business Times had found. <br><br>Latest
               records on the Singapore Exchange's web portal and the Bloomberg's 
              database show that only five elected MPs now are directors in listed 
              companies.<br><br>MediaCorp's survey comes after Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong issued his rules of prudence letter two weeks ago to new and
               existing People's Action Party MPs. In it, he had advised them to 
              conduct such business activities creditably.<br><br>And while 19 MPs did
               not reply or declined comment for this story, those who did shared the 
              kind of consideration that has gone into their decisions on 
              directorships.<br><br>For half of them, these are roles they assume 
              simply by virtue of where they work. Joo Chiat MP Charles Chong, for 
              instance, is a director in two joint ventures under his employer SIA 
              Engineering, while Jurong Group Representation Constituency MP David Ong
               is the business owner and managing director of RedDot Publishing.<br><br>Meanwhile, more than half of those with no directorships are first-term PAP MPs. <br><br>Several
               new MPs, including lawyer Edwin Tong and unionist Zainal Sapari, said 
              their current priority is their constituents, although they might make 
              exceptions for directorships on non-profit organisations.<br><br>West 
              Coast GRC MP Foo Mee Har, who heads Standard Chartered Bank's priority 
              and international banking, told MediaCorp she made a "personal decision"
               to step down from a board position before the polls to dedicate her 
              time to understanding her constituency and grassroots organisations.<br><br>For
               her GRC colleague Arthur Fong, corporate considerations came into play:
               The Credit Suisse banker and three-term MP, who has held no 
              directorship for the past 10 years, said he made the choice as companies
               may potentially have investment banking relationships with his 
              employer.<br><br>Offering a different view, though, was Pasir-Ris 
              Punggol GRC MP Gan Thiam Poh, whose employer DBS Bank had to approve his
               directorship at public-listed Ouhua Energy Holdings even before he 
              entered politics. <br><br>While he said his foremost priority is his 
              constituency, Mr Gan said he was open to directorships that would offer 
              him the exposure and skills to help him "effectively serve the 
              residents".<br><br>But the days when some backbenchers held numerous listed directorships seem to be over.<br><br>At
               the moment, Potong Pasir MP Sitoh Yih Pin holds the highest number, 
              six, followed by Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Yeo Guat Kwang with five and Marine 
              Parade GRC MP Seah Kian Peng with two. <br><br>In the past, former PAP 
              MPs such as Messrs Wang Kai Yuen and Ong Kian Min held as many as 11 
              directorships in listed companies during their political tenure.<br><br>To
               corporate governance observer Mak Yuen Teen, who has spoken publicly 
              against excessive listed directorships by MPs, it seems that "PM's words
               are filtering through". <br><br>The National University of Singapore 
              Business School associate professor noted that MPs who held several 
              listed directorships have retired in the last two elections: "I hope it 
              was (part of PM's consideration for renewal)."<br><br>But Singapore 
              Management University associate professor of finance Annie Koh offered 
              another reason for the smaller scale of directorships now: The youth and
               non-exposure of newer MPs, many of whom were also from the public 
              sector and labour movement.<br><br>"You can't be invited to any board if
               you haven't had a level of experience in order to advise companies 
              accordingly ... If you're young, the likelihood of you being asked to be
               a director is less high," said Assoc Prof Koh, who is also SMU's dean 
              of executive and professional education.<br><br>Still, given some 
              companies' "misconceived notion" that having MPs on board "can open 
              doors", she expects offers to come in for the new MPs over time. <br><br>"But
               everyone is under watch these days with the power of media and social 
              media ... People are even more conscious (especially) if there's a 
              chance that anything might lead to a misinterpretation," she said. </span></span></p>
