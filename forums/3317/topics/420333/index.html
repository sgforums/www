              â€œItâ€™s brutality, not just an injustice,â€� says human rights lawyer M. Ravi on the Thaipusam guidelines that were made public for the first time this month.
              
              Among others, the guidelines prohibit the playing of recorded music or the sounding of gongs or drums during the procession.
              
              The annual festival sees tens of thousands of Hindus give thanks to Lord Murugan, an important Hindu deity.
              
              The lawyer said on Friday he has filed an originating summon against the Attorney Generalâ€™s Chambers (AGC) and Hindu Endowment Board (HEB) over the guidelines.
              
              According to the document, Mr Ravi claims the guidelines are in breach of minority rights, guaranteed under Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.
              
              He further claims, the guidelines violate the fundamental rights to freedom of speech, assembly and expression of Hindu devotees participating in Thaipusam.
              
              Mr Ravi told reporters he plans to raise the issue to the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights as a form of protest.
              
              On Jan 6, guidelines regulating the Thaipusam procession â€” a 4km parade that starts from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road and ends at Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in Tank Road â€“ were made public for the first time by the HEB.
              
              Participants in the Jan 20 procession are prohibited from playing recorded music or sounding gongs or drums, from painting their faces, bodies or wearing any form of disguise, and from shouting or unruly behaviour. Singing religious hymns relevant to the festival is permitted.
              
              Participants who fail to comply may be refused permission to participate in the current and future Thaipusam processions. They may also be liable to prosecution including a fine of up to S$5,000 under the Public Order Act.
              
              â€œThere is a need to be a democratic voice in HEB to speak the peopleâ€™s concerns,â€� said Mr Ravi, who has participated in the festival. The published guidelines resulted in devotees turning to HEB for clarification, and The Straits Times received 10 letters from readers expressing disappointment.
              
              â€œThere are so many regulations. We have no noise, no expression, everything has been denied in this country,â€� said Mr Ravi.
              
              When contacted by Yahoo! Singapore, the AGC and HED declined to comment.
              
              Meanwhile, the AGC has applied to the Supreme Court to strike out the lawsuit filed by Mr Raviâ€™s client ex-Internal Security Act detainee Michael Fernandez, who is suing for damages arising from alleged torture during his detention.
              
              It argued that the lawsuit discloses no reasonable cause for such action to be taken against the Attorney-General. The AGC also claimed the suit is frivolous or vexatious, and that the suit is an abuse of the process of the court.
