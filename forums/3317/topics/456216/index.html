              <p>The thawed ice area jumped from 40% of the ice sheet to 97% in just four days from 8 July. According to ice core records, such pronounced melting at Summit station and across the ice sheet has not occurred since 1889.</p>

              <div id="answerImproveLinkContainer" class="improve"></div>
              <div id="editorText" class="answer_text">The level of the world's 
              oceans will rise. But this is not the real problem, the problem is that 
              these white ice caps reflect sunlight, much of which is reflected back 
              into space, in turn cooling earth, but with the ice caps melting, the 
              only reflector is the ocean, darker color absorbs sunlight causing 
              further warming of the earth which can be up to 80 °C which is fatal and
               can cause extinction of all living organisms. <br>
              <ul>
              <li>If all the ice melted, north and south pole, Antarctica, Greenland, and all, sea levels would rise between 175 and 225 feet.</li>
              <li>Coastal
               areas would essentially disappear, and roughly a third of the earth's 
              existing landmass would be submerged. it is estimated that 60% of the 
              world's population lives in the coastal plains.</li>
              <li>Many inland areas would be affected as well, as water tables, rivers, and lakes would all rise from their previous heights.</li>
              </ul>
              <br> The melting of the north polar cap would not appreciably increase the 
              volume of water in the oceans, since the north polar cap is resting on 
              the water and not on the land. It would decrease the salinity of the 
              oceans, however, and this would cause some serious problems. The melting
               of the south polar cap, which rests on the continent of Antarctica, 
              would add a great deal of water to the oceans and help to raise sea 
              level, as well as contributing to lower salinity. The melting of the 
              glaciers of Greenland would also significantly raise sea level. <br><br> My sister lives at 6 feet, and the tide gets closer to her home every 
              year. In some countries it is devastating. In places like Bangladesh it 
              leaves thousands without homes or farmland. <br><br> When the whole 
              North Pole is melted, the water will rise not at all, because floating 
              ice doesn't change sea level, but when Greenland and Antarctica melt it 
              may raise sea levels around 7 or 8 metres. This will flood sea countries
               like the Netherlands so that half of the Netherlands will disappear 
              under the sea level. <br>
              <ul>
              <li>The sea levels will start to rise</li>
              <li>If the ice-caps melt the ecosystem will go out of balance</li>
              <li>Temperature will get hotter in the coldest places in the world.(That are meant to be cold.)</li>
              </ul>
              <br> The animals that live in the cold (polar bears, penguins, and arctic foxes) will become endangered.</div>

              <p>Climate change and associated sea level rise pose serious ethical
                    challenges. Emissions generated today will have ascending adverse
                    effects on generations yet to be born. Likewise many of the countries
                    most affected by climate change or sea level rise are small island
                    states whose per capita and total emissions are quite small.
                    Even in industrial countries such as the United States weather
                    related disasters are likely to affect the poor more than others.
                    The likely social injustice inherent in disruptive climate change
                    was a central theme of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops
                    in their Statement on Global Warming issued in 2001.The very
                    powerful and recently released film, <a href="http://www.thegreatwarming.com/revrichardcizik.html">The
                      Great Warming</a>, highlights
                    this theme. Rev. Richard Cizik,  Vice
                    President for Governmental Affairs of the National Association
                    of Evangelicals, stresses the importance of “Creation Care” —  preserving
                    the environment for future generations. He notes:</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 50px;">Because God doesn’t intend to ask me, “Rich, how
                    did I create the Earth?” He won’t ask me that. He’ll
                    say  “Rich, what did you do to protect that which I created? ” And
                    that is an awesome question that deserves a good answer.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 50px;">There is a natural link between the Creation Care, Social Justice
                    and individual personal accountability themes of our major faiths
                    that may impel believers of many diverse theological perspectives
                    to support efforts abroad such as energy transformation efforts
                    in small island nations or coastal protection efforts in both
                    island states and low lying nations such as Bangladesh and Indonesia.
                    The recently launched <a href="http://www.climate.org/programs/pr_eic_20050114.shtml">Endangered
                      Islands Campaign</a> seeks
                    to link island nations that are pioneering in innovative approaches
                    to climate protection with research and technical institutions
                    abroad and university and religious groups that are encouraging
                    carbon offsets as a sign of their ethical or religious commitment.
                    Ultimately success in achieving a stabilization of global greenhouse
                    gas concentrations may be realized both through entrepreneurial
                    innovation and through individuals recognizing the wisdom of
                    Walt Kelly’s possum, Pogo,  “We have met the enemy
                    and he is us” and then acting through their faith or ethical
                    perspectives to right themselves with future generations and
                    their own Creator or conscience.</p>
