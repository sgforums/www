              <p class="first">WASHINGTON (AFP) - - Major US, Canadian and British
              life and health insurance companies have billions of dollars invested
              in tobacco companies, a study published Wednesday in the New England
              Journal of Medicine said.</p>
              <p>Wesley Boyd, the study's lead author, found that at least 4.4
              billion dollars in insurance company funds are invested in companies
              whose affiliates produce cigarettes, cigars and chewing tobacco.</p>
              <p>"Despite
              calls upon the insurance industry to get out of the tobacco business by
              physicians and others, insurers continue to put their profits above
              people's health," said Boyd, a faculty member of Harvard Medical School.</p>
              <p>"It's clear their top priority is making money, not safeguarding people's well-being," he wrote.</p>
              <p>Tobacco
              is considered the leading cause of lung cancer and a major risk factor
              for heart attack, stroke, pulmonary disease and cancer.</p>
              <p>According to the World Health Organization, it is a contributing factor in 5.4 million deaths a year.</p>
              <p>Researchers
              first revealed that health and life insurance companies had major
              investments in tobacco companies in 1995 in an article in the British
              medical journal Lancet.</p>
              <p>"Although investing in tobacco while
              selling life or health insurance may seem self-defeating, insurance
              firms have figured out ways to profit from both," Boyd wrote.</p>
              <p>"Insurers
              exclude smokers from coverage or, more commonly, charge them higher
              premiums. Insurers profit -- and smokers lose -- twice over."</p>
              <p>According
              to the study, US insurer Prudential Financial Inc. has 264.3 million
              dollars invested among three US tobacco companies, including Reynolds
              America and Philip Morris.</p>
              <p>Canadian insurer Sun Life Financial
              Inc., which sells life, disability and health insurance, has a stock
              portfolio with more than one billion dollars in two tobacco companies,
              including 890 million dollars in Philip Morris.</p>
              <p>Prudential Plc,
              which sells health and disability insurance, has 1.38 billion dollars
              in two tobacco companies, including British American Tobacco.</p>
              <p>The
              study also details the substantial tobacco investments of the US firms
              Northwestern Mutual and Massachusetts Mutual Life, and the Scottish
              firm Standard Life Plc.</p>

              <p>Insurance companies have to invest in all sorts of companies as it has to balance the payouts and the profits. I don't think "I<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">nsurers continue to put their profits above people's health" as Insurance companies main objective are not here to encourage people to live healthy lifestyles, it's primary objective is to insure people and give payouts when accidents and deaths occurs.</span></p>

Insurers profit -- and smokers lose -- twice over."" - the news article seem biased, and writes "smokers lose", which is not a full coverage as all other persons with high risk are underwritten specially</span></p>
