              <p><strong>Myanmar allegations highlight Singapore bank secrecy</strong></p>
              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>SINGAPORE (AFP) â€“ 
              Allegations that Myanmar's junta is stashing billions of dollars in <span id="lw_1253081985_0" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span> have thrown a spotlight on banking secrecy in the city-state, which strongly denies being a haven for <span id="lw_1253081985_1" class="yshortcuts">hot money</span>.</p>
              <p>US-based <span id="lw_1253081985_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">human rights group</span> EarthRights International says that energy majors Total and Chevron are
              propping up the sanctions-hit Myanmar military regime with profits from
              a gas project totalling nearly <span id="lw_1253081985_3" class="yshortcuts">five billion dollars</span>.</p>
              <p>Total and Chevron have rejected the charge and two Singapore banks
              named in the ERI report as the repositories for most of the money --
              the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. (<span id="lw_1253081985_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">OCBC</span>) and DBS -- have dismissed it as false and baseless.</p>
              <p>In a written reply to media queries on the <span id="lw_1253081985_5" class="yshortcuts">Myanmar</span> funds, the <span id="lw_1253081985_6" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Monetary Authority of Singapore</span> (MAS) said it requires <span id="lw_1253081985_7" class="yshortcuts">financial institutions</span> to have tough controls in place to fight money laundering and financing of terrorism.</p>
              <p>"This includes procedures to identify and know their customers, and to monitor and report any suspicious transactions," it said.</p>
              <p>Singapore is also amending its tax laws in cooperation with
              industrialised nations that are pursuing citizens who deposit their
              money in overseas banks.</p>
              <p>But <span id="lw_1253081985_8" class="yshortcuts">Transparency International</span>,
              which like many other corruption monitors ranks Singapore highly for
              its clean and efficient government, said the city-state should promote
              greater transparency in its financial system.</p>
              <p>"As long as no one wants to know where the money is coming from, it
              will be easy to hide money on which taxes should have been paid, but
              most importantly, money that should have been invested in a given
              country or programme," a spokesperson for the Berlin-based group told
              AFP.</p>
              <p>Wealthy Asians regard Singapore as the <span id="lw_1253081985_9" class="yshortcuts">Switzerland</span> of Asia, a rock-solid <span id="lw_1253081985_10" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">financial centre</span> where savings can be kept safely and discreetly. But critics say some of the money comes from unsavoury sources.</p>
              <p>Officials in neighbouring Indonesia are trying to recover tens of
              millions of dollars allegedly stashed in Singapore during the rule of
              the late dictator Suharto.</p>
              <p>And rival Philippine groups are suing to gain control over more than 25
              million US dollars that formerly belonged to the family of the late
              dictator <span id="lw_1253081985_11" class="yshortcuts">Ferdinand Marcos</span> and is currently frozen in an <span id="lw_1253081985_12" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">offshore bank</span> in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"It has been documented time and again that corrupt individuals -- be
              they politicians, business executives or wealthy citizens -- have used
              countries like Singapore as <span id="lw_1253081985_13" class="yshortcuts">safe havens</span> to stash their ill-gotten funds," the Transparency spokesperson said.</p>
              <p>There is growing pressure meanwhile on <span id="lw_1253081985_14" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">international banks</span> to help governments recover taxes on assets kept overseas by their citizens.</p>
              <p>Swiss banking giant UBS recently forged a landmark deal with Washington
              to reveal the names of some 4,450 American clients suspected of hiding
              assets from US tax authorities.</p>
              <p>That broke the cherished code of secrecy that underpins the super-rich European nation's banking system.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, the Organisation for <span id="lw_1253081985_15" class="yshortcuts">Economic Cooperation and Development</span> included Singapore on a <span id="lw_1253081985_16" class="yshortcuts">list of countries</span> that have not yet fully implemented standards on the exchange of tax data needed to pursue suspected evaders.</p>
              <p>Singapore's government promised to amend its laws and negotiate <span id="lw_1253081985_17" class="yshortcuts">new tax treaties</span> to implement standards set by the OECD, the Paris-based club of <span id="lw_1253081985_18" class="yshortcuts">industrial nations</span>.</p>
              <p>The government submitted a bill in parliament on Monday aimed at
              improving how the island shares information with countries with which
              it has agreements to prevent <span id="lw_1253081985_19" class="yshortcuts">double taxation</span>.</p>
              <p>In 2007, the last year for when official figures are available, <span id="lw_1253081985_20" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">assets under management</span> in Singapore totalled 814 billion US dollars, up 32 percent from 2006. About 86 percent is from foreign sources.</p>
              <p>The MAS, Singapore's de facto central bank, insists that investors including institutional and <span id="lw_1253081985_21" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">professional fund managers</span> have sound reasons for parking their money here.</p>
              <p>"Singapore's growth and development as a <span id="lw_1253081985_22" class="yshortcuts">wealth management centre</span> is underpinned by high standards of <span id="lw_1253081985_23" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">financial regulation</span> and strict supervision," it said after UBS announced its deal with the US government.</p>
