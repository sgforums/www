              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's economy contracted by 1.1 per cent on a 
              quarter-on-quarter basis in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the 
              9.4 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>On a year-on-year 
              basis, the economy grew at a modest pace of 1.9 per cent, following the 
              1.4 per cent growth in the previous quarter. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is according to advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Friday. <br><br>The
               MTI said in its statement that the weakened growth momentum in the 
              second quarter was mainly due to a sequential contraction in the 
              manufacturing sector. <br><br>The manufacturing sector declined by 6.0 per cent, reversing the 20.9 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter. <br><br>Growth
               in the services-producing industries remained modest, at 1.0 per cent 
              on a year-on-year basis, following the 1.9 per cent growth in the 
              previous quarter. This was mainly due to contraction in the wholesale 
              and retail trade, as well as the finance and insurance sectors. <br><br>While
               some experts raised concerns of a technical recession in the third 
              quarter, most said that Singapore will continue to see full-year growth 
              that is close to the government's official forecast of between 1 per 
              cent and 3 per cent. <br><br>The manufacturing sector was the weakest 
              link last quarter, but for Aldon Technologies, a vendor providing 
              smartphone components to the semiconductor industry, business has been 
              brisk. <br><br>Allen Ang, group managing director of Aldon Technologies,
               said: "We have secured a few new projects, coming from our 
              semiconductor customers who are implementing their cost containment and 
              productivity improvement projects...We are pretty optimistic about 
              business for the next half of the year." <br><br>Despite the pessimistic
               outlook for the electronics cluster next quarter, experts said 
              manufacturers that supply component parts to support the production of 
              smartphones and other mobile devices will continue to fare better than 
              others. <br><br>Still, external factors will continue to weigh heavily on the manufacturing sector. <br><br>Satish
               Lele, vice president for Asia Pacific at Frost &amp; Sullivan, said: 
              "Overall manufacturing will continue to be not so strong and will 
              continue to follow the trend in the second quarter. China is slowing 
              down particularly in manufacturing, India is slowing down much faster, 
              and of course, US and Europe are not doing well since the beginning of 
              the year, so all this is compounding the whole issue as far as 
              manufacturing is concerned." <br><br>Meanwhile, a drop in biomedical manufacturing output also more than offset gains in the transport engineering cluster. <br><br>But some economists are confident that the biomedical cluster will rebound. <br><br>Irvin
               Seah, senior economist at DBS Bank, said: "In the third quarter of this
               year, we will probably see a benign positive quarter-on-quarter growth 
              because we could see a ramp-up in pharmaceutical production. Do bear in 
              mind that because of the cyclical and volatile nature of this particular
               segment, a down cycle in the pharmaceutical industry usually won't last
               more than one quarter." <br><br>Meanwhile, Trade and Industry Minister 
              Lim Hng Kiang said he is confident Singapore's economy will grow in line
               with the official estimates of between 1 per cent and 3 per cent for 
              the entire year. <br><br>Speaking on the sidelines at the opening of a 
              research facility on Friday, Mr Lim said the eurozone debt crisis and 
              the economic slowdown in China and the US had impacted Singapore's 
              economy in the last quarter. <br><br>But Mr Lim remains optimistic for 
              the year because leading economic indicators in Singapore are steady, 
              while business confidence is high. <br><br>He said: "For electronics, we
               are still quite positive because if you look at the book-to-sales 
              ratio, it is still above one. So that is very positive. <br><br>"The 
              slowdown this second quarter is the result of the very volatile 
              biomedical sector. This is part and parcel of our landscape. The biomed 
              sector will recover for the rest of the year." <br><br>- CNA/de/ms</span></span></p>
