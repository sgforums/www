              <p>SINGAPORE: The former president of the
              Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), Ms Josie Lau, has
              left DBS Bank and joined hospitality group Overseas Union Enterprise
              (OUE).</p>
              <p>She is now vice—president for centre management at
              Mandarin Gallery, where she oversees operations and marketing for the
              new premier shopping mall, Weekend TODAY has learnt.</p>
              <p>The
              48—year—old was thrust into the limelight in March, when she became
              embroiled in a leadership tussle at Aware. Her decision to take on the
              role of president of the women’s advocacy group earned her a public
              rebuke from DBS for ignoring its code of conduct.</p>
              <p>At the time,
              she was DBS’ head of marketing, cards and unsecured loans, becoming its
              vice—president for network planning and deployment in May prior to her
              resignation.</p>
              <p>Ms Lau, who started her new job on Thursday, said
              she took it because it "allows me to leverage on all my past work
              experience and my love for fashion retail and marketing".</p>
              <p>OUE
              chief executive Thio Gim Hock said Ms Lau had "expressed her desire to
              look for new pastures", and he felt she might be suitable for the post.
              "I asked her to send in her CV and forwarded (it) to the senior
              vice—president (of) leasing, who interviewed her."</p>
              <p>Mr Thio is
              married to lawyer Thio Su Mien, who had encouraged Ms Lau to get
              involved in Aware. They attend the same church, but Ms Lau stressed her
              hiring was "based on my merit".</p>
              <p>Likewise Mr Thio — who has
              known Ms Lau, "though not very well", for over 10 years — said: "It’s
              easier and more desirable to employ people you already know ... Her
              getting the job was entirely due to her experience, qualification and
              personality."</p>
              <p>Mr Thio also noted Ms Lau’s "traumatic
              experience" during the Aware saga which included "having her employer
              threatening to sack her".</p>
              <p>When contacted, a DBS spokesman
              said: "Ms Lau decided to leave DBS to pursue other opportunities. It
              was a personal decision, and we wish her the best in her new
              endeavours."</p>
