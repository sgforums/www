              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A fee increase is in the pipeline at some People's 
                  Action Party (PAP) Community Foundation (PCF) kindergartens and 
                  childcare centres, especially those which are losing money.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>While fees will not 
                  increase "across the board", a PCF spokesperson told MediaCorp that a 
                  PCF branch may consider doing so with justifications such as new 
                  curricula or special programmes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The spokesperson 
                  said in an email reply: "The need to increase fees is based on the 
                  branch's finances. Sometimes, the fund-raising efforts by the advisers 
                  help to cover the cost of operations. But this is not the long-term 
                  solution."<br><br>She added: "Sometimes, unavoidably, the fees have to 
                  increase a little to help cover the cost of operations. Hence, fee 
                  increase, if any, is made by the branch, and not PCF-wide." <br><br>The 
                  PCF, the largest operator with about six in 10 of pre-school children 
                  here on its books, has 240 kindergartens and 65 childcare centres spread
                   across 87 branches in Singapore. Fees ranged from S$90 to S$120 per 
                  month as of August last year.<br><br>Its response came after Senior 
                  Minister of State Grace Fu told MediaCorp that fees at the Yuhua PCF 
                  centres, where she is branch chairperson, needed to be set at "a 
                  sustainable level".<br><br>Nursery classes there cost S$105, which she 
                  said was "lower than many operators", even though it has been raising 
                  the pay of its teachers to attract those with better qualifications. She
                   added that it has also spent S$800,000 over the last three years to 
                  upgrade its centres.<br><br>Ms Fu, who met with the staff last week, 
                  said the Yuhua PCF reviews its fees annually before the start of 
                  enrolment. She said: "We expect our operations to be slightly in the red
                   this financial year. Our fees will have to be set at a sustainable 
                  level to keep the operations going. We'll ensure that parents who have 
                  financial difficulties are helped to keep their children in our 
                  centres."<br><br>Woodlands PCF, which has eight kindergartens and one 
                  childcare centre, is another branch where a fee increase is being 
                  considered, said Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) 
                  Member of Parliament Ellen Lee.<br><br>Said Ms Lee: "The fees that we're
                   collecting from parents aren't really sustainable in the long term to 
                  keep up with the expenses we have to incur in terms of ... salaries and 
                  improvements we made for the centres." <br><br>While she is for the idea
                   of raising fees, the question is when, she said, noting that the branch
                   will have to be cognisant of the "general climate" and complaints about
                   cost of living.<br><br>She added: "We're trying to hold out as long as 
                  we could but, say, what if we start to lose teachers because we can't 
                  pay ... There's so much poaching going on." <br><br>Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC
                   MP Hri Kumar, who agrees on the need for sustainability, said raising 
                  fees is always an option for his Thomson PCF branches, although no 
                  decision has been made yet. <br><br>Still, some are not considering fee 
                  hikes. PCF centres at Keat Hong branch in Chua Chu Kang GRC started 
                  breaking even last year, for instance. MP Zaqy Mohamed attributed this 
                  to a different business model: Benchmarking teachers' key performance 
                  indicators to enrolment figures and adopting more innovative programmes.<br><br>He said this would stave off a fee increase "for at least a few years".<br><br>One
                   parent whose children are in PCF expressed his reservations of a 
                  possible fee hike. Mr Shawn Koh, a private tutor and father of three, 
                  said: "If they want to further increase fees, there may be parents who 
                  withdraw completely from kindergarten education."<br><br>He added that most parents who send their children to PCF are those "who can't afford" the fees of private kindergartens.<br><br>The
                   PCF spokesperson said it will help in the application of financial 
                  assistance and parents would be informed of any fee increase about three
                   months in advance.<br><br>The last major round of increase, by 50-odd PCF branches, was in 2008, due to rising operating costs. </span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Kebun Baru PCF kindergarten to raise fees for PRs, foreigners</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Even as some PAP Community Foundation (PCF) branches 
              mull over a possible fee increase for its kindergartens and childcare 
              centres, at least one branch will go ahead with a fee hike - but only 
              for its foreign enrolment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Kebun Baru PCF's two
               centres will increase fees by S$10 and S$20 from next month for 
              children of permanent residents (PRs) and foreigners, respectively.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>PRs will pay between
               S$110 and S$130 for nursery fees at the two centres and between $120 
              and $140 if their child is in kindergarten. For foreigners, the new fees
               are between S$140 and S$160 and between S$150 and S$170, respectively.<br><br>Letters
               signed by the branch administrator informing parents of the revised 
              fees, which MediaCorp obtained a copy of, were sent out as early as 
              April.<br><br>Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Member 
              of Parliament Inderjit Singh, the chairperson of Kebun Baru PCF, said 
              the decision was made last year at the GRC level.<br><br>"We want to 
              differentiate what we're charging to locals and foreigners. Costs have 
              gone up, and to keep PCF education as affordable as possible for 
              Singaporeans, I think we need to ... have it more differentiated," he 
              told MediaCorp.<br><br>The fee gap from next month at Kebun Baru will be
               as much as S$50 a month. But it remains to be seen if this will stave 
              off any fee hike for local children. <br><br>Mr Singh said the branch 
              will still have to review operations routinely, that is, every six 
              months. With teacher salaries forming the bulk of its costs and as wages
               increase in general, the branch will look at fees as part of its 
              reviews, said Mr Singh, who noted that PRs and foreigners form a small 
              proportion - about 5 per cent - of total intake at Kebun Baru.<br><br>In
               fact, the small proportion of foreign pupils is one factor that other 
              branches might take into consideration. Sembawang GRC MP Ellen Lee said:
               "If the numbers (of foreign intake) are very far and few between, is 
              there a need to have this differentiation?" <br><br>Ms Lee's Woodlands 
              PCF branch is among the centres considering whether to charge more to 
              cover costs, as reported yesterday in Today, and she said that falling 
              enrolment is another factor against greater fee differentiation.<br><br>"If
               there's going to be shortage of places, then you can give priority to 
              Singaporeans ... (but) how much can you recover if the enrolment is so 
              small? I don't think we need to necessarily create any difficulties," 
              she said.</span></span></p>
