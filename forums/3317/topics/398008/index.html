              <p>"Ana raicha Al Qaeda" is colloquial for "I'm going to the
               toilet". A very common and widespread use of the word "Al-Qaeda" in 
              different Arab countries in the public language is for the toilet bowl. 
               This name comes from the Arabic verb "Qa'ada" which mean "to sit", 
              pertinently, on the "Toilet Bowl". In most Arabs homes there are two 
              kinds of toilets: "Al-Qaeda" also called the "Hamam Franji" or foreign 
              toilet, and "Hamam Arabi" or "Arab toilet" which is a hole in the 
              ground. Lest we forget it, the potty used by small children is called 
              "Ma Qa'adia" or "Little Qaeda".</p>
              <p>So, if you were forming a terrorist group, would you call
               yourself, "The Toilet"?</p>

              <p><strong>Al-Qaeda </strong>is something like a group for muslims. their organisations includes things like football club, schools, basically like they have their own world, they play, eat, sleep, study right in Al-Qaeda groups. They recruit people based on relationships. Like family, friends, colleagues. They are basically a group of "peaceful" people like you and me, except that they believe in suicide bombing as well. The people in Middle East already treat those bombings like "normal" since at some part of the country, it happens once every 2-3 days. Just that it wasn't in the news. Sad, but true. Why they become so well known is because of the start of 911.</p>

              <p>there are also ex-ministers from Italy, Germany and France saying the same thing about Al-Qaeda..................</p>
              <p>think about it......................</p>
              <p>why is it that these terrorists never made an attempt on the lives of Western leaders especially the US president even after they threatened to do so ?</p>
              <p>why these muslim terrorists make most of their attacks in muslim countries and killing mostly fellow muslims..............?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>JI may be false too becoz that former blind president of Indonesia have said there are no terrorists in Indonesia and that the generals were responsible for the ''attacks'' so they can pocket money given to them to fight terrorism.</p>
