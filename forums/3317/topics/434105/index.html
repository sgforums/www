              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: More employers are sending their maids to upgrade 
              their skills, going by the ten-fold increase in the number of foreign 
              domestic workers (FDWs) at classes organised by the Foreign Domestic 
              Worker Association for Skills Training (FAST).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>When FAST started 
              organising such training in 2005, only 300 FDWs participated. The figure
               has increased to about 3,000 annually for the past couple of years. To 
              date, more than 16,000 FDWs have been trained in areas such as cooking, 
              baby care and computer literacy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>There are about 
              201,000 maids in Singapore, or about one in six households. However, the
               task to upgrade their skills - and offer the women better opportunities
               in life - is an uphill one.<br><br>The non-profit organisation said on 
              Sunday that it is tough getting corporate sponsors as this particular 
              cause is low on companies' list of priorities when it comes to corporate
               social responsibility efforts.<br><br>FAST president Seah Seng Choon 
              said: "(Companies have) been approached by so many non-government 
              organisations for worthy causes ... we just hope they can give us a part
               of their donation budget, so we can also do our part to enhance the 
              well-being of the foreign domestic workers."<br><br>FAST's main source 
              of funding is from the Lee Foundation. It is hoping that more companies 
              and individuals will support its cause. Otherwise, the number of courses
               or classes it offers could be cut.<br><br>Each course is subsidised 
              between S$4 and S$32 per hour. For example, maids or their employers pay
               about S$5 for a half-day cooking class and S$47.70 for a one-day 
              computer course.<br><br>Yesterday, FAST received a S$100,000 donation from Keppel Corporation.<br><br>Mr
               Seah said they have identified more corporations to approach for 
              donations but Keppel was the first to come on board. The company will 
              also help to raise awareness among its employees to encourage them to 
              send their FDWs for training.<br><br>Mr William Chew, vice-president of 
              FAST, said such lessons could enhance the maids' economic opportunities 
              when they return to their homeland. He related the story of a maid who, 
              after attending a financial training programme, was able to invest in 
              buffalos when she returned to the Philippines.<br><br>"Beyond learning and training, it also provides the domestic helper opportunities for a better quality of life," said Mr Chew. </span></span></p>
