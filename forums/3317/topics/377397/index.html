              <p> </p>
              <p>JAKARTA, Indonesia – Witnesses and media say a powerful earthquake
                      hit western Indonesia, toppling buildings, cutting electricity and
                      causing at least several injuries.</p>
              <p>The <span id="lw_1254312650_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">U.S. Geological Survey</span> said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.9, and struck 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the coast of <span id="lw_1254312650_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Sumatra</span>. The quake was along the same <span id="lw_1254312650_2" class="yshortcuts">fault line</span> that spawned the massive 2004 India Ocean tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people.</p>
              <p>A tsunami warning for countries along the <span id="lw_1254312650_3" class="yshortcuts">Indian Ocean</span> was issued after the temblor struck early evening Wednesday and then lifted about an hour-and-a-half later.</p>
              <p>Witnesses told local television and radio that hundreds of houses collapsed and that a road to the coastal town of <span id="lw_1254312650_4" class="yshortcuts">Padang</span> was cut off.</p>
              <p>Witnesses reported at least several injuries.</p>
              <p>THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1254312650_5" class="yshortcuts">JAKARTA, Indonesia</span> (AP) — A powerful underwater earthquake rocked western Indonesia
                      Wednesday, triggering a tsunami alert for countries along the Indian
                      Ocean and sending panicked residents out of their houses.</p>
              <p>The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.9. An <span id="lw_1254312650_6" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Indonesian television network</span> reported that buildings had collapsed in the coastal city of Padang, in Southern Sumatra province.</p>
              <p>Indonesia's
                      meteorological agency said the quake had a preliminary magnitude at 7.6
                      and hit 30 miles (50 kilometers) off the coast of Padang, along the
                      same fault line the spawned the massive 2004 Asian tsunami that killed
                      more than 230,000 in a dozen countries.</p>
              <p>The <span id="lw_1254312650_7" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Pacific Tsunami Warning Center</span> issued a tsunami alert for Indonesia, Malaysia, India and <span id="lw_1254312650_8" class="yshortcuts">Thailand</span>.</p>
              <p>"There is a possibility of a destructive regional tsunami in the Indian Ocean," it said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
              <p>There were no immediate reports of a high waves.</p>
              <p>It comes a day after a quake with a magnitude of between 8.0 and 8.3 in the <span id="lw_1254312650_9" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">South Pacific</span> hurled a massive tsunami at the shores of Samoa and <span id="lw_1254312650_10" class="yshortcuts">American Samoa</span>, flattening villages and leaving at least 99 dead and dozens missing.</p>
              <p>The epicenter of Wednesday's temblor off <span id="lw_1254312650_11" class="yshortcuts">Indonesia</span> lies several thousand miles (kilometers) to the west, on the other side of <span id="lw_1254312650_12" class="yshortcuts">Australia</span>.</p>
              <p>Witnesses
                      said residents of Padang, and other town and cities, ran out of homes
                      and buildings in fear when the quake hit in the early evening.</p>
              <p>"People
                      are panicking. They are running out of the buildings... There are many
                      collapsed buildings," an unidentified witness in Padang told MetroTV.</p>
              <p>The
                      shaking could be felt in high buildings in the capital, Jakarta,
                      several hundred miles (kilometers) away. <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>It was also felt in
                      neighboring Singapore and <span id="lw_1254312650_13" class="yshortcuts">Malaysia</span>.</strong></span></p>

              <p>APIA, Samoa – A powerful earthquake in the <span id="lw_1254314389_0" class="yshortcuts">South Pacific</span> hurled a massive tsunami at the shores of Samoa and American Samoa,
              flattening villages and sweeping cars and people out to sea, leaving at
              least 99 dead and dozens missing.</p>
              <p>Survivors
              fled the fast-churning water for higher ground and remained huddled
              there hours after the quake struck early Tuesday. Signs of devastation
              were everywhere, with a giant boat washed ashore lying on the edge of a
              highway and floodwaters swallowing up cars and homes.</p>
              <p>The quake, with a magnitude between 8.0 and 8.3, struck around dawn about 125 miles (200 kilometers) from <span id="lw_1254314389_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Samoa</span>, an island nation of 180,000 people located about halfway between <span id="lw_1254314389_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">New Zealand</span> and <span id="lw_1254314389_3" class="yshortcuts">Hawaii</span>. It struck about 120 miles (190 kilometers) from neighboring <span id="lw_1254314389_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">American Samoa</span>, a U.S. territory that is home to 65,000 people.</p>
              <p>Four
              tsunami waves 15 to 20 feet (4 to 6 meters) high roared ashore on
              American Samoa, reaching up to a mile (1.6 kilometers) inland, Mike
              Reynolds, superintendent of the National Park of American Samoa, was
              quoted as saying by a parks service spokeswoman.</p>
              <p>Hampered by power and communications outages, officials struggled to determine damage and casualties.</p>
              <p>Samoan
              police commissioner Lilo Maiava told The Associated Press that police
              there had confirmed 63 deaths but that officials were still searching
              the devastated areas, so the number of deaths might rise soon.</p>
              <p>Hundreds
              of injured people were being treated by health workers, and people were
              still struggling into centers seeking treatment, Maiava said.</p>
              <p>At least 30 people were killed on American Samoa, Gov. <span id="lw_1254314389_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Togiola Tulafono</span> said, adding that the toll was expected to rise as emergency crews were recovering bodies overnight.</p>
              <p>"I don't think anybody is going to be spared in this disaster," said Tulafono, who was in Hawaii for a conference.</p>
              <p>In Washington, President Barack Obama declared a disaster for American Samoa. The <span id="lw_1254314389_6" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> said it was deploying teams to provide support and assess damage.</p>
              <p>Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi looked shaken Wednesday on board a flight from <span id="lw_1254314389_7" class="yshortcuts">Auckland, New Zealand</span>, to the Samoan capital of Apia.</p>
              <p>"So much has gone. So many people are gone," he told reporters on board. "I'm so shocked, so saddened by all the loss."</p>
              <p>Malielegaoi said his own village of Lepa was destroyed.</p>
              <p>"Thankfully,
              the alarm sounded on the radio and gave people time to climb to higher
              ground," he said. "But not everyone escaped."</p>
              <p>Gov. Tulafono told reporters in Hawaii that a member of his extended family was among the dead in American Samoa.</p>
              <p>Because
              the closeness of the community, "each and every family is going to be
              affected by someone who's lost their life," he said as he boarded a
              Coast Guard C-130 plane in Hawaii to return home. The plane, which also
              carried FEMA officials and aid, was scheduled to arrive at about 7 a.m.
              local time. (2 p.m. EDT; 1800 GMT)</p>
              <p>Authorities in Tonga confirmed at least six additional people dead in the island nation west of the <span id="lw_1254314389_8" class="yshortcuts">Samoas</span>, <span id="lw_1254314389_9" class="yshortcuts">New Zealand</span>'s acting <span id="lw_1254314389_10" class="yshortcuts">Prime Minister Bill English</span> said. He said Tongan officials told him that four people were missing
              after the tsunami swept ashore on the northern island of Niua.</p>
              <p>"There
              are a considerable number of people who've been swept out to sea and
              are unaccounted for," English said. "We don't have information about
              the full impact and we do have some real concern that over the next 12
              hours the picture could look worse rather than better."</p>
              <p>A <span id="lw_1254314389_11" class="yshortcuts">New Zealand P3 Orion maritime surveillance</span> airplane had reached the region Wednesday afternoon and had searched
              for survivors off the coast, he said. It was expected to resume
              searching at first light.</p>
              <p>The <span id="lw_1254314389_12" class="yshortcuts">Samoa Red Cross</span> said it had opened five temporary shelters and estimated that about 15,000 people were affected by the tsunami.</p>
              <p>New Zealander Graeme Ansell said the Samoan beach village of <span id="lw_1254314389_13" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Sau Sau Beach Fale</span> was leveled.</p>
              <p>"It was very quick. The whole village has been wiped out," Ansell told New Zealand's National Radio from a hill near <span id="lw_1254314389_14" class="yshortcuts">Samoa</span>'s
              capital, Apia. "There's not a building standing. We've all clambered up
              hills, and one of our party has a broken leg. There will be people in a
              great lot of need 'round here."</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1254314389_15" class="yshortcuts">Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd</span> told Seven Network in <span id="lw_1254314389_16" class="yshortcuts">Australia</span> that two Australians had died in the tsunami, including a 6-year-old girl.</p>
              <p>The other Australian victim was identified by her family as 50-year-old Maree Blacker.</p>
              <p>"This is a tragic day for the people of Samoa," Rudd said.</p>
              <p>Mase Akapo, a meteorologist for the <span id="lw_1254314389_17" class="yshortcuts">National Weather Service</span> in American Samoa, reported at least 19 people killed in four different
              villages on the main island of Tutuila. Officials reported at least 50
              injured.</p>
              <p>Residents in both Samoa and American Samoa reported being
              shaken awake by the quake early Tuesday, which lasted two to three
              minutes and was centered about 20 miles (32 kilometers) below the ocean
              floor. It was followed by at least three large aftershocks of at least
              5.6 magnitude.</p>
              <p>The quake came Tuesday morning for the <span id="lw_1254314389_18" class="yshortcuts">Samoas</span>,
              which lie just east of the international dateline. For Asia-Pacific
              countries on the other side of the line, it was already Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The Samoan capital, Apia, was virtually deserted by afternoon,
              with schools and businesses closed. Hours after the waves struck, fresh
              sirens rang out with another tsunami alert and panicked residents
              headed for higher ground again, although there was no indication of a
              new quake.</p>
              <p>In <span id="lw_1254314389_19" class="yshortcuts">American Samoa</span>'s capital of <span id="lw_1254314389_20" class="yshortcuts">Pago Pago</span>,
              the streets and fields were filled with ocean debris, mud, overturned
              cars and several boats as a massive cleanup effort continued into the
              night. Several buildings in the city — just a few feet above sea level
              — were flattened by either the quake or the tsunami.</p>
              <p>Several areas were expected to be without electricity for up to a month.</p>
              <p>The dominant industry in <span id="lw_1254314389_21" class="yshortcuts">American Samoa — tuna</span> canneries — was also affected. Chicken of the Sea's tuna packing plant
              in American Samoa was forced to close although the facility wasn't
              damaged, the San Diego-based company said.</p>
              <p>The effects of the tsunami could be felt thousands of miles away.</p>
              <p>Japan's Meteorological Agency said "very weak" tsunami waves
              were registered off the island of Hachijojima about 10 hours after the
              quake. There were no reports of injuries or damage in <span id="lw_1254314389_22" class="yshortcuts">Japan</span>, which is about 4,<span id="lw_1254314389_23" class="yshortcuts">700 miles</span> (7,600 kilometers) northwest of <span id="lw_1254314389_24" class="yshortcuts">Samoa</span>.</p>
              <p>U.S. officials said strong currents and dangerous waves were forecast
              from California to Washington state. No major flooding was expected,
              however.</p>
              <p>In <span id="lw_1254314389_25" class="yshortcuts">Los Angeles</span>, lifeguards said they would clear beaches at about 8 p.m. in response to an advisory for possible dangerous currents.</p>
              <p>While the earthquake and tsunami were big, they were not on the same scale of the 2004 <span id="lw_1254314389_26" class="yshortcuts">Indian Ocean tsunami</span>, said <span id="lw_1254314389_27" class="yshortcuts">Brian Atwater</span> of the <span id="lw_1254314389_28" class="yshortcuts">U.S. Geological Survey</span> in <span id="lw_1254314389_29" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Seattle</span>. That tsunami killed more than 230,000 in a dozen countries across Asia.</p>

              <p>The death toll from a massive South Pacific earthquake and tsunami
              has risen to at least 28, with a minimum of 14 reported dead in both
              Samoa and American Samoa, the Red Cross and media reports have said.</p>
              <p>New Zealand man Tony Manson saw the tsunami arrive at "at terrific speed and force" off the coast of Samoa.</p>
              <p>"We were on the beach waiting for breakfast and felt the shake," he told TVNZ.</p>
              <p>"Moments
              later, within a minute, we saw the water on the outside of the lagoon
              disappear ... at that point we just ran for the hills.</p>
              <p>"There
              was no warning apart from us seeing the waves which usually break on
              the reef outside the lagoon, they started breaking before the reef.</p>
              <p>"And
              then there was the enormous rumble of the wave which I would guess was
              at most a couple of metres but came at terrific speed and force.</p>
              <p>"I
              was looking at a large falet, with concrete foundations, thinking 'That
              will be safe', and I looked down from the hill moments later and it was
              completely wiped out."</p>
              <p>Mr Manson said the wave took
              about 30 seconds to get from the beach to the hills, 'before it came
              through and devastated the village".</p>
              <p>"Everyone's lost everything and a lot of people have lost family members," he said.</p>
              <p>"Fortunately the village children were in school which is up on the hill so many of their lives were spared."</p>

              Bentley, who lives in Leauvaa, 15 minutes from the Samoan capital Apia,
              said local radio was saying hundreds of people were killed when the
              tsunami hit Lalomanu, a village on Samoa's south-eastern tip.</p>
              <p>"They're still looking for other people, missing people, they said hundreds," Ms Bentley said.</p>
              <p>"There are no houses, clothes, and stuff is all everywhere."</p>
              <p>The
              16-year-old was on her way to school in Leauvaa, 15 minutes from Apia,
              when she was forced to turn around and run to the mountains for safety.</p>
              <p>"The others were shouting 'tsunami!' but we
              thought it's a joke but then when we went down (the hill to the
              markets) on the bus the police were shouting at us to go to the
              mountains.</p>
              <p>"And then we saw ... the sea level was high, was rising.</p>

              he did because otherwise I would have been on the road to work when it
              hit.</p>
              <p>I
              was sitting in for him on the morning radio show on 93KHJ when the
              earthquake hit, at about 7:50am. It lasted several minutes.</p>
              <p>We
              immediately sent out an earthquake warning on air, to tell everyone to
              stay away from possible landslide areas. We also asked schools to
              initiate their tsunami plans to get kids up the mountains.</p>
              <p>We sent a tsunami warning 10 minutes later as we saw the first rising water.</p>
              <p>Our building, Pago Plaza, is located in the middle of the harbour, practically at sea level.</p>
              <p>We stayed on the air as the water reached three or four feet in the parking lot.</p>
              <p>The water stayed at that level for a few minutes, but then it surged to around 15 feet.</p>

              <p> Trees, cars, buses, boats all rushed by in a river of mud just outside my window.</p>
              <p>I actually saw that my own car - a new VW Beetle - was surprisingly buoyant when floating on its roof.</p>
              <p>We continued broadcasting for the next 5 to 10 minutes, until the batteries on our back-up power system died.</p>
              <p>Lots
              of office staff were panicking, and it was a struggle to keep everyone
              calm while I was still on the air. When we went off the air, I grabbed
              a video camera to try to capture some of the action.</p>
              <p>The first thing I caught was the second wave, and me and Lupe [another presenter] praying.</p>
              <p>All
              of the staff at the station went outside to the second floor balcony to
              see what was happening - and the air was filled with screams.</p>
              <p>The whole of the ground floor of our building was completely washed out.</p>
              <p>The
              devastation was complete. Tables, windows, jewellery, trophies, DVDs
              and bottles of water lay strewn across the murky floor.</p>
              <p>The
              villagers immediately started looking for trapped survivors. I
              dedicated myself and my staff to helping those that were hurt, and
              gathering food and water.</p>
              <p>I hooked up with two guys from the government to survey the damage and look for gas leaks and live power lines.</p>
              <p>Debris
              was everywhere. Broken furniture mixed with old tyres and trees.
              Children's clothing and road signs were crushed under telephone poles.</p>
              <p>Two lesser waves came but they were equally scary.</p>
              <p>We
              screamed for people to run up the mountain but they just ran down the
              street away from the wave rather than make a sharp left and up the
              steep mountain just feet away.</p>
              <p>We walked down the road only to find that people who weren't trying to help had already begun looting the stores.</p>

              <p> Teenagers roamed the area with spray paint, marking buildings and overturned cars with meaningless scribble.</p>
              <p>We set up a security barrier around our building, and confirmed with plaza security that no-one was trapped inside.</p>
              <p>Then I found my own car about 300 yards down the road, upside down in the middle of a tennis court.</p>
              <p>I
              got a generator from a friend and got one of our programmes back on the
              air about three hours later, just spreading information.</p>
              <p>I watched a group of Taiwanese fisherman trying to get off a 100-ft tuna boat that was leaning against the sea wall.</p>
              <p>School
              buses full of kids were smiling and waving at all the excitement, while
              behind them there were pick-up trucks with bodies in them - their feet
              were hanging out over the tailgate.</p>
              <p>Everything is so nasty here. When I finally left work, we drove through the area I saw more and more horrible things.</p>
              <p>Where
              I buy my morning snacks is a concrete slab, and the lady who makes the
              most delicious meat pies there is now badly injured at the hospital.</p>
              <p>The
              new day spa that my girlfriend Moana works at is now tilting
              precariously on its foundation. The Korean store is gutted. The store
              where I get my lunch has a truck in it. The Sacred Heart bus has a
              telephone pole skewering it like some sort of crazy shish kebab.</p>
              <p>Gas
              storage tanks at the fuel stations were leaking. Water mains are
              probably still gushing. A power generation plant was badly hit too.</p>
              <p>But
              as we got further out of the harbour area, the damage was less and less
              noticeable. The radio station was ground zero for the worst natural
              disaster in recorded American Samoa history.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore organisations raise funds for Indonesian quake victims</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Some organisations in Singapore are stepping up
              efforts to help quake victims in Indonesia, with several of them
              initiating fundraising programmes.
              <br> <br>A four-member team of Singapore's humanitarian organisation Mercy
              Relief has arrived in Padang and is expected to stay there for a week
              to help Indonesia's earthquake victims.
              <br> <br>"We can see a lot of buildings which have collapsed, and we are
              outside the M Jamil General Hospital where the Singaporean survivor
              John Lee was warded. We are now in the midst of procuring food supplies
              and also milk – UHT milk for children," said Hassan Ahmad, CEO, Mercy
              Relief.
              <br> <br>"There is also rationing for fuel for each vehicle, so it is very
              difficult for us to move around to get in the food supplies, clean
              drinking water and clean water supply for sanitation," he added.
              <br> <br> Mercy Relief's efforts are being supported by religious groups as well.
              <br> <br>The Rahmatan Lil 'Alamin Foundation, with support from Singapore's
              mosques, has started collecting funds for the quake victims during
              Friday prayers. The foundation has already raised some S$50,000 for
              quake victims in West Java and people hit by Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, the Singapore Soka Association will rally some 3,500 of
              its members for a fundraising drive on Sunday. Members can make their
              donations at three of its centres located in Tampines, Telok Blangah
              and Bukit Panjang.
              <br> <br> All proceeds from the mosques and Soka will be forwarded to Mercy Relief, in support of its humanitarian mission in Padang.
              <br> <br>Malaysian bank CIMB, which has offices in Singapore, has rolled out
              the "CIMB-The Star Padang Relief Fund" and is rallying customers and
              the public in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia to support
              the fund.
              <br> <br> The bank has already contributed close to S$50,000 (RM100,000) to the fund.
              <br> <br>All contributions to the "CIMB-The Star Padang Relief Fund" should
              be made before Sunday, 18 October 2009. Those who wish to donate can
              contact the bank at +65 6333 7777.

              <br> <br>"He can stand, so his leg is not fractured. It is probably just

              <p><strong>Indonesia's 'unlucky' president takes quake blame</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>JAKARTA (AFP) - – Some superstitious
              Indonesians are blaming a supposedly "unlucky" president -- and not
              shifting tectonic plates -- for the latest earthquake in this
              disaster-prone country.</p>
              <p>President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,
              popularly known by his initials SBY, has long been burdened by murmurs
              that he carries with him the shadow of cosmic misfortune.</p>
              <p>A
              string of disasters both natural and man-made since his election in
              2004, including the Indian Ocean tsunami that killed 220,000 across
              Asia, has seen quips that SBY stands for "Selalu Bencana Ya", roughly
              meaning "Always A Disaster".</p>
              <p>The latest catastrophe, believed
              to have killed upwards of 1,100 people with another buried 4,000 under
              rubble, is viewed by many in this Muslim-majority country of 234
              million as yet more proof that SBY's stars are crossed. Related
              article: Disaster leaves villages buried</p>
              <p>"SBY, because of his
              birth date, will always attract disasters to this country, according to
              the Primbon (a Javanese almanac of mysticism)" Permadi, a veteran
              politician from the opposition Gerindra party and practising shaman,
              told AFP.</p>
              <p>"Just look at the numbers of his birth date -- the
              ninth of the ninth, '49 -- that's unlucky. The more he holds on to
              power, the more great disasters will happen," he said.</p>
              <p>If
              Yudhoyono stays president, "a much bigger disaster will strike Jakarta
              for sure," Permadi said, referring to the Indonesian capital.</p>
              <p>"If SBY had a big heart, he would step down."</p>
              <p>Not
              everyone believes this theory -- and many see SBY's birthday as
              enviably lucky -- but such talk of supernatural misfortune has deep
              resonance in Indonesia, where Islam and Christianity are for many
              merged with older traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism and animism.</p>
              <p>The
              criticism has been long-standing enough that Yudhoyono lectured local
              government heads in the quake-hit region of West Sumatra two years ago
              that they should blame the region's volatile geology, and not him.</p>
              <p>"Magma
              doesn't move because SBY has become president. It's malicious to link
              it to me being president," he was quoted as saying at the time.</p>
              <p>Even
              the Jakarta Post, one of the top-selling English dailies, suggested a
              link between the disaster and the extravagance of politicians in a
              Sunday editorial entitled "The Gods Must Be Angry".</p>
              <p>"Whether
              you subscribe to the theological or secular explanation, the
              7.6-magnitude quake that killed more than 1,100 people came on the eve
              of the multi-billion-rupiah inauguration ball for newly elected members
              of the House of Representatives and the Regional Representative Council
              in Jakarta," it said.</p>
              <p>Political analyst Bima Arya Sugiarto
              said that while some, particularly opposition politicians, try to paint
              the president as a spiritual liability, there are benefits for him in
              Indonesians' gaze beyond the physical world.</p>
              <p>Criticism of the
              often slow aid response, and the poor planning that allowed shoddy
              buildings to spring up in the first place, has been muted by fatalism
              and a widespread belief that the disaster is God's will, Sugiarto said.</p>
              <p>"The mystical perspective or the religious perspective is more dominant than public criticism of government policies," he said.</p>
              <p>Indonesian
              media have carried accounts of divine symbols in the aftermath of the
              quake, including a ring-shaped sun surrounded by a rainbow and God's
              name inscribed in Arabic calligraphy in the clouds.</p>
              <p>In the devastated city of Padang, a commonly heard refrain has been that the quake is a test, or a punishment, ordained by God.</p>
              <p>"I
              think the quake happened because many of the youths in Padang commit
              sins, especially during Ramadan," chicken-feed factory worker Yasrizat,
              36, said near a mosque in the city.</p>
              <p>"They've been engaging in sinful activities by the beach. I think God is punishing us with this quake."</p>

              <p><strong>Indonesia calls off search for missing survivors</strong></p>
              <p>PADANG, Indonesia – Rescue workers called off the search Monday for
              life under the rubble left by a massive earthquake, focusing instead on
              bringing aid to survivors in the towns and hills of western Indonesia,
              despite being hampered by torrential rains.</p>
              <p>"After all this
              time I consider, from various experiences, it will be difficult to find
              more people alive," Ignacio Leon, the head of the U.N.'s humanitarian
              agency in Indonesia, told The Associated Press.</p>
              <p>"I don't want
              to cut the hope of the people, but the focus will shift and we are
              supporting the government now more in the relief side," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              death toll from Wednesday's temblor in Sumatra island is expected to be
              in the thousands once the missing people are declared dead. The U.N.
              has said 1,100 people died, while the government puts the toll at 603.</p>
              <p>Leon would not categorically say the search and rescue operation was called off, but other teams confirmed that was the case.</p>
              <p>Hiroaki
              Sano, head of the Japan Disaster Rescue Team, told the AP that
              officials of the U.N. and the Indonesian government discussed
              international assistance and "agreed no further assistance is needed
              for search and rescues."</p>
              <p>"We got here quickly but we haven't found any survivors. The first 100 hours are crucial," he said.</p>
              <p>International
              search and rescue teams were winding up operations and preparing to go
              back home as there was little hope of finding any survivors, he said.</p>
              <p>"They
              believe we should switch from emergency searches to the rebuilding
              stage," Sano said. International aid teams will continue to provide
              food and other humanitarian assistance, he said.</p>
              <p>Government
              minister Aburizal Bakrie told reporters that $600 million was needed to
              repair homes, schools, mosques, roads and other basic infrastructure
              damaged by the magnitude 7.6 earthquake.</p>
              <p>It had initially said $400 million was needed, but raised the estimate after the scale of the disaster became clear.</p>
              <p>The
              undersea quake devastated 10 districts in the Western Sumatra province
              including the capital, Padang, a city of 900,000 people where scores of
              tall buildings, including hotels, a mall, mosques and schools came down
              crashing. In addition, the quake triggered huge landslides in the hills
              of Pariaman district where entire villages were wiped out.</p>
              <p>Little
              aid has reached the remote communities as many roads and bridges were
              destroyed. Landslides also blocked many of the roads leading to
              villages and an AP crew saw aid workers scrambling to clear the road of
              dirt, boulders and trees.</p>
              <p>One road ended at Kampung Dalam
              village. The rest of the way had caved in, forcing rescue teams from
              South Korea, France and Germany to camp there. Villages further up the
              road were now accessible only by foot.</p>
              <p>Heavy rain since Sunday
              night threatened to trigger more landslides and hamper delivery of aid
              as most aid teams were forced to stay put in Padang.</p>
              <p>Sano said the rain hasn't affected the operations too much in the city but was more of a factor in the surrounding areas.</p>
              <p>"If
              it continues it would definitely affect the lives of the victims and
              make it for the Indonesians to conduct operations," he said.</p>
              <p>The Meteorological and Geophysics Agency warned the region could see strong winds and storms for the next two days.</p>
              <p>"People
              who live around the hills should remain alert for potential landslides,
              due to the high intensity of rain," said the agency's spokesman, Hari
              Tirto.</p>
              <p>It was unclear precisely how many people were without
              shelter Monday, but more than 88,000 houses and 285 schools were
              flattened in 10 affected districts, according to the U.N. and
              Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.</p>
              <p>Another 100,000 public buildings and 20 miles (31 kilometers) of road were damaged.</p>
              <p>In
              Padang, hundreds of children went back to class Monday in schools set
              up in tents as authorities tried to restore normalcy. UNICEF provided
              tents and basic supplies for schools in three of 10 affected districts.</p>
              <p>The
              resumption of classes was largely symbolic, giving just a few hundred
              children an opportunity to meet with teachers and receive counseling to
              process the trauma of recent days, including the deaths of relatives
              and being made homeless.</p>
              <p>"The government has called for
              classes to resume as soon as possible so they can create some
              normalcy," said Amson Simbolon, a UNICEF education officer, as math
              classes began for around 300 students at one badly damaged school in
              Padang.</p>
              <p>The agency has provided 15 tents, each with room for
              50 to 60 children, and is shipping another 220 by boat from the capital
              of Jakarta, he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Quake survivor John Lee speaks about his ordeal</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: John Lee, the Singaporean who survived the earthquake
              in Indonesia's Padang, has spoken to MediaCorp about his ordeal.
              <br> <br> The 55-year-old businessman was pulled out alive from the rubble of a five-storey hotel after being trapped for 30 hours.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said that when the hotel crumbled under the 7.6-magnitude quake, he was trapped in a space the size of a "pigeon hole".
              <br> <br>"The space covering me is more or less made to measure to my size,
              90-centimetre width, about 1.6-metre in length. I can't, totally can't
              move at all. Of course, the pain was there, plus limited air
              circulation. I sweat a lot. With that condition, I only prepared myself
              for the worst," he said.
