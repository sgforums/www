              Buffett Makes Annual Donation to Bill Gates Foundation
              By Steven Norton - Jul 7, 2012 12:00 PM GMT+0800
              
              Warren Buffett, the billionaire who pledged to donate most of his wealth to charity, contributed stock valued at $1.52 billion in his annual gift to the foundation created by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.
              
              Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), donated about 18.4 million of his companyâ€™s Class B shares to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to a filing issued yesterday. The shares closed at $82.54 in New York.

              Buffett, a trustee of the foundation, is the third-richest man in the world, with a net worth of about $46 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the wealthiest people. He has campaigned to promote charitable giving.
              
              â€œI urge people to unbutton their wallet, pull out a check, reach into their purse, whatever it takes,â€� Buffett, 81, said last year in a YouTube video. â€œYou will find that when you give a dollar and something of yourself, a lot more than a dollar comes out the other end.â€�
              
              Buffett announced plans in 2006 to donate 10 million Class B shares to the Gates Foundation and made an initial gift of 500,000 shares. He said heâ€™d release 5 percent of the remaining balance of the stock each year. That means each donation includes fewer shares than the year before.
              
              The Berkshire executive said in a 2006 letter that he expected the value of the shares to rise â€œin an irregular manner, by an amount that more than compensates for the decline in the number of shares that will be distributed.â€� The B shares were split 50-1 in 2010.

              The Gates Foundation supports organizations throughout the world aimed at improving education initiatives, enhancing health care and reducing poverty. Gates, 56, is the worldâ€™s second- richest man behind Carlos Slim, the Bloomberg index shows. A Berkshire director, Gates has joined Buffett in promoting the Giving Pledge, a push to encourage wealthy people to donate most of their fortunes to charity.
              
              Following is a summary of Buffettâ€™s stock donations to the Gates Foundation.
