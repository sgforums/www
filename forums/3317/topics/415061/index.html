              <p>TOKYO - A JAPANESE man committed suicide live on the 
              Internet after heated exchanges with online users daring him to die, 
              reports said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>A 24-year-old man in the northern city of Sendai was found 
              dead on Tuesday morning in his apartment by local police, who received 
              reports from web users, Yomiuri Shimbun said.</p>
              <p>The man, who lived alone, had been on extended sick leave 
              from his job since August and had posted complaints about his work, 
              Sankei Shimbun said.</p>
              <p>The man began to broadcast images of himself on live 
              streaming service Ustream on Sunday night, announcing his plan to kill 
              himself and discussing his views about life.</p>
              <p>After a break, his broadcast resumed early on Tuesday and he
               hanged himself in his apartment at around 5.30am (4.30am Singapore 
              time), Sankei said.</p>
              <p>His broadcast received many messages, with some web users 
              encouraging him to kill himself quickly, while others urged him to 
              desist. Ustream stopped the broadcast after 6.00am on Tuesday, following
               reports from an increasing number of viewers, Yomiuri said. -- AFP</p>

              <p>Not only that normally for people who hanged their tongue will stick out with saliva drooling and they'll be kicking their legs wildly. Anyway, it's such a sad sight to see young people take their lives, what is happening?? I wonder what the future will be like for our future generations...</p>

              <p><br>It's perfectly normal for society failures to go and die.</p>

              <p>The people who pitied and fely sorry for him, must also be in similar category or situations but are probably very impressed by his courage to kill himself.</p>

              <p>There must be other more useful ways to die than preparing such an elaborate display.</p>

              <p><br>It's also a painful way to die by hanging.</p>
              <p>In fact, you will feel that your head is about to explode with the blood pressure building up in your head and unable to go anyway else.</p>
              <p>Then you will hear your pulse getting louder and louder until eventually there's a loud bang in your head like someone shot a bullet through your head.</p>
              <p>But still, you won't die yet because despite losing your brain, your heart continues to pump until......for like eternity until you feel that your heart is reducing in size and being slowly sucked by a vaccum cleaner. Then you will feel the pain from your heart sending thousand fine sharp needles up to your brain.</p>
              <p>Then you will lose consciousness and pray that you will wake up in a better place.</p>
