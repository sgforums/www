              <p><span>WASHINGTON - Singapore, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia would see 
              their populations triple if everyone who wants to move there were 
              allowed to, a poll released Friday by Gallup shows. </span></p>
              <p><span> At the opposite end of the scale, the populations of Sierra Leone, Haiti
               and Zimbabwe would fall by more than half if migrants were allowed to 
              leave at will, the poll found. </span></p>
              <p><span> Gallup researchers interviewed nearly 350,000 adults in 148 countries 
              between 2007 and 2010 to calculate each country's potential net 
              migration score -- the number of adults who would like to leave a 
              country minus the number who would like to move in -- seen as a 
              proportion of the total adult population. </span></p>
              <p><span> They found that Singapore's population of 4.8 million would increase by 
              219 percent, New Zealand's population of four million would rise by 184 
              percent and Saudi Arabia's population of 26 million would soar by 176 
              percent if everyone who wants to come in and wants to leave, could. </span></p>
              <p><span>Switzerland made it onto the list, which was first compiled in 2009, for the first time this year.
              <br> <br> Some 800,000 of Switzerland's six million citizens said they would like 
              to permanently leave the country, while some 10 million foreigners said 
              they would move there, given the chance.
              <br> <br> The hefty influx of migrants to Switzerland versus the scant outflow 
              from the Alpine country would mean its population would more than 
              double, according to the Gallup poll.
              <br> <br> The preferred destination of most would-be migrants is still the United 
              States, although the already large US population -- 300 million 
              inhabitants -- means that the impact is less acutely felt, Gallup said.
              <br> <br> The United States is number 14 on the net migration list. If everyone 
              could come into the United States that wanted to, and all those who 
              wished to leave did, the US population would rise by around 60 percent.
              <br> <br> At the other end of the list, many countries in Africa and Latin America
               showed net outflows of population -- although four African countries 
              would gain residents, the poll showed.
              <br> <br> They are Botswana, which would see its population increase by 39 percent; 
              <br> South Africa, Zambia and Namibia, which would see rises of 13 percent, five percent and two percent, respectively.
              <br> <br> Botswana, which ranked just after the United States and just above 
              Norway on the list, is the world's top producer of diamonds and a 
              leading destination for high-end tourism. It prides itself on being a 
              model of successful democracy in Africa.
              <br> <br> At rock-bottom on the Gallup list is Sierra Leone, the west African 
              country that is still struggling to recover from a 10-year civil war 
              that officially ended in early 2002.
              <br> <br> If everyone who wanted to leave Sierra Leone could, and anyone who 
              wanted to move there did, the country's population would plunge by 56 
              percent.
              <br> <br> Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, would lose 51 percent of its population.
              <br> <br> Zimbabwe, where life expectancy is around 47 years and 15 percent of the
               population need food aid, would lose 47 percent; Nigeria -- Africa's 
              most populous nation with a population of 152 million -- and Ethiopia 
              would each lose 46 percent, and Liberia's population would fall by 45 
              percent.
              <br> <br> For Nigeria alone, the poll findings mean that 75 million people want to leave the west African state.
              <br> <br> "While Gallup's findings reflect people's wishes rather than their 
              intentions, the implications of what could happen if these desires 
              become reality are serious considerations for leaders as they plan for 
              the future," Gallup said.
              <br> <br> Two Latin American countries besides Haiti figure in the bottom 10 of 
              the list: El Salvador would lose 45 percent of its population and the 
              Dominican Republic would lose 43 percent.
              <br> <br> The lowest ranked European Union member state on the list is Latvia, 
              which would lose around a quarter of its population of 2.3 million if 
              migrants were allowed to come in and go out as they wished. 
              <br> <br> "High unemployment, low wages and a rising cost of living have driven 
              many Latvians out of the country," University of Latvia migration 
              specialist Aija Lulle told AFP. 
              <br> <br> Latvia ranked equally with Iran, and was only marginally better than the Philippines.
