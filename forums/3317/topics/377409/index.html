              <p><strong>S'poreans feel govt needs to invest more into arts, heritage, culture</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans feel that the government should pump more
              money into heritage and culture, than into sectors like tourism, IT and
              defence. Education topped the list, followed by investment in social
              welfare.
              <br> <br>This is according to a recent survey carried out by the National
              University of Singapore and commissioned by the National Heritage
              Board.
              <br> <br>More Singaporeans are visiting museums and participating in
              heritage-related activities. For example, the National Museum's Night
              Festival attracted 65,000 visitors this year over just one weekend.
              That was the same number as last year when the festival was held over
              two weekends.
              <br> <br>A survey of 1,000 respondents aged 15 to 69 years old showed that
              three out of five respondents would rather visit museums in Singapore
              rather than overseas. 59.4 per cent disagreed with the statement "I
              would rather visit museums overseas than in Singapore."
              <br> <br>Travelling exhibitions that go to the heartlands are a hit. 21.7
              per cent of respondents visited them, a significant increase of 15.2
              per cent from the 2002 survey.
              <br> <br>They include the Kangxi emperor exhibition, which was brought from
              the Asian Civilisations Museum to the masses at libraries around the
              island. <br> <br> Michael Koh, CEO, National Heritage Board, said: "We are trying to step
              up our programming and outreach events. We have stepped up for example
              our travelling exhibitions in the community. The heritage festival went
              out in a big way to the heartlands. <br> <br> "We went to the heartland malls to really reach people where they live
              because we realise that we can do a great exhibition, but without the
              supporting programmes and activities, we won't have the crowds. So this
              is where we will have to move into this aspect in an even bigger way."
              <br> <br>And to do that, a newly launched heritage bus will bring
              exhibitions about Singapore's different cultures to schools, regional
              libraries and elderly homes as well as community clubs, kindergartens
              and orphanages.
              <br> <br>Called "Colours of Heritage", the bus is a joint project by NHB,
              the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Media
              Development Council, National Arts Council, National Library Board and
              Info-Comm Development Authority of Singapore.
              <br> <br>The exhibition on the bus is divided into three themes and one of
              them is games. Visitors can relive their childhood days by playing
              games such as five stones. <br> <br> Local food, spices and cooking utensils will also be showcased.
              Visitors can also learn about the wedding ceremonies of Singapore's
              four major ethnic groups. <br> <br> The mobile museum aims to reach out to 80,000 people over six months. </span></p>

              <p>Investment in social welfare by the ruling party -  forget it.   lee ah loong already stated and reiterated that he is not making Singapore a welfare state.   For those whom I know who are in financial need who sought help from CDC were treated badly.    The CDC staff kept saying things to discourage them to apply for financial aid.</p>
              <p>Never will govt do a good job in social welfare as long as PAP rules.   Being mercenary govt, why should they invest in something that has no monetary return?</p>

              <p>unless it benefits singaporeans in terms of monetary rewards and appreciation of arts among singaporeans, i see no reason why they should invest more money.</p>

              <p>i think there is a need to consiously promote identity of Singaporean. Especially strengthen the generation that are born and brought up in Singapore.  </p>
              <p>I know it is difficult to characterized Singaporean as a race. So the only way is to preserve the heritage.</p>
              <p>However i feel that Singaporean is always side line by ethnicity...This is particularly true especially when we stay outside Singapore.</p>
