              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore raked in S$18.8 billion in tourism receipts last year, the highest in ten years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Singapore 
              Tourism Board (STB) said this is a 49 per cent increase from 2009, 
              exceeding previous forecasts of between S$17.5-18.5 billion.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>STB said the high 
              growth in tourism dollars is due to higher spending per person, and more
               international visitors due to positive economic sentiment and the 
              opening of the two Integrated Resorts.<br><br>Sightseeing and 
              entertainment accounted for a fifth of the tourism receipts, some S$4 
              billion and a 1,800 per cent jump from 2009. For the first time, 
              spending and gambling at the two Integrated Resorts was also included 
              into this component.<br><br>However, the STB was quick to add that growth was seen across the sector.<br><br>Aw
               Kah Peng, Chief Executive of STB, said: "The two Integrated Resorts 
              were highlights, but we saw growth across every part of the tourism 
              sector. Spending in F&amp;B grew, spending at the hotels grew, spending 
              at various sightseeing and attractions grew."<br><br>Singapore welcomed 
              11.9 million overseas visitors last year, led by growth in the top five 
              markets - Indonesia, China, Australia, Malaysia and India.<br><br>This figure fell within STB's forecast of 11.5 to 12.5 million visitors for 2011.<br><br>Hotel revenue also saw a jump of 21.8 per cent to reach S$1.9 billion.<br><br>With
               average room rates of S$212 a night, the Singapore Tourism Board said a
               challenge for the industry is to raise service standards, and ensure 
              that customers get value for their money.<br><br>One segment which did not do well however, was the cruise industry.<br><br>Passenger numbers declined 11 per cent, largely due to two gaming ships ceasing operations.<br><br>Ms
               Aw said: "Some of the cruises that were primarily focused on gaming 
              decided that it wasn't worth their while to do those cruises anymore.<br><br>"I
               think as new entrants come into the market, existing ones will then 
              have to relook at what they are offering, and whether they would reshape
               their business. Do something else, or introduce new products."<br><br>While
               it declined to give projections for 2011, STB expects tourism to 
              continue growing this year, driven by the opening of new attractions in 
              the Integrated Resorts.<br><br>However, growth in the sector is not expected to match the pace set last year, which was described as "exceptional".<br><br>- CNA/fa/ac</span></span></p>
