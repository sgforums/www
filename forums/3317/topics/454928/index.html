              <p>then FFS, walk the talk!</p>
              <p>instead of trying to grow everything whatever it costs, think about what the hell we are doing which impacts the world... the fucking cars here do not last more than 10 years even when they can last up to 30 years because of the fucking COE..</p>
              <p>everything is geared towards planned redundancy even when it is perfectly okay to use it more than its supposed "life expectancy"</p>
              <p>what the hell is this apart from just increasing GDP, making us buy more therefore increasing production, therefore increasing what we are digging and ripping out of the planet?</p>

              all the decision makers are full of rubbish and talk only.  all they care about is money.  nobody gives a damn about the environment.
