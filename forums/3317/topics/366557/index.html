              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">NEWater gets thumbs up by experts</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: NEWater, Singapore's own brand of high-grade reclaimed
              water, continues to surpass international quality standards despite
              more rigorous audit process. This is the unanimous verdict of a panel
              of international and local water experts, after a week of extensive
              audit and review. <br> <br> The so-called External Audit Panel concluded that "NEWater continues to
              be consistently of high quality and exceeds the Environmental Public
              Health's (EPH) and United States Environmental Protection Agency's
              (USEPA) drinking water standards as well as the drinking water
              guidelines established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and is
              therefore, safe as a source of water supply."
              <br> <br>The comprehensive sampling and monitoring programme was established
              in 1999 as part of the R&amp;D for the development of NEWater and has
              been gradually expanded from 190 physical, chemical and microbiological
              parameters to more than 290 monitored today.
              <br> <br>Professor Joan Rose, chairperson of the panel since its inception,
              said: "We are very pleased to note that the high quality of NEWater has
              remained consistent all these years. In tandem with the rapidly
              evolving water R&amp;D sector, the audit process has become more
              rigorous over the years. <br> <br> "Even with additional parameters to be monitored and lower levels of
              detection through more sensitive instrumentation, NEWater still goes
              beyond the mark in all measures of quality.
              <br> <br>"This demonstrates that the quality of NEWater surpasses
              international standards, and it also stands up well against the
              criteria established in Singapore."
              <br> <br>Professor Rose is also the Homer Nowlin Chair in Water Research,
              Department of Fisheries and Wildlife in Michigan State University, USA.
              <br> <br>Formed in November 2003, the seven-member External Audit Panel
              comprises experts from various disciplines ranging from engineering,
              water chemistry, toxicology and microbiology. <br> <br> The panel was in Singapore for the 12th External Audit Panel Meeting,
              which was held in conjunction with the recently-concluded Singapore
              International Water week.
              <br> <br>Because of its ultra-clean quality, NEWater is supplied to
              high-tech industrial and commercial customers in Singapore, especially
              those that have high-end processes like wafer fabrication that require
              water of a higher quality.
              <br> <br>In line with international practice, NEWater is mixed with raw
              water in the reservoirs before undergoing further treatment at the
              waterworks for supply as drinking water. The existing plan is to
              progressively increase the amount of NEWater in reservoirs.
