              <div>
              <p>Several explosions have rocked a suspected hideout of alleged Asian terror mastermind Noordin Mohammad Top in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>The blasts came after a 12-hour siege by police.</p>
              <p>Media reports said smoke was seen billowing out of holes in the roof of the house in Central Java.</p>
              <p>The reports said at least four blasts went off as police appeared to move in on the property.</p>
              <p>Counter-terror police opened fire on the house in Beji village,
              where Noordin is believed to be holed up with two or three accomplices.</p>
              <p>Noordin leads an extremely dangerous splinter group of the Jemaah Islamiyah regional terror network.</p>
              <p>He's wanted for a string of suicide attacks in Indonesia including last month's bombings of luxury hotels in Jakarta.</p>
              <p>Separately, Indonesia's police chief said two would-be suicide
              bombers were killed during a police raid near Jakarta this morning.</p>
              <p>National police chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri said the two men were
              shot dead as they were about to detonate hand-made bombs during the
              raid.</p>
              <p>The operation also uncovered a cache of explosive material and a car rigged as a bomb.</p>
              <p>He said the two men were just weeks away from launching a car bomb attack.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Indonesia awaits DNA test to confirm terror leader's death</span></strong></p>
              <p>Indonesian police say it could take two weeks to confirm the death
              of alleged terror mastermind Noordin Mohammed Top, who was reportedly
              killed in a dramatic standoff with police.</p>
              <p>Local media say Noordin died in the assault on his suspected hideout in a remote village in Central Java yesterday.</p>
              <p>Authorities say that DNA tests are being conducted on the body at a police hospital in Jakarta.</p>
              <p>However, doubts have emerged about whether the dead man was Noordin.</p>
              <p>Pictures circulated after the police raid suggest that the lower
              half of the man's face did not resemble previous police photographs of
              the militant leader.</p>
              <p>Analysts say that Noordin's death would be a blow to his network,
              but they stress that it would not end the terror threat in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,</p>
              <p>The military has stepped up security for Indonesian President Susilo
              Bambang Yudhoyono after police uncovered a plot to attack his home
              outside Jakarta.</p>

              <p><strong>Doubts grow about Islamist's death in Indonesia</strong></p>
              <p class="first">JAKARTA (AFP) - - Malaysian terror suspect Noordin
              Mohammed Top is probably still at large in Indonesia despite reports of
              his death, police said on Monday, even as the net closed around his
              extremist network.</p>
              <p>Fingerprint analysis confirmed that a man killed by police special
              forces in a raid on a suspected Noordin hideout on the weekend was not
              the Malaysian Islamist, a police source involved in the investigation
              told AFP.</p>
              <p>"It's not him. We know from his facial structure as well as his fingerprints," the source said, requesting anonymity.</p>
              <p>"We're continuing to track his whereabouts."</p>
              <p>Noordin's
              death has not been formally ruled out, however, and police are publicly
              sticking to the line that DNA tests are required.</p>
              <p>"Whoever the man is, it should be proved in a scientific way," national police spokesman Nanan Soekarna said.</p>
              <p>Photographs
              of the bullet- and shrapnel-riddled body dragged from the remote
              farmhouse in Central Java at the end of a 17-hour siege on Saturday
              morning do not resemble Noordin, police sources and independent experts
              said.</p>
              <p>"The picture of the guy doesn't bear any resemblance," said
              Jakarta-based security analyst Sidney Jones, of the International
              Crisis Group.</p>
              <p>Noordin, 40, is wanted for multiple suicide
              bombings against "iconic" Western targets in Indonesia since 2003 which
              have killed around 50 people and injured hundreds.</p>
              <p>He is the
              self-proclaimed leader of "Al-Qaeda in the Malay Archipelago", an
              offshoot of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) regional terror group responsible
              for the 2002 Bali attacks which killed more than 200 people.</p>
              <p>The
              twin suicide blasts at the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in
              Jakarta on July 17, which killed nine people including six foreigners
              and the bombers, are believed to be his first major strike since 2005.</p>
              <p>It
              was unclear whether Noordin was ever in the Central Java house that was
              besieged overnight Friday, but the counter-terrorist police source
              indicated that the Malaysian might have escaped before the police
              arrived.</p>
              <p>"We were not as quick as him," he said, without elaborating.</p>
              <p>Noordin
              has already escaped two earlier armed assaults on his hideouts, and his
              legend will only grow among his disciples and on Islamist websites if
              he has managed to slip away again.</p>
              <p>Pressure will also mount on
              Indonesia's US-trained counter-terrorism forces to track him down
              before he can do further damage to the country's hard-earned image as a
              stable and moderate Muslim-majority country.</p>
              <p>"It's a huge
              disappointment -- the police were convinced they had Noordin in that
              house," Jones said, adding however that they could take heart from
              other recent arrests and the discovery of a major bomb factory outside
              Jakarta.</p>
              <p>Five of Noordin's alleged accomplices have been arrested
              in recent days, and two men described by police as would-be suicide
              bombers were killed Saturday in a raid at a house packed with
              bomb-making material in Bekasi, outside Jakarta.</p>
              <p>Police said the
              would-be bombers were planning to detonate a truck rigged with
              explosives at President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's main residence,
              which is a 12-minute drive away.</p>
              <p>The attack, timed around
              Indonesia's Independence Day on August 17, had been ordered by Noordin
              during a meeting on April 30 as revenge for the execution of three of
              the Bali bombers late last year, they said.</p>
              <p>One of the men killed
              in Bekasi was identified as Air Setiawan, a Noordin acolyte who was
              involved in the suicide truck bombing of the Australian embassy in 2004.</p>
              <p>The
              two men who blew themselves up at the Jakarta hotels on July 17 had
              also been identified, while another alleged Noordin accomplice was
              arrested on July 24 as he prepared a follow-up attack.</p>
              <p>Information
              on the Bekasi cell and the Central Java safe-house was gained from Amir
              Abdillah, arrested last Thursday and suspected of helping to carry out
              the hotel attacks.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Still alive -- Indonesian police say slain militant was not Noordin Top</span></strong></p>
              <p>Indonesian police say a suspect shot dead in a raid in Central Java over the weekend was not leading militant Noordin Top.</p>
              <p>Authorities say DNA tests show that the suspect was not the wanted fugitive.</p>
              <p>The man killed was identified as Ibrohim, who was wanted over the
              bombings last month at the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott in Jakarta.</p>
              <p>He was a florist who worked at the hotels and helped prepare the almost simultaneous attacks.</p>
              <p>Police released new security camera footage showing Ibrohim
              escorting the alleged Marriott bomber around the hotel in early July
              and later bringing bomb-making material into the hotel's staff-only
              loading bay.</p>
              <p>News that Noordin Top has managed to elude police again and remains on the run is a blow for Indonesian security forces.</p>
              <p>He is one of Asia's most wanted terror suspects blamed for a series
              of attacks in Indonesia since 2003, including the twin suicide blasts
              in Jakarta last month.</p>

              <p><strong>Terror mastermind Noordin dead in Indonesia raid: police</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>KEPUH SARI, Indonesia (AFP) - – Armed
              Indonesian police stormed an Islamic militant hideout early Thursday in
              a raid that killed fugitive terror mastermind Noordin Mohammed Top and
              three other militants, police said.</p>
              <p>Noordin's body was among
              four recovered after the early morning raid on a village house in
              Central Java, national police chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri told
              reporters, bringing to an end an exhaustive six-year manhunt.</p>
              <p>"From
              national police doctors' examinations, antemortem (investigations) and
              finger prints sent by Malaysian police, thank God on this holy month of
              Ramadan... it's Noordin M Top," Danuri said to applause.</p>
              <p>Loud
              explosions and gunfire were heard as police raided the rented house at
              around sunrise after a nine-hour siege on the outskirts of Solo city, a
              stronghold of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) radical network.</p>
              <p>The raid left the simple house in the lush, densely populated region a burnt-out shell.</p>
              <p>President
              Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said the death of Noordin and that of an ally,
              Malaysian bomb expert Azhari Husin, killed by police on Java in 2005,
              did not mean the end of the militant threat.</p>
              <p>"The crippling of
              these two terrorists in Southeast Asia does not mean all cells working
              in Indonesia have all been paralysed," he said.</p>
              <p>"That's why we
              must continue to be vigilant and prepare for steps to tackle, optimally
              prevent and continue to hunt down terrorist leaders, their networks and
              prominent fugitives."</p>
              <p>Police chief Danuri said forces from an
              elite unit known as Special Detachment 88 launched the raid after
              interrogating two Noordin acolytes arrested nearby on Wednesday
              afternoon.</p>
              <p>"Despite repeated warnings to surrender there was a
              firefight. A motorcycle was hit, caught fire and they took refuge by
              huddling in the bathroom," Danuri said.</p>
              <p>"But our men breached
              the wall as morning prayers came, at around 5:00 or 6:00 am we carried
              out a quick operation in three hours and we managed to disable them."</p>
              <p>Danuri
              said the three killed along with Noordin were "expert bomb-maker" Bagus
              Budi Pranoto, alias Urwah, close Noordin associate Ario Sudarso, alias
              Aji, and the renter of the house, Susilo.</p>
              <p>He said two men were also arrested and Susilo's wife, who was wounded in the raid, was also in custody.</p>
              <p>Police
              found 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of explosive powder already "prepared"
              by the militants as well as loaded M-16 assault rifles, laptops and
              surveillance equipment inside the house, he said.</p>
              <p>Noordin, a
              41-year-old Malaysian who was Southeast Asia's most-wanted man, led a
              radical splinter faction of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror network blamed
              for a string of deadly attacks.</p>
              <p>The offshoot, labelled
              Al-Qaeda in the Malay Archipelago, is suspected of being behind the
              July 17 suicide attacks on Jakarta's JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton
              hotels.</p>
              <p>The bombings, which killed seven people including six
              foreigners, were the first major attacks in Indonesia in nearly four
              years.</p>
              <p>International Crisis Group analyst Sidney Jones said Noordin's death would be a major setback.</p>
              <p>"It's
              a major blow for terrorism in Indonesia generally. I think Noordin was
              the person most single-mindedly devoted to pursuing the Al-Qaeda line
              in Indonesia," she said.</p>
              <p>"Unquestionably, Noordin's network will be severely weakened but it may not disappear."</p>
              <p>In
              Washington, US State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters
              that the raid that killed Noordin "potentially represents a significant
              step forward in Indonesia in its battle with extremists."</p>
              <p>Indonesian
              police believe they narrowly missed Noordin in a dramatic televised
              raid in August on a safe house in Temanggung, also in Central Java.</p>
              <p>Noordin
              was initially reported dead at the end of the 17-hour siege but the
              body later turned out to be that of a florist working in the Marriott
              and Ritz-Carlton hotel complex who helped plot the attacks from the
              inside.</p>
              <p>Noordin allegedly also masterminded a 2003 attack on
              the Marriott that killed 12 people, as well as the Australian embassy
              bombing and 2005 attacks on tourist restaurants on the holiday island
              of Bali.</p>
              <p>Jemaah Islamiyah's ultimate goal is to unite
              Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and the southern Philippines
              into a fundamentalist Islamic state.</p>

              <p><strong>PM Lee congratulates Indonesia for successful anti-terror raid</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has congratulated
              Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on the successful raid by
              the Indonesian police that led to the death of wanted terrorist Noordin
              Mohammed Top. </span></p>
              <p><span>In his letter to President Yudhoyono on Friday, Mr Lee said it is
              a significant achievement that will make Indonesia and the region
              safer.
              <br> <br>But the prime minister added that although terror groups linked to
              Top will be weakened by his death, they still pose a threat to the
              region.
              <br> <br> He said Singapore will continue to work closely with Indonesia and other regional governments to combat terrorism.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said he is confident that under President Yudhoyono's able
              leadership and the professionalism of the Indonesian police and
              security agencies, Indonesia will score more successes against
              terrorists in future.

              <p><strong>Indonesian police: DNA test confirms Noordin death</strong></p>
              <p>JAKARTA, Indonesia – DNA tests have confirmed that Southeast Asia
              terrorist leader Noordin Top was killed days ago in a shootout with
              Indonesian security forces, police said Saturday.</p>
              <p>Police initially identified 41-year-old Noordin's body by taking
              fingerprints after the gun battle Thursday at a hide-out in central
              Java. DNA tests have confirmed those findings, National Police
              spokesman Nanan Sukarna said.</p>
              <p>Officials showed a photo of
              Noordin taken after his death in which he has a thick beard, and
              contrasted it with photos of him clean-shaven that police used in
              wanted posters.</p>
              <p>"There's no longer any doubt," Sukarna told a news conference.</p>
              <p>Authorities
              had earlier believed that they killed Noordin last month in a 16-hour
              siege of another terrorist hide-out in central Java, but DNA tests
              proved otherwise.</p>
              <p>Sukarna said Indonesian officials were
              coordinating with Noordin's family in Malaysia to send his body back
              there "as soon as possible," but did not specify a date.</p>
              <p>Police
              say Noordin, a Malaysian national, planned the 2002 and 2005 suicide
              bombings on the resort island of Bali and the July 17 attacks on the
              J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. In all, he is thought
              to be responsible for the deaths of more than 200 people, mostly
              foreigners.</p>
              <p>Noordin joined the regional terror network Jemaah
              Islamiyah in 1998 after briefly training in the southern Philippines. A
              disagreement over targeting civilians caused a split in Jemaah
              Islamiyah and Noordin formed Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad, which he
              reportedly called the "al-Qaida for the Malay archipelago." Its aim is
              to create a common Muslim state in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and the
              Philippines.</p>
              <p>Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has
              hailed Noordin's death as an important blow to one the most violent
              factions of Muslim extremists in the region.</p>
              <p>Regional leaders
              also cheered Noordin's demise and were optimistic his death could help
              undermine terror groups throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>"This is a
              very significant result," Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in
              an interview Friday on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.</p>
              <p>"This man has been a mass murderer," he said. "He's been responsible for the murder of Australians."</p>
              <p>Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also congratulated Indonesia on Friday.</p>
              <p>But
              some terrorism analysts, such as Sidney Jones at the International
              Crisis Group think tank, have warned that Noordin probably passed on
              his bomb-making skills and ideology to others, and that the threat of
              attacks remains.</p>
