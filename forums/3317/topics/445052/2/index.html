They are in no position to cut the hairs of the students. If the kids broke any rules, the legal guardian should be inform and advise upon instead of taking things into their own hand. They are only teachers and not authorise to touch kids at any point of time. Even when caning is required, the guardians are often inform before the action is carried out. </p></div>

              <p>I don't think that the parents were over-reacting to the whole situation whereby the teacher just snipped the student's hair off just like that. </p>
              <p>It's important that the student follow the school rules but ample warning and time should be given to him before the school decides that they should take things into their own hands. Furthermore, this case has room for argument as the teacher himself is not a qualified hairstylist and hence he cannot cut the student's hair without notifying his parents. The teacher, in this case, is abusing his authority and MOE has the responsibility to account for this incident. In fact, this debate boils down to the code of conducts of a school. </p>
              <p>If "cutting of students hair by a non-qualified teacher" is allowed, then are students all going to be at the mercy of teachers in future? </p>
              <p>I would like to emphasize that school in a place to gain knowledge and to adopt the right set of morals and value. YES, disciplinary actions like corporate punishment to recalcitrants are necessary. But cutting a student's hair on the first/second day or school should not be acknowledged by the society. I don't see why students must be intimidated in schools. How will learning be conducive?! I think that this is a very good calling for MOE to re-define their set of mandatory school rules and to restrict the freedom teachers have towards disciplining a child. And as for this teacher, he ought to be sacked because he could have chosen other alternatives like refusing the child's entry into school etc.</p>
