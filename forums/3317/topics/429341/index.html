              <p>TRADE and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang has urged Singaporeans to 
              understand the need for foreign workers, cautioning that Singapore will 
              have to turn away big investments if it is not flexible on this issue.</p>
              <p>He said the government plans to cap the proportion of foreigners at 
              one-third of the workforce over the next decade, but this limit will 
              constrain Singapore's economic growth.</p>
              <p>He was speaking to reporters after a walkabout at Boon Lay market and
               hawker centre with his fellow PAP candidates for West Coast GRC - Mr S 
              Iswaran, Mr Arthur Fong, Mr Lawrence Wong and Ms Foo Mee Har.</p>
              <p>'We will keep foreign workers to one-third of the workforce but I can
               tell you that one-third of the workforce is a very severe limitation to
               us,' he said.</p>
              <p>'I have to be very selective now and take in investments that don't bust that constraint.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said in 2006 and 2007, when Singapore took in a 'bumper crop' 
              of investments from multinationals such as energy giants Shell and 
              Exxon-Mobil, which required more foreign workers, the economy expanded 
              by about 7 per cent, he noted.</p>
              <p>But with the current limits on foreign worker numbers, Singapore will have to aim for lower growth of 3 to 5 per cent, he said.</p>

              <p><br>i wonder why oppiostions never lash out at the pap ministers wages in a more 'constructive' manner.</p>
              <p>their consolidated monthly pay and other welfares, if added and trasnfered to reserves or welfare funds, can help many mnay poor sgreans on the fllor. and i mean saving them aside every month , a monthly supplement for the really poor sgreans. if they do that, i rather forgo all the growth packagage and handouts given to me.</p>
