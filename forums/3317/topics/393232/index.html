              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Minister in Charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr 
              Yaacob Ibrahim, said there has been a steady decline in the number of 
              marriages involving minors in the community. </span></p>
              <p><span>Giving an update on the state of the Malay Muslim community here, 
              Dr Yaacob said the number of solemnizations involving minors dropped by 
              18 per cent to 295 last year. This is a sharp drop of 45 per cent since 
              2005. 
              <br> <br> Divorces involving persons who had been minors at the point of marriage 
              have also fallen by four per cent to 433 in 2009.
              <br> <br> Dr Yaacob attributed the good progress to the various efforts undertaken
               by the community. 
              <br> <br> These include marriage preparatory courses and an amendment to the 
              Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) to raise the legal age of 
              marriage for Muslim couples from 16 to 18 years of age. From 1 March 
              2009, anyone who is below 18 years of age and wants to get married is 
              required to obtain a Special Marriage License (SML).
              <br> <br> Separately, Dr Yaacob also announced that two new mosques will be built 
              in Woodlands and Jurong West to meet the high demand for prayer space in
               the area.
              <br> <br> He said: "MCYS, together with MND, URA and MUIS, have studied the issue.
               Based on our assessment, there is particularly high demand for prayer 
              space in Jurong West and Woodlands because they are large towns with a 
              significant Muslim population. 
              <br> <br> "In addition, the mosques in these areas also serve Muslim workers from 
              the nearby industrial estates at Tuas and Woodlands, as well as students
               from the nearby tertiary institutions such as Nanyang Technological 
              University and Republic Polytechnic, during Friday prayers. 
              <br> <br> "Unfortunately, there are no other mosques nearby which are able to cope
               with the spill-over demand. Even after upgrading the existing mosques 
              to increase capacity, there would still be a shortage of space.
              <br> <br> "Therefore, I am pleased to announce that the government has decided to 
              reserve land for MUIS to build two additional mosques in Woodlands and 
              Jurong West." 
              <br> <br> Dr Yaacob added: "The community continues to progress in many facets - 
              be it education, skills or the many indicators of quality of life. We 
              benefit from the Singapore system and complement with community 
              self-help. However, there are pressing issues at the bottom. These will 
              require continued focus and results will take time to show up."
