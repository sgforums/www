              <p>SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD Gwen Tan never stopped giving, even after she died.</p>
              <p>The teenager, who often volunteered to tutor under privileged kids,
              gave eight patients a new lease of life when her parents - who held the
              belief that their daughter would have wanted to help others - donated
              five of her organs after she was declared brain dead, the Singapore
              General Hospital (SGH) reported in its May/June newsletter, Outram Now.</p>
              <p>The recipients - five men, two women and a girl - come from diverse
              backgrounds. The oldest is 61 and the youngest, three. The two men who
              recieved her kidneys each had waited for over seven years, while the
              child - born with a rare life-threatening condition - waited for over a
              year. In all, Gwen's heart, liver, kidneys, lungs and corneas were
              donated.</p>
              <p>Gwen, a triple-science student of a top school, collapsed at a
              train station one morning last December. 'I tried to massage her head
              her head but she stopped me,' said her mum who was with Gwen then.
              Other than mild childhood asthma and occasional nosebleeds due to a
              thin nose membrane, Gwen seemed a healthy girl, her mother was quoted
              as saying. Their names were changed at the family's request for
              privacy, said the newsletter .</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan decided to take her to a clinic where she was given
              an injection and medicine for giddiness and vomiting. But by the time
              they left the clinic, Gwen's vision had blurred. Late that night, she
              vomitted again and her parents rushed her to hospital.</p>
              <p>A CT scan showed a massive blood clot in the left lower back
              of her head and doctors diagnosed her to be suffering from Cerebral
              Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) - a congenital disorder that
              interrupts blood flow in the brain due to abnormal connections between
              arteries and the veins.</p>
              <p>Gwen was transferred to an intensive care unit around 1am and
              was induced into a coma to minimise brain activities. Her condition
              stablised the next morning but deteriorated quickly overnight when the
              pressure in her skull spiked. An emergency procedure was done to
              relieve pressure on her brain. By the next afternoon, neurosurgeons
              told Mrs Tan Gwen's left brain - the part that controls speech and
              vision - was damaged.</p>
              <p>"According to him, she was like a walking time bomb. As the
              high-pressure blood acts at the top of the vein, the thin wall of the
              vein is being stretched. It was only a matter of time before it burst,"
              said Mrs Tan. Another consultant told her Gwen "would be gone" the
              moment she was taken off the life support machine.</p>
              <p>On Christmas night, doctors told the Tans Gwen's hormones had
              become inbalanced - a sign the brain had lost its function. The
              following night, she was certified brain dead.</p>
