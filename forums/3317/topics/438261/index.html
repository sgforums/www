I hope that we will be able to move forward in a constructive direction," Mr Lee said.<br>The Prime Minister also laid down what he expects from the People's Action Party (PAP) MPs. They should believe in what they say and master the subject in their speeches, Mr Lee said. He also urged PAP MPs to speak up for their constituents and help to form and shape views to develop a consensus and move forward together.<br>To a question on whether the Whip would be lifted more often, Mr Lee said that it depends on the issues. He said the Whip will be lifted if it is an issue of conscience, but party discipline will need to be followed on policy matters.<br>Mr Lee also elaborated on the recent editorial in the PAP's magazine Petir, where he called on the party to reflect on the General Election.<br>He said that it is a new situation where the population is changing and attitudes are shifting. However, the party still needs to connect, represent and lead the people, and he hopes that the new generation will work with the Government.<br>"As they work with us, they change and we change. I think that's something which the party has to work at very hard, reaching out to the new generation, new formats, new media, new activities. But also keeping our traditional base - the older ones, Singaporeans who have contributed a lot to Singapore and I think who deserve to have their voices heard too."<br><br>The Presidential Election<br>On the recent Presidential Election, Mr Lee said it was important to have public debates on the future of the institution.<br>"It's good that there's a public debate on the experience on the Presidential Election, different perspective raised and concerns too, particularly amongst the minority communities that if the process carries on like this, it will become difficult to elect a minority President because that's the nature of election politics," he said. "We are following the debate carefully, I think it's still very early yet and we have not come to any conclusion."<br><br>The PA-Workers' Party dispute<br>When asked about the recent storm between the People's Association (PA) and Aljunied Group Representation Constituency over the lease of common sites in the Opposition wards, Mr Lee stressed that the PA is not a political organisation.<br>"The PA serves all the residents in the constituency, and it's non-political. In fact, it doesn't allow political activities on its premises when it runs its own activities. But guidance must be from somebody who's working on behalf of the Government. It's like having the Ministry of Education, the civil servants are impartial and neutral but the Minister is a Government Minister," Mr Lee said.<br><br><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #2288bb;" href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110911-0000218/PM-Lee-expects-more-robust-debates-in-the-next-Parliament">http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110911-0000218/PM-Lee-expects-more-robust-debates-in-the-next-Parliament</a></span></p>
