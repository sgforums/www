              <p>apparently you are still a kid yourself, parents raise children, naturally it hurts them most....to be blaming parents for adding stress is also totally unwarranted...good parents want their children to lead better lives and good education provides for that. not all children are made the same, some require more discipline than others..</p>
              <p>you want to see stress free kids, there are plenty who roam around chilling out, dropping out of schools and getting into trouble, that's stress free...</p>

              <p>This news was in the papers already... The education system seems to be flawed.</p>

              <p>I remember she lied saying she scored 261 for her PSLE when in fact she score 216.</p>

              <p>From all the replies, i can conclude:</p>
              <p>1) Ask what your child wants</p>
              <p>2) Ask what is stopping your child from reaching your
              expectations</p>
              <p>3) Provide help when necessary</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Quite concisely, you've listed down one of the ways such an event can be prevented.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, familiarity breeds contempt within the family, and we take each other's presence for granted. </p>
              <p>Quite sad that for some, it's only when death gives a visit that we stop and ponder such things.</p>
              <p>Anyway, no use blaming, won't bring back what's lost. Hope the parents of the kid can accept the loss and get the right support from society. </p>

              <p>Yup...you may be right. But we know that parents would want the best for their child I believe. They would want them to be successful in their life and thus deem such work is required for them to do well.</p>
              <p>But if even society condones this, then this is truly partial fault of the Singaporean Society.</p>
              <p>What I mean is that.....what has MOE (or the government) done to alleviate this predicament or issue? The only time they did was to do away with Pri3 streaming which helps. Other than that? What did MOE do to alleviate exam stress? Do they have pre-exam stress counselling? seminar for students to prepare mentally and psychologically for examinations? How to mitigate the stresses? Do they have parents/students/teacher gathering to also brief and work with parents on stress management?</p>
              <p>There is a whole shlt out there that MOE can do to prevent/reduce such sad incidents from happening. So, is the parent more experience or the school more experience with kids? A school with teachers having more than 20 over years experience on teaching and working with students or a parent where his/her only experience is his/her first kid where he/she has the only single experience of bringing up 1 single kid.  </p>

              <p><br>Yes, so the school/MOE should take the lead to provide counselling - what I mean is PRE-counselling, not Post-counselling when something has happened already.</p>
              <p>As busy parents it will be difficult for them to take the lead, schools should have pre-exam seminars or talks conducted etc to educate and teach them the proper methods of motivating kids, not using wrong methods etc that stress them with less improved outcome.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">An 11-year-old boy fell to his death yesterday afternoon.<br><br>The Primary 5 pupil from Sengkang Primary School is understood to have gone to a nearby block of flats after school and fallen from the 16th floor.<br><br>He was found in his school uniform at the foot of Block 241, Compassvale Walk at around 4.15pm. MediaCorp understands that he lived at Block 236. His parents could not be reached for comment, but some who knew the boy described him as being stressed by impending exams.<br><br>When MediaCorp visited the school at 9pm, the principal and several staff members were still there. Principal Lew-Lim Lau Chin said: "We can't comment further because police investigations are ongoing. But he was a good student. We are all very sorry for the loss." Police are investigating the unnatural death. TEO XUANWEI</span></p>

              <p>My parents in law live in that block, one unit over from where he fell. He went over at the rubbish chute, but really it was no fall, as the wall is almost two metres tall at that point. Had to climb up first.</p>
              <p>Poor kid. Stress is the impetus for these kinds of acts, but the blame rests solely on poor communication.</p>
              <p>As has already been stated, one level of stress can bring out the best in one person, whilst decreasing performance in another. It is the responsibility of the parent to teach their child moderation in all things.</p>
              <p>Relying on the State to look after your children is like handing them scissors and asking them to go for a run. The State only looks after one thing; the State. Utopian's who believe that the State can ever perform any other function are sadly mistaken.</p>
