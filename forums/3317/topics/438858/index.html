              gardening-related businesses at Jalan Penjara, plans to take the 
              Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to court over tenancy issues.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It is believed to be the first such case involving property managed by the SLA.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Garden Hub was meant to be a one-stop station for all things related to gardening and landscaping.<br><br>But the fate of 15 sub-tenants is now in limbo.<br><br>This comes after the master tenant was served a termination notice earlier this month by SLA, to clear out by 22 September.<br><br>Channel
               NewsAsia obtained the letter, which said the premises were only meant 
              for plant nurseries and ornamental plant production.<br><br>It added the tenant had sublet the area for unauthorised uses, without prior approval.<br><br>Garden Hub is now planning to take legal action on the matter.<br><br>It is still business as usual for many of the subtenants. <br><br>At
               the moment, it is unclear if it is illegal for them to continue 
              occupying these premises because of SLA's termination notice. <br><br>But on the other hand, subtenants also said they remain contractually bound to Garden Hub.<br><br>One
               subtenant said: "It's been very, very difficult because we don't know 
              where we are and whether we are here legally or illegally, so that's 
              been the most difficult part, and not knowing what to do and who to ask 
              for help. <br><br>"It's a very, very difficult situation because we have all invested a lot of money here. <br><br>"Before we came here, this place has been vacant for a very long time and very, very badly maintained."<br> <br>Subtenants
               said business has been hit, some as much as half, since the dispute 
              unfolded as customers are unaware whether they are open or not.<br><br>Cookyn
               Inc co-owner Dexter Tai said: "All the long-term plans that we have for
               this place is on hold for this point in time because we don't really 
              know what's the final outcome.<br><br>"We have spent a lot of money, our life savings are all in here.<br><br>"The
               four directors, we're all friends. Hopefully our friendship stays. But 
              more important is our responsibility to our sponsors and also our 
              clients."<br><br>For now, SLA said it is reviewing the court papers filed.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <h1>Lease terminated; two firms sue Govt</h1>
              <p>The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) has terminated the lease on two 
              properties in Queenstown because of what it said were 'persistent 
              breaches' of the tenancy agreements.</p>
              <p>These include sub-letting parts of the properties without prior 
              approval from the SLA, sub-letting parts for unauthorised uses and 
              erecting unauthorised structures.</p>
              <p>In turn, Nursery Mart and Garden Hub, which had leased the land, have
               started legal action against the Government on this matter.</p>
              <p>This is the first time legal action has been taken against the Government as far as SLA-managed properties are concerned.</p>
