              <p><strong>Ethnic groups' academic performance steady for past decade: MOE</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Education Ministry has released its annual report
              on the academic performance of Singapore's three main ethnic groups -
              and it has shown that performance figures have held steady for the past
              decade. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore's primary school students have generally done well for
              the PSLE in the last 10 years, with pass rates above 90 per cent.
              <br> <br>Most have no problem with English or their mother tongue, with at
              least 94 per cent of Chinese, Malays and Indians earning at least a C
              grade.
              <br> <br>But Maths remains the archilles' heel of many Malay students. In
              2008, only 56.3 per cent scored at least a C, compared to the national
              average of 83.1 per cent. It was also down from 10 years ago, when 63.4
              per cent of Malay students got the same grade.
              <br> <br>Across the board, the number of O-level passes have gone up since
              1999, with Malays seeing the biggest jump - from 49 per cent to 59 per
              cent in 2008. But overall, they continue to lag behind the national
              average.
              <br> <br>Neither has the gap significantly narrowed between Malay students
              and other ethnic groups. This is despite continual efforts of the Malay
              community to reach out to students. Some observers said one reason is
              broken families.
              <br> <br>Abdul Halim Kader, president, Taman Bacaan, said: "If you do not
              address this issue properly, it will continue to affect the educational
              performance of the Malay students, especially at the lower educational
              levels."
              <br> <br> Educators said the lack of family support can also undermine efforts to help kids with their grades.
              <br> <br>Clifford Chua, principal, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School,
              said: "Many of the areas are focused on looking at children and how
              they are doing in school, how they are performing in school, what are
              their needs.
              <br> <br>"Perhaps now we should shift our attention and look at parents,
              struggling parents, and how we can help them to work with their
              children and help them take ownership of their children's education."
              <br> <br> Mr Chua said that even though there are programmes for parents, the challenge is to get them to participate. </span></p>
