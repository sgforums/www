              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore society has often been described as "kiasu"
               - a term used to refer to Singaporeans' innate fear of losing out.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This label still sticks, according to an independent survey by local consulting firm aAdvantage and the Barrett Values Centre.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singapore residents were asked what values and behaviours described Singapore today.<br> <br>Besides
               being "kiasu", Singapore was seen to be competitive, self-centred, 
              defined by material needs, and "kiasi', a term which literally means 
              being afraid of death.<br> <br>The study polled 2,000 Singapore citizens
               and Permanent Residents representing different gender, ages and living 
              in different housing types.<br><br>Experts behind the study said these 
              are potentially-limiting values - not necessarily negative, but possibly
               so if sustained in the long term.<br><br>CEO of Barrett Values Centre, 
              Phil Clothier, said: "One of the numbers we look at is the total 
              percentage of all the limiting values that respondents picked out. Some 
              nations would have limiting values like corruption, blame, manipulation.
               The total percentage can range anywhere from the high end like 60-70 
              per cent, to as low as 4 per cent, which is in fact the figure for 
              Bhutan. Singapore's number is 41 per cent, which means it's actually in 
              the lower areas.<br><br>"One thing that's interesting about the 
              Singapore current culture, those limiting values particularly, is that 
              they're much more of a psychological nature, rather than, on the street 
              really seeing trouble. So we don't see words like crime and violence, 
              and corruption."<br><br>Mr Clothier thinks Singapore residents' honesty 
              in acknowledging these potentially-limiting values is a good sign that 
              they are open to change and improvement.<br><br>Mr Baey Yam Keng, deputy
               chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for 
              Information, Communications and the Arts, agreed. <br><br>He said: "I 
              think it's a reflection that Singaporeans can also be self-critical, and
               realise our own shortcomings and there are certain areas we need to 
              improve. I think it's not necessarily bad, because it means we're being 
              honest, and hopefully we can turn ourselves in the direction that we can
               all improve as a society in the way we think, in the way we behave."<br><br>The
               survey comes as the government recently announced that it wants to kick
               off a national conversation on the future of the country.<br><br>Respondents were also asked what values and behaviours best described themselves.<br> <br>And these were family, friendship, health, happiness and being caring.<br><br>But
               when asked what residents desired in Singapore society, the top five 
              answers that came up were: affordable housing, caring for the elderly, 
              effective health care, caring for the disadvantaged and compassion.<br><br>But some said the survey findings don't paint the full picture.<br><br>Director
               of Behavioral Sciences Institute at Singapore Management University, 
              Professor David Chan, pointed to the survey methodology asking 
              respondents to pick 10 values out of a prepared list of about 90.<br><br>He
               said: "I think it's timely to do a survey as this is to find out 
              values. But at the same time, we should be very cautious about the 
              findings of this particular survey.<br><br>"My understanding is that 
              there are important values such as religious freedom, freedom of 
              religion, religious harmony, rule of law which are not included in the 
              list provided. So it would never have been able to be endorsed. And 
              these are values which I think are quite important, as shown by previous
               surveys done in Singapore."<br><br>Additionally, the survey sought to find out how Singaporeans see their current and desired workplaces. <br> <br>Respondents
               in the private sector saw their current workplaces being defined by 
              customer satisfaction, cost reduction and team work.<br> <br>Those in the public sector picked team work, bureaucracy and customer satisfaction. <br> <br>But
               it was work-life balance, along with employee recognition and team 
              work, that came up most often when asked what they desired of their 
              workplace.<br><br>However as Singapore gears up for a national dialogue,
               most observers agree the survey findings offer compelling food for 
              thought. <br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Many S'poreans "quietly kind": Josephine Teo</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Many Singaporeans are "quietly kind" and acts of 
              kindness here are not as uncommon as it seems, said MP for Bishan-Toa 
              Payoh GRC Ms Josephine Teo. This was in response to a recent independent
               survey that found Singaporeans competitive and self-centred.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singapore society has often been described as "kiasu" - a term used to refer to Singaporeans' innate fear of losing out.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However, Ms Teo, who
               is also the Minister of State for Finance and Transport, disagrees. 
              This after Singapore residents were recently asked what values and 
              behaviours described society today.<br><br>While Ms Teo noted such studies were useful, she cautioned against taking them too seriously. <br><br>She
               said: "Based on our interactions with many people in the community, I'd
               like to believe, yes, we may be a fast paced competitive society, but 
              there is still a lot more of the other 'K' - kindness rather than 
              kiasu."<br><br>She added that kindness is extremely important in a 
              multi-racial, multi-religious society, and more can be done to bring out
               the gentler and kinder side of Singaporeans.<br><br>One way to do so is to start them young in kindergarten. <br><br>Dr
               Tamilselvan, chairman of the Saraswathy Kindergarten Management 
              Committee, said: "Kindness, unlike mathematics or science, is not an 
              academic subject and it's emotional based. One of the things children 
              can do is write journals, where children will actually pen down what are
               the kind acts they have done everyday."<br><br>The Singapore Kindness Movement, launched in 1997, aims to promote the message of kindness and respect to all residents.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
