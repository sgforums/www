              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The government has announced the full alignment for 
              the 21.5-kilometre-long North-South Expressway (NSE), with the southern 
              segment unveiled on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The final 
              5.6-kilometre stretch of the expressway will be an underground tunnel 
              beginning from Toa Payoh Rise and ending at East Coast Parkway.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It will pass along Thomson Road, Bukit Timah Road and Ophir Road before leading to the East Coast Parkway Expressway.<br><br>In
               January, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) had announced the alignment
               for the northern segment between Admiralty Road West and Toa Payoh 
              Rise.<br><br>When ready by 2020, NSE, which is Singapore's 11th 
              expressway, is expected to cut travel time for motorists by up to 30 per
               cent.<br><br>For example, a journey between Yishun and the city currently takes about 30 to 35 minutes.<br><br>With the NSE, the same journey can be completed between 20 and 30 minutes.<br><br>LTA
               chief executive Chew Hock Yong said: "We were looking for the southern 
              segment to link up in a nice way to the ECP so it has to take a certain 
              alignment that comes round that way into city. <br><br>"The city is very
               built-up so the southern segment is all underground, and as much as 
              possible, we follow the alignment of existing rounds, so as to minimise 
              the acquisition of private properties and we use state land to build the
               expressway."<br><br>But several properties will have to make way for the southern segment.<br><br>Two full lots and 21 partials lots will be acquired.<br><br>They include four HDB blocks of flats at Rochor Centre which has been around since 1977.<br><br>This will be the largest acquisition of HDB flats to date.<br><br>Mr
               Chew said: "We studied the alignment, and in the city it gets very 
              crowded and at that area, there are MRT lines that are running there. <br><br>"There's
               the Bugis MRT station and there's the Downtown Line station being 
              constructed, there is a canal running along Rochor Canal and for 
              engineering reasons, the road has to be of a certain level of 
              straightness... because the cars would have to travel at a certain 
              speed. <br><br>"So taking all that into account, that was the alignment 
              that we have to settle on and unfortunately it will affect the blocks 
              that are there."<br><br>Residents of  567 flats at Rochor Centre will be
               offered relocation benefits similar to those offered under the 
              Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).<br><br>Eighty-three per cent of the flats acquired are three-room units.<br><br>HDB will build about 810 units of new flats at Kallang as replacement housing for the residents affected.<br><br>Located
               next to Kallang River, residents will also be well-served by a good 
              transportation network, with the Kallang MRT station being a five-minute
               walk.<br><br>Some 187 rental shops and eating houses at Rochor Centre will also be affected.<br><br>They
               will be given a 10 per cent preferential discount off the monthly 
              rental rates when they successfully tender for other HDB rental 
              commercial properties, or when they take over other HDB rental 
              commercial properties through assignment.<br><br>Nanyang Pho Leng 
              Association, located at Keng Lee Road and which has been in operation 
              since 1970, will have to make way for the NSE.<br><br>The Nanyang Pho Leng Building is home to a Teochew clan association, which has more than 1,000 members. <br><br>LTA said the association will be given assistance in their purchase of and relocation to a replacement property.<br><br>Land
               acquisition notices have been handed out since 12pm Tuesday and the 
              Singapore Land Authority has gazetted the lands affected by the 
              acquisition.<br><br>Some state properties will also be making way for the NSE. <br><br>They include Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home and Victoria Street Wholesale Centre. <br><br>They will be able to complete their current tenancy or licence when the NSE works starts. <br><br>The lease for Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home has been extended till September 2013.<br><br>Advance works for the NSE will start progressively from 2013, and major construction works will start in 2015.<br><br>The
               construction of the NSE will benefit residents living in the north and 
              north-eastern sectors of Singapore as it caters to the expected growth 
              in traffic demand generated by new developments there. <br><br>It will 
              connect towns along the north-south corridor -- Woodlands, Sembawang, 
              Yishun, Ang Mo Kio, Bishan and Toa-Payoh -- to the city centre.<br><br>Running
               parallel to the Central Expressway, NSE will help to alleviate the 
              traffic load on the heavily-utilised expressway, as well as the major 
              arterial roads nearby such as Thomson Road and Marymount Road.<br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>
