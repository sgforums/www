              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>CHICAGO: Walmart has
               pulled infant formula from the shelves of its 3,000 stores after two 
              babies in Missouri got sick and one of them died, the retailer said on 
              Thursday.<br><br>Health officials have not yet determined whether the 
              bacterial infection which sickened the newborns was linked to the 
              powdered formula, but Walmart said it was pulling the product "out of an
               abundance of caution."<br><br>"We extend our deepest condolences to 
              this baby boy's family as they try to come to grips with their loss," 
              Walmart spokesperson Dianna Gee told AFP.<br><br>The retailer only removed Enfamil formula from the lot number in question: ZP1K7G, Gee said.<br><br>"Walmart
               customers who may have purchased the item at our stores can return it 
              for a full refund or exchange it for another brand of formula," she 
              added.<br><br>The formula manufacturer said it tests all of ingredients 
              and products prior to shipment and does not believe the bacteria was 
              present at time of sale.<br><br>"The batch of our product used by the 
              child's family tested negative for Cronobacter when it was produced and 
              packaged, and that has been reconfirmed from our batch records following
               this news," spokesman Chris Perille said.<br><br>"We are highly confident in the safety and quality of our products - and the rigorous testing we put them through."<br><br>Mead
               Johnson Nutrition is "working with the health authorities to support 
              their efforts to identify the source or cause of this infant's 
              infection," he said, adding "our hearts go out to the child's family for
               their tragic loss."<br><br>Missouri health officials have sent the 
              formula to federal labs for testing and urged parents to be careful 
              because "powdered infant formulas are not commercially sterile 
              products."<br><br>They noted that powdered infant formula is the only 
              type of food linked to outbreaks of this type of infection and that "no 
              exclusively breastfed infants have been reported to have" the infection.<br><br>They
               urged parents to careful store powdered formula, prepare only small 
              amounts that will be used right away, sterilise bottles, boil water used
               to prepare formula for at least two minutes and wash their hands 
              thoroughly in order to prevent contamination.<br><br>"Until testing is 
              completed it cannot be determined whether the illness is linked to 
              Enfamil Newborn Formula 12.5 oz. cans Lot # ZP1K7G or an outside 
              source," the health department said in a statement.<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>
