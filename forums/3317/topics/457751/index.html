              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Whenever Christina Tang is overseas and returns to 
              her hotel room, she always knocks on the door before entering even if 
              she is the only occupant.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 25-year-old 
              Singaporean marketing executive said knocking on the door is meant to 
              seek permission from the "good brothers" -- spirits that might have 
              taken over her room while she was away -- for her to stay over for the 
              night.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"It's just like 
              visiting a friend. You would definitely not barge in without the 
              courtesy of a doorbell or a knock on the door, right? To me, it's just 
              respect."<br><br>Singapore might be one of Asia's wealthiest and most 
              well-educated societies, but quirky superstitions are part of daily life
               in the predominantly ethnic Chinese city-state.<br><br>Superstition comes to the fore during the month-long Hungry Ghost Festival, which began on Friday.<br><br>Chinese
               superstition holds that the gates of hell are opened for spirits to 
              wander across the mortal realm before they return to the underworld.<br><br>During
               the month, property sales fall because it is considered inauspicious to
               make major purchases, and people refrain from staying out too late to 
              avoid otherworldly encounters.<br><br>Noisy streetside shows called 
              "getai" featuring professional singers are staged to entertain the 
              visiting spirits -- but don't sit on the empty front seats because 
              they're reserved for the invisible guests.<br><br>Traffic jams are 
              typically caused not only by crumpled cars obstructing traffic but also 
              by drivers slowing down to take note of the license plate numbers so 
              that they can bet on them in the hugely popular four-digit lottery.<br><br>Having
               bird droppings land on your head is also seen as a good omen for 
              gamblers because it's so rare for one to be hit in the concrete jungle.<br><br>A
               tree in a western suburb has attracted a following due to the likeness 
              of a monkey on its bark, which believers say resembles that of a deity 
              from Chinese mythology.<br><br>The "Monkey Tree" drew so much attention 
              at one point that authorities had to explain to a local newspaper that 
              the visage was a "natural" response by the tree to various "minor 
              accidents over the years".<br><br>Even national icons are not immune to superstition.<br><br>Operators
               of the bayside Singapore Flyer, said to be the world's largest ferris 
              wheel, reversed its spinning direction in 2008 so that it revolves 
              towards the financial district and not the sea.<br><br>Masters of feng 
              shui -- the ancient practice of balancing energies in any given space to
               attract good fortune -- advised them that the wheel's revolution should
               bring fortune into Singapore, not suck the good luck away.<br><br>Superstitious
               practices are often mistakenly associated with religion in Singapore, 
              where many Chinese are followers of Buddhism or Taoism, said Chung Kwang
               Tong, a high priest with the local Taoist Federation.<br><br>"The 
              religion itself does not have such practices," he told AFP. "A lot of 
              them will just try because to them there is no harm in trying."<br><br>Ang
               Swee Hoon, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore, said 
              even well-educated people resort to superstitious practices because of 
              the highly competitive environment in Singapore.<br><br>"Hence, to get a
               leg up, Singaporeans engage in more activities that will give them an 
              advantage. Superstitious behaviours seemingly offer that," Ang said. 
              "So, instead of superstitions being irrational, it may be perceived as 
              rational."<br><br>Ang said the opening of two massive casinos in 2010 
              further boosted superstitious practices in gambling-mad Singapore, which
               already has horse racing, sweepstakes, numbers games and sports betting
               operations.<br><br>Red underwear is seen as sexy in many countries, but
               to Singaporean gamblers, it's just another way of attracting good 
              fortune because red is regarded as a lucky colour among Chinese.<br><br>Gamblers and financial traders often wear red undergaments before placing a bet or playing the stock market.<br><br>"Gamblers are generally a more superstitious lot," Ang said.<br><br>- AFP/ck</span></span></p>
