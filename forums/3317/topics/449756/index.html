              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of National Development (MND) may include two new indicators in its Town Council Management Report.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The two are "need 
              for corporate governance" and "financial adequacy", derived after survey
               and consultation efforts with residents. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The survey was conducted with a sample of around 500 HDB residents aged 21 years old and above. <br><br>Nine in 10, or 90.4 per cent of respondents, said it was important for the town council to ensure its finances are healthy.<br><br>Meanwhile 88.4 per cent said it was important the town council complies with government rules and regulations.<br><br>The
               survey also found the majority of respondents are supportive of the 
              current four indicators, such as cleanliness, maintenance of common 
              facilities and lifts, as well as arrears in service and conservancy 
              charges.<br> <br>It also showed that the level of awareness of the 
              report was still not high, with only 16 per cent of respondents saying 
              they are aware of the report. <br><br>MND started publishing the Town 
              Council Management Report in 2010 to give residents a report card on 
              their town councils' performance in estate management.<br><br>The survey
               underscored that the function which respondents rated important or very
               important, was the cleanliness of HDB common areas and estate -- at 
              98.2 per cent of respondents.<br><br>The maintenance of common 
              facilities was the second highest at 97.9 per cent, while the 
              maintenance of lifts and breakdown prevention followed closely at 97.3 
              per cent.<br><br>81.9 per cent of respondents felt it was important for the town council to keep the service and conservancy charges debt low.<br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Two new performance indicators added to town councils' report card</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of National Development (MND) added on April 1 two new indicators to the report card for town councils.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The 15 town councils
               will now be assessed on their corporate governance and financial 
              adequacy, in addition to four other existing indicators.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>MND said the 
              introduction of these two indicators aims to promote greater 
              accountability and transparency, and encourage community ownership of 
              the management of public housing estates.<br><br>For corporate 
              governance, town councils have to submit a self-declared checklist on 
              their compliance with the Town Councils Act and Town Councils Financial 
              Rules. The report will provide information on whether the town councils'
               auditors have made any governance-related observations in their annual 
              financial audit.<br><br>For financial adequacy, there will be 
              information on the adequacy of town councils' funds to meet future 
              expenses, especially big-ticket items such as repainting and repairs, 
              and lift replacements.<br><br>MND said this will help residents better 
              understand whether the town councils have adequate funding through the 
              service and conservancy charges collected.<br><br>The ministry will 
              appoint a professional consultant to develop an appropriate assessment 
              methodology on town councils' financial adequacy.<br><br>More details will be announced at a future date.<br><br>The existing four indicators of the report will also be enhanced to better reflect public concerns.<br><br>For
               cleanliness and maintenance, the report will take into account the 
              severity of the observations. Greater weightage will be given to lapses 
              posing hygiene, health or safety concerns. <br><br>For example, the town
               council will be rated more poorly for failing to replace a missing 
              manhole cover, which poses a safety threat, than for failing to replace a
               missing fluorescent light-tube. <br><br>For lift performance, the enhanced report will also measure the percentage of lifts in a town that break down frequently. <br><br>The
               first Town Council Management Report -- which covers the period from 
              April to September -- under the new framework will be published by the 
              end of 2012.<br><br>- CNA/wm/ck</span></span></p>
