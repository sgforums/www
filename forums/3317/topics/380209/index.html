              <p>BRUSSELS (AFP) - â€“ First, it was
              Commerzbank, ING and now Northern Rock -- European Union competition
              regulators are imposing tough conditions on banks that benefited from
              state bailouts, deepening concerns for the likes of Lloyds, RBS and
              Dexia.</p>
              <p>EU competition regulators on Wednesday approved the
              state aid contained in plans to break up and sell British nationalised
              bank Northern Rock in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p>
              <p>Competition
              commissioner Neelie Kroes said the proposed changes "will allow the
              bank to become viable in the long-term and limit distortions of
              competition."</p>
              <p>Welcomed on this occasion by the British
              Treasury, the deal to bring Northern Rock back from the brink of
              collapse will see it split into a "good bank" that will continue its
              economic activities, and a "bad bank" management company to run down
              the remaining assets.</p>
              <p>The British government's aid includes
              recapitalisation measures of up to three billion pounds (4.43 billion
              euros), liquidity measures of up to 27 billion pounds and guarantees
              for liabilities of several billion pounds.</p>
              <p>Once Britain's
              fifth-biggest home loan provider, Northern Rock faced potential
              collapse in September 2007 and requested emergency funding from the
              Bank of England -- sparking the first run on a British bank for more
              than a century.</p>
              <p>The commission's ruling comes after Dutch
              banking and insurance group ING said it would restructure, under
              pressure from the EU regulator, to pay back emergency state funds.</p>
              <p>ING said Monday it would sell off its insurance operations and raise up to 7.5 billion euros (11.25 billion dollars).</p>
              <p>As
              Kroes heads towards the end of her tenure in the plum competition job,
              she has made a concerted drive to rein in banks previously considered
              "too big to fail."</p>
              <p>Germany's Commerzbank has already been
              forced to shed 45 percent of its balance sheet after it received aid
              from the German state, which now owns 25 percent of the group.</p>
              <p>And
              Belgium's Dexia, like ING, was also yellow carded by the commission
              this month for announcing to markets the early repayment of debt
              without first alerting European competition authorities.</p>
              <p>Dexia
              -- itself under investigation for nearly eight months -- and ING have
              between them announced over one billion euros of such repayments.</p>
              <p>Bankruptcy
              is no longer taboo, in the commission's eyes -- with one banking source
              saying it is "frightening" what is happening with ING.</p>
              <p>Stock markets seemed to agree. Shares in the banks concerned fell following Brussels' announcements.</p>
              <p>Kroes has long had the two biggest British bank rescues -- Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group -- in her sights.</p>
              <p>Lloyds
              is expected to face a forced reduction in its share of the retail
              banking market from 30 percent to 25 percent, with the disposal of more
              than a seventh of its 3,000 branches, Britain's Independent newspaper
              reported on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>RBS, which is 70 percent owned by the
              taxpayer after it was saved from collapse by a government bailout last
              year, is also working on plans to sell off several hundred branches.</p>
              <p>RBS
              had to be rescued after it was ravaged by the credit crunch and
              weakened by its 2007 takeover of Dutch group ABN Amro at the top of the
              market.</p>
              <p>Last year, it recorded Britain's biggest ever corporate
              loss of more than 24 billion pounds (26 billion euros, 38 billion
              dollars).</p>
