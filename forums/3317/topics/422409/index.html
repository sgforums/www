              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Association of Women for Action and Research 
              (AWARE) called for the government to make several policy changes to 
              support gender equality and improved parenting leave - at a time when 
              Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) has dropped to an all-time low.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In particular, it asked for paternity leave to be mandated by law.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>AWARE suggested that a "parenting present" of S$4,000 be offered to couples where the father opts for parental leave.<br><br>AWARE
               executive director Corinna Lim said: "We have looked at studies in 
              other countries, and we have found that this kind of parenting leave is 
              quite a good idea and does promote gender equality but only if there is 
              an incentive for the fathers to take the leave".<br><br>The organisation said it finds support in the views expressed by about 1,000 working parents in a survey conducted recently. <br><br>When asked whether they thought paternity leave should be made compulsory, about nine in 10 said 'yes'.<br><br>Most said paternity leave would allow fathers to be more involved in parenting. <br><br>Ms
               Lim said: "(The) first significant finding is that 91 per cent of 
              respondents want to have mandated paternity leave -- (from a ) minimum 
              of six days up to as (many) as 14 days.<br><br>"Our recommendation is 
              that paternity leave be mandated (with) two weeks (of) paid leave -- the
               leave payment to be shared by (the) state and employer(s)".<br><br>Nearly
               six out of 10 respondents would also like the last four weeks of 
              maternity leave to be transferable from mother to father.<br><br>Meanwhile,
               nine out of 10 felt single and unwed parents should get the same 
              childcare and infant care benefits as married parents.<br><br>AWARE said
               two important factors in trying to reverse the declining TFR are better
               support for parenting responsibilities and policies that promote gender
               equality.<br><br>The organisation said it felt that Singapore's current
               parenting leave policies -- where new mothers are given four months 
              maternity leave and none for new fathers -- reinforce gender stereotypes
               of women as caregivers and men as providers.<br><br>The organisation 
              said such policies entrench gender inequality and need to be changed if 
              Singapore hopes to reverse the declining birth rate trend.<br><br>In an 
              email response, GPC chair for the Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports Seah Kian Peng said he is supportive of the proposals for 
              paternity leave to be be mandated and maternity leave to be 
              transferable.<br><br>He said the government should be prepared to try 
              more options to address the low birth rate and not be deterred by any 
              administrative challenges.<br><br>Meanwhile, Centre for Fathering 
              executive director Wong Suen Kwong said the centre welcomes any 
              initiative that would facilitate the involvement of fathers in the early
               stages of their babies' lives and for wives to feel supported.<br><br>The
               AWARE-led survey was conducted by final-year Business Studies and 
              Business Information Technology students who are specialising in 
              marketing at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Business &amp; 
              Accountancy. <br><br>The survey was conducted between October 2010 and January 2011.<br><br>-CNA/fa/wk</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Take our survey: Will Aware's ideas work?</h1>
              <p>THE Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) is calling for five policy changes to help the falling birth rate here.</p>
              <p>The association wants paternity leave of two weeks to be made mandatory.</p>
              <p>It is also for converting the final month of the existing four-month maternity leave into a parental one.</p>
              <p>Aware's call comes in the wake of Singapore's fertility rate being at a record low.</p>
              <p>In 2010, it plummeted to 1.16, a far cry from the replacement rate of 2.1.</p>
              <p>A recent study of 1,000 young working parents commissioned 
              by Aware, found that nine in 10 support compulsory paternity leave, 
              while over half want the option to transfer leave from mum to dad.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Make paid paternity leave of two weeks mandatory, with the cost shared between the employer and the state. (Will work or Won't Work?)<br><br></li>
              <li>Convert the 4th month of maternity leave into ‘parental leave’ to be 
              taken by either parent, with the state sharing the cost with the 
              employer when the father takes this leave.			
              															(Will work or Won't Work?)<br><br></li>
              <li>Offer a ‘parenting present’ of $4,000 to couples where the father takes the 4th month of parental leave.			
              															(Will work or Won't Work?)<br><br></li>
              <li>Convert the currently mandated 6 days of paid childcare leave into 
              dependent’s leave, with ‘dependents’ including older children and 
              parents.			
              															(Will work or Won't Work?)<br><br></li>
              <li>Extend to unwed parents the same parenting leave benefits enjoyed by married parents.

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Aware's paternity leave scheme, S'poreans divided</h1>
              <p>MORE than 1,000 Singaporeans responded to an online poll conducted by
               The Straits Times, giving a mixed response to five policy changes 
              recommended by Aware on paternity leave recently.</p>
              <p>The gender equality advocacy group's call earlier this week came in 
              the wake of Singapore's fertility rate dropping to a record low.</p>
              <p>About 1,100 readers shared their views with us on whether Aware's recommendations are viable.</p>
              <p><strong>Recommendation 1: </strong></p>
              <p>Make paid paternity leave of two weeks mandatory, with the cost shared between the employer and the state.</p>
              <p>Percentage of respondents who believe this will work - 66%</p>
              <p>Featured comments:</p>
              <p>'Most men's thinking is still very traditional. Besides, 
              they may view this as a hindrance to their work. If a couple were to 
              work in same company, it will be a burden to the company as it means 2 
              staff members are down.'</p>
              <p>'This will burden the country and company. The employer has 
              no obligation to pay. Why not mandate to revert the employer CPF to 20% 
              instead, which will prove more effective?'</p>
              <p><strong>Recommendation 2:</strong></p>
              <p>Convert the 4th month of maternity leave into 'parental 
              leave' to be taken by either parent, with the state sharing the cost 
              with the employer when the father takes this leave.</p>
              <p>Percentage of respondents who believe this will work - 55%</p>
              <p>Featured comments:</p>
              <p>'Paternity leave should be made separate and distinct from 
              maternity leave. Won't it be a step backwards for maternity leave 
              benefits if the 4th month is utilised in such a way?'</p>
              <p>'Long-term solutions are needed. These one-off baits are 
              just temporary. Parenting is a lifetime commitment, so long-term help 
              for families should be looked into...'</p>
              <p><strong>Recommendation 3:</strong></p>
              <p>Offer a 'parenting present' of $4,000 to couples where the father takes the 4th month of parental leave.</p>
              <p>Percentage of respondents who believe it will work - 54%</p>
              <p>Featured comments:</p>
              <p>'The father will take the leave for the sake of $4000, but 
              whether he will stay at home to take care of the child is another 
              question. Will he simply leave the child with the granny or maid?'</p>
              <p>'Is this supposed to encourage taking the 4th month as 
              parental leave? Think about what's the objective of granting the 
              additional maternity leave to start with. Do not confuse the original 
              intentions.'</p>
              <p><strong>Recommendation 4:</strong></p>
              <p>Convert the currently mandated 6 days of paid childcare 
              leave into dependent's leave, with 'dependents' including older children
               and parents.</p>
              <p>Percentage of respondents who believe this will work - 64%</p>
              <p>Featured comments:</p>
              <p>'This shows an understanding that everyone has dependents, not just those people with kids.'</p>
              <p>'This is a benefit for parents with young children but 
              perhaps for children from 7 years up to 12 years old, parents can also 
              utilise such 'childcare leave' or flexible time-off for children when 
              they fall sick.'</p>
              <p><strong>Recommendation 5:</strong></p>
              <p>Extend to unwed parents the same parenting leave benefits enjoyed by married parents.</p>
              <p>Percentage of respondents who believe it will work - 53%</p>
              <p>Featured comments</p>
              <p>'We know the government is not encouraging single 
              parenthood. But like every developed country, Singapore has its single 
              parents and we should learn to acknowledge them soon. Rather have single
               parents who are responsible, than have problematic couples who end up 
              in divorce and a traumatic child.'</p>
              <p>'This addresses only a small percentage. And are you 
              encouraging people to have kids and not go into the commitment of 
              marriage? This will give rise to social issues in the future.'</p>
