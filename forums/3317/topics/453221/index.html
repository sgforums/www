              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Maid agencies in Singapore will now have to apply 
              online for employment contracts for Indonesian foreign domestic workers 
              with the country's embassy. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The change takes effect on Wednesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The new online 
              system will help the embassy compile data and track the domestic workers
               from the time they leave Indonesia for Singapore.<br><br>The Indonesian embassy held a briefing for employment agencies on Wednesday to explain the changes.<br><br>In the past, the embassy said it does not have full information of all its domestic workers in Singapore.<br><br>This is because the data was just shared between employment agencies in Indonesia and Singapore.<br><br>Now, both Indonesia and Singapore employment agencies must key in the necessary data into the online system.<br><br>The embassy said having such information will help it safeguard the welfare of its citizens.<br><br>Sukmo
               Yuwono, counsellor, Indonesian Embassy in Singapore, said: "Based on 
              all that data, I'm very confident it will give protection in the 
              beginning when the Indonesian domestic helper has problems in Singapore.
               <br><br>"Because if I have a call from the police, for example, if I 
              don't have any data, I have to find out by myself. I need to search 
              through Indonesia, search all the agencies... but if they are already 
              keyed in to our system, I will just find out from the system."<br><br>Employment agencies said the online process may be more tedious.<br><br>This
               is because even after the online process, agencies have to print out 
              the Employment Contract and submit it to the embassy for endorsement. 
              Agencies then need to send the Employment Contract to their counterparts
               in Indonesia.<br><br>This new system is also expected to put a stop to the practice of some employers who hire maids directly from Indonesia.<br><br>K
               Jayaprema, president, Association of Employment Agencies, said: "So we 
              are looking at more business for the local employment agencies because 
              it looks like only the accredited agencies with the Indonesian embassy 
              will be able to download the employment contract. <br><br>"So definitely
               employers have to go to a local agency to help them with this contract.
               And it's not going to just stop with new girls coming in, I think it's 
              also for renewal, also for the transfer of girls." <br><br>The 
              Indonesian government said it wants to stop sending domestic workers 
              abroad as of 2017. It wants to provide comprehensive training so that 
              workers are ready to enter more competitive industries. Stricter 
              requirements may also be applied by 2017.<br><br>"But it's something we 
              have to wait and see how effective this is going to be because 
              definitely, they see anybody working overseas as a better source of 
              income. So unless they are able to earn equally good salaries, I don't 
              think the ban is going to work," said K Jayaprema, president, 
              Association of Employment Agencies.<br><br>The Indonesian government had
               previously imposed a moratorium on sending migrant workers to Saudi 
              Arabia due to the implementation of the death penalty on a number of 
              Indonesian workers there.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
