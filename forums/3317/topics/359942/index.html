              <p>INDIAN billionaire Bhupendra Kumar Modi moved into his $15.46 million
              penthouse at Marina Bay on Wednesday and immediately set about
              unpacking some ambitious plans for his new home country.</p>
              <p>The founder and chairman of conglomerate Spice Group - it has interests
              in telecommunications, technology, financial services and entertainment
              - has set up two funds worth more than $100 million to invest here.</p>
              <p>The tycoon also wants to open a 24/7 'Hollywood meets Bollywood'
              entertainment centre at one of two floating crystal pavilions coming up
              at the Marina Bay Sands integrated resort.</p>
              <p>Speaking to The Straits Times at his 63rd storey apartment at
              The Sail @ Marina Bay, Dr Modi said he plans to spend 'tens of
              millions' on the project and is in talks with Sands to either buy or
              lease a pavilion.</p>
              <p>'We are getting designers from Hollywood and from Bollywood
              to design it,' he said, adding that the IR could use his design or do
              its own. But the idea is to entice Hollywood and Bollywood stars to
              entertain crowds here on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>Dr Modi, 60, also owns a film production company and wants to
              attract directors. Indian star Anil Kapoor has been lined up to act in
              a movie to be shot here. The businessman, who relocated the global
              headquarters of Mumbai-based Spice Corp to Singapore last year, said he
              is here to stay.</p>
              <p>Dr Modi said that his two new funds involve nuts and bolts
              investment strategy and their share of risk-taking. One fund is a
              special-situation real estate vehicle. This will target half-completed
              projects here or projects that are delayed due to a lack of funds.</p>
              <p>'The world is going through a special situation...you need
              people to take special risks,' he said. 'We are looking for 25 per cent
              returns...high risks, high returns. We are not looking for immediate
              returns. We are willing to wait two, three years.'</p>
              <p>His team is assessing about 20 possible projects. Dr Modi
              said they are keen on joint ventures, and Marina Bay Sands is certainly
              on his radar screen. He also said he is discussing a deal to buy a
              residential building in the eastern part of Singapore. The other fund
              will focus on investment in entertainment.</p>
              <p>'Singapore is very much the right place for me,' said Dr
              Modi. It is cosmopolitan, secular, very secure, has a growing
              population, well-connected.'</p>
