              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Given Singapore's declining birth rate and ageing 
              population, more needs to be done in terms of providing adequate 
              childcare as well as meeting the needs of those caring for aged and 
              dependent relatives, the Association of Women for Action and Research 
              (AWARE) said on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Current caregiving 
              schemes including childcare and kindergarten subsidies are pegged to a 
              family monthly household income of S$1,800 or less.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However, the median monthly household income rose to S$5,000 this year, and so has the cost of living.<br><br>The eligibility criteria should be reviewed and revised, Aware said.<br><br>This
               call was among a slew of suggestions put forth by Aware in what the 
              gender equality advocacy group said was "a women's perspective" to the 
              upcoming Budget on Friday.<br><br>Other calls include: Singles - men or 
              women - who are caregivers and who employ foreign domestic workers 
              should be given the tax relief on the levy they pay to Ministry of 
              Manpower (MOM).<br><br>Unwed mothers should be extended the same motherhood and childcare benefits as married mothers.<br><br>The
               19-page, two-part submission spells out its proposals for policy-making
               and programmes implementation, which is divided into areas like 
              families with children, caregiving, as well as health and employment 
              issues.<br><br>"Women make up half the population. Women's issues are 
              the nation's issues, and every step taken to deal with these issues and 
              to ensure the development of women will mean better outcomes for 
              families and for society generally," said the paper.<br><br>A key 
              concern highlighted in the report is what Aware deemed an inconsistent 
              provision of gender or age-specific data, using last year's budget as an
               example.<br><br>The paper also noted that the Ministry of Community 
              Development, Youth and Sport's (MCYS) 2010 budget allocation was just 4 
              per cent, which AWARE considered "small" given that it looks into 
              "cradle to grave" issues.<br><br>Similarly MOM, which has tasks such as job creation, received just 2 per cent of the Singapore Budget pie.<br><br>AWARE said it believes that MCYS and MOM will need bigger budget allocations if they are to achieve their goals.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
