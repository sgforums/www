              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>TOKYO: Japan on 
              Wednesday called for stronger security ties with Southeast Asia as Tokyo
               looks to boost alliances at a time of growing territorial tensions with
               China.<br><br>Vice-minister level representatives from Japan and the 
              10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) began a two-day
               gathering at a Tokyo hotel, with several participating nations 
              embroiled in sovereignty rows with Beijing.<br><br>"The Asia-Pacific 
              region has various issues concerning security and defence... including 
              territorial conflicts in the South China Sea," Vice Defence Minister 
              Akinori Eto told the opening session of the closed-door meeting.<br><br>"On
               top of the growing maturity of our economic cooperation, Japan and 
              ASEAN need to further strengthen ties in the field of security and 
              defence," Eto said.<br><br>The meeting is the first high-ranking defence
               dialogue of its kind since hawkish Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 
              took office late December following a landslide victory in general 
              elections.<br><br>"Our country changed governments late last year," Eto 
              said, "Under the new regime, we want to reinforce cooperation in 
              security and defence with ASEAN countries and contribute to peace in the
               region," he added.<br><br>Ahead of the meeting, the ASEAN participants 
              met Abe late Tuesday and voiced their high expectations from Japan "in 
              dealing with various security issues of the Asia-Pacific region," the 
              defence ministry said in a statement.<br><br>Japan, along with several members of ASEAN have locked horns with China over separate territorial disputes.<br><br>Relations
               between Beijing and Tokyo have deteriorated badly over the last year as
               the two sides argued about the sovereignty of Tokyo-controlled islands 
              in the East China Sea.<br><br>On Tuesday, three Chinese government ships
               spent several hours in the 12-nautical-mile territorial zone off one of
               the Senkaku islands, claimed by Beijing under the name Diaoyus. Taiwan 
              also claims them.<br><br>ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, 
              Malaysia and Brunei, as well as China and Taiwan, have claims to parts 
              of the South China Sea, which contains some of the world's most 
              important shipping lanes and is believed to be rich in fossil fuels.<br><br>Simmering
               tensions over the issue have risen in the past two years, with the 
              Philippines and Vietnam accusing China of becoming increasingly 
              aggressive.<br><br>China claims most of the sea, including waters close to the shores of its neighbours.<br><br>Relations
               between the Philippines and China have become particularly tense since 
              patrol vessels from both countries engaged in a stand-off over the 
              Scarborough Shoal in April.<br><br>Analysts said China's recent prickliness meant regional alliances made sense.<br><br>"Japan
               and ASEAN can regard security cooperation as a realistic option because
               China is their common adversary," said Hideshi Takesada, a Japanese 
              defence expert and former professor at South Korea's Yonsei University.<br><br>"Practically,
               Japan can provide defence technologies or equipment to ASEAN so that 
              Japan can win their trust," said Takesada, who is also former professor 
              at Japan's National Institute for Defence Studies.<br><br>Japan 
              reportedly plans to donate patrol boats worth more than US$10 million 
              each to the Philippines, ramping up regional efforts to monitor China's 
              maritime activity in disputed waters.<br><br>The Japanese government 
              plans to finance the deal in its fiscal 2013 budget starting in April 
              and hopes to officially sign it early next year, the Nikkei business 
              daily reported last month.<br><br>- AFP/fa/fl</span></span></p>
