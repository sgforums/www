              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Police have arrested two men for suspected involvement in more than 200 cases of loansharking harassment islandwide.
              <br> <br> The men, aged 18 and 30, were nabbed on Monday following a report by a
              victim who found paint splashed on the door of her home at Jelapang
              Road last Thursday night.
              <br> <br> She spotted a suspicious man leaving the area in a private ambulance and called the police.
              <br> <br>On Monday, officers from the Jurong Police Division mounted an
              operation to arrest the 30-year-old suspect, a private ambulance
              driver. He is believed to be a debtor himself and used his company's
              ambulance illegally to conduct loansharking activities.
              <br> <br>Various loanshark-related paraphrenalia, including plastic packets
              filled with paint and boxes of coloured crayons were found at the back
              of the vehicle. Other items seized included ATM cards, two mobile
              phones and two notebooks.
              <br> <br> Police also arrested the accomplice on the same day and investigations showed that the two had met via an Internet chat line.
              <br> <br>Both suspects will be charged on Wednesday and if found guilty of
              loanshark harassment, they face a fine of between S$4,000 and S$40,000,
              or up to three years' jail, or both.
              <br> <br> They could also be caned if they had caused damage to property or harm to others while committing the harassment. </span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Nine men and a woman have been arrested for their
              suspected involvement in a loansharking syndicate. It is the second
              such syndicate to be cracked down in as many weeks.
              <br> <br> On July 1, police arrested seven others in connection with another syndicate.
              <br> <br>In the latest operation, officers from the Criminal Investigation
              Department and Police Intelligence Department fanned out islandwide to
              conduct raids at several locations in Bedok, Bukit Batok, Ang Mo Kio,
              Geylang, Yishun and Haig Road.
              <br> <br>They arrested the ten, aged between 26 to 45 years. Officers seized
              about S$9,000 in cash, laptops, mobile phones, computer storage
              devices, ATM cards and bank transaction slips.
              <br> <br>Preliminary investigations showed that the syndicate might have
              around 500 debtors linked to it. It could also be behind more than 900
              cases of harassment.
              <br> <br>First-time offenders found guilty of operating or helping in an
              unlicensed money lending business may be fined between S$20,000 and

              face a fine of up to S$200,000 and up to five years' jail.
              <br> <br>First-time offenders guilty of harassing debtors could be fined
              between S$4,000 and S$40,000, or jailed up to three years, or both.

              <p>Further checks revealed a red marker pen, two bicycle locks, two
