              <br> <br> This, after reports of loanshark harassment lodged in June this year.

              <br> <br>In the second case, Police arrested three men aged between 15 and
              30 on Tuesday for their suspected involvement in such activities.

              <br> <br>When officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division responded swiftly and
              spotted three men along Ang Mio Kio Street 61, they found mobile phones
              with suspected debtors' records and items used in loanshark harassment.
              <br> <br> These include spray paint, marker pens and rubber gloves.
              <br> <br>Two men aged 20 and 30 will be charged in Court on Wednesday while
              Police said the remaining two suspects will be released on bail,
              pending further investigations. </span></p>

              10.20pm along Yishun Avenue 1. </span></p>
              <p><span> Officers had noticed the suspects behaving suspiciously while on an anti-crime patrol. </span></p>

              <p><span> It is believed the men, aged 19 and 20, had helped loansharks to issue debtor notes for loan repayments. </span></p>
              <p><span> Both suspects will be charged in court on Wednesday. If convicted, they
              could be fined up to S$200,000 and jailed for up to two years. </span></p>

              <p><strong>8 people arrested by police in connection with a suspected loanshark syndicate</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Eight people, including three women were arrested by police in connection with a suspected loanshark syndicate. </span></p>
              <p><span>The suspected head of the syndicate was also arrested in the operation.
              <br> <br> The arrests were made after intensive probes by officers from the
              Criminal Investigation Department and the Police Intelligence
              Department. <br> <br> Police carried out raids at several locations including Woodlands, Depot Road, Clementi, Beo Crescent and Telok Blangah. 
              <br> <br> They also seized cash amounting to some S$16,000, mobile phones, ATM
              cards, suspected debtor records, and data storage devices including
              thumb-drives, laptops and computers.
              <br> <br>The eight suspects, aged between 22 and 34 years old, are believed
              to have used electronic fund transfers in the course of their business
              and conducted harassment in connection with debtors' loans. <br> <br> Assistant Director of the Specialised Crime Division CID (Covering),
              DSP Loh Kah Wai, said: "Even where loansharking syndicate members are
              not directly involved in harassment, they are not absolved of
              responsibility. From the operators who employ runners to harass debtors
              to the assistants who check units for harassment and issue loans, all
              have a role to play in this complex network and are responsible for
              causing anguish to innocent victims. Police will spare no effort in
              bringing such syndicates and those involved to task."
              <br> <br>First-time offenders found guilty of operating a business as an
              unlicensed moneylender may be fined up to S$200,000 or jailed up to two
              years, or both. <br> <br> First-time offenders found guilty of loanshark harassment may be fined up to S$40,000 or jailed up to three years or both. 
              <br> <br> Offenders will be liable for caning where harm to persons or damage to
              property is caused during the course of committing the acts of
              harassment. </span></p>

              <p><strong>136 youths arrested for loanshark-related activities</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Minister for Education, Ng Eng Hen, said 136
              youths were arrested for loanshark-related harassment activities
              between October last year and September this year. Almost half were
              students. </span></p>
              <p><span> Dr Ng shared the statistic in a written reply to a parliamentary question from MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Lee Bee Wah. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said the reasons for school children being lured into working for such activities are complex. </span></p>
              <p><span> Dr Ng said parents, as primary caregivers, must take responsibility to
              monitor the after-school activities of their children and who they are
              interacting with so as to provide timely guidance. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said schools can play a complementary reinforcing role. For example,
              they can collaborate with relevant agencies or authorities to guide
              students back on the right track. </span></p>

              <p><strong>43-year-old man arrested for suspected loansharking activities</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Police have arrested a 43-year-old man for suspected involvement in loansharking activities.</span></p>
              <p><span>The suspect was caught during an anti-loansharking operation around Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 on Monday.
              <br> <br> Police had spotted the man loitering suspiciously along a common
              corridor. They approached him and found several ATM cards, ATM slips
              and mobile phones believed to contain debtors' addresses in his
              possession. <br> <br> Initial investigations revealed that the suspect was a
              debtor-turned-runner. He had assisted a loanshark by checking if the
              debtors were at home.
              <br> <br>The man will be charged in court on Wednesday with assisting in an
              unlicensed moneylender in his business, under the Moneylenders Act
              2008.
              <br> <br> If he is found to be a first-time offender, he can be fined up to S$200,000 or jailed for up to two years, or both.

              <p><span>Police investigations revealed that the suspects had opened bank
