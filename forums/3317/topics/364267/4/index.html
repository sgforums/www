              other debtors to open bank accounts for loansharking activities. <br> <br> Since early November, several cases of loanshark harassment had been reported in the Bukit Merah View housing estate. <br> <br> One of the men will be charged in court on Thursday. <br> <br> The other is helping police in their investigations. <br> <br> First-time offenders found guilty of assisting in the business of an

              <p><strong>Teenager pleads guilty to loanshark harassment</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to eight charges
              of loanshark harassment. The court heard on Thursday that the boy
              committed the harassment acts between August 13 and 17 this year. </span></p>
              <p><span>His crime spree started at Block 853, Woodlands Street 83. He and
              an accomplice vandalised a wall at a staircase landing with black ink
              and splashed a unit with black paint.
              <br> <br>They repeated the act at four other flats that day in different
              parts of Singapore at places including Tampines and Commonwealth.
              <br> <br>On August 17, a resident who had entered a lift with them at Block
              16, Marsiling Lane, spotted the paint in the boy's unzipped bag. He
              asked the pair if they were loanshark harassers. <br> <br> They denied and tried to flee, but the resident managed to detain and hand them over to the police.
              <br> <br> Police officers found six bags of paint, two markers and a street
              directory on the pair. They also admitted that they were working for an
              unlicensed moneylender known as "Sunny", claiming that they were given
              S$40 for every unit harassed.
              <br> <br>The 17-year-old also pleaded guilty to being in an unlawful
              assembly with four others with the common intention to hurt a secondary
              school student.
              <br> <br>He and four others beat up the student at Block 840, Tampines
              Street 82, on May 4 this year. The victim suffered bruises on his face.
              <br> <br> The scuffle had broken out after one of the attackers accused the student of snatching away his girlfriend.
              <br> <br>The boy originally faced 16 different charges, but seven were taken
              into consideration. The other parties involved in these cases will be
              dealt with separately.
              <br> <br>This case will be mentioned again on December 10. For loanshark
              harassment, the boy could be jailed a maximum of three years and fined
              up to S$40,000 for each charge.
              <br> <br> For being in an unlawful assembly, he could be jailed up to two years and fined.

              <p>Police have arrested a 29-year old man in Redhill Close for alleged loan shark harassment activities. <br> Earlier this month, the authorities had received several reports of harassment cases in the area. <br> <br> That's because residents had found walls in the estate defaced with messages and splashed with paint. <br> <br> In a move to address the problem, officers from Clementi Police
              Division intensified their patrols and conducted numerous stake-outs in
              the vicinity. <br> <br> Their efforts paid off when they spotted the suspect behaving suspiciously outside a flat yesterday afternoon. <br> <br> But he fled when they wanted to conduct a check on him. <br> <br> The officers collared the suspect after a short chase and he was found
              with items including a can of paint as well as several marker pens in
              his possession. <br> <br> The suspect will be charged with loan shark harassment in court tomorrow. <br> <br> If convicted, first-time offenders may be jailed up to three years, fined a maximum of  $40,000  or both. <br> <br> They are also liable for caning if any damage was caused to property or harm caused to any person.<strong> </strong></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: 14 Singaporeans will face the court on Tuesday for
              helping in loansharking activities. The 11 men and three women are aged
              between 23 and 58. </span></p>
              <p><span>Police investigations revealed that some of them had opened bank

              cards and PIN (Personal Identification Number) numbers to loansharking
              syndicates.
              <br> <br>These accounts were then used by the syndicates for illegal
              money-lending activities. The rest of the subjects will be charged with

              business, the owner of the account and card is presumed to have

              money-lending acts may be fined up to S$200,000, or jailed a maximum of

              <br> <br> Repeat offenders face a fine of up to S$200,000 and a mandatory jail term of up to five years.

              <p>Three men and one woman have been arrested for loansharking activities. <br> <br> They are believed to be members of a syndicate operating locally and
              responsible for more than 200 cases of loanshark-related harassment
              island-wide. <br> <br> The suspects caught yesterday are between 24 and 34 years old. <br> <br> During the operation, the Police raided several locations and seized cash amounting to about $170,000 and other items. <br> <br> Initial investigations show that the syndicate would carry out transactions by electronic funds via ATM. <br> <br> Police say the syndicate would harass those who did not pay up, by splashing paint and scribbling repayment notes on the walls. <br> <br> First-time offenders found guilty of operating or assisting in an
              unlicensed moneylending business may be fined up to $200,000 and jailed
              up to 2 years, or both. <br> <br> Persons who cause damage to properties or harm to persons in the course
              of committing loanshark-related harassment are also liable for caning.</p>

              in loan shark harassment with the help of two vigilant members of the
              public. </span></p>
              <p><span>The 34-year-old was spotted by an alert resident living in Yishun at about 7.50pm on Monday.
              <br> <br> The resident had heard some noises outside his flat. Upon checking, he saw the suspect walking along the corridor.
              <br> <br> The resident also noticed that the door of one of his neighbours had been splashed with paint.
              <br> <br> He called out to the suspect who started running. He gave chase and
              managed to detain the suspect after a short scuffle with the help of
              another member of the public.
              <br> <br>The police seized a marker pen, some containers of paint, a
              notebook and a mobile phone containing addresses which are believed to
              belong to debtors, from the suspect.
              <br> <br> The man is believed to be involved in a series of loan shark harassment acts in the Ang Mo Kio and Yishun estates.    
              <br> <br> If convicted, he could be fined up to S$40,000, jailed up to three years and caned. </span></p>

              <p><strong> </strong>Three youths between the ages of 17 and 18 were arrested for 
              suspected loanshark harassment, following a tip-off from the public.</p>
              <p>This comes after several cases of loanshark harassment had been reported
               in the Canberra estate in Sembawang between March and April this year. <br> <br> Tactics employed include splashing of paint and scrawling of 
              loanshark-related graffiti on walls. <br> <br> This morning at about 1.45am, a resident in the area noticed a 
              suspicious character walking along the common corridor. <br> <br> When he opened his door to check, the resident saw another unfamiliar 
              character coming down the stairs. <br> <br> Upon seeing the resident, the subject turned away and walked towards the
               lift area. <br> <br> The resident then called the police, who found two sets of 
              loanshark-related graffiti written using blue markers. <br> <br> Police then patrolled the area, where they spotted three youths, two of 
              whom fitted the description provided by the resident. <br> <br> Several blue markers, cans of paint and handphones containing debtors' 
              records were found in their possession. <br> <br> All three suspects will be charged in court tomorrow (10 May) for 
              loanshark harassment. <br> <br> If found guilty, first time offenders may be jailed up to five years, 
              fined up to $50,000, and be liable for six strokes of the cane.</p>
