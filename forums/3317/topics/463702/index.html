              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A slew of new measures kick in on Tuesday. Among them
               - parents getting better support in raising a child, and employers 
              abiding by a weekly day-off policy for foreign maids. Car buyers and 
              taxi users too will benefit from new regulations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>With the new year, comes new policies.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>One of the new 
              policies is the Child Development Account (CDA) under the Baby Bonus 
              scheme, which is aimed at helping families with the costs of raising 
              children.<br><br>It is a savings account where parents' deposits are 
              matched dollar-for-dollar by the government, up to a cap ranging from 
              S$6,000 to S$18,000, depending on the birth order of the child.<br><br>From
               January, parents can continue to dip into the savings account until 
              their children are 12 years old, instead of six. This includes paying 
              for healthcare and childcare fees.<br><br>Associate Professor Paulin 
              Straughan, a sociologist with the National university of Singapore 
              (NUS), said the move is pertinent, given the demands of raising a child.<br><br>She
               added: "A big concern for parents now is childcare. And childcare for 
              school-going primary kids, primary school kids are not cheap. For 
              example, after school care. So if they are allowed to dip into the CDA 
              for this, it will certainly help working dual-income families 
              significantly."<br><br>The new year also marks the start of mandatory 
              weekly rest-days for foreign domestic workers. This will apply to those 
              whose work permits are issued or renewed from January 1, 2013. All maids
               will be covered by the new legislation by 2015.<br><br>Employers and 
              workers should agree on which day of the week the rest day falls, and if
               there's no day-off, employers must give monetary compensation.<br><br>Employment agencies are also expected to play a larger role.<br><br>President
               of the Association of Employment Agencies, K Jayaprema, said: "The 
              employers are going to need the employment agencies to be part of this, 
              because we are supposed to negotiate the off-days, we are supposed to 
              witness the paperwork, when the domestic worker actually agrees not to 
              take her day off and to be compensated.<br><br>"So I will strongly 
              encourage employers to ensure that when they are going through this 
              process of off-days with the employees, they should work with the 
              employment agencies involved."<br><br>Separately, those eyeing a new car
               can stand to benefit from the new Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle 
              Scheme. Owners of cars which are more fuel-efficient and emit less 
              carbon will enjoy rebates of up to S$20,000. This will be given as an 
              offset against the vehicle's Additional Registration Fee.<br><br>To make an informed choice, buyers are advised to look out for the mandatory Fuel Economy Labelling Scheme (FELS) at showrooms.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority said only cars that are approved by LTA under FELS can be registered for use from January 1.<br><br>Those
               who do not own a car may also now find it easier to get a cab. That is 
              because operators must ensure that 70 per cent of their fleet are on the
               road during peak hours and clock an average daily mileage of 250 
              kilometres. This translates to around eight to nine hours on the road 
              per day, five days a week.<br><br>Observers believe the move may burden smaller operators and cause them to merge, in order to meet the standards.<br><br>Associate
               Professor Lee Der-Horng of the Department of Civil Engineering at NUS 
              said: "With this quality of service measurement, this may become a 
              burden to the smaller operators. Because given their size and given 
              their corporate resources, it may be even more difficult for them to 
              satisfy (the requirements).<br><br>"Perhaps we may see a merger between 
              the smaller operators but from the passengers side, this may be good 
              news as well. After the merger, they may better cooperate resources and 
              they may be able to provide better service to passengers."<br><br>Taxis 
              will be also allowed to pick up and drop off passengers along roads 
              within the Central Business District, except for roads with bus lanes 
              during the operating hours of the lanes.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
