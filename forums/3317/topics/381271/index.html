              <p><strong>More turn to sub-letting HDB flats</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>SINGAPORE: Some were in financial
              hardship, and an increasing number were Singaporeans working overseas
              or who simply saw their flats as investments.</p>
              <p>They made up the
              growing number of households that are sub—letting their entire flats —
              a figure that jumped 21 per cent in the course of the last financial
              year.</p>
              <p>Between April last year and March this year, the Housing
              and Development Board (HDB) approved 22,754 such applications, or 4,019
              units more than in the previous year.</p>
              <p>Despite the recent
              recession, this trend is not necessarily due to flat—owners having
              problems meeting their mortgage repayments, said property analysts.</p>
              <p>"The
              downturn happened in the middle of HDB’s financial year, toward the end
              of last year. And while some households may have been affected, it’s
              not enough to say they contributed to the increase — it’s a variety of
              factors," said Ngee Ann Polytechnic real estate lecturer Nicholas Mak.</p>
              <p>One
              of which is more Singaporeans heading overseas for work. Property agent
              Liz Choo told MediaCorp that the number of such flat—owners approaching
              her to sub—let their flats has gone up by as much as 20 per cent from
              six years ago.</p>
              <p>They are mostly headed to China and Vietnam, "followed by Australia and the United Kingdom", she added.</p>
              <p>Depending
              on the location, rents for a three—room flat range from $1,500 to
              $1,800, while four—room, five—room and executive maisonettes can
              command $1,800 to $2,500 a month. A five—room flat in the central area
              could fetch $3,000, said property agents.</p>
              <p>The relaxation of
              public housing policy in March 2007 sparked the first increase in the
              number of Singaporeans sub—letting their housing board flats.</p>
              <p>Home
              owners can now rent out their entire flats after living in it for three
              years, if the flat was bought without a housing grant from the resale
              market; or five years if the flat was bought from the HDB or the open
              market with a CPF Housing Grant.</p>
              <p>Previously, they had to wait 10 years if they had an outstanding HDB loan or five years if they did not.</p>
              <p>"It
              used to be a lot tougher in the past, you could only let out your flat
              if you were studying or working overseas and you must have documentary
              proof, or if you’re very sick and need to live with your relative —
              there were so many conditions attached," said property agent of 15
              years, Mr G Rajan.</p>
              <p>HDB relaxed its policy to allow flat owners
              greater flexibility to monetise their flats during retirement or times
              of financial difficulty, and also to enlarge the rental market for HDB
              flats.</p>
              <p>And some, it seems, have taken advantage of the
              situation. "I’ve a client who, after living in his flat for seven
              years, moved into his newly completed condo and is now renting out his
              flat," said Mr Daniel Lim, a property agent. Other agents also told
              MediaCorp the HDB flat is increasingly seen as an investment.</p>
              <p>Still, there are some who sub—let because they cannot afford the repayments.</p>
              <p>Finance
              graduate Ms Sumathi (not her real name) told MediaCorp she has been
              unemployed for three years since returning from her studies in
              Australia. Her three—room flat in Serangoon, which she bought with her
              father, is being rented out for $1,500.</p>
              <p>"Though we took an HDB
              loan, I couldn’t afford to pay $404 monthly," she said. The 35—year—old
              is staying with a friend. Her father, who works overseas, does not earn
              enough to pay the mortgage. "The income from the rental helps, but I
              have to pay property tax and conservancy charges, too," she added.</p>
