              <p>Good character and strong leadership abilities are essential for a
              person's future and nation's success, says Senior Minister Goh Chok
              Tong. <br> <br> Speaking at an Edusave Awards ceremony today (eds : 09/01), Mr Goh
              urged students to also do well in their Co-curricular Activities. <br> <br> He said this is because good academic results alone are not enough to excel in life. <br> <br> <em>Saifulbahri Ismail</em> with more :<strong> <br> </strong><br> Trustworthiness, reliability, integrity, compassion, courage and loyalty. <br> <br> According to Senior Minister Goh, these are the qualities which should be developed in a person. <br> <br> Mr Goh also said that a strong leader will have the courage to act
              according to one's conviction and principles in the interest of the
              people, society and country. <br> <br> He added a good leader will have the ability to rally others to follow :<strong> <br> <br> "Leaders are not those who observe and exploit popular sentiment by
              offering popular but short-sighted and flawed solutions in order to be
              elected."</strong> <br> <br> In addition, Mr Goh stressed the importance of character building at home and in school. <br> <br> For example, he says, when a student participates in team sports, he's
              not just learning about winning and losing, but about playing fair and
              doing so as a member of a team. <br> <br> At home, parents should also pay attention to their children's character development :<strong> <br> <br> "They should spend time talking and listening to them, understanding
              the problems they face, showing by example what are the right values,
              and providing a moral compass to navigate through life."</strong> <br> <br> To help students develop good character and strong leadership
              abilities, Mr Goh encouraged students to win the Edusave Awards for
              Achievements, Good Leadership and Service or EAGLES. <br> <br> This award recognises those who have done well in their Co-curricular Activities. <br> <br> At the Edusave Awards ceremony, Mr Goh presented scholarships and bursaries to 153 students at the Marine Parade area. <br> <br> 17-year old Clara Lee from CHIJ Katong Convent is a recipient of the Edusave Merit Bursary award :<strong> <br> <br> "I'm still very happy even though I've got it for many years. This is
              definitely a motivation for me to excel better and I hope I can get
              more of such awards even when I've graduated. <br> </strong><br> A total of 57 students received the Merit Bursary award valued between 150 and 300 dollars. <br> <br> While another 96 received the Scholarship Award valued between 250 and 500 dollars.</p>
