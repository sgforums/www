              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-5091" class="versenum"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">4</span></strong></sup>Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-5092" class="versenum"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">5</span></strong></sup>And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</p>
              <p title="Subsection title"><strong><sup><span style="font-size: xx-small;">18</span></sup></strong>Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.</p>

              <p title="Subsection title"><strong><sup><span style="font-size: xx-small;">1</span></sup></strong>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-3284" class="versenum"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">2</span></strong></sup>Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.</p>

              <p title="Subsection title"> </p>
              <p>And the reason I made such unexamined assumptions was because I recognised Jesus's life described in the Gospels. I even felt immediately comfortable with the oh-so-Jewish, unselfconscious telling of the same story in four different gospels, from four different contradictory angles - as a tiny fraction, a glimpse into the world of the Talmud, snatched out and wondered over, a brief second in the span of time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I easily recognised the Last Supper as most probably a Passover Seder (especially since Easter coincides with Pesakh), but had to wonder how come Jesus was welcomed into Jerusalem, according to the Gospels, about six days earlier, but with all the crowd behaviour of six months earlier, the festival of Sukkot - Tabernacles - when we wave palm branches and sing <em>Hoshana</em> - Save us?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was even more puzzled by why everyone seemed to get so heated about whether or not Jesus thought he was the Son of God - aren't we all? - or even the Messiah - might not anyone be? And each gospel had its own angle, its own story. I could see, even at 17, what Matthew was doing. He was proving that all the prophecies relating to the Messiah were manifest in Jesus. Virgin birth? Tick. White donkey? Tick. Hanged on a tree? Tick. But I'd never been taught as a Jew to pay much attention to these details of messianic credential. How will we know the Messiah? Easy. The world will be at peace. Cross.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I could see Luke floundering in Jewish preoccupations he couldn't fathom. What were they all squabbling about? But with Mark and John, I felt more at home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I can't see Jesus as the Messiah we Jews are waiting for. And nor, as the Gospel accounts themselves make clear, could the disciples who knew him once he was executed. After the crucifixion, the disciples did not sit around calmly and reassure each other that all was going according to plan. They were instead understandably devastated. This was not the messianic plan. Nothing in Jewish teaching had suggested the execution of the Messiah. Not one of them was able to come up with the idea that this was all as it should be. It wasn't. They had invested their faith in this man and he was now dead.</p>

              <p>Sikhs don't think it pleases God if people pay no attention to others and simply devote themselves slavishly to religion.</p>
              <p>Sikhism doesn’t ask people to turn away from ordinary life to get closer to God. In fact it demands that they use ordinary life as a way to get closer to God.</p>
              <p>A Sikh serves God by serving (<em>seva</em>) other people every day. By devoting their lives to service they get rid of their own ego and pride.</p>
              <p>Many Sikhs carry out chores in the Gurdwara as their service to the community. These range from working in the kitchen to cleaning the floor. The Langar, or free food kitchen, is a community act of service.</p>
              <p>Sikhs also regard caring for the poor or sick as an important duty of service</p>
              
              <h2 title="Subsection title">The three duties</h2>
              <p title="Subsection title"> </p>
              <p>The three duties that a Sikh must carry out can be summed up in three words; Pray, Work, Give.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Nam japna: 
              <ul>
              <li>Keeping God in mind at all times.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Kirt Karna: 
              <ul>
              <li>Earning an honest living. Since God is truth, a Sikh seeks to live honestly. This doesn't just mean avoiding crime; Sikhs avoid gambling, begging, or working in the alcohol or tobacco industries.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Vand Chhakna: 
              <ul>
              <li>(Literally, sharing one's earnings with others) Giving to charity and caring for others.</li>

              <p>, called Ahura Mazda (meaning 'Wise Lord'). He is compassionate, just, and is the creator of the universe.</p>
              <p>Ahura Mazda is:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Omniscient (knows everything) </li>

              <p>Zoroastrians believe that everything he created is pure and should be treated with love and respect. This includes the natural environment, so Zoroastrians traditionally do not pollute the rivers, land or atmosphere. This has caused some to call Zoroastrianism 'the first ecological religion'.Zoroaster and God</p>
              <p>Zoroastrians believe that Zoroaster is the prophet of God.</p>

              <p title="Subsection title"> </p>
              <p><em>Amesha Spentas</em> translates as 'Holy Immortals'. Just as light rays are emanated from the sun but are not the sun, so the Amesha Spentas are emanated by God but are not God. These emanations are seen as the divine attributes of God. They helped God fashion the world and each is associated with a particular aspect of creation.</p>
              <p>Western scholars have likened the Amesha Spentas to the Archangels in Christianity</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is not strictly correct as they also represent spiritual attainments. Zoroastrians believe that man can know God through his Divine Attributes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The six Amesha Spentas are:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Vohu Manah - Good mind and good purpose. </li>
