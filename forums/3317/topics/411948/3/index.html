              <p><strong>45 new charges for ex-SLA duo</strong></p>
              <p>THE pair of former Singapore Land Authority (SLA) officials accused 
              of defrauding the Government of $11.8 million each had 45 fresh cheating
               charges heaped on them on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>With these latest charges, former deputy director Koh Seah Wee and 
              manager Lim Chai Meng now face 294 and 305 charges respectively, edging 
              the alleged fraud amount up to $12.1 million.</p>
              <p>The 45 new charges each faces are tied to their alleged dealings with
               Ribbons and Rolls Marketing Services (R&amp;R), which provides 
              information technology supplies and networking solutions for corporate 
              clients.</p>
              <p>The pair are said to have deceived the SLA into believing 
              that their department - the technology and infrastructure department - 
              required products and services from R&amp;R, when they knew the 
              transactions were never intended to result in work being done, or 
              products being delivered. Altogether, the SLA is said to have paid about
               $297,000 to R&amp;R, in sums ranging from $790 to $63,850, between 
              November 2007 and September last year.</p>
              <p>Koh, 40, and Lim, 37, are accused of conspiring with R&amp;R
               director Anthony Xavier Foo Doon Tong, 42, to cheat the SLA. Mr Foo has
               not been charged.</p>
              <p>No fresh charges were filed against co-accused Ho Yen Teck, 
              31, a former swimming instructor whose 195 charges involve $9.8 million.</p>

              <p><strong>SLA fraud 'human failure'</strong></p>
              <p>THE alleged fraud case at the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) was not 
              the result of lax public sector financial rules but human failure, two 
              ministers said on Monday.</p>
              <p>Investigations have revealed that the root cause was a lack of 
              vigilant supervision over the two former SLA executives charged with 
              cheating the statutory board of $12.18 million.</p>
              <p>Authorities have since recovered $10 million in cash and assets.</p>
              <p>Koh Seah Wee, 40, and Christopher Lim Chai Meng, 37, are 
              said to have conspired with several businesses to win IT contracts from 
              SLA, and then submitted false invoices for goods and services that were 
              not delivered.</p>
              <p>Koh may also have cheated the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (Ipos) of $286,000, using similar methods.</p>
              <p>'Certain officers at SLA and Ipos did not exercise 
              sufficient supervision over Koh and Lim and had not carried out their 
              audit responsibilities thoroughly,' said Law and Home Affairs Minister 
              K. Shanmugam in Parliament on Monday.</p>

              <p><strong>Ho was a "puppet" in SLA fraud case</strong></p>
              <p>Ho Yen Teck, the former swimming instructor who has pleaded guilty to 
              his role in the Singapore Land Authority cheating case, was just a 
              puppet</p>
              <p>That's what his lawyer, Jackson Eng, told the court in his mitigation plea today</p>
              <p>Mr Eng added that his 31-year-old client did not make a substantial gain in the scam that involved more than $12 million.<br> <br> The lawyer stressed that Ho only received some $200,000 in the 
              conspiracy, which Mr Eng said was masterminded by two of SLA's former 
              senior executives, Koh Seah Wee and Lim Chai Meng. <br> <br> Ho pleaded guilty to 21 charges on 15 December, last year. <br> <br> He originally faced 195 charges involving nearly $10 million but the remaining ones were taken into consideration. <br> <br> Ho had conspired with 40-year-old Koh and 37-year-old Lim to deceive the
               SLA into paying the monies to his seven sole proprietorships. <br> The slim and fair complexioned Ho did this by using fake invoices, without delivering any work to the agency. <br> <br> The court heard that the SLA disbursed the payments between January 2008 and March, last year. <br> <br> In his mitigation, Mr Eng told District Judge Jasbendar Kaur that Ho played a minor role in the conspiracy. <br> <br> The lawyer pleaded for leniency saying that the ruse was only able to 
              succeed as Koh and Lim had abused their positions within the SLA. <br> <br> However, Deputy Public Prosecutor, Jean Chan, pressed for a deterrent 
              sentence to "quell the public disquiet and unease that has been 
              generated". <br> <br> She told the court the offences were committed against a public institution over a substantial period of time. <br> <br> This resulted in a loss of what Ms Chan referred to as an "astronomically large sum of public funds". <br> <br> She also highlighted that most of the agency's losses - some 80 per cent - were attributed to Ho's companies. <br> <br> The greater the quantum of loss caused, the greater the sentence should be, said Ms Chan. <br> <br> Ho, who is the first of 8 men to admit that he was part of the scam, will be sentenced next Friday. <br> <br> He can be jailed up to 10 years for each charge.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">SLA $12m scam: 10 years' jail for ex-swim coach</h1>
              <p>THE first man to plead guilty in the Singapore Land Authority $12 
              million scam was given 10 years' jail by a district court on Friday.</p>
              <p>Ho Yen Teck, 31, a former swimming instructor, had set up seven sole 
              proprietorships in a conspiracy with two others to deceive the statutory
               board into paying for fictitious IT maintenance services and goods 
              which were not delivered.</p>
              <p>The transactions took place between January 2008 and March 2010. His 
              share in the conspiracy was about $200,000. The court was told that 
              almost 80 per cent of the total payments by SLA for the fake 
              transactions was made to Ho's seven companies totalling $9.8 million.</p>
              <p>Ho's alleged accomplices, former SLA deputy director Koh 
              Seah Wee, 40, and ex-manager Lim Chai Meng, 37, have since been charged 
              and their cases are at the pre-trial stages. Five others have also been 
              hauled to court. Their cases are also pending. The prosecution had urged
               the court to impose a deterrent sentence, citing several aggravating 
              factors.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Jean Chan had said that the 
              offences were committed against a public institution over a substantial 
              period of time, resulting in the loss of an astronomical sum of public 
              funds. Ho's role, she added, was pivotal. The offences undermined the 
              integrity of the public procurement process, she said. Neither did Ho 
              make full restitution.</p>
              <p>District Judge Jasbendar Kaur agreed with the prosecution 
              that a stiff sentence was clearly warranted. She felt that Ho's role was
               significant and without his participation and active facilitation, the 
              elaborate and well-planned fraud would not have been successful. Ho, who
               had pleaded guilty to 21 of 195 counts, could have been jailed for up 
              to 10 years and fined on each charge. His sentence was backdated to his 
              remand on Oct 6 last year.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Second man in SLA scam jailed three years</h1>
              <p>A MAN who conspired with two employees of Singapore Land Authority 
              (SLA) to cheat the statutory board of about $297,000 was jailed for 
              three years on Monday.</p>
              <p>Anthony Xavier Foo Doon Tong, 43, then a partner of Ribbons and Rolls
               Marketing Services (R&amp;R), is the second person to be convicted and 
              sentenced.</p>
              <p>In January this year, former swim coach Ho Yen Teck, 31, who 
              benefited about $200,000 for his role in the conspiracy, was jailed for 
              10 years. He had admitted to 21 of 195 charges.</p>
              <p>Foo pleaded guilty to 10 of 45 charges of abetting with SLA 
              deputy director of technology and infrastructure department Koh Seah 
              Wee, 40, and SLA manager Lim Chai Meng, 37, to deceive SLA into paying 
              between $2,032 and $63,847 under contracts for which work was not done 
              in 2007 and 2009.</p>
              <p>Of the $297,000 involved, his share was about $94,500.</p>
              <p>The cases against Koh and Lim have been moved to the High 
              Court while the cases of six other contractors are still in pre-trial 
              stages in the lower court.</p>

              <p><strong>CASE BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
              <p>The court heard that Foo was roped in in October 2007 by Lim into the
               conspiracy as a 'vendor''. Once transactions were awarded and paid to 
              R&amp;R, Foo would be given a cut of the payment made by the SLA.</p>
              <p>Other than preparing invoices according to Lim's instructions, Foo 
              knew that the firm would not need to do any work for the SLA to get 
              payment.</p>
              <p>Foo agreed to the arrangement and concurrently entered into both 
              legitimate and fictitious small value purchase transactions with the 
              SLA.</p>
              <p>He could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined 
              for each offence committed before February 2008, and up to 10 years and 
              fined on each of two other charges after 2008.</p>
