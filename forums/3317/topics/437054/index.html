              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A 38-year old manager, Jerome Ow Siew Nam, was 
              sentenced to jail and a fine on Monday for making a fake marriage 
              certificate. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ow was separated but not divorced from his Thai wife Usa Naree when he started seeing another woman in 2006.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>His girlfriend, who 
              was unaware of his marital status, became pregnant with his child and 
              wanted him to marry her. To appease her, Ow scanned his original 
              marriage certificate and made a copy, replacing his wife's name with 
              that of his 28-year-old girlfriend's.<br><br>He made the false document sometime between October 2006 and February 2007. <br><br>Ow was sentenced on Monday to two weeks' jail for this offence and was also fined S$5,000.<br><br>Ow
               tied the knot with Ms Usa, a social escort, in 2004 but their marriage 
              was an unhappy one. She went back to Thailand about two years later and 
              took their young son with her.<br><br>During this separation, Ow started
               seeing his new girlfriend and gave her the false marriage certificate 
              after she pestered him to marry her. He lied to her, claiming that his 
              grandmother's lawyer had settled their paperwork and they need not go 
              down to the Registry of Marriages.<br><br>Deputy Public Prosecutor 
              Amardeep Singh said the girlfriend believed Ow and the couple even had a
               marriage ceremony on February 14, 2007.<br><br>DPP Singh said the pair 
              then lived together as so-called man and wife with the girlfriend's 
              parents. But she became suspicious two days after the ceremony and 
              decided to check with the ROM about their marriage. Only then did the 
              girlfriend find out that Ow had deceived her and she informed the 
              police.<br><br>The court heard that Ow's marriage with Ms Usa only dissolved in 2009.<br><br>Defence
               Counsel, Montague Choy had said in his mitigation plea that his 
              client's offence was "merely technical" and "not serious".<br><br>However,
               District Judge Francis Remedios disagreed with this and stressed that 
              third parties as well as public bodies could be affected by the offence.
               Citing an example, the judge said that the girlfriend had to produce a 
              marriage certificate to register her child in school.<br><br>Ow's jail 
              term will begin on September 12 as he has to settle some personal 
              matters first. He has to surrender to the authorities by noon that day 
              and is now out on a bail of S$6,000.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
