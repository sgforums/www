              <p>The Straits Times; Published on Aug 24, 2011<br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/PrimeNews/Story/STIStory_705424.html">Curbs lifted on events at PA sitesÂ </a><br> Li Xueying; Teo Wan Gek<br> IN AN apparent softening of stance by the Government, residents can now 
              invite whoever they wish to events held on public sites leased by the 
              People's Association (PA).<br> This means that MPs from the opposition parties can now be invited to these activities in their personal capacity.<br> There are two caveats though.<br> <a name="more"></a>One, the events must be of a 'non-political nature'. This means that they cannot be, say, political rallies.<br> Two, the lifting of the restriction applies only to events organised by non-grassroots organisations.<br> Government grassroots organisations - such as residents' committees 
              (RCs) and Citizens Consultative Committees (CCCs) - continue to reserve 
              the right to invite only their grassroots advisers, usually the ruling 
              People's Action Party (PAP) candidates in the constituency.<br> <br> The liberalising of the rules was announced last night by the PA - the 
              apex body of government grassroots organisations, in a joint statement 
              with the Ministry of National Development (MND) under whose remit the 
              Housing Board (HDB) falls.<br> <br> It is the latest twist in a furore over the use of public spaces in 
              Aljunied GRC that had even the four presidential candidates - locked in 
              the heat of a campaign edging towards the finishing line - weighing in 
              yesterday.<br> <br> All four called for 'fairness' in the matter, with former deputy prime 
              minister Tony Tan saying: 'It is important that justice and fairness 
              should be done, and not only that, but the public should see that 
              justice and fairness have been done.'<br> <br> On Monday, the Workers' Party (WP) said that residents had told them 
              they were not allowed to invite WP MPs for Seventh Month festivities, 
              held on PA-leased land in Aljunied GRC.<br> <br> In the statement last night, MND and PA gave their side to the dispute.<br> They said there had been occasions when organisers of grassroots and 
              community events applied to use sites managed by the Aljunied-Hougang 
              town council - run by the WP - and were told that they were expected to 
              invite the WP MP.<br> 'It was only on Aug 19 that the chairman of Aljunied-Hougang Town 
              Council (AHTC) stated publicly that the town council would not impose 
              any condition on whom the organisers could invite, when using sites 
              managed by AHTC,' they wrote.<br> <br> The town council chairman is Ms Sylvia Lim, who made the statement in an interview published in The Straits Times that day.<br> 'PA welcomes this new position of AHTC, and is likewise lifting its 
              current restriction on invitees for events organised by non-GROs on 
              sites leased by PA from HDB, as long as they are of a non-political 
              nature.'<br> <br> The PA statement also sought to explain why 26 public spaces - mainly 
              open fields and hard courts - within Aljunied GRC were transferred to 
              the PA shortly after the May 7 General Election when the PAP lost in the
               constituency. The sites were previously under the management of the 
              town council.<br> This transfer, Ms Lim had charged, was 'politically motivated and an abuse of power' on the part of HDB.<br> <br> Yesterday, MND and PA described the transfer as a pre-emptive move in 
              anticipation of potential obstacles placed in the PA's way by the new WP
               town council.<br> PA, they said, had been using such sites frequently to conduct community
               activities - and intends to continue doing so 'to carry out their 
              mission of promoting bonding among the residents'.<br> But while the PA has had no difficulty gaining access to sites managed 
              by town councils run by the PAP, it has met with 'many difficulties' in 
              Hougang, a single-seat ward under the WP since 1991.<br> 'PA was concerned that they might encounter similar difficulties in 
              Aljunied,' they said. 'To avoid unproductive wrangling, PA decided that 
              it would be best if they could lease their own sites.'<br> In approving the request from PA, HDB has 'ensured that there will be 
              sufficient open areas to meet the demand from other users'. MND and PA 
              also released examples of how the grassroots organisations in Hougang 
              have been stymied in various attempts to reach out to the residents. 
              (See sidebar)<br> <br> Mr Poon Mun Wai, secretary of one of the five CCCs in Aljunied GRC, told
               The Straits Times that the grassroots leaders had decided to apply to 
              the PA for the transfer 'after feedback' from their Hougang 
              counterparts.<br> 'We want to have more room to organise activities without being held by a
               condition by the town council to invite the opposition MPs. It should 
              not be a condition, it should be up to the organisers.<br> 'We are just trying to make room for ourselves.'<br> <br> Yesterday, Mr Ong Ye Kung, one of the PAP candidates in Aljunied GRC in 
              the May polls, said: 'I am glad to learn about the new positions of AHTC
               and PA.<br> 'This makes a lot more sense to facilitate grassroots organisations in promoting social bonding and cohesion.'<br> Ms Lim did not respond by press time.<br> xueying@sph.com.sg<br> wangekt@sph.com.sg<br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/PrimeNews/Story/STIStory_705424.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/PrimeNews/Story/STIStory_705424.html</a></p>

              <p>The logic I understand is that the PA's task is to diseminate government propaganda, like social harmony, health, security, etc, to the people. So only the government's ministers can be grassroot advisers or ruling party members to be grassroot advisers. Fair enough.</p>
