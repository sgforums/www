              <p>Hallucinations tormented the mind of a 58-year-old woman, keeping her 
              from leaving her bathroom in her flat in Jurong West for two and a half 
              years, reported <em>The New Paper (TNP)</em>.</p>
              <p>From 25 March in 2009, 58-year-old Leong Mee Yan mainly sat naked on the toilet bowl, and slept and ate there, the paper said.</p>
              <p>It was only on 13 September last year that her husband Ong Kian Ann, who
               is unemployed, decided to call the police and ambulance, it reported.<br><br>Leong was later admitted into the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) where she stayed for 18 days. <br><br>When asked why it took a while for Ong to seek assistance, he told <em>TNP </em>that whenever he tried to get his wife to leave the bathroom, she would refuse because a “force” was holding her down.<br><br>Ong
               was also reported by the paper as saying that the hallucinations began 
              affecting his wife in 1991, after one of her sisters demanded for more 
              money. It was not reported further what the issue was about.<br><br>Since treatment at IMH, her condition has improved and bathroom visit now last around one or two hours, he told the same paper.<br><br>Psychologist Daniel Koh of Insights Mind Centre told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that a person suffering from mental disorders such as schizophrenia or 
              psychosis may experience hallucinations or delusions, especially when 
              the illness is not treated in its early stages. <br><br>He highlighted 
              that a person under extreme stress or pressure can also experience 
              hallucinations, which can be categorised as auditory, visual and 
              tactile. <br><br>Under auditory hallucination, one can hear voices 
              telling one to act or do certain things, including inflicting harm to 
              one’s self. In visual hallucination, the person tends to see things 
              being thrown at or a person harassing him or her. For tactile 
              hallucination, the person can smell or feel certain things, for example,
               insects crawling on them, even though none are.<br><br>Koh said that 
              family members can also keep a lookout for signs of hallucinations, 
              which is apparent when the person’s behaviour starts to change from its 
              usual self, like when they become easily frightened, tend to panic or 
              show  great distress.<br><br>On the other hand, they can also turn passive or quiet, which also indicates that their mental condition might not be stable. <br><br>As
               such, undergoing treatment earlier is the best option as the chances of
               recovery are higher, but a delayed treatment, warned Koh, might result 
              the condition to worsen or become more concrete.</p>
