              <p>JOHOR BARU - SAND worth millions of ringgit is being illegally 
                  'floated' out of the country daily via Sungai Johor here, The Star 
                  reported on Thursday, saying this has been going on for the past three 
                  years.</p>
              <p>A Star team investigating the lucrative trade found that the sand 
                  ends up in Singapore, despite a ban on sand export imposed by the 
                  Malaysian Government.</p>
              <p>Sand extraction is a common sight along the river as mining 
                  syndicates illegally transport millions of tonnes of sand, even on 
                  weekends and public holidays, via Danga Bay and Port of Tanjung Pelepas.
                   The culprits use barges to pass through the international waters from 
                  Kota Tinggi and Ulu Tiram before arriving at local ports for shipment to
                   Singapore.</p>
              <p>The probe revealed that the barges are directed towards a 
                  private jetty or landing point at Pulau Punggol Timur in Singapore where
                   the sand is unloaded.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean company, which obtains the sand from a 
                  Malaysian partner, supplies it to the Housing Board of Singapore for its
                   construction projects.</p>
              <p>The Star team's visit to the landing point revealed that the
                   sand from the barges was loaded onto trucks before being taken to the 
                  Pulau Punggol Timur jetty for storage. To circumvent the Malaysian ban 
                  on sand export, the syndicates are believed to be exporting this highly 
                  sought-after material as processed or 'packed' silica sand, an item that
                   can be exported.</p>
              <p>By obtaining sand from its Malaysian partner, the 
                  Singaporean company is making huge profits as it only pays S$30 per 
                  cubic metre compared with S$40 for the same amount of sand from 
                  Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. It is estimated that since August 2007, 
                  more than three million cubic metres of sand has been smuggled out 
                  through Sungai Johor.</p>
              <p>Starprobe's findings also revealed that more than 90 per 
                  cent of the sand was extracted from Sungai Johor while the rest was from
                   sand mines from the Kota Tinggi and Johor Baru districts.</p>

              <p><strong>No evidence HDB sand is illegal</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE - Singapore says there is no evidence that sand received
               by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) has been smuggled out of 
              Malaysia as alleged by The Star newspaper. </span></p>
              <p><span>In response to media queries, a spokesperson for the Ministry of 
              National Development (MND) said that HDB engages sand suppliers on a 
              commercial basis to supply sand for its development works. 
              <br> <br> As part of the procurement process, HDB requires its tenderers to 
              produce quality certificates and export permits to confirm that their 
              supply is from approved concessions in the source countries. 
              <br> <br> In addition, the spokesperson said Singapore Customs has in place 
              procedures to check and investigate the import of goods at the 
              checkpoints.
              <br> <br> Sand suppliers must have the necessary import permits to come through 
              the Pulau Punggol Timor Aggregate Terminal, which is managed by the 
              Building and Construction Authority (BCA) on the government's behalf.
              <br> <br> In a report on Wednesday, The Star newspaper alleged that sand worth 
              millions of ringgit is being illegally "floated" out of Malaysia through
               Sungai Johor - and that this has been going on for the past three 
              years. 
              <br> <br> The newspaper said its investigating team found that the sand ends up in
               Singapore, despite an export ban by the Malaysian government.
              <br> <br> The paper reported that mining syndicates used barges to illegally 
              transport the sand, via Danga Bay and Tanjung Pelepas port to Singapore.
              <br> <br> It said a Singapore company obtains the sand from a Malaysian partner 
              and supplies it to HDB for construction projects. 
              <br> <br> To circumvent the ban on sand export, the syndicates are believed to 
              have masked the sand as processed or "packed" silica sand, which can be 
              exported.
              <br> <br> The Star said further investigations revealed that the illegal business 
              started after a contract worth RM62.4 million (S$26.7 million) was 
              awarded by the Malaysian government to a private company to carry out 
              redesign and rectification works at Sungai Johor.
              <br> <br> Checks revealed that since the project started in August 2007, a total 
              of 3 million cubic metres of sand had been smuggled out.
              <br> <br> The paper estimated that at S$30 per cubic metre, the syndicates could 
              have raked in RM207 million over the two-year period of the project.
              <br> <br> After the project's completion, the syndicates continued to "export" 
              sand to Singapore.

              <p><strong>Panel to curb sand smuggling</strong></p>
              <p>PETALING JAYA - MALAYSIA has set up a high-level integrity committee 
              to check sand smuggling activity.</p>
              <p>Home Ministry director-general Mahmood Adam said the committee was 
              set up based on a proposal submitted by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
              Commission (MACC). 'We are taking an integrated approach to resolve this
               issue,'' he said, responding to reports in The Star which has 
              highlighted massive sand smuggling activities that had caused Malaysia 
              to lose sand believed to be worth hundreds of millions of ringgit over 
              the years.</p>
              <p>The committee, formed after the National Security Council raised 
              security threat alert over rampant sand smuggling, is expected to look 
              into regulatory aspects as part of the preventive measure to check 
              smuggling.</p>
              <p>Commenting on the issue, Senator Ezam Mohd Noor urged the MACC to 
              take stern and immediate action against officers who had been abetting 
              smuggling syndicates.</p>
              <p>'Such massive movement of sand would not have occurred without 
              corruption,' he said. 'MACC must investigate and take action against all
               corrupt individuals even if it involved high ranking officers and 
              politicians.''</p>
              <p>Mr Ezam said it was impossible for law enforcement officers not to 
              see the movement of lorries and barges laden with sand.</p>
              <p>In Johor Baru, Mentri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman said sand mining
               activities could be traced with 24-hour surveillance but the state did 
              not have the manpower to cope, adding that it was difficult for the 
              state government to trace every exit point for illegal sand miners as 
              there were many possible routes.</p>
              <p>Abdul Ghani said the state was conducting stringent checks at the border
               to keep tabs on those who bring sand out but claim it was silica. 'Both
               silica and sand are very similar,' he said. Chemists were also sent 
              there to ascertain if the load was sand or silica, he added. -- THE STAR</p>
