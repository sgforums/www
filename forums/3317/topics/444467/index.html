              10-year-old relative over two years and left him permanently disfigured 
              have been sentenced to jail.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The case has been described by a District Court judge as "one of the worst cases of causing grievous hurt".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The accused cannot be named to protect the identity of the boy.<br><br>The
               court heard that the boy, who is not schooling, had been living with 
              the family in a rented unit in Ang Mo Kio since he was four years old 
              when his biological mother was serving jail term. <br><br>In 2010, his 
              grandaunt hit him on his mouth with a hammer, causing a tooth to fall 
              off and his mouth to bleed. This was after the grandaunt found out he 
              had finished some fried rice meant for the family.<br><br>A few months after the incident, the boy was again abused for stealing food and playing with the knobs of the gas stove.<br><br>His grandaunt asked her three daughters to restrain the boy while she splashed hot cooking oil on his face and body.<br> <br>She also cut his fingers with a pair of scissors, and pressed a hot iron and ladle on him.<br><br>She tied his hands and taped his mouth with a cable tie and scotch tape, after she caught him stealing food again.<br> <br>The boy now suffers from facial deformities, including a distorted lip margin and a flattened nasal bridge. <br> <br>For their crimes, the boy's 44-year-old grandaunt received a five-year jail term.<br><br>Her
               24-year-old daughter got 20 months' jail for abetment of voluntarily 
              causing hurt. She was given another two months' jail for four counts of 
              cheating her former employer, who runs a cleaning services company, of 
              more than S$2,200.<br><br>Another daughter, who is 20 years old, was also sentenced to 20 months in prison.<br><br>The youngest daughter, who is 14 years old, was sentenced earlier this year to probation.<br><br>The woman's ex-husband will be sentenced early next year.<br><br>The boy is said to have a habit of asking food every five minutes and helping himself to whatever food that was available. <br><br>Defence
               lawyer M S Rajendran said that this aggravated the family's financial 
              struggles as they had "very little to eat and spend".<br><br>He told the
               court that the grandaunt, who used to work as a cleaner, was "not a 
              heartless person" and "merely wanted to frighten" the boy.<br><br>The court heard that the woman and her daughters would comfort the boy and apply medication on his wounds after the punishment. <br> <br>The woman, who remained stoic while her charges were read out, later broke down when the court was hearing her mitigation plea.<br><br>She continued tearing when Assistant Public Prosecutor Ashraff Hassan read out the charges against her daughters.<br><br>Her 24-year-old daughter, who started a company with her fiancee last year, looked down while her sentence was read out.<br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>
