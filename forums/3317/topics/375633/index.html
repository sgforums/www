              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
              spoke at length on Tuesday evening, to some 1,500 students at the
              Nanyang Technological University on Singapore’s immigration policy and
              also gave the assurance that the interest of citizens will always come
              first.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td align="center"><br></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>

              Mr
              Lee explained that it was important for the issue to be discussed with
              the students because it concerned their future and eventually would be
              taken forward by their generation.</div>
              <p>He said that the country will
              make greater efforts at fostering integration of new arrivals and that
              the National Integration Council will announce its initiatives soon.</p>
              <p>"This
              is not a one problem you can solve one off, just answer an exam paper
              and settled. But it is a continuing issue with no final solution, where
              you have to manage it, decide, adjust your policy from time to time and
              as circumstances changed, adapt it in order to keep on going forward.
              And it’s a problem where what we do doesn’t just depend on the
              government or the government’s decisions but on how open our society is
              and how well Singaporeans adjust to and integrate new arrivals. And
              that depends on you, as your enter the workforce, work, settle your
              families and become the next generation of Singaporeans, what kind of
              Singapore you want," said Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>He
              said that while Singaporeans understand the need for immigrants and
              foreign workers, they still have some concerns given the large inflow
              in the last few years.</p>
              <p>When the Singapore economy was booming the
              country admitted many foreigners — more than 100,000 per year in recent
              years. Mr Lee, however, said the country will not continue to admit
              people at this pace as the nation cannot expect to continue booming as
              in the last few years.</p>
              <p>So over the long term while Singapore
              needs to continue bringing in immigrants, it will be mindful of how
              quickly its society can absorb and integrate new arrivals.</p>
              <p>"In
              the midst of all these discussions about Singaporeans and
              non—Singaporeans, I should emphasise one point— that in Singapore, the
              interests of citizens have to always come first. Not a short term
              interest but a long term interest. It is to safeguard the long term
              interest of Singaporeans, we must have a sustained, calibrated inflow
              of immigrants. We will make this differentiation sharper over time to
              reflect the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. But we
              cannot make it so onerous for PRs and non—residents that nobody wants
              to come," Mr Lee said.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, he mentioned that Singapore’s
              critical constraint isn’t with physical space but with its people —
              that with more good people, the country can generate new and creative
              ideas to expand the space and create more opportunities.</p>
              <p>At the start of his speech, Mr Lee also had a word on the Singapore economy for his audience.</p>
              <p>He said the third quarter economic forecast didn’t look bad.</p>
              <p>But he cautioned that the nation must be psychologically prepared for a slow pickup and even surprises like a W—shaped recovery.</p>

              <p><br>at the end of the day, singaporean are a pragmatic lot. they still need to put food on the table. becos the majority of the citizens are are still just making enuf to live, they will not rock the boat as much. typically, it is the exasperated bunch who will `take the risk'. however, the guys who just have enuf to go buy, with a little excess will not want to change the status quo since they have much to lose.</p>
              <p>the beauty of the pap governance system is that they put just enuf on the table for the people to live by, so these large band of these group of people are caught between a rock and a hard place. the fact that the govenment can pull the food mat off your table easily if they want to makes you think twice about voting against them. the guys that speaks up are those who have something to fall back on, or have nothing on their shirt so they couldn't care less. however, even for the former, the government has its way of bankrupting these people, emotionally and materially. </p>
              <p>my take is still the same, the day the old man continues breathing, nothing will change.....so depending on which generation of singaporean you are, you can be hopeful or resign to your fate.  </p>
