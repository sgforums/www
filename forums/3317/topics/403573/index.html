              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A private estate has become the latest target of loan 
              sharks. Eight units at Eastwood Terrace in Bedok were vandalised in 
              what's believed to be the first reported case of loan shark harassment 
              at a private estate. </span></p>
              <p><span>42-year-old American, Wesley Heiser, was eager to move in to his 
              new place at Eastwood Terrace until vandals crept into the district and 
              left a mess.
              <br> <br> The resident at Eastwood Terrace said: "My wife and I decided to make 
              Singapore our permanent home and so we made our first home purchase. The
               purchase was completed two days ago. Within the past two days, the 
              house has been painted twice and we didn't know that the seller had owed
               money to illegal moneylenders."
              <br> <br> Bags of red paint were splashed at neighbouring houses and cars.
              <br> <br> The vandals left notes all over the road which read "Because of her, 
              this happened".
              <br> <br> Neighbours said this isn't the first time the unit has been vandalised.
              <br> <br> Jasmine Siew, immediate neighbour of Mr Heiser, said: "Two or three days
               back, while we were driving out, we saw this bag of paint at our new 
              neighbour's house. So we were quite puzzled."
              <br> <br> Residents are taking no risks. One unit even installed security cameras.
              <br> <br> James Yap, resident, Eastwood Terrace, said: "If nobody were to create a
               deterrent for them, then definitely they'll get bolder. Because if they
               see you have touched up your place and made good again, then they'll 
              come again.
              <br> <br> â€œSo for us, there's only so much we can do to protect ourselves. Short 
              of hiring a security guard in front of our house, we are but sitting 
              ducks and waiting for them to abuse us."
              <br> <br> Neighbours described the previous owners to be cold and inconsiderate.
              <br> <br> Some had made complaints to the Police about their noisy mahjong 
              activities in the night.
              <br> <br> Residents said they often saw a middle-aged woman, her husband, and two 
              men in their twenties in the house.
              <br> <br> They also had three cars which residents said were often 
              indiscriminately parked."
              <br> Ms Siew added: "I think it's very unfair to all of us especially to the 
              new neighbour because they just bought the house without knowing 
              anything about the old neighbour. And for us, we are not very close to 
              the old neighbour so we couldn't contact her at all."
              <br> <br> Police have been notified of the incident and are investigating the 
              matter. </span></p>
