              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's High Court has ruled that more than $23 
              million seized from the estate of late Philippine leader Ferdinand 
              Marcos rightfully belongs to a Philippine bank.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In a 77-page ruling 
              obtained on Thursday by AFP, Justice Andrew Ang dismissed the rival 
              claims of the Philippine government, a group of human rights victims and
               five foundations believed to be Marcos fronts.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He ruled that the 
              money -- deposited in the Singapore branch of German bank WestLB -- 
              belongs to the now privately-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB).<br><br>"I
               am of the view that PNB holds legal title to the funds as trustee of 
              the same," Ang said in his judgement issued on Wednesday.<br><br>The 
              funds, comprising $16.8 million and 4.2 million British pounds ($6.58 
              million), were part of the alleged illicit fortune that Marcos stashed 
              away in various Swiss bank accounts.<br><br>Marcos ruled the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, when he was overthrown by a popular revolt. He died in exile in Hawaii in 1989.<br><br>He first governed as a democratically elected president but declared martial law in 1972, using military force to crush dissent.<br><br>Marcos
               and a circle of relatives and cronies allegedly amassed a fortune of up
               to $10 billion through graft and rigged business deals, much of it 
              stashed overseas.<br><br>In 1998, Swiss authorities released deposits in
               Swiss banks to PNB, which in turn transferred the money to various 
              banks in Singapore including WestLB, according to the ruling.<br><br>WestLB went to court in 2004 to determine the owner of the money after several groups staked claims.<br><br>Among
               the claimants was the Philippine government, which based its arguments 
              on a 2003 ruling by the country's Supreme Court that the funds be 
              forfeited in its favour.<br><br>But the Singapore judge ruled that the Philippine Supreme Court ruling could not be enforced in the city-state.<br><br>While
               he dismissed the claims of the human rights victims, the judge said he 
              sympathised with their plight but the court "must act in a principled 
              manner when dealing with such questions of law".<br><br>Despite numerous
               cases being filed in the Philippines, no member of the surviving Marcos
               family has been successfully prosecuted.<br><br>- AFP/al</span></span></p>
