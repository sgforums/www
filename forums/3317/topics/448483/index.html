              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: With Singaporeans drawing down under CPF Life from 
              January 1, 2013, the government announced further refinements to the 
              Life plans to better cater to the needs of the people.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>From four plans, CPF Life will now offer only two plans for Singaporeans to make the choices simpler.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>These announcements 
              were made by Deputy Prime Minister and Manpower Minister, Tharman 
              Shanmugaratnam during the Committee of Supply debates on the Manpower 
              Ministry's estimates in Parliament on Monday.<br><br>As more Singaporeans are expected to live longer, they will need more money for their retirement.<br><br>About
               half of Singaporeans aged 65 today are expected to live beyond 85 years
               of age. One-third are expected to live beyond 90 years old.<br><br>Mr 
              Tharman said: "More and more retirees will outlive their CPF savings if 
              they were on the Minimum Sum Scheme. CPF LIFE is therefore an important 
              and timely evolution of the Minimum Sum Scheme."<br><br>Since the introduction of CPF Life in 2009, there has been some feedback about the plans.<br><br>Mr
               Tharman said: "Some think the government introduced CPF LIFE to hold on
               to their money for life. Actually, all it means is you get paid for 
              life through CPF LIFE instead of for about 20 years under the minimum 
              sum scheme. CPF LIFE does not change how much you can withdraw from CPF 
              in cash and it does not change how your savings in other CPF accounts 
              can be used.<br><br>"The second misconception, some people believe you 
              end up losing your CPF savings, if you do not live long enough under 
              this new pooled insurance. This is not the case because when you're on 
              CPF LIFE, you leave a bequest.<br><br>"The bequest goes to your loved 
              ones, not to other CPF members and not to the government. You get all of
               your capital back either through your monthly payouts or in a bequest 
              that you leave to your family and loved ones."<br><br>As a result of the
               feedback received, the CPF Board said it will be combining the desired 
              features of the LIFE Plus and Balanced Plans into a new plan called the 
              Standard Plan.<br><br>The new Standard Plan will also be the default 
              plan, meaning if Singaporeans do not indicate their choice of which plan
               they want, they would automatically be placed under the Standard Plan.<br><br>Among
               the desired features of this plan include comparable payouts to the 
              Minimum Sum Scheme, the bequest feature and the flexibility to use the 
              Retirement Account.<br><br>Giving an example of how a member would 
              benefit from the Standard Plan, CPF Board said a member with S$90,000 at
               age 55 in his CPF balances would receive S$780 as a monthly payout from
               his draw down age for life.<br><br>The draw down age for CPF Life is from 65 years of age.<br><br>If the member were under the minimum sum scheme, he would get S$800, but only for 20 years.<br><br>The
               second plan which will be retained is the existing LIFE Basic plan, 
              which would provide a choice for members who prefer a higher bequest and
               a lower monthly payout.<br><br>The CPF Board will however, be removing 
              the LIFE Income Plan as this has generated very low demand, with only 
              three per cent of LIFE participants choosing this plan.<br><br>There had
               also been some confusion over the non-bequest feature in this plan and 
              any members who initially chose the Income Plan changed their minds when
               the nil bequest feature was explained to them.<br><br>CPF Board will no longer offer the Income Plan as an option from 2013.<br><br>CPF
               Board said the Standard Plan will be available from 2013 onwards and 
              about 58,000 members who turn 55 in 2013 will be able to choose between 
              the Standard Plan and the Basic Plan.<br><br>As for existing CPF Life 
              members, the Board emphasised that they may remain on their existing 
              plans which they have chosen and there is no need for them to switch.<br><br>However, policy holders who still prefer the new Standard Plan will have up to the December 31, 2013 to make the switch.<br><br>CPF
               Board will be sending out customised information packages in the fourth
               quarter of this year to help them better understand the differences 
              between their existing plan and the new Standard Plan.<br><br>The Board emphasised that CPF LIFE provides lifelong income for Singaporeans.<br><br>It
               was introduced in 2009 after extensive public consultation and it 
              applies to CPF members with a Retirement Account balances above S$40,000
               at age 55.<br><br>Those with lower balances can also opt-in any time.<br><br>Between
               2009 and now, CPF Board said more than 73,000 members have joined CPF 
              LIFE and since then it has given an opportunity for the Board to better 
              understand the needs of Singaporeans and further refine the plans.<br><br>Feedback
               obtained from members indicated that they generally find it difficult 
              to choose between the four plans and they preferred a simpler scheme.<br><br>- CNA/fa/ac</span></span></p>

              Percentage of CPF members meeting Minimum Sum on the rise: Tharman
              By S Ramesh | Posted: 05 March 2012 1701 hrs
              
              SINGAPORE: The percentage of active CPF members who meet their Minimum Sum at age 55 has been improving over the years, from 36 per cent in 2007 to 45 per cent in 2011.
              
              Speaking in Parliament, Deputy Prime Minister and Manpower Minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam said this will improve with each successive cohort, as educational profiles improve and lifetime incomes rise.
              
              He said among those starting work now, about 70 to 80 per cent should be able to attain the current level set for the Minimum Sum in cash, by the time they retired, adjusted for inflation, even after they have withdrawn money for a home.
              
              So, he said Singapore's CPF system with current contribution rates is broadly appropriate for most of the younger generation of Singaporeans.
              
              Mr Tharman also addressed MPs concerns if the minimum sum was too high. He said the CPF aims to help Singaporeans save up enough to meet a basic level of needs in retirement.
              
              The Minimum Sum (MS) that is to be set aside at age 55 is set at a level necessary to meet the typical expenditure needs of retiree households in the lower-middle income group.
              
              It should also cover the needs of those in the 2nd quintile of income, that is between the 20th percentile and 40th percentile of households by incomes. It would therefore also cover the needs of those in the lower, first quintile.
              
              For middle-income households, while their spending in retirement is usually higher, the CPF will still form an important part of retirement savings, said DPM Tharman.
              
              He however, explained that the minimum sum is not adequate to support the expected needs of those in higher-income households, and was not designed for that purpose. Those in higher-income households would have private savings outside of the CPF to tap on.
              
              Mr Tharman said: "If the CPF had to support those needs, we would need much higher contribution rates and a much higher Minimum Sum. It would be excessive for those in the lower-half of incomes, and also mean less take-home pay to meet their day-to-day expenditures."
              
              Going forward, Mr Tharman said one of the ministry's tasks is to ensure that most low-wage workers are in the CPF system.
              
              If they are in casual jobs and are not receiving CPF from their employers as they should, they would lose out on the Workfare Income Supplement and other government top-ups to their CPF from time to time.
              
              Mr Tharman said the ministry is stepping up its enforcement and promotion efforts to ensure compliance with the CPF Act for low wage workers.
