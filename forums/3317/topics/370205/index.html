              <p>EQUITY dealer Q L Loh, 25, was shocked when she found out she had
              to pay almost $1,000 in interest after a vacation abroad.</p>
              <p>She had charged $5,000 to her two credit cards for the holiday but
              could fork out only $2,000 in repayment when the bill arrived.</p>
              <p>Ms Loh paid the remaining $3,000 over the next few months and
              incurred an additional interest of about $100 each month. 'I felt the
              pinch only when (the interest) snowballed to $1,000,' she said ruefully.</p>
              <p>In the end, she took six months to clear her debt. Ms Loh is among
              a growing number of people who repay only a part of their debt instead
              of the full amount. They are known as 'revolvers'.</p>
              <p>According to Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS), there were 417,000
              revolvers in May, up four per cent from last June. Targeting this group
              of consumers, CCS and Citibank Singapore yesterday launched a
              creditmanagement programme called Use Credit Wisely.</p>
              <p>The initiative includes public talks, an information booklet and a
              phone helpline for Citibank customers to seek help in restructuring
              their debt.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Anil Wadhwani, Citibank Singapore's head of consumer
              markets: 'It's our responsibility to reach out to consumers and share
              good credit-management practices.'</p>
              <p>CCS president Kuo How Nam told my paper that the average debtor in
              Singapore has a monthly disposable income of $2,700 and owes seven
              creditors up to $70,000. That means he has exhausted his disposable
              income two years in advance.</p>
              <p>In the first half of this year, CCS handled 227 cases - almost
              double the 120 debtors it saw in the same period last year. Common
              causes of debt include overspending, loss of jobs or pay cuts, and
              business failures.</p>
              <p>Six in 10 debtors below 30 years old cited overspending as one of
              the main reasons for their financial difficulties, said CCS.</p>
              <p>According to figures from the Monetary Authority of Singapore,
              banks here wrote off $16.4 million in bad debt in May, up sharply from
              the $9.4 million written off in June last year.</p>
