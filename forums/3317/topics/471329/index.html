              <p>A 31-year-old woman was charged with the death of her son at her Housing and Development Board (HDB) unit in Clementi on 1 June.</p>
              <p>Rebecca Loh is accused of throwing her 9-year-old son Gabriel from the fifth-floor apartment at Block 704 West Coast Road, Clementi. Gabriel suffered severe health problems and had difficulty walking. Rebecca was often seen pushing him around in a pram in the neighbourhood. They lived together with Rebecca's mother, who worked full-time for $1000 a month to feed the family. That said, the Lohs were certainly not well off and must have been struggling to keep their heads out of the water.</p>

              <p>Based on what i have read, i really sympathised Rebecca.</p>
              <p>With her salary of $1k , definitely she has difficulties in coping her housing, PUB, son's ,medical bills etc and etc.Anyone would have stressed out and depressed.$1000 is not enough for the high living cost in Singapore.Those earning $2k plus already have problems coping with monthly basic needs.</p>
              <p>However due to whatever reasons, she should not end her son's life, well no one has the right to do so.She could have seek help from the relevent government agency or see her MP for further assistance.</p>
              <p>Well its really a sad real life story for the low income, worst of all, her's son got liver problems which need constant medical attention.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God blessed, hopefully she gets a lighter sentence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is really tough for poor people!</p>
              <p>Government, pls help us SINGAPOREAN ! POOR SINGAPOREAN!</p>

              Again, as I mention the majority agree with his. I am not sure did you notice, at least that is what I notice from a large number of the people.  Most of the people that complain are the one the give the elites the mandate.

              <p>Did she ever seek any financial assistance?  Some ppl may not know where to find help while some refused help.  If any of you has been to Novena Church on Sat, you will notice a blind man selling tissue papers under the hot sun with his wife, outside the church bus stop.  This man... many years ago, I saw a social worker talking to him and he said that as long as he could still support himself and his family (wife and a daughter), he will not take any financial assistance from the social service.  </p>
              <p>Coming back to the case of Rebecca.  The MP said he will do something to help.  So far, has he followed up in anything?  </p>
              <p>If Rebecca did ask for help and such tragedy still happened, then the MP and all at Town Council and CDC should pack up and go home.  Some of us may say that it's not right to kill the child, but in her case, it seemed that she had no where to go and nobody to go to.  I believe her initial intention was to kill herself (whereby ppl did witness her sitting on the window before she threw her son down) or die with her son.  She has suffered much pain and it pained her even much more seeing her son suffer poverty and physically.   </p>
