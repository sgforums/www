              <h1 class="headline">Over 60 killed in Myanmar quake</h1>
              <p>More than 60 people were killed and 90 injured after a strong 
              earthquake struck Myanmar near its border with Thailand, an official 
              said Friday, as some affected areas remained cut off.</p>
              <p>The earthquake on Thursday, which the US Geological Survey (USGS) 
              measured at magnitude 6.8, was felt as far away as Bangkok, almost 800 
              kilometres (500 miles) from the epicentre, Hanoi and parts of China.</p>
              <p>A Myanmar official said dozens of people were killed in areas close to the epicentre and more than 240 buildings had collapsed.</p>
              <p>"The death toll has increased to more than 60 now from those areas 
              including Tarlay, Mine Lin and Tachileik townships," said the official.</p>
              <p>"About 90 people were injured from those areas. The officials are 
              still trying to reach some more affected areas. There are some places we
               cannot reach yet."</p>
              <p>Tremors were felt as far away as Bangkok, almost 800 kilometres (500 miles) from the epicentre, Hanoi and parts of China.</p>
              <p>Just across the border from Tachileik, Thai authorities said a 
              52-year-old woman was killed in Mae Sai district after a wall of her 
              house collapsed.</p>
              <p>Terrified residents across the region fled their homes, tall 
              buildings swayed and hospitals and schools were evacuated during the 
              tremors.</p>
              <p>The quake struck 90 kilometres (60 miles) north of Chiang Rai and 235
               kilometres (150 miles) north-northeast of Chiang Mai, Thailand's second
               city and a popular tourist destination. Tall buildings shuddered in 
              Bangkok during the tremor.</p>
              <p>Its epicentre was close to the borders with Thailand and Laos and was just 10 kilometres (six miles) deep.</p>
              <p>Thailand's meteorological department on Friday said it had registered six large aftershocks following the initial quake.</p>
              <p>Chiang Rai governor Somchai Hatayatanti told AFP late Thursday that 
              efforts were made to evacuate people from tall buildings and he had 
              ordered all patients from Mae Sai District Hospital to be taken to 
              Chiang Rai.</p>
              <p>The shaking was felt throughout China's southwest province of Yunnan,
               according to state-run China National Radio, but no casualties or 
              structural collapses had been reported as of Friday morning.</p>
              <p>However, the earthquake reportedly caused cracks in some homes and 
              schools in and around the rugged Xishuangbanna region which borders 
              Myanmar, and fear of aftershocks forced many people in the area to spend
               the night outdoors.</p>
              <p>Some residents of the Vietnamese capital Hanoi fled their homes in panic when the quake shook the city.</p>
              <p>Nguyen Thi Hong Hanh, 36, who lives on the 10th floor of a highrise, 
              said her husband noticed their pet fish shaking in their tank.</p>
              <p>"We all rushed to the street. All the other people in the apartments also rushed out," she said.</p>
              <p>Hanoi felt the tremor at about magnitude 5.0, according to Dinh Quoc Van, deputy head of the earthquake monitoring department.</p>
              <p>The quake comes two weeks after Japan was hit by a monster 
              earthquake, which unleashed a devastating tsunami that left around 
              27,000 people dead or missing and triggered a crisis at its Fukushima 
              nuclear plant.</p>
              <p>No tsunami warning was issued after the Myanmar quake as US 
              seismologists said it was too far inland to generate a devastating wave 
              in the Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>The USGS initially recorded the quake as magnitude 7.0, but later revised it down to 6.8.</p>

              <p><strong>Survivors struggle in remote Myanmar quake areas</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>TARLAY, Myanmar : Survivors surveyed the wreckage of their 
              Myanmar villages on Saturday as details of an earthquake that left 75 
              dead and reduced homes to rubble began to trickle out of remote areas.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The powerful 6.8 
              magnitude quake struck in the east of the country near the borders with 
              Thailand and Laos late on Thursday and was felt as far away as the 
              Vietnamese capital Hanoi.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tachileik town and 
              nearby Tarlay and Mong Lin in Myanmar's Shan state appeared to have been
               most severely affected by the quake, which flattened hundreds of houses
               and toppled monasteries and government buildings.<br><br>In Tarlay a 
              few rescue teams were seen picking through the rubble of buildings, a 
              bridge was destroyed and the roads were riven with huge cracks.<br><br> "The whole village is gone," said Nan Myint, tearfully explaining that 
              she had lost her father, nephew and sister-in-law in the quake, which 
              happened while she was in Yangon.<br><br>"I came back as soon as I heard
               about the earthquake. Some of my relatives are still in the hospital in
               Tachileik," she told AFP, adding authorities have supported her with a 
              350,000 kyats (about $400) payment.<br><br>"I have no idea what we should do in the future because my house is totally destroyed. I do not want to stay here."<br><br>The
               charity World Vision, which said around 15,000 people could have been 
              affected in the worst-hit areas, is sending in first aid kits and 
              tarpaulins to give emergency shelter for up to 2,500 families.<br><br>"This is an immediate concern as even last night there was rain," said Chris Herink, Myanmar country director in Yangon.<br><br>A
               Myanmar official said there had been no official increase in the toll 
              from Friday's figure of 74. One woman was also killed in Thailand.<br><br>"There
               might be some places we still cannot reach because of the communication
               and transportation problems. The death toll could rise," the official 
              added.<br><br> Strong aftershocks continued into Saturday.<br><br>A 
              motorcycle taxi driver in Tachileik told AFP that things were "calm" in 
              the town. "We were frightened in the beginning, but now we are trying to
               get back to normal," he said.<br><br>The region affected was already 
              difficult to reach before the quake, access to the area by foreigners is
               restricted and the military dominated government tends to keep a tight 
              grip on information.<br><br>The ruling military was widely criticised 
              for refusing foreign assistance for weeks after cyclone Nargis wrought 
              devastation across the Irrawaddy Delta in May 2008, leaving more than 
              138,000 people either killed or missing.<br><br>But Herink said his 
              organisation, which is working in the affected areas with the Myanmar 
              Red Cross and UNICEF, had found the government had been "proactively 
              seeking our assistance and providing information to us".<br><br>A report
               by authorities in Tarlay, translated by the charity, described the 
              emergency response, with soldiers helping to rescue people within the 
              first hours.<br><br>The social welfare relief and resettlement minister went to Tachileik from the capital Naypyidaw on Saturday.<br><br>But
               one Tachileik resident, posting anonymously on an Internet forum, 
              expressed frustration with the authorities, describing the town as 
              "ruined".<br><br>"I hope there is not another earthquake because our 
              situation is not very good as we cannot get any concrete assistance from
               the authorities."<br><br>Many people were getting their news from Thai 
              radio, rather than sources in the country, while state media appeared 
              keen to downplay the disaster, with the first mention of the earthquake 
              on page 11 in Saturday's New Light of Myanmar.<br><br>"We never expected
               this kind of natural disaster... That is why I worry for my people," 
              said Sai Thein Aung, a Shan Nationalities Democratic Party member of 
              parliament for Tachileik.<br><br>The United States expressed its condolences, while Thailand donated money and said it was ready to offer additional assistance.<br><br> - AFP /ls</span></span></p>
