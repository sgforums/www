              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said despite globalisation, Singapore can create a national identity for itself. <br><br>He said the challenge is to keep Singapore recognisable to its citizens, while bringing in new immigrants to cope with future challenges. <br><br>Mr Lee was addressing over 500 junior college and polytechnic students at a Pre-University Seminar on Tuesday morning. <br><br>Addressing a packed auditorium at the National University of Singapore, the prime minister outlined four key challenges facing Singapore. He spoke of the need to upgrade the economy, create a strong education system, build a cohesive society and improve the urban living environment. <br><br>Mr Lee said to achieve this, Singapore needs good people at all levels, be it in the public or private sector. And he said the public service especially requires a team of outstanding officers and that good government remains a critical advantage of Singapore. <br><br>Mr Lee also reminded his audience that even if they find success in life, they should make an effort to contribute back to society. <br><br>These themes were picked up during the hour-long dialogue following his speech, with students raising questions on income equality, attracting youths into politics and how Singapore can meet future challenges. <br><br>A student from Hwa Chong Junior College asked the prime minister: "How do you suggest that we prepare stability and peace for the next century, living in the culture of our pledge?" <br><br>Mr Lee's reply, "I'm putting it in your good hands", brought on laughter. <br><br>He added: "I sketch big questions not to frighten you, but to give you a sense that there are big issues which is worth our while committing heart and soul to go and tackle." <br><br>Others wanted the prime minister's view on globalisation and new immigrants. <br><br>One student from Millennia Institute asked: "With the influx of new immigrants and the potential fault-lines in our society between established Singaporeans and the new arrivals, what do you envision Singapore to be 10 years from now?" <br><br>In reply, Mr Lee said: "I hope in 10 or 15 years' time, the immigrants who are here today would have become more Singaporean in their outlook, in their habits, in their integration in our society. <br><br>"We have to keep the core, the ethos of this place, a sense of continuity, that it's not just a new group living in the same room. And keep a balance between strengthening, maintaining the core and keeping Singapore recognisable, and bringing in new people and transforming Singapore to prepare for tomorrow." <br><br>A student from Temasek Polytechnic, who is a Singapore permanent resident from Taiwan, asked: "How do you build a national identity when it will be diluted over time by foreigners like myself?" <br><br>Mr Lee said one way is to maintain a sense of heritage and history among Singaporeans. <br><br>He said: "That's why we try hard to give people a sense of heritage, a sense of place, of a sense of how Singapore came to be like this. And if you can sense and feel that, and belong to that ... <br><br>"And if the PRs also, who come and want to become part of our community, identify with that and then say, 'Yes I am joining this team and my children will grow up here and they will be part of this team,' then I think we can keep our identity and in a globalised world, Singaporeans are something different." <br><br>There was also a question on meritocracy versus elitism, to which Mr Lee responded that while some people may do better than others, it was important that the benefits of growth go to everyone, not just those who succeed. <br><br>And he said that Singapore must not have what he calls a "magic circle" of elite achievers, and that anyone can do well whatever his or her background. <br><br>Mr Lee also spoke of the need for capable hands at all levels, especially in the public service. <br><br>He said: "So if the PSC talks to you, please listen carefully and take it seriously because in fact, it's a serious choice which you have to make. If everybody goes into the private sector, you say marvellous, somebody else can look after the country. <br><br>"And it so happens that nobody remembered to mind the shop, then the private sector will not succeed. Because you must have somebody who's not just minding the shop, but making sure it's possible for people to prosper, thrive, do well and make tomorrow better." <br><br>The Pre-U Seminar is an annual event and celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. <br><br>- CNA/vm/al <br></span></p>
