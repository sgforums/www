              <p><strong>Death toll from China mine blast rises to 104: media</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>HEGANG, China (AFP) - â€“ The death toll
              from China's deadliest coal mine blast in two years has climbed to 104,
              local authorities said early Monday, according to state media.</p>
              <p>The state-run Xinhua news agency said four workers were still trapped in the mine shaft at Hegang city in northeast China.</p>
              <p>The
              explosion early Saturday tore through the state-run mine in
              Heilongjiang province near the Russian border, one of the largest and
              oldest in China, after a build-up of gas, survivors said.</p>
              <p>The explosion occurred when a total of 528 miners were in the pit, according to the State Administration of Work Safety.</p>
              <p>Local news reports said the blast was felt 10 kilometres (six miles) away.</p>
              <p>The
              accident was the worst in energy-hungry China's notoriously dangerous
              mining industry since an explosion killed 105 miners in Shanxi province
              in December 2007.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, President Hu Jintao and Prime
              Minister Wen Jiabao issued orders to take all measures to rescue
              workers at Hegang, while Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang was dispatched to
              the mine to oversee the operation, state media said.</p>
              <p>The head,
              deputy head and chief engineer of the mine, which is run by the
              majority state-owned Heilongjiang Longmay Mining Holding Group, have
              been removed from their posts, the China News Service said.</p>
              <p>The director of the work safety administration is to lead an investigation into the blast, it added.</p>
              <p>China's
              state prosecutor will also launch a probe to determine whether criminal
              negligence led to the disaster, China Central Television said.</p>
              <p>The
              mine produces 1.45 million tonnes of coal a year. The company ranked
              12th out of China's top 100 mining companies and seventh in terms of
              production volume in 2009, according to its website.</p>
              <p>China has
              a dismal work safety record, with thousands of people dying every year
              in mines, factories and on construction sites. Chronology: Major
              accidents in Chinese mines</p>
              <p>Its coal mines are among the most
              dangerous in the world, with safety standards often ignored in the
              quest for profits and the drive to meet surging demand for coal -- the
              source of about 70 percent of China's energy.</p>
              <p>Official figures
              show that more than 3,200 workers died in collieries last year. But
              independent labour groups say the actual figure could be much higher,
              as accidents are often covered up to avoid costly mine shutdowns.</p>
              <p>On
              Sunday, the provincial work safety bureau vowed to step up a reform of
              the industry and shut down small inefficient mines in the Heilongjiang
              region, Xinhua news agency said.</p>
