              <p>September 20, 2009<br> Op-Ed Contributor<br> Last Words<br> By CLAIRE CAMERON<br> <br> Last week, reports of executions — one postponed in Ohio, one carried
              out in Texas — punctuated the news more frequently than usual. These
              reports prompted me to reflect on an archive of executed prisoners’
              last words I found on the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Web site
              while researching parole terms. The archive’s earliest entry dates from
              Dec. 7, 1982; the most recent was added after Stephen Moody was
              executed on Wednesday by lethal injection for murder.<br> <br> What follows are quotations taken from inmates’ last statements in
              Texas. The statements, delivered before family members, relatives of
              victims, friends and the press, are compiled out of chronological order.<br> <br> — CLAIRE CAMERON, the author of “The Line Painter”<br> <br> Go ahead?<br> <br> Nothing I can say can change the past.<br> <br> I done lost my voice.<br> <br> I would like to say goodbye.<br> <br> My heart goes is going ba bump ba bump ba bump.<br> <br> Is the mike on?<br> <br> I don’t have anything to say. I am just sorry about what I did.<br> <br> I am nervous and it is hard to put my thoughts together. Sometimes you don’t know what to say.<br> <br> Man, there is a lot of people there.<br> <br> I have come here today to die, not make speeches.<br> <br> Where’s Mr. Marino’s mother? Did you get my letter?<br> <br> I want to ask if it is in your heart to forgive me. You don’t have to.<br> <br> I wish I could die more than once to tell you how sorry I am.<br> <br> Could you please tell that lady right there — can I see her? She is not
              looking at me — I want you to understand something, hold no animosity
              toward me. I want you to understand. Please forgive me.<br> <br> I don’t think the world will be a better or safer place without me.<br> <br> I am sorry.<br> <br> I want to tell my mom that I love her.<br> <br> I caused her so much pain and my family and stuff. I hurt for the fact that they are going to be hurting.<br> <br> I am taking it like a man.<br> <br> Kick the tires and light the fire. I am going home.<br> <br> They may execute me but they can’t punish me because they can’t execute an innocent man.<br> <br> I couldn’t do a life sentence.<br> <br> I said I was going to tell a joke. Death has set me free. That’s the biggest joke.<br> <br> To my sweet Claudia, I love you.<br> <br> Cathy, you know I never meant to hurt you.<br> <br> I love you, Irene.<br> <br> Let my son know I love him.<br> <br> Tell everyone I got full on chicken and pork chops.<br> <br> I appreciate the hospitality that you guys have shown me and the respect, and the last meal was really good.<br> <br> The reason it took them so long is because they couldn’t find a vein.
              You know how I hate needles. ... Tell the guys on Death Row that I’m
              not wearing a diaper.<br> <br> Lord, I lift your name on high.<br> <br> From Allah we came and to Allah we shall return.<br> <br> For everybody incarcerated, keep your heads up.<br> <br> Death row is full of isolated hearts and suppressed minds.<br> <br> Mistakes are made, but with God all things are possible.<br> <br> I am responsible for them losing their mother, their father and their
              grandmother. I never meant for them to be taken. I am sorry for what I
              did.<br> <br> I can’t take it back.<br> <br> Lord Jesus forgive of my sins. Please forgive me for the sins that I can remember.<br> <br> All my life I have been locked up.<br> <br> Give me my rights. Give me my rights. Give me my rights. Give me my life back.<br> <br> I am tired.<br> <br> I deserve this.<br> <br> A life for a life.<br> <br> It’s my hour. It’s my hour.<br> <br> I’m ready, Warden.</p>
