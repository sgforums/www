              <p class="articleabstract">Former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad was admitted to hospital for chest infection Saturday during a trip to Australia, where he was scheduled to address a seminar, according to an aide.</p>
              <p>
              
              
              </p>
              <div id="abody" class="articlebody">
              <p>The 85-year-old was admitted to the general ward in a Melbourne hospital for antibiotics treatment and physiotheraphy, his aide Sufi Yusof said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"Dr Mahathir's condition is stable and he has been advised to rest," said the aide, adding that the former Malaysian leader is expected to remain in hospital for a few days for observation.</p>
              <p>Mahathir arrived in Melbourne Thursday and was slated to address a seminar on human development organised by a club linked to Malaysia's ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation.</p>
              <p>Mahathir retired in 2003 after 22 years in power. He remains an influential figure in Malaysian politics, and has often speak up on current issues.</p>
              <p>He has undergone two coronary bypass surgeries, one in 1989 and the latest in 2007.</p>

              <p>No. It's just one of Lee Kuan Yew's zany racist rubbish theories. Mostly outdated and debunked racial crap from 1930s.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew is from that generation and he is unable to throw off those rubbish racist concepts.</p>
              <p>This is a very serious intellectual handicap of Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>He reveals himself to be a confused, intellectual trashbag. You can see how poor and confused his understanding of human development really is.</p>
              <p>Nothing but filth from Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Pui. Read Lee Kuan Yew filth also want to vomit.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; ">Fundamentally, Ardrey <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">is a racist, devoted to a belief in human inequality and unfreedom, an enemy of social "disorder" which must be suppressed by authority because man is a predatory, violent, aggressive creature, compelled by irresistible hereditary compulsion to war over territory. </span></span></strong>These are fascist ideas, and, in this book, Ardrey is doing for America what Treitschke, H. S. Chamberlain, Alfred Rosenberg, and others did for Germany: preparing an intellectual basis for fascist political action. Unfortunately, there is not space here to show this in detail, but a few brief points will show the trend. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; ">   Ardrey speaks of 6 to 7 million mentally deficient Americans as an example of "the accident of the night," when he must know perfectly well that a considerable part of these have nothing to do with inheritance but are the result of virus infections or other events of an environmental nature which occurred after conception. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; ">   <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Negro intelligence, which he renames "capacity to learn," he insists, is inferior.</span></span></strong> To soften the blow, he says that Negroes have "superiority of anatomical endowment and neurological coordination," then asks, "If racial distinction on the playing field is to be accepted, then can there exist theoretical grounds for banishing distinctions in the classroom? In the United States the evidence for inferior learning capacity is as inarguable as superior performance on the baseball diamond." He bases this of course, on the Coleman Report and, equally naturally, runs into a conspiracy to prevent him from getting a copy of this explosive document: "After some eight months of trying, I pried a copy out of the U.S. Government Printing Office. Why it had become unavailable became evident only after long exploration of its 700-plus pages of statistics. The Negro had failed in American schools catastrophically, beyond statistical doubt or sentimental apology. . . . Worse still for the black was the record of the Oriental-American, subjected in American life to discrimination certainly as rigorous as the Negro, who consistently equalled and in areas excelled the records of white students."<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Naturally, Ardrey finds Arthur Jensen's article "on the genetic inferiority of Negro intelligence" a persuasive document and calls those who reject it hysterical.</span></span></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">   I can answer Ardrey simply by pointing out that his ignorance totally disqualifies him from writing on the subject.</span></strong> If he had compared Chinese-Americans with Negro-Americans from several points of view (crime rate, educational achievement, recourse to violence, mental ill-health, need for government social and economic relief), he would have discovered that the Chinese record is far superior to the Negro on all of these. He would also have discovered that the Chinese family is probably the most stable of any American minority, just as the Negro family is the most unstable,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> and that most students of these matters would attribute the difference in various social indicators to the factor of family stability, rather than to race or skin color. </span></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; ">   Moreover, if Ardrey had taken time to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">compare the family life of the 15 percent of Negroes who do as well as the upper 50 percent of whites, he would have found that the higher achieving group came from more stable Negro families. </span></span></strong>The Moynihan Report, despite its obvious weaknesses, is as quotable as the Jensen paper, but Ardrey, who constantly doctors his evidence by selection, does not mention Moynihan. Ardrey's bigotry appears when he says that Chinese-Americans are "subjected in American life to discrimination certainly as rigorous as the Negro." This is nonsense. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; "><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 31px; font-size: 17.5px; ">   Forty-five years ago, about 1925, writers like Ardrey were arguing the genetic inferiority of Negroes by using the intelligence tests of draftees in World War I. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">These bigots were silenced only when it was pointed out that the same tests which showed the whites did better than Negroes also showed that Northern Negroes did better than Southern whites.</span></span></strong> In Ardrey's case, as usual, he can be refuted from his own book. He admits that the Coleman Report tests were "culture-bound" and intended to be so. In that case, to use them to indicate genetic (that is, non-cultural) differences reveals Ardrey for what the whole book shows: that he is a writer who has no concern with scientific procedures.</span></p>
