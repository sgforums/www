              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Education today is about developing enduring skills 
              and character, and less about transferring content knowledge, says 
              Education Minister Heng Swee Keat.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said it starts with recruiting teachers with the right values to guide young Singaporeans.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Heng was speaking at the ministry's annual promotion ceremony on Thursday.<br><br>The
               connection between character building and physical education may not be
               apparent, but some saw the potential in gymnastics and drama.<br><br>Mr
               Muhammad Ali, Head of Physical Education at Guangyang Primary School, 
              said: "You can't really teach character. What you need to do is create 
              that situation, that scenario where students are able to think on their 
              feet, and engage them in problem-solving, how to relate with each other 
              in case during the activities they have issues with one another, and how
               to resolve situations like that."<br><br>Mr Muhammad Ali is one of 6,803 education officers promoted this year. <br><br>Mr
               Heng said: "Education is now less about transferring content knowledge 
              but more about learning how to learn and about holistic development. Our
               students need to know what is right and what is wrong. They need to 
              discern truths from untruths.<br><br>"Education is about developing in 
              our students an enduring core of competencies, values and character, so 
              that they have the resilience to survive and succeed in a future which 
              could be very different from the one that we are living in today."<br><br>Among the promoted officers, there are 121 Principals - almost three times the number last year.<br> <br>As
               the ministry's leadership grows, Mr Heng said teachers continue to take
               a central position in delivering its values-driven education.<br><br>"They
               themselves must have the relevant values, knowledge and skills to guide
               our young. It starts with recruiting teachers with the right values and
               passion to teach. NIE then needs to develop them, not just with a 
              strong foundation in pedagogical content knowledge, but also in the 
              ethos of the teaching profession," he said.<br><br>In 2010, the Ministry
               reviewed its educational outcomes and drew up its 21s Century 
              Competency Framework. It wants to develop students who are confident 
              learners, active contributors, and concerned citizens.<br><br>The ministry is also rewarding those who have made a mark in helping teachers - teach. <br><br>Mr
               Manmohan Singh, Vice Principal (Administration) at Anglo-Chinese School
               (Barker Road), said: "Providing support structures and putting in place
               processes to support teachers where administration is concerned. <br><br>"One
               thing we realise today is teachers are very bogged down with 
              administration. What we try to do is that we try to minimise as much as 
              possible their administrative work, so they get a chance to focus 
              strictly on teaching, so that we bring our students up to a certain 
              level where you can see them going into 21st century global citizens."<br><br>Mr Manmohan Singh is among a new and growing breed of Vice Principals tackling this essential support for teachers.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>
