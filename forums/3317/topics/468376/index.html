              <p>SINGAPORE: Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said
               the government will not be changing its decision on the tightening of 
              foreign manpower policies for the foreseeable future.</p>
              <p>The focus he said is to help companies ease off their dependence on foreign labour and succeed in the adjustment process.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan was speaking at a recording of Channel NewsAsia's programme "Ask Minister".</p>
              <p>Mr
               Tan said: "I think I need to be quite definitive here, so that the 
              signal is clear because I would say for some time, I would say the 
              industry was thinking that government will make a U-turn so therefore 
              the changes perhaps did not quite happen. I think people were hoping 
              that if the pressure was high enough, we will make adjustments and so 
              on. And we notice that as a result of that, the propensity to do the way
               we do things was not so significant."</p>
              <p>He said should affected companies close down, assistance will be provided to them and their workers to find alternatives.</p>
              <p>Going
               forward, Mr Tan said the government is looking for a leaner manpower 
              set-up and businesses which depend on cheap labour should rethink how 
              their businesses are run.</p>
              <p>"In areas where you need to depend 
              on low wage, cheaper labour, I think those are sectors we need to 
              rethink - either in the way we do business, in the way we operate or 
              maybe some of these sectors may not be quite relevant."</p>
              <p>Wage growth will be another focus in the next couple of years.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Tan said he is "very uncomfortable with the fact" that some of the 
              wages of low wage workers have remained quite stagnant for some time.</p>
              <p>He pointed that the government has already enhanced the Workfare programmes and adjusted the CPF contributions.</p>
              <p>He said more will be done to put in place progressive work practices in industries such as security and cleaning.</p>
              <p>"We
               are looking at restructuring the approach so progressive work practices
               will be put in place. So structurally, we will hope to see, and I think
               in a tight labour market, wages begin to move up but at the same time 
              augmented by all the different measures to support that effort,” said Mr
               Tan.</p>
              <p>As the economy restructures, Mr Tan said the aim is to provide Singaporeans at all levels with good opportunities and good jobs.</p>

              <p>this article is redundant in the frist place. boh lang ask him to comment. boh lang also care we want them to u-turn.</p>
              <p>in a long run sg cannot thrive as a country attracting cheap labor business. no loinger is cheap labor an attraction to the bglobal investaors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so this comment and piece of news is red herring, and the thought of asking for u-turn never cross any singaporeans' minds. its just some idea and thinking this guy created himself.</p>
              <p>the reason why ECP was a dilema to me for GE2016 was GCT. now that he is out and doing something else, nice sweet and pretty panty can go all out full force to get it for GE2016.</p>
