              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Acting Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said there are 
              positive signs that Singapore will be able to achieve its target of 
              building as strong a Singaporean core as possible, by encouraging its 
              people to get married and have more children earlier.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Teo, who is also 
              Minister-in-Charge of population policies, said surveys show that 85 per
               cent of singles want to get married, while eight in 10 married couples 
              want to have two to three children.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said these reflect the desire among the vast majority to get married and start families.<br><br>Addressing
               about 200 participants at a townhall dialogue on "Our Population, Our 
              Future" on Tuesday, Mr Teo said this is very encouraging.<br><br>Mr Teo also hopes that Singapore's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) can increase from the current 1.2 to at least 1.4 or 1.5.<br><br>He said it would be good if the TFR is higher than 1.5 but added that it'll take time to change this.<br><br>He
               said there have been suggestions for the government to increase 
              financial support for parents, improve the availability and quality of 
              childcare facilities and promote work-life balance and flexi-work 
              arrangements.  <br><br>Mr Teo said the government is studying these 
              proposals, including ideas to refine existing marriage and parenthood 
              initiatives.  <br><br>But he stressed that what's more important is a whole-of-society effort to enhance a family-friendly culture. <br><br>"Getting
               married and having children must be something that couples want and 
              look forward to, and feel is important to make their lives complete. We 
              will strive to create a supportive and conducive environment for raising
               children, and we hope that couples will make the decision to start a 
              family, even if circumstances do not fit their expectations completely 
              or perfectly," said Mr Teo.<br><br>He pointed out that Singapore will need to add about 20,000 new Singaporeans each year, to keep the citizen population stable.<br><br>A good number of these new Singaporeans are spouses of citizens.<br><br>Last year, 39 per cent of marriages, or about 9,000, were between a Singaporean and a non-Singaporean. <br><br>So
               with 20,000 new citizens per year, Mr Teo said the country is "filling"
               in the shortfall to replace itself and to have a sustainable and stable
               population of Singaporeans.<br><br>Turning to long-term population 
              projections, Mr Teo said how many people Singapore can have will depend 
              on factors such as plans for its urban environment.<br><br>The Urban 
              Redevelopment Authority (URA), in its most recent mid-term concept plan 
              review in 2006,  had assessed that Singapore has sufficient land to 
              support a population of 6.5 million. <br><br>Mr Teo stressed that this was a planning parameter - not a population target. <br><br>He
               said what Singapore's population would be will depend on how many more 
              babies the country has, whether it continues to create good jobs and is 
              able to attract new immigrants, as well as the decisions on the number 
              of foreign workers needed to support economic and social needs. <br><br>"But
               because major infrastructure projects take time, we must plan well 
              ahead, and build in a buffer for contingencies. This is a prudent thing 
              to do so that we can implement the plans if needed with minimal lag 
              time, and continue to enjoy a well-planned and good living environment,"
               said Mr Teo.<br><br>The National Population and Talent Division has 
              received close to 2,000 pieces of feedback directly and met over 1,200 
              individuals and representatives of various groupings and organisations. <br><br>The government is preparing a White Paper on the population issue and plans to finalise it by the end of the year.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
