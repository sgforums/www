              <p>DBS Bank is being sued by a client claiming fraudulent and negligent 
              misrepresentations that a US$1.5 million ($2 million) Lehman 
              Brothers-related investment was "sound".<br><br> Former DBS banker 
              Desmond Lim Hong Nian had said principal invested in the structured 
              product was safe, according to a Nov 30 lawsuit filed with the Singapore
               High Court by Australian Mark Carpenter.<br><br> Mr Carpenter is 
              seeking to recover the US$1.17 million he lost when Lehman filed for 
              bankruptcy protection in 2008 and claiming an additional US$280,000 from
               DBS and Mr Lim for losses incurred after the bank made five 
              unauthorised transactions in currency-linked investments, according to 
              court filings.<br><br> The bank had its ban on the sale of 
              structured notes lifted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in 
              February after it improved the internal procedures of its advisory 
              services across all its investment products. <br><br> DBS was one 
              of 10 financial institutions banned from selling structured notes 
              following claims by investors that they were misled on products tied to 
              Lehman.<br><br> A DBS spokeswoman said the bank will defend the 
              lawsuit. Mr Lim is no longer employed by the bank, the spokeswoman 
              added, declining to elaborate.<br><br> Mr Carpenter's lawyer, Mr N Sreenivasan, could not be reached for comment at his office.<br><br> DBS denied in court filings telling Mr Carpenter that his 
              principal in the investments would be protected. Mr Carpenter indicated 
              he was prepared to take high risks and was an experienced investor who 
              made his own decisions, the bank said.<br><br> Mr Carpenter also 
              failed to inform the bank within seven days of receiving his investment 
              advice slips that there were erroneous transactions, DBS said.<br><br> Investors in Singapore bought $508 million of structured products 
              linked to Lehman, which lost most or all of their value when the lender 
              filed for the biggest bankruptcy in United States corporate history.<br><br> DBS last year reviewed 140 cases in Singapore where its customers 
              lost money on $103 million of Lehman-linked structured notes. <br><br> The Singapore lender has also been sued by 204 investors who 
              incurred $17 million in losses on securities linked to Lehman.<br><br> DBS in July agreed to repay HK$651 million ($110 million) to Hong 
              Kong clients it classified as having a low or medium investment risk 
              profile and who bought Lehman-linked notes.</p>
