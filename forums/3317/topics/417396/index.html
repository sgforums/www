              <p><strong>RWS to sue local travel firm over trademark infringement </strong></p>
              <p>Resorts World at Sentosa, along with its affiliated company - Genting 
              International Management - is taking a travel firm to court over 
              trademark infringement.</p>
              <p>The firm providing services such as limousine pick-up and sight-seeing packages is registered as ResortWorldSentosa and goes by www.resortworld.com.sg on the internet.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the integrated resort is registered as Resorts World at Sentosa and has a domain name on the internet as www.rwsentosa.com. <br> <br> Court papers filed in the High Court showed that the two plaintiffs said
               the words "Resorts World" and its accompanying logos such as the red 
              symbol was first used by them in 2007. <br> <br> Through widespread advertising, they have acquired "substantive goodwill and reputation". <br> <br> Hence, the trademarks used in relation to the similar services provided 
              by the travel company have given rise to "a likelihood of confusion", 
              they claimed. <br> <br> Seeking an injunction against the use of their registered trademarks, 
              the integrated resort further contend that services offered by the 
              travel company such as "RWS Suite" or "RWS Corporate" packages are 
              similar to those offered under their trademarks. <br> <br> RWS and Genting International Management are also alleging that the 
              travel company has attempted to pass off their services as those of 
              RWS. <br> <br> The travel firm’s Internet domain name would also lead the public to associate its services with them, the plaintiffs said. <br> <br> Owned by a 50-year-old Singaporean, ResortWorldSentosa was first 
              incorporated in November last year and its Internet domain name was up a
               month later. <br> <br> The owner of ResortWorldSentosa who has yet to file a defence told 
              MediaCorp he stands by his company’s name and will wait for the 
              plaintiffs to commence their next course of action before he decides 
              what to do. <br> <br> RWS and Genting International Management first filed their writ of 
              summons in September, after failing to get him to comply with their 
              request to stop using their registered trademarks and his lack of 
              response to their lawyers’ letters, they claimed.<br> <br> RWS says it’s seeking at least $250,000 in damages and costs - the minimum amount for a High Court case.</p>
