              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Latest results from the International Baccalaureate 
              (IB) examinations show that Singapore students are among the top 
              performers worldwide.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In fact, they make up about half of the world's perfect scorers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It was a leap of 
              faith that 19-year-old Amanda Ang took when she chose to pursue the IB 
              Diploma at St Joseph's Institution International two years ago. <br><br>She
               said: "At the beginning, my mother wanted me to go to junior college 
              instead, but later on, she saw that I became much more passionate about 
              learning, and I was given the opportunity to be involved in many 
              different areas. I wouldn't normally have the opportunity to, and so she
               was supportive of my decision in the end."<br><br>And it has paid off. Amanda graduated among the top of her batch last year.<br><br>Her counterparts at other schools did just as well.<br><br>Four schools under the Education Ministry currently offer the IB programme.<br><br>They
               are Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Anglo Chinese International, St
               Joseph's Institution International and Hwa Chong International.<br><br>Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) produced half of the world's perfect scorers. <br><br>The
               International Baccalaureate Organisation said 57 students worldwide 
              achieved the maximum score of 45. Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) 
              produced 28 perfect scorers.<br><br>Hwa Chong International saw a pass rate of 100 per cent, while it was 96 per cent for Anglo Chinese International. <br><br>The schools said the IB programme gives them the flexibility to offer a holistic and creative curriculum.<br><br>Students
               are engaged through a wide lesson plan, which includes outdoor 
              activities like St Joseph's Institution International's Challenge Week. <br><br>Brian
               Christian, principal of St Joseph's Institution International, said: 
              "They have a set budget and they have to leave Singapore and they have 
              to take on a service-orientated challenging project for a week.<br><br>"They
               are on their own and I think the independence they develop is 
              brilliant. We allow students to explore areas that would not be 
              available to them in something like the 'A' Levels programme."<br><br>The
               International Baccalaureate Organisation said the programme's 
              difficulty suits Singaporean students' insatiable pursuit to achieve.<br><br>Amanda
               from St Joseph's Institution International said: "It is not really more
               difficult than any other way. It just focuses a lot more on individual 
              opinion and ideas and creativity and it is less exam focused, but it 
              allows us to focus more on our individual projects and assessments."<br><br>Including private institutions, there are currently 23 schools which offer the IB programme in Singapore.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
