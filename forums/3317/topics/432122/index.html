              <p>Young Singaporeans are intelligent and motivated. They want to 
              exchange opinions and seek higher ideals. But some may also feel 
              restless or disenfranchised.</p>
              <p>And the government, schools and parents have a part to play to ensure
               these young people - who make up 26 per cent of the total electors in 
              this year's <span id="lw_1307467041_1" class="yshortcuts">General Election</span> - remain rooted in <span id="lw_1307467041_8" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>, said a panel of speakers to about 250 people on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The panel, who were from six political parties, were speaking in their personal capacities at an Institute of Policy Studies forum titled "What Youth Want".</p>
              <p>The forum explored the political attitudes of people aged 36 and below, issues that matter to them and how they can be engaged.</p>
              <p>Pointing to a "restlessness" among young people, the Workers' Party's (WP) <span id="lw_1307467041_3" class="yshortcuts">Member of Parliament</span> for Hougang <span id="lw_1307467041_0" class="yshortcuts">Yaw Shin Leong</span> said, "I believe they are searching for their place in society, where their aspirations can be fulfilled."</p>
              <p>This could be a reason why there were huge turnouts at political 
              rallies, such as the WP's during the GE, said the 35-year-old, who felt 
              campus activism was one way to involve the youth.</p>
              <p>Bread and butter issues remain important to young Singaporeans but 
              "more of us are increasingly conscious of higher ideals, environmental 
              issues, human rights, animal rights, artistic expression and so on," 
              said the People's Action Party's Desmond Lee, 34.</p>
              <p>He noted, they hold "no automatic affiliation" to any <span id="lw_1307467041_4" class="yshortcuts">political party</span> and are discerning in their choices even as they support having more 
              voices in Parliament and external checks on the government.</p>
              <p>To connect with this group, policies not only need to be rational and
               sound but must be implemented "fairly, justly and compassionately", he 
              added. The government also needs to change the way it consults with 
              people and start gathering feedback on policies earlier on, he noted.</p>
              <p>Singapore Democratic Party's
               Michelle Lee, 35, pointed to Generation Y's "awakening" at a time of 
              terrorist attacks, natural disasters and two major "bear markets".</p>
              <p>Such events give them a "very different world view" and result in a 
              scepticism of institutions and the establishment, she said. As such, 
              they seek "higher order needs" like social networks, immediate 
              relationships and a sense of belonging.</p>
              <p>Today, Generation X-ers, who were born in "stability and wealth" are 
              also starting to feel that "money is not everything", she added.</p>
              <p>Singapore society is at a critical juncture, said Lee. With honest 
              soul-searching, Singapore could see a "renaissance" and establish its 
              place as a cultural and <span id="lw_1307467041_7" class="yshortcuts">social capital</span> of Asia, she said.</p>
              <p>There is also a group of "disenfranchised" youth, who, perhaps 
              looking at their parents' challenges in life, find their future hopeless
               and bleak, raised Singapore People's Party's Jimmy Lee, 35.</p>
              <p>It is this group that political parties, schools and parents need to 
              reach out to, to give them hope and inspire then to work toward their 
              dreams, he said.</p>
              <p>He disagreed with a Facebook posting that said youth today are 
              demanding and have unrealistic expectations. Instead of putting them 
              down, they need to be guided and encouraged to find the path toward 
              their aspirations, he said.</p>
              <p>The speakers targeted education as one key way to help young Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Desmond Lee and Jimmy Lee commended the current education system for 
              moving in the right direction, but the latter also urged for more active
               steps to get youth talking offline about issues like politics.</p>
              <p>35-year-old Jeffrey Lim from the Singapore Democratic Alliance and Nicole Seah from the National Solidarity Party, 24, wanted to see more emphasis on critical thinking.</p>
              <p>Added Seah, one of the youngest candidates in this year's GE, young 
              Singaporeans are craving a sense of "rootedness" to the country that 
              they grew up in.</p>
              <p>"As we have developed fully as an economy, what we are looking ahead 
              to is the next step, not so much as to pull back on economic growth, but
               really, to look at what more can we do to ensure we have a heart for 
              every single area of society and to ensure that nobody gets left 
              behind," she said.</p>
              <p>"This is the kind of security that young Singaporeans are looking out
               for and this is something that will continue to keep them loyal, keep 
              them rooted (to Singapore)."</p>
