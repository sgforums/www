              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>Singapore: An electrician has been sentenced to jail and caning 
              for stealing a rifle from a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) specialist 
              cadet trainee at Pasir Laba Camp.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mohammad Ridzuan Jamari, 31, was sentenced to a jail term of five years and three months, as well as three strokes of the cane.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He pleaded guilty to one count of theft and another count of drug consumption.  <br><br>Mohammad Ridzuan, who is diagnosed with schizophrenia, committed the offences on May 8 this year.<br><br>He
               was deployed to work at a construction site in Pasir Laba Camp, where 
              about 100 specialist cadets were on Standard Obstacle Course training 
              nearby.<br><br>Mohammad Ridzuan ran beside 22-year-old Mr Kang Tai, as he was running alone towards the finish line.<br><br>Mohammad Ridzuan, who was holding a 25-cm long screwdriver, grabbed his shoulder and shouted at him. <br><br>Both men struggled but Mohammad Ridzuan managed to snatch the rifle from Mr Kang. <br><br>He held onto the rifle for two seconds before it was taken away by Mr Kang's platoon commander.<br><br>Mohammad Ridzuan was arrested later.<br><br>Investigations revealed that he had also taken drugs at the army camp.<br><br>In
               an earlier mitigation plea, Mohammad Ridzuan was said to be "very 
              confused" at the time of the incident and had imagined that there were 
              attackers.<br><br>His lawyer, Mr K Mathialahan, pointed out that he had no intention of harming anyone, and did not know how to use a rifle.<br><br>The
               court also heard that Mohammad Ridzuan's schizophrenia was "causal to 
              the offence" and that he would not have committed the offence if he was 
              not suffering from the illness.<br><br>District Judge Lim Keng Yeow acknowledged that Mohammad Ridzuan's mental health issues had a significant impact on his actions. <br><br>He
               said Mohammad Ridzuan had grabbed the rifle "out of a mixture of 
              confusion and desperation" in order to "get help and to ward off his 
              imagined attackers".<br><br>He added that while Mohammad Ridzuan did 
              seize the rifle forcibly and held on to it momentarily, it was not his 
              main intention to possess it.<br><br>The judge said there were no indications that Mohammad Ridzuan had entered the camp with plans to commit the offence.<br><br>The court also heard that there was "little likelihood" that he had planned to flee with the rifle.<br><br>- CNA/lp</span></span></p>
