              <p>SINGAPORE : More people have sought help for gambling—related issues since the casino at Resorts World Sentosa opened in February.</p>
              <p>Figures provided by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) show that callers to its helpline have more than doubled in the last two months, compared to when the helpline opened last October.</p>
              <p>An advertisement by the NCPG highlights the troubles that can arise, when a gambler crosses the line between entertainment and addiction.</p>
              <p>And it seems that people have grown more aware of this distinction, since the casino at Resorts World Sentosa opened in February.</p>
              <p>The helpline run by the NCPG saw 450 calls in February, and 520 in March.</p>
              <p>This compared to a monthly average of 200 calls between October and January.</p>
              <p>Many of the callers seek help for what they see as a gambling problem in their family member or friend, but the NCPG also sees a number of problem gamblers coming forward. The helpline number is 1800—6—668—668.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, the NCPG told reporters that the cases have also become more complex.</p>
              <p>Mildred Tan, chairperson, Public Communications Subcommittee, National Council on Problem Gambling, said: "Typically, in the past, they would just ask us questions such as ’where can I seek help, how would I know a person is a problem gambler’. Now there is a lot more sharing on the lines.</p>
              <p>"It could even go into social issues such as ’the person has left the family, and we do not know where the person is, and he is running away because loansharks are after him, and the children are sick’. You can see the dysfunctional issues appearing in the family."</p>
              <p>The NCPG said that some callers may also seek help on how to manage their debts. The 24—hour hotline is run by the National Addictions Management Service of the Institute of Mental Health. It is manned by 12 counsellors, who are fully trained. Apart from directing callers to other sources of information and help, the NCPG said counsellors will also try to meet the caller in person.</p>
              <p>The NCPG said it keeps track of the calls to its helpline to ensure there is a proper follow—up after the initial call is made. It added that a number of these calls eventually translates into exclusion orders being issued.</p>
              <p>Forty—nine Family Exclusion Orders have been issued since applications opened a year ago, with the bulk of them in the last two months — with 16 in February and 14 in March.</p>
              <p>The same period has also seen a spike in those applying to bar themselves from the casino.</p>
              <p>The NCPG has received 567 applications for self—exclusion orders since applications began in November 2009. About four in five applications were received in the last two months alone — with 191 in February and 218 in March.</p>
              <p>Among the Family Exclusion Orders issued, 23 out of 49 of the respondents earned a monthly income of S$2,000 or below. About one in four worked in sales and services.</p>
              <p>With the casino at Marina Bay Sands due to open on April 27, more are expected to seek help.</p>
              <p>NCPG said it is working with operators to ensure safeguards against problem gambling are implemented effectively.</p>
              <p>Among other rules, the casinos are required to impose a S$100 daily entry levy for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents. These gamers can also only use cash to exchange for chips.</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan said the NCPG recently reviewed the safeguards at Resorts World Sentosa and said that while the integrated resort has been "forthcoming in embracing these social safeguards", the Council found that informational posters on problem gambling could be made more prominent.</p>
              <p>She said: "Even little things like where to place the help cards. The help cards were initially placed where you pay the S$100. Now they have extended it to put it in the bathroom for example, so that nobody knows (if a person is) picking up a help card or things like that."</p>
              <p>She added that Resorts World Sentosa has since made the necessary changes, and that NCPG is in "constant and on—going dialogue" with Marina Bay Sands on implementing the social safeguards.</p>
              <p>In a statement to MediaCorp, Resorts World Sentosa said that in March alone, 17 excluded individuals tried their luck at entering the casino, but there are measures to stop them from succeeding.</p>
              <p>It added that so far, none of its patrons have made use of its counselling service, but notes that "this is typical for counselling services provided by casino operators, as it takes time for the programme to gain momentum".</p>
              <p>Neither have patrons made use of its voluntary loss—limit system, in which they can declare beforehand the maximum amount they are willing to lose. — CNA/il/ms</p>
