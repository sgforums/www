              <p>SAN JOSE MINE, Chile—With the whole world watching, miners trapped 
              deep underground for 69 days began rising to the surface in a red, white
               and blue rescue capsule dubbed "The Phoenix."</p>
              <p>Florencio Ávalos, a 31-year old father of two, was the first of 33 
              miners to be rescued after having endured longer underground than any 
              mine accident survivors to date.</p>
              <p>Mr. Ávalos emerged above ground just after midnight on Wednesday 
              Chile time as rescuers cheered. He was greeted by family members and 
              government officials as he made his way into a triage area where he 
              would undergo an initial check-up.</p>
              <p>Mario Sepulveda, the chatty "presenter" who acted as host for video 
              recordings the miners had made underground, was the second miner brought
               to the surface.</p>
              <p>After emerging from the capsule, Mr. Sepulveda, gave a bear hug to 
              all of the dignitaries present, including President Sebastián Piñera and
               the First Lady. Mr. Sepulveda grabbed stones collected from the mine's 
              belly and handed them out with a big smile to a laughing Mr. Piñera and 
              Mining Minister Laurence Golborne.</p>
              <p>Third out of the pod was Juan Illanes, who hugged President Piñera.</p>
              <p>The rescue operation was set to continue through the day Wednesday. 
              Before Mr. Ávalos' emergence, a rescuer worker, Manuel Gonzalez, had 
              ridden down into the bottom of the mine. Spectral images from a camera 
              showed him embracing the miners. It was the first direct contact they 
              had had with another person since the Aug. 5 cave-in. Mr. Piñera told 
              Mr. Gonzalez before his departure, "may God be with you, the Chilean 
              people are with you. Bring back the miners with you."</p>
              <p>Earlier in the night, rescuers lowered the unmanned 14-foot capsule 
              some 200 feet, while engineers made last-minute adjustments to systems 
              to enable communication between the miners and the surface during their 
              trips. On a second unmanned test run, rescuers descended the capsule the
               full length of the shaft.</p>
              <p>The government had previously revealed the order in which the men 
              will be extracted from the mine, where they have already endured longer 
              than any previous mine accident survivors. The first men were chosen 
              because they were thought to have the physical and mental attributes to 
              work out any bugs that might emerge in the capsule.</p>
              <p>At Camp Hope, the sprawling tent city the miners' relatives 
              established after the Aug. 5 cave-in, family members anxiously counted 
              the minutes for the rescue to begin its final phase.</p>
              <p>"My heart is beating fast and it feels like it's about to explode," 
              said Priscilla Ávalos, who has been traveling to the mine every weekend 
              to be closer to her brothers Renan and Florencio Ávalos.</p>
              <p>Fabiola Acuna, wife of miner Claudio Acuna, was digesting the news 
              that her husband had drawn No. 26 in the miner extraction lottery. "The 
              wait will even be longer," she sighed. Health Minister Jaime Mañalich 
              said that several miners had offered to be the last man out of the mine,
               but that distinction would fall to the shift foreman, Luis Urzua, whose
               leadership skills have been widely praised.</p>
              <p>Down below, the miners made final preparations of their own.</p>
              <p>"The mountain began to creak in the morning, but in the afternoon it 
              stopped creaking," miner Dario Segovia wrote in a letter his brother 
              provided to the Santiago newspaper La Tercera Tuesday. "We prayed. All 
              of us are uneasy about the size of the rocks."</p>
              <p>The operation bears risks. After a drill finished boring a 
              28-inch-wide hole into the chamber where the miners are located early 
              Saturday, engineers decided to install steel casing in only the top 315 
              feet of the 2,050-foot shaft. They are counting on the rest of the hole 
              being smooth and sound enough to serve as a safe conduit for escape.</p>
              <p>"If a fragment of rock was to wedge the capsule to the wall of the 
              hole, the [miners] would have their work ahead of them to free the 
              capsule," said Louis King, managing director of Australian Mine Rescue 
              Consultants, which isn't involved in the rescue effort. "I don't think 
              it is time to celebrate just yet."</p>
              <p>A spirit of solidarity has bloomed in the Atacama Desert, the barren 
              wasteland where the mine is located, since the cave-in. Volunteers from 
              nearby towns came to cook and baby-sit for the families of miners who 
              were camping above the mine. Local mining companies brought drills to 
              San Jose and began sending probes deep into the earth to look for the 
              chamber where the men were holed up—or find their corpses. A probe 
              finally made contact after 17 days, when the miners were down to the 
              last two cans of the tuna that had sustained them through the ordeal. 
              "Life is hard here, there are earthquakes and accidents," said Macarena 
              Valdes, a 30-year-old topographer who helped direct the positioning of 
              the drills in the rescue effort "People have to work together."</p>
              <p>After the miners were found, their cause ceased to be simply Chilean.
               Schoolchildren in St. Paul, Minn., and Fredricktown, Pa., sent letters 
              of support to the miners' families. Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder 
              celebrated them on his Twitter account: "Viva chile! 33 miners are 
              alive!"</p>
              <p>Town leaders and industrialists from Nice, France, 
              shipped half a ton of protein bars to the mine, thinking the men might 
              need nourishment. English soccer legend Bobby Charlton, himself the son 
              of a miner, invited the miners on an all-expenses paid trip to see the 
              Manchester United Football Club play. A website collected thousands of 
              messages of support from throughout the Spanish speaking world.</p>
              <p>"Miners are working-class heroes in the best of times, but in worst 
              of times everyone can relate to taking a job where there are high risks 
              but really no choice," said Harley Shaiken, a specialist on Latin 
              America and labor at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
