              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A government-wide push to get civil servants to be 
              more revenue and cost conscious has fizzled out after about a decade. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Today has learnt 
              that the Net Economic Value (NEV) framework, which was gradually 
              implemented among ministries and statutory boards since 2000, has been 
              scrapped. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Under the framework,
               which is equivalent to the private sector's Economic Value Added 
              accounting, the public agencies were encouraged to raise annually their 
              NEV, which is defined as the revenue minus the operating and capital 
              costs. <br><br>Senior civil servants told Today that while the framework
               discourages overspending, there was concern that the emphasis on 
              revenue and cost would compromise the delivery of public services.<br><br>One
               of them, who works in a statutory board, noted that the NEV framework 
              may skew spending on public infrastructure, for instance, to become 
              "overly conservative", even if it tends to help control costs and 
              discourage overspending on items such as office equipment and manpower. <br><br>"Watching
               financials is a good thing, but if it is overzealous, it can swing the 
              other way - causing under-spending which in turn may lead to the public 
              good not being achieved," the civil servant said.<br><br>Another civil 
              servant noted that the NEV framework may have been unsuitable for 
              certain ministries, such as the Ministry of Community Development, Youth
               and Sports (MCYS). He said: "Say, you hire another 10 probation 
              officers and you rehabilitate the delinquents, how do you measure the 
              value to that?" <br><br>According to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the 
              head agency which implemented the NEV framework, it was dropped in the 
              2011 Financial Year. <br><br>An MOF spokesman said: "We have since 
              evolved our approach in recognising that the effectiveness of the public
               sector is not just about financial/economic value but the 
              whole-of-government outcomes that it delivers to the public."<br><br>Nevertheless,
               the spokesman noted that the use of NEV accounting incentivised public 
              agencies to improve on how well they utilise their available resources 
              or assets, and has resulted in "several improvements", for instance the 
              better utilisation of land leading to parcels freed up for other uses.<br><br>MOF
               said that public agencies are now instead asked to monitor outcomes 
              from services that are delivered to the public, and adopt various 
              initiatives that enhance efficiency and optimise resources, such as the 
              Manpower Management and Office Space Management frameworks.<br><br></span><strong>Looking long term</strong><span><br><br>Pointing
               out that a weakness of the NEV framework is its narrow and short-term 
              focus, Chua Chu Kang GRC Member of Parliament Zaqy Mohamad, who sits on 
              the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and 
              Industry, felt that scrapping the NEV framework sends a signal to the 
              civil service to be "more holistic in the way they work â€¦ (and) gives 
              the government the flexibility to do longer range projects", such as 
              growing Singapore's native population. <br><br>Singapore Management 
              University finance professor Annie Koh pointed out the difficulty in 
              measuring outcomes using the NEV approach, especially in today's "highly
               uncertain climate". <br><br>The NEV framework might also lead to silos and non-collaboration between different agencies, she said.<br><br>Citing
               how civil servants worked across ministries and agencies to craft the 
              Jobs Credit scheme during the financial crisis between 2008 and 2009, 
              Prof Koh added: "If everything has to be justified by NEV measures, we 
              will not have been able to ride out that stormy period quite so 
              successfully." <br><br>National University of Singapore corporate 
              governance expert Mak Yuen Teen pointed out that an improved NEV for an 
              agency does not necessarily lead to higher efficiency.<br><br>"If there 
              are no checks and balances, it is very easy for the public sector to 
              increase revenue even if costs increase, whereas in the private sector, 
              that would not be so easy because of competition," said the associate 
              professor.<br><br>Nevertheless, the experts noted that the NEV concept could still serve a purpose in some areas. <br><br>For
               instance, Prof Mak agreed that NEV incentivised more efficient use of 
              land. "If you don't have NEV - you have land and you are not charged for
               it, you can just sit on it and nobody uses it. But on the other hand, 
              you also worry that they will just increase revenue by charging people 
              even more," he said.<br><br>Prof Koh cited the determining of investment
               proposals: "If a hospital is trying to decide whether to invest in a 
              specific new equipment - then measuring if economic value will be 
              created in buying such a piece of equipment is fairly defined." <br><br>NEV or not, a senior civil servant working in a ministry reiterated that he and his colleagues "think beyond monetary value".<br><br>He
               said: "Sometimes returns are not immediate, it may be about long-term 
              change in behaviour ... sometimes you have to pump in a lot of resources
               for a little bit of gain, but the gain means a lot to the people you 
              are serving, I would like to think that all civil servants behave that 
              way."<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
