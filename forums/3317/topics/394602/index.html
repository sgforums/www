              <p>SINGAPORE : Police are investigating the case of a China national found dead in a private swimming pool at Sentosa Cove on Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>24—year—old Li Hong Yan was discovered floating face down in the pool. No injuries were found on her body.</p>
              <p>It is believed that she met the house—owner at a nightspot where she worked.</p>
              <p>Before that, the victim worked shifts at an Indian restaurant at Jalan Besar, before quitting after the Lunar New Year.</p>
              <p>She had stayed in quarters above the restaurant. Her former co—workers said she was shy, and could not speak English well.</p>
              <p>With no family in Singapore, it was left to her former boss to collect her body from the morgue on Thursday morning.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans should united together and stand firm by each other despite being polite and courteous towards foreigners, but we should never be EMOTIONAL towards foreigners! That would be one of the biggest mistakes that you can make for your future generations!</p>

              <p><strong>Woman was part-time hostess</strong></p>
              <p>THE woman whose body was found in the lap pool of a Sentosa Cove 
              bungalow on Wednesday was moonlighting as a part-time karaoke hostess in
               a number of KTV lounges in Havelock Road.</p>
              <p>Chinese national Li Hong Yan, 24, whose day job was as a 
              catering supervisor in an Indian restaurant, had told her employer that 
              she was going back to China on Feb 6 for the Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>She had not said when she would return, and her work permit 
              still identifies her as an employee of the restaurant in Jalan Besar, 
              said her employer, who refused to be named.</p>
              <p>Late on Tuesday, she is said to have left Las Vegas De' 
              Palace Lounge with Mr Adrian Chua Boon Chye, 39. They were believed to 
              have gone to a Boat Quay pub before heading to his bungalow in the 
              exclusive residential estate of Sentosa Cove, where she spent the night.</p>
              <p>The next morning, his maid found her naked body floating in 
              the pool behind the three-storey house. There were no apparent physical 
              injuries on her and she is believed to have drowned.</p>
              <p>Mr Chua is the founder and chief executive of Roundhill 
              Capital, a real-estate investment advisory firm registered here under 
              his Sentosa Cove address.</p>

              <p><br>Don't add your nonsense upon what I have posted, it is not what I meant no matter how much you tried to relate your nonsense closely to me.</p>
              <p>If you have met and known many PRCs, and they tell you that China will be powerful in the future and soon all your Singaporean children will grow up learning Chinese as your first language and laugh at your future and tried to put you down so that they can look down on your kind because they think they are first-class chinese and you're just a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>How would that made you feel?</p>
              <p>I can understand if you're just one of the many Singaporean guys out there who loves PRC girls. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And there's nothing wrong in standing up for what you have decided to love.</p>

              <p><br> What do you think PRCs would say if it is Singaporean Girl found
              dead in China(any part of China)?</p>
              <p>Do you think they will say "Pitiful" or anything even close to
              the meaning of that word?</p>
              <p>No wonder PRCs are looking down on Singaporeans cos we are such
              a NAIVE and such a CAREBEAR group of people.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should united together and stand firm by each other
              despite being polite and courteous towards foreigners, but we
              should never be EMOTIONAL towards foreigners! That would be one of
              the biggest mistakes that you can make for your future
              generations!</p>
              <p>Please wake up Singaporeans! Before your national anthem has a
              Chinese version specially meant for those PRCs immigrants.</p>
