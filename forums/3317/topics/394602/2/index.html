              <p>I heard from my parents that our national pledge used to be using chinese to say daily in school (Due to Chinese School nature in 1960s). Nowadays, in some chinese temples on National Day celebration, they also use Chinese to say out the pledge "æˆ‘ä»¬æ˜¯æ–°åŠ å�¡å…¬æ°‘ï¼Œ.....". Does that mean that such things use chinese also meant for the PRC? Yes -- our national anthem is sing in Malay and not English / Chinese / Tamil.</p>

              <p><strong>Family didn't know her jobs</strong></p>
              <p>SHE came to Singapore to provide for a better life for her family 
              but, instead, her naked body was found in the pool of a Sentosa Cove 
              bungalow on March 24.</p>
              <p>Ms Li Hong Yan, 24, had come from China and was working two jobs - as
               a part-time karaoke hostess, and as a catering supervisor in an Indian 
              restaurant.</p>
              <p>But her family members, who arrived here last Wednesday, 
              told The Sunday Times they knew nothing about this. They were at her 
              funeral wake in Sin Ming Drive yesterday.</p>
              <p>'She told us she was going to be a hairdresser here and earn
               money to give her parents a better life. I found out about the two jobs
               from the papers, but her parents can't read,' said a relative, Madam 
              Fang Shi Hui, 56, who works in an insurance company in China.</p>
              <p>Ms Li's parents, Mr Li Kui You, 58, and Madam Sun Jing Fang,
               49, are farmers and the family have had to sell their plot of farmland 
              as well as borrow money from relatives to make the trip here to claim 
              her body.</p>
              <p>They were too distraught to speak yesterday, only sitting 
              with their heads in their hands and weeping silently. The couple had 
              collapsed earlier, when they were taken to the morgue to see Ms Li's 
              body.</p>
