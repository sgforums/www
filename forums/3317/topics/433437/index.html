              <p>A MOTHER of six is suing the anaesthetist who was in attendance at the Caesarian birth of her last child in 2006.</p>
              <p>Ms Joanne Tong, 39, charges that as Dr Gordon Yau was negligent while
               inserting a breathing tube down her airway ahead of the Caesarian, he 
              'erred in his duty of care' and 'overstrained and/or injured her neck 
              during the procedure'.</p>
              <p>Ms Tong, a former lawyer and the former chairman of the People's 
              Action Party's Women's Wing, claims she continues to suffer severe pain 
              in the neck and back, numbness in her hands and feet, and often loses 
              her balance.</p>
              <p>She also said she is now unable to drive her children around
               or help them in their schoolwork because she cannot sit up for long.</p>
              <p>She is seeking damages.</p>
              <p>The trial is slated to begin in the High Court on July 27, 
              with Ms Tong represented by lawyers Melanie Ho, Chang Man Phing and 
              Yuwen Teo-McDonnell from WongPartnership.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A mother of six has taken an anaesthetist who 
              attended to her during the Caesarian birth of her last child in 2006 to 
              court for allegedly causing her neck injuries.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mdm Joanne Tong Seok
               May, 40, claims that Dr Gordon Yau Hok Man had "overstrained and/or 
              injured her neck" while he was inserting a breathing tube down her 
              airway in the process of administering general anaesthesia.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>As a result, she has
               been suffering from severe pain in the neck and back, pins and needles 
              in her hands and feet, and chronic headaches, claims the former lawyer. <br><br>Dr
               Yau is denying all allegations and said in court documents that he had 
              not flexed, extended and/or tilted Mdm Tong's head while performing the 
              procedure.<br><br>Mdm Tong, who is now an English tutor, said she now 
              suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder with a major depressive 
              disorder and has to take more than 20 pills a day because of the 
              ailments.<br><br>Mdm Tong, represented by Ms Melanie Ho, is seeking 
              unspecified damages. Besides alleging Dr Yau carried out the intubation 
              improperly, Mdm Tong claims he had fallen "appallingly short of 
              acceptable standards in his practice of medicine" because he had 
              allegedly failed to adequately assess her physical condition before 
              carrying out the procedure.<br><br>Dr Yau, who is in private practice at
               Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, is also alleged not to have sought and 
              obtained Mdm Tong's consent for general anaesthesia, and nor did he 
              explain the nature and risks of the procedure.<br><br>But Dr Yau 
              contended that it was the "usual and standard practice" for Mdm Tong's 
              gynaecologist, with whom he had been working with for some years, to 
              advise patients accordingly. He argued further the tube was successfully
               inserted in one attempt without any difficulty.<br><br>His lawyer, Mr 
              Lek Siang Pheng, noted Mdm Tong had also signed a consent form 
              indicating that the nature, risks and alternatives of anaesthesia had 
              been explained to her.<br><br>Mdm Tong's account was that she was 
              unaware the consent form was for procedures other than the Caesarian 
              section and that she had not read it before signing.<br><br>Among the 
              nine witnesses that Dr Yau will call include a private investigator, who
               conducted surveillance on Mdm Tong and found that she was able to 
              engage in normal activities.<br><br>When the hearing began on Thursday, 
              Mr Lek grilled Mdm Tong as to whether her gynaecologist had already 
              discussed with her about the anaesthesia procedures, thus making it 
              unnecessary for his client to repeat the same.<br><br>Mdm Tong denied 
              this, saying they only spoke generally about anaesthesia being necessary
               for Caesarian births, but did not delve into the type of anaesthesia.<br><br>She
               added that she felt Dr Yau was the best person to explain and advise 
              her about the risks because it was his area of expertise but he had not 
              done so.<br><br>The hearing, scheduled for 19 days, continues on Monday.</span></span></p>
