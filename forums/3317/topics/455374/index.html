              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government has completed a review of the mandatory death penalty for all its laws.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>On Monday, 
              Parliament was given an update of the review in relation to laws related
               to drug offences and certain types of homicides.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In a ministerial 
              statement in the House, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister 
              Teo Chee Hean said that all executions that have come due since the 
              review started in July 2011, have been deferred.<br><br>And he explained
               that the review reaffirmed the relevance of the death penalty for all 
              the offences to which it currently applied.<br><br>Mr Teo said: "The 
              death penalty has been an important part of our criminal justice system 
              for a very long time, similar to the position in a number of other 
              countries. <br><br>"Singaporeans understand that the death penalty has 
              been an effective deterrent and an appropriate punishment for very 
              serious offences, and largely support it. As part of our penal 
              framework, it has contributed to keeping crime and the drug situation 
              under control."<br><br>For drug traffickers, Mr Teo said that the review
               concluded that the mandatory death penalty should continue to apply in 
              most circumstances. <br><br>However, where two specific, tightly-defined
               conditions are met, Mr Teo said the death penalty will still apply but 
              it will now be at the discretion of the courts. <br><br>These conditions
               are: firstly, the trafficker must have only played the role of courier,
               and must not have been involved in any other activity related to the 
              supply or distribution of drugs; secondly, discretion will only apply if
               having satisfied the first requirement, either the trafficker has 
              cooperated with the Central Narcotics Bureau in a substantive way, or he
               has a mental disability which substantially impairs his appreciation of
               the gravity of the act.<br><br>Mr Teo said that the government proposes
               to change the law such that when these conditions are met, the courts 
              will have the discretion either to sentence the trafficker to death, or 
              alternatively to pass a sentence of life imprisonment with caning.<br><br>Under
               Singapore's laws, anyone who trafficks drugs is liable for the death 
              penalty - from syndicate leaders, to distributors, to couriers who  
              transport drugs, and pushers who sell drugs - as long as the quantity of
               drugs involved is above the stipulated thresholds.<br><br>Mr Teo noted 
              that the weight element is often misunderstood. He said the mandatory 
              death penalty threshold for heroin is 15 grammes of pure diamorphine, 
              which is often portrayed as the weight of a few 50-cent coins. <br><br>But
               in street form in Singapore, at a typical purity level of 2.3%, 15 
              grammes of pure diamorphine is equivalent to some 2,200 straws of heroin
               worth S$66,000, based on each straw having a gross weight of about 
              0.3gm and street price of about S$30. <br><br>DPM Teo warned that this 
              quantity was enough to feed the addiction of more than 300 abusers for a
               week. In such cases, the death penalty is imposed, given the harm 
              caused by these drug traffickers and the numbers of lives they destroy.<br><br>He
               said: "The government's duty is first and foremost to provide a safe 
              and secure living environment for Singaporeans to bring up their 
              families. We must be constantly vigilant, adapt our law enforcement 
              strategies and deterrence and punishment regime to remain ahead of 
              criminals. <br><br>"We must do what works for us, to achieve our 
              objective of a safe and secure Singapore. The changes announced today 
              will sharpen our tools and introduce more calibration into the legal 
              framework against drug trafficking, and put our system on a stronger 
              footing for the future."<br><br>Concluding, Mr Teo said the government 
              will monitor how the changes impact and influence the behaviour of the 
              criminal organisations. If the situation worsens, it will consider 
              tightening the provisions or making other changes.<br><br>On homicide 
              offences, Parliament was also informed that the review of the mandatory 
              death penalty showed that Singapore should retain the death penalty in 
              its penal laws, except for certain types of homicides where it should no
               longer be mandatory but be at the discretion of the courts.<br><br>Law 
              Minister K Shanmugam explained that the mandatory death penalty will 
              continue to apply to the most serious form of murder, intentional 
              killing. <br><br>Mr Shanmugam warned that offenders who intended to 
              cause the death of their victims ought to be punished with the most 
              severe penalty, and the law ought to provide the most powerful deterrent
               against such offences.<br><br>However, he explained that other 
              categories of murder could be committed with different degrees of intent
               and under a variety of situations that may not deserve the death 
              penalty.<br><br>In such cases, the courts should be given the discretion to order either life imprisonment or the death penalty.<br><br>"This
               change will ensure that our sentencing framework properly balances the 
              various objectives: justice to the victim, justice to society, justice 
              to the accused, and mercy in appropriate cases," Mr Shanmugam said. 
              "This is a matter of judgement and the approach being taken is not 
              without risks, but we believe this is a step we can take."<br><br>The 
              minister explained that the changes were a right step to take as 
              Singapore society becomes safer, less violent and more mature, citing 
              the nation's relatively low incidence of homicides, with 16 recorded 
              homicides, or about 0.3 per 100,000 population, in 2011.<br><br>Mr 
              Shanmugam told Parliament that once legislation has been put in place, 
              all accused persons who meet the requirements can elect to be considered
               for re-sentencing under the new law. <br><br>This will include accused 
              persons in ongoing cases, as well as convicted persons who have already 
              exhausted their appeals and are currently awaiting execution.<br><br>"While
               we have outlined the principle of the changes today, those giving legal
               advice to the accused persons should carefully study the legislation 
              when it is enacted and properly understand the precise scope of the 
              changes. In the meantime, they should not make any assumptions or give 
              misleading advice," Mr Shanmugam said.<br><br>The minister also told 
              Parliament that for firearms offences, the government's conclusion is 
              that such offences are a serious threat against law and order, against 
              which the country must continue to maintain a highly deterrent posture. <br><br>The mandatory death penalty will therefore also continue to apply to firearms offences.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam stressed that in making the changes, the government seeks to achieve and balance two broad objectives.<br><br>The first is to continue taking a strong stance on crime. <br><br>"Where
               many other countries have failed, Singapore has succeeded in keeping 
              the drug menace under control. Singapore's homicide rate is one of the 
              lowest in the world, and we believe that the deterrent effect of the 
              death penalty has played an important part in this. Our tough approach 
              to crime has resulted in crime rates which are significantly lower than 
              many other major cities," he said.<br><br>"Young children can take 
              public transport by themselves. Women can move around the city freely. 
              We have no gun violence, no protection rackets, no drug pushers on the 
              streets, no inner-city ghettoes. Citizens and visitors alike feel safe, 
              in and out of home, at all hours of the day. This is something enjoyed 
              by few cities in the world. This is something we should seek to 
              preserve."<br><br>The second is the refinement of Singapore's approach towards sentencing offenders.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam warned that Singapore's cardinal objectives remain the same 
              and crime must be deterred and society must be protected against 
              criminals. <br><br>"Justice can be tempered with mercy and, where appropriate, offenders should be given a second chance," he said.<br><br>"How
               these objectives are achieved and balanced depend on the values and 
              expectations of society, as it evolves and matures. We believe the 
              proposed changes strike the right balance for Singapore today. They will
               seek to ensure that our criminal justice system continues to provide 
              the framework for a safe and secure Singapore, while meeting the need 
              for fairness and justice in each case."<br><br>There are 35 persons 
              awaiting capital punishment; 28 are for drug offences and seven for 
              murder. Draft legislation implementing the changes outlined will be 
              introduced later this year.<br><br>- CNA/wm/ir</span></span></p>

              Singapore Plans to Exempt More Criminals From Death Penalty
              
              Singapore, which imposes the death penalty for serious crimes including murder and drug trafficking, said it plans to exempt more cases from the mandatory sentence.
              
              While the nation will uphold the death penalty for those who manufacture and traffic drugs, the punishment will no longer be mandatory for all those caught carrying drugs exceeding certain amounts, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said in parliament today. Courts will have the discretion to either sentence the offender to death or life imprisonment with caning if the accused is only a courier and has cooperated with authorities or has a mental disability, he said.
              
              â€œThese provisions retain the strong deterrence posture of our capital punishment regime while providing for a more calibrated sentencing framework when specific conditions are met,â€� Teo said. The proposed changes will provide a framework for accused persons to assist the state in targeting those who play â€œa more significant role in drug syndicates,â€� he said.
              
              Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes. Still, the city state has been criticized by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International for maintaining the death penalty even as more than two-thirds of countries worldwide have abolished it in law or in practice.
              
              The death penalty will still apply for â€œintentionalâ€� murders, while courts will have the discretion to impose life imprisonment in less severe crimes, Law Minister K. Shanmugam said. The seriousness of the crime, personal culpability and deterrence will be considered, he said.
              Second Chance
              
              Intentional killing is still considered â€œone of the most serious offenses,â€� and the state reserves the right to punish offenders with the most severe penalty, Shanmugam said. When the crime isnâ€™t intentional, the courts will have the discretion to impose either the death penalty or life imprisonment.
              
              â€œJustice can be tempered with mercy and where appropriate, offenders should be given a second chance,â€� he said. â€œThe approach being taken is not without risks, but it is a step we can take.â€�
              
              Draft legislation outlining the changes will be proposed later this year, Shanmugam said.
              â€™First Stepâ€™
              
              The proposal is an important first step toward consistency with universal standards of human rights, Braema Mathi, president of Singapore-based human rights organization Maruah, said in a statement today. The mandatory death penalty is â€œfundamentally troubling, and it continues to be applied to a substantial number of criminal offences,â€� Mathi said.
              
              In a 2004 statement, the ministry of home affairs said the country executed 110 people for drugs-related offenses and 28 for murder and arms-related offenses over five years.
              
              There are currently 35 prisoners awaiting capital punishment, 28 for drug offenses and seven for murder, Teo said.
              
              â€œThere will be an appropriate process where they will be given the opportunity to be considered whether or not the new sentencing regime can be applied to them,â€� he said.
              
              There has been a â€œprogressive reduction in the use of the death penalty in Singapore,â€� Amnesty International said in a statement in May.
              
              Recent cases that have put the death penalty in the spotlight include Yong Vui Kong, a Malaysian who was sentenced with execution for smuggling 47 grams (1.7 ounces) of heroin to Singapore, and last year lost a bid at the cityâ€™s highest court for a presidential review of his sentence. An online petition appealing for clemency garnered more than 41,000 signatures.
              
              In 2005, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong dismissed Australiaâ€™s calls to commute the death sentence for Australian drug smuggler Nguyen Tuong Van.
              
              A book on the cityâ€™s death penalty resulted in a contempt of court charge for British author Alan Shadrake. His book, â€œOnce a Jolly Hangman: Singaporeâ€™s Justice in the Dock,â€� suggests that the government â€œsuccumbs to political and economic pressuresâ€� in meting out the death penalty, the Attorney-Generalâ€™s Chambers said in court papers. Shadrake was convicted and sentenced to jail.

              <p><strong>Criminal lawyers, human rights groups welcome death penalty review</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Two human rights groups and the Association of 
              Criminal Lawyers have welcomed the announcement by the Singapore 
              government that the death penalty will no longer be mandatory in certain
               limited circumstances. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Association of 
              Criminal Lawyers called the move a significant milestone in Singapore's 
              legal history. Its president, Subhas Anandan, said death row inmates 
              deserve punishment but not all deserve death.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But human rights 
              group MARUAH said it regrets the "narrow scope of this move", and that 
              it is "troubled" that the mandatory death penalty will continue to be 
              maintained for offences such as intentional murder, kidnapping, firearms
               offences and drug trafficking where the conditions spelt out by the 
              government are not met. <br><br>In its submission to the United Nations 
              Human Rights Council for the Universal Periodic Review of Singapore in 
              2011, MARUAH has highlighted that the mandatory death penalty 
              fundamentally conflicts with international human rights norms. <br><br>So
               MARUAH said it is glad at this "first step towards consistency with 
              universal standards of human rights", but it called on the Singapore 
              government to do much more.  <br><br>In a statement, MARUAH president 
              Braema Mathi said: "We applaud the Singapore government for taking this 
              important first step. But this is only a small step in the right 
              direction, as the mandatory death penalty is fundamentally troubling, 
              and it continues to be applied to a substantial number of criminal 
              offences."<br><br>In a phone interview with Channel NewsAsia, she 
              described the review of the mandatory death penalty as a move towards 
              "greater enlightenment".<br><br>"That is really bravo. That is really 
              moving towards a greater enlightenment by the government. This has been 
              too harsh and too long for too many. I still think the death penalty as a
               tool needs to be discussed thoroughly by the public. It has to be a 
              proper dialogue with the public to fully understand and comprehend 
              whether it is really the best deterrent that we can have to really stamp
               out drug trafficking or to reduce drug addiction?" said Ms Braema 
              Mathi. <br><br>Meanwhile, human rights group Amnesty International wants to see the mandatory death sentence abolished unconditionally.<br><br>In
               a statement to Channel NewsAsia, a spokesperson from the group said 
              mandatory death sentences prevent judges from exercising their 
              discretion and from considering all extenuating circumstances in a case.<br><br>It
               added international human rights law prohibits mandatory death 
              sentences as "they have been found to constitute arbitrary deprivation 
              of life and cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment".<br><br>"Many courts and judicial bodies around the world have ruled mandatory death sentencing as unconstitutional", it said.<br><br>The group cited the case of Malaysian drug trafficker Yong Vui Kong, who was 19 years old when he was arrested.<br><br>"Yong
               Vui Kong's case has attracted international attention and concern from 
              the diplomatic community. Amnesty International and the Anti Death 
              Penalty Asia Network (ADPAN) join local groups in Malaysia and Singapore
               in calling for the Singaporean government to commute Yong Vui Kong's 
              sentence."<br><br>The group acknowledged the impact of violent crimes on
               society and families but added "there is no evidence to demonstrate 
              that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than other 
              punishments".<br> <br>The government announced on Monday that it will 
              change the law such that the mandatory death penalty will not be applied
               in two types of cases: firstly, where a drug trafficker only played the
               role of a courier, and the trafficker had substantively cooperated with
               the police or had a mental disability; and secondly, where there is a 
              homicide but there was no intention to kill. <br><br>In these cases, the
               courts may either impose the death penalty or sentence the convicted 
              person to life imprisonment with caning.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>MPs raise questions on proposed changes to death penalty</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: After numerous reviews in recent years, the Singapore government is finally tweaking the death penalty laws.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking in 
              Parliament on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean mooted lifting
               the death penalty for drug couriers under certain conditions.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Firstly, they must 
              have only played the role of courier and not been involved in the supply
               or distribution of drugs. Secondly, they would need to have cooperated 
              with the Central Narcotics Bureau in a substantive way or demonstrated 
              mental disability.<br><br>In such cases, the courts will have the discretion to now impose a life sentence instead of sending traffickers to the gallows.<br><br>Nine Members of Parliament raised supplementary questions on the proposed changes to the death penalty framework in Singapore.<br><br>Several
               asked about the level of cooperation needed from the accused drug 
              trafficker to be exempted from the mandatory death penalty.<br><br>Christopher
               De Souza, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, asked: "How much cooperation 
              must be given? I certainly hope that a high level of cooperation is 
              needed and required by the courts and by the amendments, such that we 
              can go upstream with the information collected through that cooperation 
              and go to the people who run these rackets outside of Singapore."<br><br>Alvin
               Yeo, MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC, said: "I'm also slightly troubled by the
               remark that cooperation needs to lead to concrete outcomes. As DPM has 
              rightly observed, the many drug cartels are very difficult to penetrate 
              the high levels. And indeed, the lower down the hierarchy the courier 
              is, the less likely he is to have information that will lead directly to
               the ringleaders. Are we in some danger of setting too high a barrier?"<br><br>In
               reply, Mr Teo said: "On the cooperation element, we believe that it 
              will help us, give us an extra set of tools, to reach higher up into the
               drug syndicates. <br><br>"It's going to be very difficult. I'm not sure
               that we will succeed, but it gives us an extra set of tools to 
              encourage the couriers in this case, to assist us, to dismantle drug 
              syndicates, or to arrest or prosecute members of the syndicates. And 
              I've described a substantive cooperation in those terms. We'll have to 
              define the precise way of having this enacted in the law as we go 
              ahead."<br><br>Workers' Party Secretary-General and MP for Aljunied GRC,
               Low Thia Khiang, asked if there is a need for a mandatory death 
              sentence.<br><br>"Why can't we leave it to the court to decide and to 
              impose appropriate sentence, rather than mandatory sentence, especially 
              death penalty. And if mandatory death penalty is an important deterrent,
               how does non-mandatory, compared to mandatory, have more deterrence? If
               the court imposes death sentence under certain circumstances, is it not
               deterrent enough?"<br><br>Mr Teo replied: "The mandatory death sentence
               provides on conviction a very certain and severe punishment. And it has
               been a very strong deterrent.<br>In the case of the mandatory death 
              penalty for drug trafficking, we can see that drug traffickers, and 
              others involved in the supply chain, are deliberately, where they can, 
              opting to come below the threshold levels for the mandatory death 
              penalty. <br><br>"So it clearly has an impact on behaviour. Hence the 
              changes we are making are carefully calibrated to maintain the strong 
              deterrent value of the mandatory death sentence, while providing for the
               courts to have discretion in certain specific, tightly-defined 
              situations." <br><br>Sylvia Lim, MP for Aljunied GRC, said: "An 
              overriding concern is that, while we look at the death penalty itself, 
              it should not be looked at in isolation of the criminal procedure as a 
              whole. Because the sentence finally comes out at the end of that 
              process. And I think all of us are interested to ensure that we don't 
              convict the wrong person!"<br><br>Law Minister, Mr K Shanmugam, said: 
              "We work with the Bar, and with the judges to make sure we have a system
               that doesn't fall into either extremely liberal such that prosecution 
              becomes a game of catch-me-if-you-can with a series of procedural 
              hurdles which have no real substantive value, or another system where 
              even innocent people can be convicted.<br><br>"We want the cases to be 
              proven beyond reasonable doubt, in a fair and proper way. All 
              suggestions to make the process more rigorous would always be welcome. 
              My ministry as well as Home Affairs would be willing to listen to any 
              suggestions in that context. Ultimately the test is: does it improve the
               system?"<br><br>NMP Faizah Jamal said: "Very often, most of these 
              couriers are very young, and probably driven by hard circumstances. 
              While I understand the primary objective is always for the society, my 
              concern is that in the course of the long period of time when they are 
              in remand or in prison, change happens. I wonder if that can be taken 
              into account. People change, and there could be real remorse, and this 
              can be attested to by authorities."<br><br>Replying, Mr Shanmugam said: 
              "I think if we focus on any one individual, a powerful case can 
              emotionally be made out for saving a life. For saving lives, powerful 
              cases can always be made out. It is more difficult if you want to 
              balance that against the reality.<br><br>"15g of heroin is 300 people 
              using that for a week. Somebody who peddles that, and usually they 
              peddle much more than that, will bring ruin, possibly death, or at least
               a life of ruin, to a large number of people. <br><br>"Let's say, instead of 15g it is 100g, you work it out for yourself, how many thousands of people (are ruined).<br><br>"What
               is never in the headlines is the number of lives that have been lost; 
              the number of children who are orphaned either literally or through 
              their parents being in jail; the amount of sadness and impact on the 
              social fabric of society that those who are on the ground see every day.<br><br>"The
               headlines never focus on the victims of crime. If you look at it - the 
              number of people who are impacted and how tough you need to be to try 
              and save the society as a whole, then you need to send out a clear and 
              consistent message. <br><br>"And the clear and consistent message is 
              that if you deal in drugs in a quantity that is enough to support 300 
              people or more, then you face the death penalty. It's never an easy 
              debate. It's not because we like the death penalty, it's not because we 
              think it ought to be imposed for no reason. It's not because we want to 
              simply, be tough.<br><br>"It's because imposed with the duty of ensuring
               the safety and security of every single Singaporean who goes out on the
               streets, we feel there's no choice but to have this framework. And that
               is a conversation we ought to continue to have."<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>lifting the death penalty subject to certain conditions is, in any perspective, applaudable than a fixed regime of death punishment. But to completely lift it would have disastrous impact on our society and may easily turn singapore into a lively drug trafficking hub..</p>
              <p>humanity is to be balanced with stern punishments and a chance to reprieve...this is a good move to transform inflexibility due to insecurities or lack of confidence to a more open legal system to face with greater confidence against the great evils of human nature and society...</p>
