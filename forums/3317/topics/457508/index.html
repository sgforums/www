              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The High Court is set to hear whether a section of 
              the law which criminalises gay sex is unconstitutional. This follows a 
              ruling by the Court of Appeal on Tuesday on a bid by Tan Eng Hong to 
              have Section 377A of the Penal Code declared unconstitutional.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This section of the law states that a man who commits any act of gross indecency with another man shall be punished.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Tuesday's ruling 
              overturns an earlier High Court decision, which had upheld the move by 
              the assistant registrar to strike out the application.<br><br>Tan was arrested for having oral sex with another man at a public toilet in CityLink Mall on March 9, 2010.<br><br>He
               applied to have 377A of the Penal Code declared unconstitutional for, 
              among other things, violating his right to personal liberty.<br><br>The 
              charge against Tan was changed to a different section of the Penal Code -
               Section 294(a) - on October 15, 2010, to state that he had committed an
               obscene act in a public place.<br><br>Tan, and his partner, subsequently pleaded guilty to the amended charge. Each was fined S$3,000.<br><br>However,
               in the midst of the case, and before Tan and his partner pleaded 
              guilty, the Attorney-General moved to strike out Tan's application to 
              have 377A declared unconstitutional.<br><br>On December 7, 2010, the 
              assistant registrar struck out Tan's case on the grounds that it was, 
              among other things, an abuse of court process.<br><br>Tan appealed to 
              the High Court but the appeal was dismissed as the judge ruled that 
              there was no real controversy to be decided. This stemmed from the fact 
              that Tan had already pleaded guilty to and was convicted of a different 
              charge.<br><br>Tan then took his case to the Court of Appeal, which 
              disagreed with the High Court ruling. It ruled that Tan has a right to 
              apply to pursue the constitutional challenge.<br><br>The Court of 
              Appeal, presided by Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, Judge of Appeal V K 
              Rajah and Justice Judith Prakash, said in a 106-page judgement that they
               found an arguable case on the constitutionality of Section 377A that 
              ought to be heard in the High Court.<br><br>They explained that Tan was 
              at the outset arrested, investigated, detained and charged exclusively 
              under Section 377A. This, they said, squarely raises the issue as to 
              whether Tan's initial detention and prosecution were in accordance with 
              the law.<br><br>Secondly, there is a real and credible threat of prosecution under Section 377A.<br><br>Based
               on these two points, the judges said there is a real controversy to be 
              decided. They said Tan will be allowed to vindicate his rights before 
              the courts based on a finding that there is an arguable violation of his
               constitutional rights.<br><br>"The principle of access to justice calls for nothing less," the judges said in their document.<br><br>The
               judges also wanted to acknowledge that Section 377A in its current form
               extends to private consensual sexual conduct between adult males, 
              adding that "this provision affects the lives of a not insignificant 
              portion of our community in a very real and intimate way."<br><br>"The 
              constitutionality or otherwise of Section 377A is thus of real public 
              interest. We also note that Section 377A has other effects beyond 
              criminal sanctions," the judges said.<br><br>Tan's lawyer, M Ravi, told Channel NewsAsia that his client will be pursuing his case.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>Read carefully. He was charged under Section 377A initially and that's what he was challenging. He accepted the other charge that you think he's contesting.</p>

              <p>s377A.. sandwiched between sex with  the dead and animals. lol</p>
              <p>If I am not mistaken, Singapore like MY are not parties to the UN Convention for Political and Civil Rights. That itself should be an indicator on how the executive will react to the challenge.</p>
              <p>But the mere fact for the first time a constitutional challenge is allowed, albeit a few have all failed in previous years.. *remembed the hudud ban? - challenge failed. Ban reasons -to promite racial and religious harmony "</p>
              <p>Looking at the entire context, from Minster of Law's statements, PM Lee, the Judicial reasoning to the parliament and ultimately executive zeal, to repeal or void will have far wider impact to the entire political climate of Sg not to mention other civil liberty groups.</p>
              <p>The consequences needs to be fully explored. If say, Courts rules unconstitutional, it's still a long way from being repealed or voided. Is that a low level political gamble ? If so, again the repecussions by other civil liberty rights groups on other issues ? But the successful challenges itself will open up to more constitutional challenges.</p>
              <p>Pandora's Box will surely be opened.</p>
              <p>Anyways, it will be an interesting development that will have significant impact on how Sg will be governed in the next decade.</p>
