              <p>LONDON (AFP) - – People who get less than six hours sleep per night 
              have an increased risk of dying prematurely, researchers said on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Those who slumbered for less than that amount of time were 12 percent
               more likely to die early, though researchers also found a link between 
              sleeping more than nine hours and premature death.</p>
              <p>"If you sleep little, you can develop diabetes, obesity, 
              hypertension and high cholesterol," Francesco Cappuccio, who led 
              research on the subject at Britain's University of Warwick, told AFP.</p>
              <p>The study, conducted with the Federico II University in Naples, 
              Italy, aggregated decade-long studies from around the world involving 
              more than 1.3 million people and found "unequivocal evidence of the 
              direct link" between lack of sleep and premature death.</p>
              <p>"We think that the relation between little sleep and illness is due 
              to a series of hormonal and metabolical mechanisms," Cappuccio said.</p>
              <p>The findings of the study were published in the Sleep journal.</p>
              <p>Cappuccio believes the duration of sleep is a public health issue 
              and should be considered as a behavioural risk factor by doctors.</p>
              <p>"Society pushes us to sleep less and less," Cappuccio said, adding 
              that about 20 percent of the population in the United States and Britain
               sleeps less than five hours.</p>
              <p>Sleeping less than six hours is "more common amongst full-time 
              workers, suggesting that it may be due to societal pressures for longer 
              working hours and more shift work"</p>
              <p>The study also found a link between sleeping more than nine hours 
              per night and premature death, but Cappuccio said oversleeping is more 
              likely to be an effect of illness, rather than a cause.</p>
              <p>"Doctors never ask how much one sleeps, but that could be an 
              indicator that something is wrong," said Cappuccio, who heads the Sleep,
               Health and Society Programme at the University of Warwick.</p>
              <p>Research showed no adverse effects for those sleeping between six 
              and eight hours per day.</p>

              <p>Researchers report that sleep deprivation can double the chances of 
              dying from a cardiovascular event. However, too much sleep appears to be
               even more dangerous for us, more than doubling the likelihood of dying 
              from other causes. In a research project headed by Professor Francesco 
              Cappuccio from the University of Warwick's Medical School, researchers 
              from the University of Warwick and the University College London 
              collected data on 10,308 civil servants sleeping habits and mortality 
              rates between the years 1985 to 2004. The project's disturbing results 
              were recently published in the journal SLEEP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The recommended amount of sleep for an adult person is 7 hours per night,
               and routinely sleeping less might be risky. In the research project, 
              data regarding civil servants sleeping habits was collected between the 
              years 1985-8 and 1992-3; the civil servants mortality rates were then 
              checked in 2004. Other factors like age, BMI (body mass index), smoking 
              habits, physical condition, etc. were all taken into consideration. The 
              results showed that the mortality rate of people whose sleeping period 
              decreased from 7 hours a night in the years 1985-8 to 5 hours a night 
              (or less) in the years 1992-3, was 1.7 times higher than the mortality 
              rate of the people who had continued sleeping the recommended 7 hours 
              per night. Cardiovascular problems were the most common cause of death 
              in those persons who had slept less than 7 hours a night. </p>
              <p>It is well known that modern society encourages people to sleep less,
               and many people do not get enough sleep. This latest study has proven 
              there is a connection between insufficient sleep and high mortality 
              rates. </p>
              <p>However, the scientists also found that sleeping more than 7 hours a 
              night may also be bad for us. Among the civil servants who increased 
              their nightly sleeping period from 7 hours per night to 8 hours per 
              night or more, the overall mortality rate more than doubled! In this 
              case, cardiovascular problems did not seem to be the main cause of 
              death. The scientist are still trying to establish what lies behind 
              these findings, and what is the true reason for these high mortality 
              rates in well-rested people. In any case, based on these results, it 
              seems clear that sleeping too much is also not recommended. </p>
              <p>The Warwick research project produced interesting and potentially 
              important findings regarding the connection between sleeping habits and 
              mortality rates. Although there is much work to be done in this field, 
              we might all need to start considering our sleeping habits more 
              carefully.</p>
