              <p><strong>Chinese waitress walks free after killing official</strong></p>
              <p class="first">BEIJING (AFP) - - A Chinese waitress convicted of
              killing an official who demanded sex walked free from court Tuesday,
              after a nationwide Internet campaign hailed her as a heroine for
              standing up to government sleaze.</p>
              <p>In a case that sparked widespread outrage, Deng Yujiao, 21, was put
              on trial for stabbing to death a local official in central China in
              May, in what she said was self-defence after he tried to force himself
              on her sexually.</p>
              <p>Deng, a waitress at a hotel in the city of
              Badong, was initially detained on suspicion of murder after the
              incident, in which she said the man hit her repeatedly after she
              refused his advances.</p>
              <p>She also stood accused of injuring a second
              official who had made unwanted sexual advances, according to the state
              Xinhua news agency.</p>
              <p>Deng was eventually charged with the lesser
              offence of intentional assault -- still punishable by death, according
              to the China Daily -- as officials caved in to the massive public
              pressure generated on the Internet.</p>
              <p>Internet users fed up with
              government corruption, abuse of power and official impunity quickly
              rallied to Deng's cause, and her case became a symbol of injustice in a
              society tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party.</p>
              <p>On
              Tuesday, after a brief trial in Badong in Hubei province, Deng walked
              free despite being found guilty as charged, on the grounds of
              diminished responsibility, a judge at the court who asked not to be
              named told AFP.</p>
              <p>The judge said the court had decided not to
              punish her as she had used excessive force in an act of self-defence,
              she had surrendered to the police, and the officials involved in the
              incident had made a "major mistake."</p>
              <p>The case highlights the
              growing might of the Internet in China, a nation where traditional
              media is tightly controlled and the legal system has little or no
              independence from the government.</p>
              <p>China has the world's largest online population at nearly 300 million web users.</p>
              <p>Reflecting
              the huge public interest in the case, at least 500 supporters of Deng
              gathered at the courthouse, Luo Jiajiu, one of the organisers of the
              rally, told AFP, adding the group had been banned from attending the
              trial.</p>
              <p>Luo had said Deng's supporters would call for action if
              the court announced she was guilty, but AFP was unable to contact him
              again after the verdict was announced.</p>
              <p>Chinese Internet users
              were divided in their immediate reaction to the verdict, with some
              saying justice had been served and others complaining that Deng had
              been convicted of any crime.</p>
              <p>"This is a victory for the people, a victory for justice," said one post on popular web portal sina.com.</p>
              <p>Another,
              written by someone in northern China, said: "What was the evidence of
              guilt? She is not guilty, what she did was 100 percent self-defence."</p>
              <p>Zhang
              Tianyong, a Beijing-based human rights lawyer, said the court would not
              have freed Deng had the case not attracted so much attention and
              generated so much pressure.</p>
              <p>"The impact of the strong online public opinion on this case is obvious and easy to see," Zhang told AFP.</p>
              <p>"If she had not had the attention of public opinion, Deng Yujiao would most probably have been given a heavy penalty."</p>
              <p>The
              China Daily, in a report published Tuesday before the trial began, had
              speculated that Deng could get a suspended sentence of less than 10
              years.</p>
