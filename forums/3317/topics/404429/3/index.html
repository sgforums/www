              <p>i just want to made an observation base on my experience as
              a panel member to qualify students for semester
              abroad in London. (not from SG of course)</p>
              <p>We make sure that selected students are sound and can be
              successful in their semester abroad and able to "complete" the
              program.</p>
              <p>That include mental maturity that they can take care
              of "themselve"  for very clear reason there is
              no evaluation from the University to evaluate candidates but
              simply have Money will Travel..... this particular students
              fail in many aspect that include maturity...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>How did you evaluate this maturity? Do you ask the student to write essays, or related where he or she has travelled alone? Shit still happens to even the most savvy travellers, although in this instance one of the most basic rules of solo travel was broken.</p>
              <p>For NTU at least, you need to satisfy a minimum grade point average (for more popular places the selected students have much better grades) and write a passage to justify your selection and outline your objectives. The university also gives briefings before departure about insurance, safety, health matters, accomodation and what-not.</p>
              <p>I can't say what else they could've done for me because I did pretty fine on my own.</p>

              <p>As you mention....Substained Grade point average, Essay and interviews. Character evaluation feedback from peers and professors  get as much information as possible from the applicants. </p>
              <p>it is also institution interest that students succeed in this program and characters growth from the experiences and so that returning students to help promote program.</p>

              <p><strong>S'porean gang-raped in HK</strong></p>
              <p>A SINGAPOREAN undergraduate was gang-raped last month while on an 
              exchange programme in Hong Kong, Hong Kong newspaper Sing Tao Daily 
              reported on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The Hong Kong police have arrested a man in connection with the 
              crime, and are looking for two others who are believed to have been 
              involved.</p>
              <p>The woman, 22, had gone alone to a bar in Lan Kwai Fong, an area in 
              the Central district with many bars and restaurants, and had become 
              drunk.</p>
              <p>Three Nepalese men who worked in the bar - two of whom are believed 
              to be brothers - approached her and invited her to a party on a yacht.</p>
              <p>She accepted their invitation, and they took her to a yacht in the 
              Causeway Bay area, where they took turns to rape her, for a total of six
               times. The men had left by the time she woke up the following morning. 
              She made a police report, and was taken to hospital for an examination.</p>
              <p>Police in Hong Kong have classified the case as rape, the newspaper 
              said. Police identified the three men, after visiting the bar and the 
              yacht and reviewing the bar's closed-circuit television footage, and 
              arrested one of the men near Lan Kwai Fong.</p>

              <p>We don't know which university she came from so it's hard to say if she went there alone. Even within an academic setting I think it's nigh-on impossible for faculty to judge  how savvy a student is. At most they can report the student's commitment to work, but even hardworking students have to have fun sometimes, right?</p>
              <p>About your point in red, both the academic and cultural aspects of the exchange are equally important, and it goes <em>both</em> ways. I've seen people go abroad to travel and attend lectures without talking to the locals and their new classmates too. What's the point in that?</p>
              <p>I know I'm digressing... just getting things off my chest.</p>

              <p><br>Do not mistaken the individual responsibilities vs University responsibilities in ensuring success of their "Accademic Semester abroad Program" vs "Social Semester abroad Program"</p>
              <p>Similar to your airlines example does airlines allow "intoxicate individual" to board the plane</p>
              <p>I am questioning did the University done enough evaluation to ensure students success in their future ? That is why They are called "Students" Paid tuition fees. <strong><em>They send someone who obversely not ready to be alone.  The university APPROVED the "Application"</em></strong></p>
              <p>Singaporean need to start asking what are they getting for their "Education" </p>
