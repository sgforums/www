              <p>Singapore lambasted Washington Tuesday for what it said were 
              numerous "inaccuracies" in a damning human trafficking report, while 
              tentatively welcoming the city-state's removal from a watchlist.</p>
              <p>The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, 
              released Monday, elevated Singapore's ranking to Tier 2, which means 
              that while it does not fully meet standards on human trafficking, it is 
              making efforts to do so.</p>
              <p>This effectively removed Singapore from a group of countries put on the human trafficking watchlist.</p>
              <p>"We note the change to Singapore's tier ranking... but we are 
              dismayed to find the US TIP report riddled with inaccuracies in the 
              section on Singapore," the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"Such a casual approach to the facts is troubling."</p>
              <p>The ministry took exception to the US report about forced labour on 
              fishing vessels originating from Singapore, which it said was "untrue 
              and unverified."</p>
              <p>It urged the United States to "thoroughly investigate the 'reports' 
              before faulting us for not pursuing our 'phantom' ships," the ministry 
              said.</p>
              <p>Singapore also took the United States to task for saying that 
              trafficking victims were not afforded the opportunity to avail 
              themselves of medical and other services at shelters over the past year.</p>
              <p>"We are puzzled by this statement," the ministry said, adding it had
               given the US details of the assistance it extended to trafficking 
              victims.</p>
              <p>"While we can acknowledge that much remains to be done in our fight 
              against trafficking, we are disappointed that the United States chose to
               blatantly dismiss the facts and suggest that we are not doing our 
              share," it said.</p>
              <p>Singapore said the US had "again unabashedly" given itself the top 
              Tier 1 ranking despite inadequacies in its own approach to human 
              trafficking.</p>
              <p>It cited a New York Times report which said that teenage girls 
              coerced into prostitution in the US are treated not as trafficking 
              victims but as "miscreants who are arrested and prosecuted, instead of 
              protected."</p>
              <p>"As is well known, the United States also suffers from serious 
              problems with illegal immigrants, many of whom are trafficked by 
              well-organised criminal gangs which seem to be able to operate with 
              impunity," the ministry said.</p>
              <p>"On any objective criteria, the United States has a more serious TIP problem compared with Singapore."</p>
