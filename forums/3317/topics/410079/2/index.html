              <p>It's not as if there are no jobs for Singaporeans. If that were true, there will not be foreigners looking for jobs here. The fact is that foreigners with the right skills for the jobs available will depress salaries for Singaporeans doing the same job. It just means that you will have to accept a lower salary and a lower standard of living unless you can move into high value occupations.Remember that these foreigners are able to accept a lower salary, live in Singapore and still send money home. Of course the cost of living for their families in their home country is lower than that in Singapore. But if you cannot but have to compete at the same level with these foreigners, then you should consider sending your family to live in Johore or Indonesia.</p>
              <p>In any case, through the foreign workers' levy (employers have to pay that to the government, making foreigners more expensive to hire than locals), Singaporean workers are already one leg ahead of foreigners.

So in this case, we are costing more... although the pay (instant cash you are getting) is the same, as compared to the foreigner.</p>

              <p>do we even need 1 million floortraps and peearse? you mean 1/4 junk picked from anywhere are better than 4 million or 3 millioin declining sgreans?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>our cost labor really is not low. its because they bnever moderate and continouos allow floor traps and pee arse to come in and take root.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i don;t mind you pay miilions to one foreign talent who is talkent and iswilling to be a permanent resident but if you dangle 1 sgd just to make things cheapo the sure lots of housflies from floor traps and pee arse will flock here causing society instability crimes conjestion, depreciate our properties, our dollar and our jobs.</p>

              <p>Zero crime rate = You can retrench the firing squad</p>

              <p>Retaining the firing squad to do nothing = Economy will be affected.</p>

              <p>Do you know what was the hourly rate for your stupid fast-food restaurant? Did you compared the previous rate with the current one? Do you know why there was an adjustment in the previous rate?</p>
              <p>You may compare the previous starting rate for retail jobs against the current rates if you are not too lazy.</p>
              <p>Even your current job position also have your own difference in rates. What are the differences in rates if you were to be employed a few years back compared to being employed now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can tell you, the kind of minimum wage scheme in your stupid imagination is going to kill yourself.</p>
              <p>Because employers will pay you minimum wage according to the stupid law that your "professor" has recommended, and why do you think it will boost job morale and productivity when everyone will be paid the same minimum wage in the same job, regardless of how talented, qualified, hard-working, you have worked for the company?</p>
              <p>Will you be motivated to increase productivity??</p>
