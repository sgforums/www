              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has asked Singaporeans 
              to view problems such as overcrowding in trains and increasing property 
              prices in perspective, and remember those who are less fortunate. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Goh was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a community event 
              on Saturday held in conjunction with the Muslim fasting month. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Ramadan-on-Wheels is an annual event that aims to help the needy. It is organised by the Malay Youth Literary Association. </span></p>
              <p><span>This year, over 200 beneficiaries who have been given S$200 Giant 
              Hypermarket shopping vouchers each, headed off with volunteers to shop 
              for their daily groceries.
              <br> <br> All that would not have been possible without supporters.
              <br> <br> And it's this thoughtfulness that Mr Goh hopes to see in Singaporeans, 
              even as the country deals with challenges which have accompanied the 
              country's success.
              <br> <br> "It's important for those who are facing problems of success - like 
              inadequate car parks and housing at the top end - to think of those who 
              are struggling to make a living everyday. There are many people who are 
              not able to benefit from our overall success. So just remember that, as 
              we also try to solve our own problems at the top end," urged SM Goh. 
              <br> <br> Ramadan-on-Wheels has reached out to more than 1,200 disadvantaged families since it started in 2001. </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually the problem lies with the charity organisations. <br><br>You donate $10.... About $8 goes for marketing and $2 goes to the needy.... I have seen many charity organisations hiring teenagers to pull donators for donations... particularly Ang Mo Kio Central... <br><br>On average, those students earn like $2 commission from selling the $10 donation ticket... Marketing and printing of those lovely donation Thank You ticket and staff costs take up about $6 and $2 to the needy..<br><br>Personally I dont donate to such charities.... They are using "Charity" as a means to get the donations, but arent helping the needy to much extent. <br></p></div>

              <p>Those coin cans is CIP programme lah.... Those students can donate... They are doing it for CCA points... But as to where the money goes, remains another question again. <br><br>What I hate is those buggers... Can I have a minute with you.... Would you like to donate "BLA BLA Charity Organisation".... Try to sweetalk with you... Those people are really doing evil by earning money over the needy.</p>

              <p>Really, I think foreigners were initially brought into Singapore to do the jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have high dreams of themselves and often over-estimate their own abilities.</p>
              <p>Looking at the mindset and attitude in this forum, it is a clear fact that many Singaporeans simply do not possess the drive and aptitude to succeed.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans have DREAMS of working for some big companies...yes, FOREVER WORKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE !!!</p>

              <p>Anyway, Singaporeans cannot do alot of jobs, take hardships........</p>
              <p>But that's normal because they grew up with spoons inside their mouths.....they need to be spoon-fed and simply cannot do housechores by themselves without exploiting the cheap labour of foreign maids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do we even employ foreign maids when we know that it is quite inhumane to shortchange them with such low wages?</p>
              <p>I know, because we're a society of cheap-skates.</p>

              <p>Really, I think foreigners were initially brought
              into Singapore to do the jobs that Singaporeans do not want to
              do.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have high dreams of themselves and often
              over-estimate their own abilities.</p>
              <p>Looking at the mindset and attitude in this forum, it is a clear
              fact that many Singaporeans simply do not possess the drive and
              aptitude to succeed.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans have DREAMS of working for some big
              companies...yes, FOREVER WORKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE !!!</p>
              <p>Can I laugh at such laughable dreams of Singaporeans? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, Singaporeans cannot do alot of jobs, take
              hardships........</p>
              <p>But that's normal because they grew up with spoons inside their
              mouths.....they need to be spoon-fed and simply cannot do
              housechores by themselves without exploiting the cheap labour of
              foreign maids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do we even employ foreign maids when we know that it is
              quite inhumane to shortchange them with such low wages?</p>
              <p>I know, because we're a society of cheap-skates.</p>
