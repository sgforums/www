              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SYDNEY: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says Singapore and 
              Australia can prosper, if they work together against the backdrop of an 
              increasingly challenging world.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Addressing business 
              leaders in Sydney, Mr Lee also spoke about the growing influence of 
              China and how Australia can play a part in ensuring a peaceful shift in 
              the global power balance.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>At Asia Society Australia, Mr Lee said it is increasingly difficult for governments to look 10 or 20 years into the future.<br><br>This
               is due to globalisation and technology, which have brought about rapid 
              change, and many countries are experiencing are social stresses over job
               security and a widening income gap.<br> <br>Mr Lee felt Asia is well-placed - thanks to China's growing influence.<br><br>He
               said a new balance will have to be struck with China's growth, not 
              based on exclusive spheres of influence, but an open regional order 
              where all major powers can participate peacefully and constructively.<br><br>Asian countries would then be able to live and grow in an orderly and secure environment.<br> <br>Mr
               Lee said: "I do have confidence that over the medium to long term, 
              China's trajectory will be upwards because the dynamism, the drive, the 
              determination to improve their lives and to create that affluence and 
              better future is palpable and pervades the whole society and I'm 
              convinced that China's success will be positive for the region and for 
              the world. But managing this strategic shift is going to be a critical 
              challenge for the international system. It's a major change and it's 
              taking place not so slowly and will need restraint and wisdom, both from
               China as well as other countries, especially the US."<br> <br>According
               to Mr Lee, as China's largest trading partner and a treaty ally of the 
              US, Australia can help ensure that this shift in strategic balance 
              occurs peacefully.<br><br>Mr Lee also called on Australia to deepen its 
              engagement with the rest of Asia, in spite of the challenges and risks 
              involved, such as territorial disputes.<br><br>He said: "ASEAN 
              integration is a work in progress, requiring patience and political will
               and we have territorial disputes too, in the South China Sea and also 
              in North East Asia, between China and Japan, between Korea and Japan, 
              between China and some of the ASEAN countries.  These disputes are 
              sharpened by prospect of oil and gas deposits,  but also made more 
              difficult by rising nationalist sentiments, at a politically sensitive 
              time. But overall outlook for Asia is positive."<br> <br>At a dialogue 
              session later in the day, when asked about Singapore's experience with 
              its two integrated resorts, given that Australians in Sydney are 
              debating the merits of a second casino, Mr Lee said concerns about its 
              impact on society remain, although there have been obvious benefits.<br> <br>"Having
               crossed the rubicon, it's not hard for us to say, you know if we are 
              going to have one, you might as well have two," commented Mr Lee. <br><br>"There
               is no further issue of principle and from the point of business, it's 
              quite good to have two in fact, the casinos are happy because then if 
              you don't have as much luck as you wish in one place, you go to the 
              other place."<br><br>"They came up at a good time, after the financial 
              crisis. Business-wise, they've done very well; revenue-wise, the 
              government has gained," said Mr Lee.<br> <br>"There's some offset 
              because our horse racing isn't as exciting as it used to be, people have
               gone to gamble in casinos instead but overall government revenue has 
              gone up."<br><br>"From an urban planning point of view, it's done a lot 
              for our skyline, the Marina Bay Sands with the three towers as well as 
              the sky pool is recognised all over the world, I think. That's a great 
              plus. It's helped our image enormously."<br> <br>About a quarter of visitors to Singapore's two integrated resorts are locals.<br><br>"So
               we are quite happy but we are still watching anxiously," commented Mr 
              Lee. "Because total amount of gambling is about the same but the 
              compulsive gambling, the very extreme cases, there seems to be a slight 
              trend up and we are hoping that things will stabilise, but it will take 
              time."<br> <br>When asked about how Singapore was tackling brain-drain, 
              Mr Lee felt it was natural in the course of globalisation as talents 
              will go where there is vibrancy and confidence in the future.<br><br>Mr Lee also mentioned the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings in his speech.<br><br>He
               said Indonesia has made progress in identifying, tracking down, 
              bringing to justice and punishing some of the terrorists, making 
              Indonesia and the region  safer.<br><br>But he warned that the terror threat still remains.<br><br>"It
               never completely disappears, (there are) splinter groups, radicalised 
              elements, self-radicalised individuals, people with crazy ideas," he 
              said. "There are always a few of them but it is enough to cause 
              trouble." <br> <br>Mr Lee wrapped up his visit to Australia, 
              underscoring the strong relations between the people of both countries. 
              There are some 50,000 Singaporeans living in Australia and about 20,000 
              Australians in Singapore. <br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
