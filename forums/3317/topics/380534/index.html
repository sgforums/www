              <p><strong>Some promising PAP candidates identified for next election: PM Lee</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said the People's
              Action Party (PAP) has identified some candidates, including potential
              office-holders, for the next General Election due by February 2012. </span></p>
              <p><span>They are mainly in their thirties and forties.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee, who is also the PAP's Secretary-General, was the main speaker at the party's convention on Sunday.
              <br> <br> He highlighted why Singapore's next General Election will be crucial,
              as it must produce leaders who can take over his generation of Cabinet
              colleagues.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "We have made progress, we have got people who will be
              part of this team, but we do not have a complete team and we must
              produce such a line up by the next General Elections - 2011 or 2012."
              <br> <br>By then, Mr Lee believes Singapore will have a new slate of leaders
              who can instil confidence among investors and Singaporeans and lead the
              country for the next 20 years .
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "We have kept clean, resolutely against corruption, in
              the Party in the society, in the government, at the grassroots. <br> <br> "If there is a case we will investigate; if a wrong has been done, we
              will act on it...If you do not keep the party clean, you are finished."
              <br> <br> The PAP brought in 24 new Members of Parliament during the last General Election.
              <br> <br> On the new candidates, Mr Lee said they grew up in the years of prosperity and did not experience turbulence and hardship.
              <br> <br> But he believes they are just as committed as the earlier generations of MPs.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "This leadership for Singapore can only come from the
              PAP, and if the PAP lets Singapore down, we are all in big trouble, not
              only PAP but (also) Singapore. Therefore, the PAP must never let
              Singapore down; (we must) make sure when we press the button, things
              work."
              <br> <br> He added that the new MPs have done well and have established themselves with voters.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee also told his audience of party activists that the new
              office-holders have made significant contributions as well, and have
              gained confidence in presenting and defending policies in Parliament
              and on the ground.
              <br> <br>Prime Minister Lee also reminded the party convention that
              Singapore will be amending the Constitution, which will result in more
              Non Constituency MPs, smaller Group Representation Constituencies and
              more Single Member Constituencies. That means there would be more
              contests in the next General Election. So Mr Lee's message to the party
              activists is: never assume that your division will get a walkover.
              <br> <br> Party activists asked questions about the selection process of candidates after Mr Lee's speech.
              <br> <br>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also Second Assistant
              Secretary-General of the PAP, said: "If you look at our party, we have
              got a successful blend between people who have come up from the ground
              and people who have come in from outside the party, and come in as MPs
              in the last elections; we have several who have come from the ground.
              <br> <br>"Lim Biow Chuan and Sam Tan were branch secretaries, so we have
              people who have come from the ground and who are able to hold their own
              in Parliament and represent the people.
              <br> <br>"But we also need to make sure that we bring in talented people
              from outside. We must be open to ideas and open to people. So long as
              they subscribe to our party ideals, our values and want to do well for
              Singapore and Singaporeans, we should be prepared to accept them.
              <br> <br>The PAP leaders stressed that the party's success formula is to
              ensure that it gets its politics right so that it can attract good
              people to enter politics. </span></p>
