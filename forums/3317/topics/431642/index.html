              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The line between work and personal life is fast 
              blurring, with increasing workplace connectivity and higher expectations
               from bosses keeping more workers connected to work at all times.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>According to Robert 
              Half's latest Workplace Survey, 69 per cent of Singapore employees tune 
              into work when they are out of the office or on holiday, higher than the
               regional average of 66 per cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Reasons cited by 
              Singapore respondents include the need to be available in case of an 
              emergency at work (66 per cent) and filtering through work emails to 
              ensure less stress when returning to the office (60 per cent), 
              suggesting rising work pressures.<br><br>The survey also noted a high level of employee dedication, or "workaholism".<br><br>Many
               claimed they preferred to stay on top of work issues even when on 
              holiday (45 per cent), believing they should be available at all times 
              as they are using a company mobile phone (29 per cent) or simply finding
               it impossible to "switch off" (25 per cent).<br><br>59 per cent of 
              respondents also cited technological advancements allowing access to 
              work information from anywhere in the world as a key reason.<br><br>Managing
               Director of Robert Half Singapore and Japan Tim Hird said the 
              phenomenon of 24/7 workplace access made possible by technological 
              advancements has led to hyper-connectivity and faster turnaround time, 
              which is undoubtedly an advantage for businesses in this competitive 
              world. <br><br>However, the pervasiveness of constant work connectivity 
              also result in the erosion of personal space, higher stress levels and 
              overall decline in the quality of life for employees.<br><br>He said 
              employers need to be realistic in their expectations to avoid 
              overloading their staff and negatively affecting employees' morale and 
              work productivity.<br><br>Indeed, the survey found a strong correlation 
              between employees' workplace connectivity and employers' expectations, 
              with a substantial 96 per cent of Singapore employers expecting 
              employees to be available or contactable while on leave or during 
              out-of-office hours, higher than the regional average of 83 per cent.<br><br>Fortunately,
               a sizeable 77 per cent said that they expect their staff to be 
              available or contactable only for emergencies, higher than the regional 
              average of 57 per cent.<br><br>This suggests that although expectations 
              are high, Singapore bosses are comparatively less unreasonable in their 
              demands than their regional counterparts.<br> <br>And the more senior 
              you are the greater the expectation for you to be available or 
              contactable while on leave or out of office hours.<br><br>In terms of 
              compensation for being available while on leave or during out-of-office 
              hours, employees in Singapore are most commonly offered time off in lieu
               (43 per cent) or overtime payment for additional hours worked (31 per 
              cent).<br><br>However, 39 per cent of workers are not compensated for 
              working outside of office hours, higher than the regional average of 33 
              per cent.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>Singaporeans are very efficient wage earners. That's all. It's a society which favours the educationally qualified. It's the opposite in Indonesia where I am. Qualifications get you nowhere. Brains do. The number of rags to riches stories here are amazingly endless.</p>
              <p>Poor chap going on to own a chain of restaurants, petrol stations, factories etc are nothing new and going on holidays while their workers slog it off ha. That's life.</p>
