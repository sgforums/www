              <p><strong>Lead poisoning scare spreads to central China</strong></p>
              <p class="first">BEIJING (AFP) - - Medical authorities in central China
              have discovered more than 1,300 cases of suspected lead poisoning in
              children, state media said Thursday, in the second such incident this
              month.</p>
              <p>Authorities in the city of Wugang in Hunan province have shut down a
              smelting plant and detained two of the company's executives on
              suspicion of "causing severe environmental pollution", the Xinhua news
              agency said.</p>
              <p>Locals had complained of large amounts of thick smoke and dust
              coming out of the Wugang Manganese Smelting Plant since it began
              operations in May last year, it said.</p>
              <p>A total of 1,354 children -- or about 70 percent of those under the
              age of 14 that lived in four villages near the smelter -- were found to
              have levels of lead in their blood that exceed safety standards, the
              report said.</p>
              <p>Seventeen of the most severely affected have been hospitalised.</p>
              <p>A primary school, a middle school and a kindergarten are located
              within a 500-metre (1,650-foot) radius of the plant, which was shut
              down last week, it added.</p>
              <p>Provincial medical teams were conducting secondary tests to confirm the initial results.</p>
              <p>So far, they have found 45 cases in which lead levels exceeded 200 milligrams per litre, it said.</p>
              <p>Lead
              levels of between zero and 100 milligrams are considered normal. A
              reading of more than 200 milligrams is considered hazardous, with
              children more vulnerable to lead poisoning which can harm the nervous
              system.</p>
              <p>The Wugang incident comes on the heels of another case in
              northern Shaanxi province, where more than 850 children have been
              affected by lead poisoning caused by pollution from a smelting plant,
              according to Xinhua.</p>
              <p>More than 170 children in Shaanxi's Changqing township were hospitalised, the agency said.</p>
              <p>On Monday, villagers stormed the Shaanxi smelter, smashing trucks in anger at the case. The plant has also been shut down.</p>
              <p>China's
              rapid industrialisation has led to widespread environmental damage over
              the last 30 years, with the nation boasting some of the world's worst
              water and air pollution.</p>

              <p>the commies don't give a shit about who or what they screw.. as long as they get a monetary profit...</p>
              <p>Mao did away with all religions and philosophies like Taoism and Confucianism.. morality and ethics went out the window...</p>
              <p>then Deng told them it was glorious to be rich...</p>
