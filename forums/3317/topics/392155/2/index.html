              <p><strong>Russia cancels tsunami warning</strong></p>
              <p><span>MOSCOW, Russia - Russia has cancelled a tsunami warning after the
              waves that hit the coast of its Pacific peninsula of Kamchatka proved
              too small for danger, the local emergency situations ministry said
              Sunday as quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency. </span></p>
              <p><span>"The wave's height was only 25 centimetres. There were no incidents linked to its approach," the officials said.
              <br> <br> Russia issued a tsunami warning after Saturday's massive earthquake in
              Chile and launched evacuation procedures in Kamchatka, expecting waves
              of up to two metres, the Sakhalin island tsunami centre's chief Tatyana
              Ivelskaya said earlier on Sunday.
              <br> <br>According to Kamchatka officials, some 100 employees of
              Severo-Kurilsk port and fish factory were evacuated, and residents of
              five houses that could be struck by a tsunami would be transported to
              safe areas.
              <br> <br>The 8.8-magnitude quake, which struck off the coast of Chile before
              dawn, killed more than 300 people and affected as many as two million
              as it left a trail of destruction through a swath of central Chile.
              <br> <br>One of the largest earthquakes on record, it sent tsunami waves
              crashing into coastal areas of the South American nation of 16 million
              people, and then roaring across the Pacific Ocean as far as New Zealand
              and Japan.

              <p><strong>First wave hits Japan</strong></p>
              <p>SENDAI (Japan) - MORE than 70,000 people fled vulnerable coastal
              areas of Japan on Sunday as a tsunami churned up by the huge earthquake
              in Chile slammed into the country's long Pacific coastline.</p>
              <p>'Please
              do not approach the coast at any cost,' Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama
              said in nationally televised comments as Japan, one of the world's most
              quake-prone nations, went on its first major tsunami alert in 15 years.</p>
              <p>The
              first tsunami wave, 30 centimetres (one foot) high, hit Nemuro on the
              northern island of Hokkaido in the early afternoon, the Meteorological
              Agency said.</p>
              <p>Far bigger waves of up to three
              metres (10 feet) could hit northern areas of Aomori, Iwate and Miyagi
              prefectures, south of Hokkaido, the agency said.</p>
              <p>PM
              Hatoyama urged extreme caution even as fears of destructive waves eased
              across the rest of the Pacific. 'We should not drop our guard,' the
              sombre-looking prime minister said. 'I would like people to take all
              possible measures.' The Meteorological Agency also issued warnings for
              waves of up to two metres along the entire Pacific coastline of the
              Japanese archipelago, from Hokkaido through to the southern island
              chain of Okinawa.</p>
              <p>Tsunami warnings flashed across
              all television channels as authorities rushed at least 70,000 people
              living on Japan's east coast to schools and other public facilities
              located on higher ground. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Tsunami races across world</strong></p>
              <p>HONOLULU - WITH a rapt world watching the drama unfold on live
              television, a tsunami raced across a quarter of the globe on Saturday
              and set off fears of a repeat of the carnage that caught the world off
              guard in Asia in 2004.</p>
              <p>The tsunami delivered
              nothing more than a glancing blow to the US and most of the Pacific,
              but Japan was still bracing for a direct hit and waves up to 10 feet
              high (3 metres). Scientists worried the giant wave could gain strength
              as it rounds the planet and consolidates, though the first wave to hit
              Japan's outlying island's was just 4 inches (10 centimeters) high.</p>
              <p>The
              tsunami was spawned by a ferocious magnitude-8.8 earthquake in Chile
              that sent waves barreling north across the Pacific at the speed of a
              jetliner. But Pacific islands had ample time to prepare because the
              quake struck several thousand miles away.</p>
              <p>By the
              time the tsunami hit Hawaii - a full 16 hours after the quake -
              officials had already spent the morning ringing emergency sirens,
              blaring warnings from airplanes and ordering residents to higher
              ground. The islands were back to paradise by the afternoon, but
              residents endured a severe disruption and scare earlier in the day:
              Picturesque beaches were desolate, million-dollar homes were evacuated,
              shops in Waikiki were shut down, and residents lined up There were no
              immediate reports of widespread damage, injuries or deaths in the US or
              in much of the Pacific, but a tsunami that swamped a village on an
              island off Chile killed at least five people and left 11 missing.</p>
              <p>Waves
              hit California, but barely registered amid stormy weather. A surfing
              contest outside San Diego went on as planned. Despite Internet rumors
              of significant problems in coastal areas of California, no injuries or
              major property damage occurred.</p>
              <p>The tsunami
              initially raised fears that the Pacific could fall victim to the type
              of killer waves that killed 230,000 people in the Indian Ocean in 2004
              the morning after Christmas. During that disaster, there was little to
              no warning and much confusion about the impending waves. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Wary Chileans sleep outside</strong></p>
              <p>CONCEPCION (Chile) - CHILEANS fearful of aftershocks camped outside
              on Sunday in towns shattered by a massive earthquake, as officials
              struggled to grasp the scale of the damage to the country's transport,
              energy and housing infrastructure.</p>
              <p>One of the
              world's most powerful earthquakes in a century hammered Chile early on
              Saturday, killing more than 300 people as it toppled buildings and
              triggered a tsunami that rushed across the Pacific toward Japan.</p>
              <p>While
              the apparently low death toll could be considered a lucky escape from
              such a strong temblor, the quake dealt a serious blow to infrastructure
              in the world's No. 1 copper producer and one of Latin America's most
              stable economies.</p>
              <p>A tsunami killed at least four
              people on Chile's Juan Fernandez islands and caused serious damage to
              the port town of Talcahuano. On the other side of the Pacific, Japanese
              officials warned residents to evacuate northern coastal areas as a
              tsunami with waves as high as three meters (10 feet) approached.
              Residents were also evacuated on Russia's Kuril islands after a warning
              over a potential two-meter-high wave.</p>
              <p>Two million
              people in Chile have been affected by the earthquake, said President
              Michelle Bachelet, adding that officials were still trying to evaluate
              the 'enormous quantity of damage.'</p>
              <p>The earthquake
              has raised a daunting first challenge for billionaire Sebastian Pinera,
              who was elected Chile's president in January in a shift to the
              political right and who takes office in two weeks. -- REUTERS</p>

              <p><strong>Philippines lifts tsunami alert</strong></p>
              <p>MANILA - THE Philippines on Sunday lifted a tsunami alert imposed
              in 19 Pacific-facing provinces after Chile's earthquake, allowing
              evacuees to return home as metre-high waves made little impact.</p>
              <p>The
              Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said thousands of
              residents who voluntarily evacuated their homes after the earthquake
              struck Chile on Saturday could return.</p>
              <p>'We are
              continuing our observation on our coastlines (but) the tsunami was not
              as high as expected,' the head of the institute, Mr Renato Solidum,
              told reporters. 'It was not significant. Our public officials and
              residents may now assume that there is no longer a tsunami threat.' In
              response to the alert about 10,000 people in the surfing resort of
              Siargao, in the Mindanao group of islands, moved to safer areas.</p>
              <p>In
              the province of Albay, on the main island of Luzon, authorities had
              advised over 47,000 families living along the coast to move about five
              kilometres (three miles) from the shore after the 8.8 magnitude quake.</p>
              <p>Some had moved on Sunday morning, although many others ignored the warnings and stayed home, officials said.</p>
              <p>The
              first waves reached the Philippines' eastern seaboard about 1pm (0500
              GMT) on Sunday and appeared to have subsided two hours later. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>World pledges aid to Chile</strong></p>
              <p>PARIS - THE United States, Europe and China vowed to come to Chile's
              aid as relief workers rushed to the western hemisphere's second
              enormous earthquake in seven weeks.</p>
              <p>But the
              Latin American country, reeling from the deaths of at least 300 people
              and a trail of destruction caused by Saturday's 8.8-magnitude quake,
              appealed for foreign donors to wait until the scale of the task is
              clear.</p>
              <p>'We are very grateful for people's good
              intentions but let's let the (Chilean) emergency office get its very
              specific report on what needs done,' Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez
              told reporters. Chile does not want 'aid from anywhere to be a
              distraction' from disaster relief, he said. 'Any aid that arrives
              without having been determined to be needed really helps very little.'</p>
              <p>The
              International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)
              said it had unlocked US$279,000 (S$392,000) from its emergency funds to
              help the relief efforts in Chile.</p>
              <p>UN chief Ban
              Ki Moon's office said he was 'very closely monitoring developments'
              including the risk of Pacific Basin tsunamis. A Pacific-wide tsunami
              alert was lifted, although Japan kept a lower-level alert in place,
              having evacuated 320,000 people.</p>
              <p>US President
              Barack Obama pledged to meet any request for help from Chile, while the
              European Union offered three million euros (S$5.6 million) in immediate

              <p>IT WAS their first night in Chile and the start of a five-month
              exchange programme at a university in the South American country.</p>
              <p>The
              six students from the Singapore Management University (SMU) were all
              asleep in a hostel in the Chilean capital Santiago when the first
              rumblings of a massive earthquake measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale
              began.</p>
              <p>One of them, Mr Mohamed Nazir, 23, a
              third-year accountancy student, was sleeping in the lower deck of a
              two-storey bunk bed when the rattling bed jerked him awake.</p>
              <p>'I thought the guy on the upper bunk was moving,' he said. 'Then I realised that the whole building was shaking.'</p>
              <p>Three other Singaporeans who were in his room were also jolted awake and they ran out of the building.</p>
              <p>Outside,
              the streets were packed with people in their pyjamas, said Mr Mohamed.
              There were shattered glass, fallen window panes and even an
              air-conditioner on the ground, he told The Straits Times on the phone
              on Sunday night. Some buildings had huge cracks running through them
              although they did not see anyone injured.</p>

              <p><strong>Chileans in Singapore relieved that relatives are safe</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Some 130 Chileans in Singapore had a sleepless
              weekend, frantically trying to contact family members after a massive
              earthquake struck Chile on Saturday. <br> <br> Their efforts were hampered by Chile's cut phone lines, making the wait
              to hear from family members and loved ones all the more agonising. <br> <br> The ambassador here has also indicated that she will be approaching the Singapore government for help in specific areas. <br> <br> A Singapore-based Chilean, Leyla Vasquez was in Hong Kong when the 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile. <br> <br> The 30-year-old journalist found out about the disaster when she turned on the television in her hotel room <br> <br> "When I saw the news, I saw the corner that my mum lives and it was all
              destroyed and I couldn't get through and my blood pressure was really
              down and I just wanted to know what was going on, so I called the
              ambassador and they were trying to help me find out if my family was
              right or not. My only thought, 'Oh My god I have no family anymore'." <br> <br> Thankfully for Ms Vasquez, the Chilean Association Singapore managed to contact her immediate family members. <br> <br> Pablo Menichetti, who’s the association’s president said since phone
              lines in Chile were down, Chileans here turned to social media sites. <br> <br> "We contact people that have Internet that is closest to the main area
              then they call by mobile phone locally - that was the best way we found
              to find our relatives." <br> <br> According to Chile's ambassador to Singapore, Graciela Fernandez
              Sobarzo, the immediate relatives of Chileans here are safe - no
              casualties have been reported. <br> <br> "I think and I can assure almost one hundred per cent it's already
              located. It's already done. That means we're calm and this is a good
              opportunity to call all Chileans here and say to them to remain calm,
              slowly slowly Chile is becoming operative." <br> <br> Based on the amount of damage back home, the Chilean embassy in
              Singapore says it will submit requests for disaster relief to the
              Singapore government. <br> <br> Already, the embassy hopes to tap on Singapore's expertise in water
              treatment to provide clean water supplies to disaster victims, back in
              Chile. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Chile quake moved Earth's axis, shortened days: scientist</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - – The powerful earthquake that shook Chile on 
              Saturday probably shifted the Earth's axis and made days slightly 
              shorter, a NASA scientist said.</p>
              <p>Richard Gross, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
              Laboratory in California, calculated that the planet's axis would have 
              shifted by eight centimeters (three inches) during the 8.8 magnitude 
              quake, NASA said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Earth days are 24 hours long because that's the amount of time it 
              takes the planet to make one full rotation on its axis, so shifting the 
              axis would affect rotation.</p>
              <p>If, indeed, the planet's axis did shift by eight centimeters during 
              the Chilean quake, days would have shortened by 1.26 microseconds, Gross
               calculated.</p>
              <p>A microsecond is one-millionth of a second, so no need to adjust 
              watches just yet.</p>
              <p>The Chilean quake shifted the Earth's axis by even more than the 
              9.1-magnitude temblor off Indonesia that set off the deadly tsunami in 
              Asia in 2004, Gross worked out.</p>
              <p>That's partly because the faultline responsible for the earthquake 
              in Chile "dips into Earth at a slightly steeper angle than does the 
              fault responsible for the 2004 Sumatran earthquake" and is more 
              effective at moving Earth's mass vertically and shifting the planet's 
              axis.</p>
              <p>The 2004 quake in Asia caused the Earth to move by around seven 
              centimeters and chopped an estimated 6.8 microseconds off the length of a
               day, NASA said.</p>

              <p><strong>US$50,000 for Chile relief</strong></p>

               supplies requested by the Chilean government to help those affected by 
              the earthquake.</p>
              <p>The contribution will be channelled through the Singapore

              desperate survivors using helicopters and boats as the death toll rose 
              to nearly 800 three days after a devastating 8.8-magnitude earthquake 
              and tsunami.</p>
              <p>The government also dispatched more troops to restore order 
              in the country's second-largest city, Concepcion, which was placed under
               curfew for 18 hours a day after looters raided stores and burned a

              <p><strong>Aid reaches battered areas, unevenly</strong></p>
              <p>Relief efforts in earthquake-torn Chile have begun to reach the remote 
              coastal areas hardest hit by Saturday's quake and ensuing tsunami.<br> <br> But three big, successive aftershocks rattled already nervous residents.
               <br> <br> The tremors, measuring between magnitudes 5.9 and 6.3, triggered a new 
              tsunami alert along parts of the coastline. <br> <br> Blaring sirens sent residents scurrying for higher ground in at least 
              three coastal towns, according to eyewitnesses and local radio. <br> <br> The alarms turned out to be false.<br> <br> The fresh jolts only added to the misery in coastal towns, where anger 
              at the government is greatest for downplaying the tsunami risk 
              immediately after the quake and for doing little to aid survivors in the
               days since. <br> <br> Aid is arriving unevenly in other areas, raising worries of disease and 
              lack of clean drinking water. <br> <br> In the industrial hub of Concepcion, Chile's second-largest city, some 
              residents have resorted to drinking water out of backyard pools. <br> <br> Health workers said the situation could turn dire. <br> <br> But in several towns south of Concepcion, government trucks began 
              turning up with food, water and medicine.</p>
