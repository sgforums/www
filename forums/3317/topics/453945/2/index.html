              <p>i hope the legal system would seriously punish women who are involved in such unethical business practices...even though its their "personal" assets they are using...if they are not charged....i foresee a great failure of our legal system in its fair treatment of wrongdoings or crimes....it is definietly unethical, a wrongdoing, a social dilemma of capitalist system, which the punishment must be fairly meted out to wrongdoers to instill deterence from others to follow suit....</p>
              <p>our whole business and social culture would be seriously subverted if the legal system condones them...worse if women charter steps in to protect such wrong doings....</p>
              <p>what we face is the greater danger of allowing or condoning such bad influences seeped deep into the minds of our daughters of the future generations...who are already born in such highly materialistic cultures....</p>

              <p>Well, you look at the sexily dressed chio bus at raffles place and you may wonder, "Why are they dressed in this manner?" Well people can say all they want about using "real ability" to get to the top and bla bla bla. Truth is sex sells at the workplace, from harmless flirtations to sexual advancements.</p>
              <p>I personally disagree with it but this is the way it works. It's not what you know but who you know. After these years of working, my humble observation is that social skills matter much more than genuine ability.</p>

              <p>AN offer to sleep one's way up to success and fame - you can't stop it from coming, but you can choose to walk away from it.</p>
              <p>That's the stand of veteran Taiwanese artiste Chen Meifeng, who has more than 30 years of experience in showbiz.</p>
              <p>In a phone interview with The New Paper ahead of her concert here, the 54-year-old actress-host, described by the media in Taiwan as the "Most Beautiful Obasan (Japanese for aunty)" there, was candid and upfront on the sensitive topic.</p>
              <p>Two weeks ago, South Korea was rocked by explosive details in the late actress Jang Ja Yeon's letters, in which she claimed her management company had forced her to give sexual favours to more than 31 men.</p>
              <p>Jang, best known for her role in idol drama Boys Over Flowers, committed suicide in December 2009.</p>
              <p>Said Chen: "You simply can't avoid it... in Taiwan."</p>
              <p>Young, pretty female celebrities inevitably receive offers to give sexual favours, in exchange for riches and a smoother career path.</p>
              <p>"It often starts out as a casual invitation to dinner, but you'll soon realise that the other party's intentions aren't so innocent."</p>
              <p>Chen, who will be performing with veteran singer Sakura and child sensation Xiao Xiao Bin in the Super Hits Concert this Sunday, has her own experience to share.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">She was approached during her younger years with illicit offers. Chen said she flatly declined all of them, but "didn't feel angry or insulted".</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">She added: "Right from the start, I knew it wasn't in me to accept something like that."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>After a slight pause, she said: "When it comes to work, you have to believe Lady Luck will find you someday.</p>
              <p>"I got my big break late in my career. In my younger days, I didn't earn a lot.</p>
              <p>"Nevertheless, I was very happy as I got to indulge in my passion (for acting and compering). That was good enough."</p>
              <p>Today, Chen is hot property, hosting her popular cooking show A Date With Meifeng, being the ambassador of lifestyle brand Osim and taking on lead roles in Hokkien soap operas such as Love and Night Market Life.</p>
              <p>The family-themed Night Market Life, which sees her playing a selfless mother of two, is showing over Channel 8 on weekends at 7pm.</p>
              <p>Chen, who has had a boyfriend for 10 years, laughed when we asked if she feels flattered by her "Most Beautiful Obasan" moniker.</p>
              <p>"Of course I love it, it's warm and friendly," she said jovially.</p>
              <p>"Besides, there are many beautiful female celebrities in Taiwan, but not many are my age."</p>
              <p>She takes the "obasan" label in stride, despite its reference to a middle-aged woman.</p>
              <p>"There was one time when I bumped into a few young fans on the street," recalled Chen.</p>
              <p>"They instantly blurted out: 'Meifeng-Jie (meaning sister in Mandarin), you are the most beautiful...' and suddenly stopped mid-sentence.</p>
              <p>"They looked a bit shy to say 'obasan', fearing that I didn't like to be called old.</p>
              <p>"But I really did not mind it one bit, I even completed the sentence for them!"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>These things do happen in corporate life. It 's all a matter of the individual employees' principles. One reputable American computer  systems firm  used to hire very good looking young men. whether bachelor or married. The old and single Caucacian big boss of this so called non sexual discriminatory firm used to fly in the singapore the RHQ to see his "favorities ". Interestingly  some of these guys were married  and I doubt their  spouses knew what was going on.</div>

                      The Company employing such women to elicit big sales volume by using their body should also be fined heavily for  either  knowing  colloborating or abetting in corporate pimping and prostitution!
                  Does  the judicial system have the independence of judgement to right what is going terribly wrong in Singapura? Surely that also depends on the morals values of the judges the system has appointed in place, and how they see such practices?

              <p> </p>
              <p>REPORT: <strong>KOH HUI THENG</strong></p>
              <p>STUDENTS see their teachers in school almost every day.</p>
              <p>  But a group of students at an international school here may have seen a bit too much of two of their teachers last week.</p>
              <p>  While browsing files on the school's computer server, they chanced upon a video featuring two teachers having sex.</p>
              <p>  The video has since spread to students in other schools.</p>
              <p>  A teenager who is studying in a different school has seen the video.</p>
              <p>  James (not his real name), 18, said he learnt about it during an online chat last Friday with a friend who is in the same school as the two teachers.</p>
              <p>  They were talking about the friend's last school day when the latter blurted out: "Hey, have you heard? People from my school are talking about this video that's going around.</p>
              <p>  "It shows teachers having sex. Do you want to see it?"</p>
              <p>  Intrigued, James said yes.</p>
              <p>  His friend sent the file over and James waited half an hour for the clip to download.</p>
              <p>  "My friend was laughing when talking about it. He thought it was quite funny," he recalled.</p>
              <p>  "It was a 20-minute video, quite a big file. It showed a man and woman having sex. I was laughing a bit when I saw the video.</p>
              <p>  "I was shocked, too, because I was wondering what would have happened if this had been my school," James said.</p>
              <p>  The New Paper understands that the video was found on his friend's school's computer server. It is not known how the video ended up there.</p>
              <p>  This explicit footage quickly circulated among the expatriate student population.</p>
              <p>  James' 16-year-old sister, who is in another school, also heard about the incident.</p>
              <p>  "She brought up the topic during dinner. My parents laughed but you can imagine it got a bit awkward at the dinner table," the blonde teenager said.</p>
              <p>  His friend is overseas and could not be reached, but his junior in school, Adeline (not her real name), 17, confirmed that the clip had gone viral.</p>
              <p>  She said: "A girl came up to some of us on the last day of school and said her class had found the video. She asked if we wanted to see it.</p>
              <p>  "Students were passing it around. I heard someone had posted it on Facebook and was offering to send it to others through Skype."</p>
              <p>  The video, which appears to have been taken by a camera in a fixed position, shows a naked man and a woman wearing a camisole, underwear and high-heel shoes having sex in a bedroom.</p>
              <p>  Another three students said they had heard about the video's existence but had not viewed the clip.</p>
              <p>  Adeline, who did not watch the video, said she knew the teachers involved.</p>
              <p>  The man is said to have handled disciplinary matters at the school, where he has worked for almost a decade.</p>
              <p>  "We thought of him as Voldemort(the main villain in J.K Rowling's Harry Potter series). He is very stern and always wearing black. But once you know him, he's actually quite nice," she said.</p>
              <p>  Fellow students said the woman in the video was one of the stricter teachers there.</p>
              <p>  TNP understands that the two teachers are dating each other and could get married soon.</p>
              <p>  Adeline said that the profiles of both teachers had been removed from the school's website.</p>
              <p>  "I hope that they didn't lose their jobs because of this," she added.</p>
              <p>  "What some of the students are doing (spreading the video) is really irritating. There's no respect at all."</p>
              <p>  A school spokesman said the school was "not in position to comment on the personal life of ex-staff as these are private matters".</p>
              <p>  Its academic year ended on June 8.</p>
              <p>  TNP understand that the teachers were not fired but had left after they finished their contracts.</p>
              <p>  The spokesman said: "While there was no breach in the school's IT security, the school has briefed its senior leadership, so they can share the learnings (from) this incident and promote the responsible use of technology with the senior students in the upcoming academic year."</p>
              <p>  When told about the matter, expat parents had varing reactions.</p>
              <p>  A housewife who wanted to be known only as Mrs Vivi, 48, was appalled that the video had become public.</p>
              <p>  Her family has been in Singapore for six years, and her son and two daughters attend the school in question.</p>
              <p>  "What the teachers did was their private matter.</p>
              <p>  "The video could have been accidentally sent. Mistakes do happen, I feel very sorry for the teachers involved and for the school. It's pity (this happened)," she said.</p>
              <p>  "The students shouldn't be spreading the video. Children may think it's funny to do so, but I don't think I would find it funny if (such behaviour) came from my own friends."</p>
              <p>  She said she and her husband would discuss the matter with their children.</p>
              <p>  Another parent, who wanted to be known as Mr G, laughed as he said: "My children are big girls. I have no problem about this (if they saw the video)."</p>
              <p>  The father of three daughters aged 14 to 20 moved to Singapore last year. His children do not study at the school.</p>
              <p>  He said: "In today's digital age, it's difficult to keep things under wraps, but it's what the teachers should have done - kept it under wraps."</p>
              <p>  Still, he did not think the incident was a big deal.</p>
              <p>  "As a parent, I won't complain because there are other more important things to complain about," he said.</p>
              <p>  Lawyer Tan Hee Joek said the students who circulated the video are breaking the law as it is illegal to make, distribute, show, import, or possess, any obscene video recording.</p>
              <p>  Under the Firms Act, first-time offenders caught sending out obscene films will be fined at least $2,000 for each film distributed or jailed up to two years, or both.</p>
              <p>  "Technically, the teachers could be in trouble with the law for making an obscene film but the chances of the police charging them over this is remote," Mr Tan said.</p>
              <p>  The teachers could also sue for copyright infringement if they wish but not for invasion of privacy.</p>
              <p>  "There is no privacy law here," Mr Tan added.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore's Edison Chen</strong></p>
              <p>Unemployed man Chen Guilin gained notoriety after he posted his self-filmed sex videos on various amateur porn sites and sex forums.</p>
              <p>  The clips had titles like "Gary Ng vs Beer Promo Auntie", "Gary Ng vs Friend's Niece" and "Gary Ng vs Chua Chu Kang girl".</p>
              <p>  Chen used the moniker Gary Ng.</p>
              <p>  He was found guilty of possessing obscene films and other offences like housebreaking, forery and criminal breach of trust. He was jailed for four years and two months and fined $20,000 last year.</p>

              <p><strong>Air Stewardess</strong></p>
              <p>A four-minute graphic video showing a Singaporean air stewardess/part-time actress having sex with a man appeared on US and regional websites in early 2010.</p>
              <p>  The clip focused almost entirely on the woman in explicit poses performing sex acts. She had appeared in several drama series and did not say much when contacted. The video was taken down soon after.</p>
