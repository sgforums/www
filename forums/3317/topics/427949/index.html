              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Childcare operator Cherie Hearts is suing Australian firm G8 Education for breach of contract.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It has also 
              successfully applied for a court order overturning a receivership 
              appointment by G8, which the operator said was unlawful.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The move by G8 had put Cherie Hearts under threat of liquidation.<br><br>But
               while the operator appears to be out of the woods for now, its sale 
              agreement with G8 is up in the air, with possible implications on future
               expansion plans by Cherie Hearts.<br><br>Lawyers for Cherie Hearts declined comment on the deal pending the outcome of the trial.<br><br>Last
               October, G8 agreed to buy over Cherie Hearts' Singapore operations for 
              S$24.6 million, as part of a move by the Australian-listed firm to 
              expand its childcare business into Singapore.<br><br>An affidavit 
              submitted by Cherie Hearts detailed how, as part of the business 
              acquisition contract, G8 would extend a S$12 million loan to Cherie 
              Hearts and assume part of its outstanding debts.<br><br>The loan was to 
              have been offset against the purchase price, and Cherie Hearts would 
              receive some S$9 million once the sale was completed.<br><br>But on 
              March 22, with a few weeks to go, receivers were called into the 
              operator's Cecil Street headquarters, with G8 alleging a loan default of
               S$5.5 million. <br><br>This was disputed by Cherie Hearts, which said its loans had been effectively paid off as of March 1.<br><br>It
               later found out that G8 had also exercised its security over the 
              alleged loan default, and, without its knowledge, assumed control of 12 
              of its subsidiary companies in Singapore.<br><br>Cherie Hearts has since assumed control of the 12 centres.<br><br>The case is now pending trial.<br><br>- CNA/ms/ls</span></span></p>
