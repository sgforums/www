              <p>You're being very naive in saying that 'no secrets == good'.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, there will always be secrets, and as much as you may not like it, there is a good reason for some things to remain secret.</p>
              <p>Let's say, for example, the secret of ULTRA and MAGIC decrypts got out smack in the middle of World War II. The Germans and Japs would have reworked their encryption systems. That would at the very least prolong the war by several years, considering how useful ULTRA was to winning the Atlantic front (read up on the submarine war), and how useful MAGIC was to the Pacific front (Midway, especially).</p>
              <p>Let's go into current times. Secret diplomacy is there for a reason simply because having it out in the open can be more detrimental in the big picture. How will it look like, for instance, if secret peace negotiations between Israel and an Arab country got blown out into the open? You may well end up empowering the terrorists in the knowledge that '<em>Hey! Our government is consorting with the enemy! Now we can convince more people to join us!</em>'</p>
              <p>Of course, <em>some</em> things should be made more transparent. But that doesn't mean that <em>everything</em> should be made transparent.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo has 
              said the confidentiality of diplomatic communication must be respected, 
              and that any communication must not be taken out of context.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking to 
              reporters on the latest reports from WikiLeaks regarding comments from 
              senior Singapore Foreign Affairs officials on countries in the region.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Yeo said: "There 
              will be more coming out in the future and "you said this about me and I 
              said this about you", and it goes on. I think it is best that we respect
               the confidentiality of diplomatic communication.<br><br>"That is what 
              certain individuals said about others. There could be a diversity of 
              views. As I said, they probably said things about me which I may not 
              agree with. But that is fine, that is to be expected. <br><br>"If you want to hear everything which others say behind your back, and take offence at it, you will be a very unhappy person."<br><br>Mr
               Yeo added that diplomatic relations cannot be done "on the basis that 
              there is a camera in the room recording everything", and that when that 
              happens, "we lose something".<br><br>He also said that sometimes it is 
              in the nature of "cocktail talk" where "people say things in a blunt 
              forthright way", and "we should not divorce, even if true, what is said 
              from the context".<br><br>- CNA/ms</span> </span></p>

              <p><strong>WikiLeaks hits Singapore diplomats</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore diplomats think the leaders of some close 
              Asian allies are corrupt or incompetent, cables from WikiLeaks revealed 
              Sunday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Confidential 
              diplomatic notes given by the whistleblower website to Australia's 
              Fairfax media group contained unflattering assessments of key figures in
               Malaysia, Thailand, India and Japan.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"A lack of competent
               leadership is a real problem for Malaysia," permanent secretary for the
               Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bilahari Kausikan reportedly told US Deputy
               Secretary of Defence for East Asia David Sedney in a cable dated 
              September 2008.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>As such, "the 
              situation in neighbouring Malaysia is confused and dangerous," fuelled 
              by a "distinct possibility of racial conflict" that could see ethnic 
              Chinese "flee" Malaysia and "overwhelm" Singapore, Bilahari was quoted 
              as saying.<br><br>Another official, Peter Ho, reportedly described 
              Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak as "an opportunist" who "would not 
              hesitate" to be critical of Singapore if "it is expedient for him to do 
              so."<br><br>He said allegations linking Najib to the murder of a 
              Mongolian woman in 2006, which the leader has strongly rejected, would 
              continue to "haunt" his political fortunes.<br><br>Bilahari was also 
              critical of the Thai government in 2008, labelling then premier Thaksin 
              Shinawatra as "corrupt" along with "everyone else, including the 
              opposition."<br><br>He also said the Thai crown prince was "very 
              erratic, and easily subject to influence," and warned of continued 
              instability in Thailand.<br><br>In another 2009 memo, Singapore's 
              ambassador at large Tommy Koh -- known for being mild-mannered and 
              eloquent in public -- was uncharacteristically blunt in his assessment 
              of Japan and India.<br><br>"Koh described Japan as 'the big fat loser' 
              in the context of improving ties between China and ASEAN," a leaked 
              cable detailing a meeting between him and US officials stated.<br><br>"He
               attributed the relative decline of Japan's stature in the region to 
              Japan's 'stupidity, bad leadership, and lack of vision,'" it added.<br><br>"He
               was equally merciless towards India, describing it as 'half in, half 
              out' of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.)"<br><br>There
               was no immediate reaction from the Singapore government to the leaks 
              but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) earlier issued a statement 
              saying it is "critical to protect the confidentiality of diplomatic and 
              official correspondence". <br><br>"Which is why Singapore has the Official Secrets Act (OSA)," an MFA spokesman said.<br><br>He
               said: "In particular, the selective release of documents, especially 
              when taken out of context, will only serve to sow confusion and fail to 
              provide a complete picture of the important issues that were being 
              discussed (among) leaders in the strictest of confidentiality."<br><br>-AFP/CNA/wk </span></span></p>

              <p><strong>MFA doesn't comment on leaks</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman said as a matter of principle, the ministry does not comment on leaks. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was responding to
                   media queries on Australian press reports of US Embassy cables leaked 
                  by WikiLeaks which attributed remarks to various Singapore leaders and 
                  officials.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The spokesman added 
                  that these reports are based on American interpretations of confidential
                   conversations that did not provide the full context and, in some cases,
                   were from third party sources. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>When asked if he 
                  expected that subsequent WikiLeaks reports would contain critical 
                  comments about Singapore by other countries, the spokesman said that 
                  there are many thousands of leaked cables from US diplomatic missions 
                  all around the region. <br><br>The spokesman said he would be very surprised if Singapore were not the subject of at least some of them.  <br><br>"As I said earlier, MFA does not comment on leaks."<br><br>And the spokesman added that Singapore takes leaks of confidential information very seriously and would not tolerate it here.<br><br>When
                   asked whether these leaks would affect Singapore's ties with these 
                  countries, the spokesman said Singapore has long-standing, robust and 
                  positive relationships with all countries in the region. <br><br>He 
                  added that these relationships are built on a strong foundation of 
                  shared interests and mutually beneficial cooperation in many areas. <br><br>And countries base relationships on their own interests and not hearsay or gossip.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>if wikilinks's bullsheeting then i thnk sg should take legal action against the publisher or writer. if the document is true then i think we have to ask the autthor why he comment like that, and put it on paper for people as prove?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if so why one side encourage and open so big our doors to floor traps, the other end say them bad? if its the later i only truely suport if we put it into actions, install stronger filters at our doors.</p>
              <p>of course everything we do must have secrets. take photographeer and hardware for example. when the correct way to take a photo with regards to hardware and its limitation is leaked, everyone can wasily take photos already. now see why people still asking how to take good photos, why so many follow seniors learn until now still take crap photos?</p>

              <p><strong>MFA clarifies with M'sia</strong></p>
              <p>THE Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Singapore's High 
              Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur T Jasudasen had been asked to see Malaysian
               Foreign Minister Dato' Seri Anifah Aman this morning regarding press 
              reports of US Embassy cables leaked by WikiLeaks.</p>
              <p>He also received a protest note.</p>
              <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo called Mr Anifah later on 
              Tuesday to clarify Singapore's policy of not commenting on leaks.</p>
              <p>Highlighting a disparity of facts, the MFA spokesman said 
              the 'specific complaints raised by the Malaysians, what Singapore 
              officials were alleged by WikiLeaks to have said did not tally with our 
              own records'.</p>
              <p>'One purported meeting did not even take place.' the spokesman added.</p>
              <p>Both Mr Yeo and Mr Anifah have agreed on the importance of good bilateral relations and strengthening cooperation further.</p>

              More likely is that wikileaks is a big hypocrite who exposes the

              <p>Likely is revenue from news, but arouse instability. The leaders and all communities ought to remain in harmony and calm from the leaks. Leaders probably have to brave up themselves to apologise from the unloving political language used then.

              <p><strong>MM Lee says Myanmar junta 'dense': WikiLeaks </strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew described 
              Myanmar's ruling generals as "dense" and "stupid" people who have 
              "mismanaged" the country's vast resources, US cables released by 
              WikiLeaks said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In a 2007 meeting 
              with top US officials, Lee also reportedly said Myanmar's envoy in 
              Singapore had told the city-state that his country could "survive any 
              sanctions" because of its abundance of natural resources.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Lee believed the 
              Myanmar problem could be solved if a younger generation of generals who 
              were less "obtuse" would step forward and possibly forge a power-sharing
               agreement with the country's democracy movement, the cable said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"They could share 
              power with the democracy activists, although probably not with Aung San 
              Suu Kyi, who was anathema to the military," it said.<br><br>Asked about 
              the prospects of ASEAN appointing an envoy to Myanmar, Lee suggested 
              that Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's (SBY) military 
              background would make him an ideal candidate for the post.<br><br>"He suggested that Indonesian President Yudhoyono could potentially be an interlocutor," the US cable said.<br><br>"As a former general, SBY might be able to meet with Senior General Than Shwe and get him to listen.<br><br>In
               a statement issued earlier, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
              spokesman said as a principle, the ministry does not comment on leaks.<br><br>He added Singapore has long-standing, robust and positive relationships with all countries in the region. <br><br>The
               spokesman said these relationships are built on a strong foundation of 
              shared interests and are not based on hearsay or gossip. <br><br>-AFP/wk</span></span></p>
