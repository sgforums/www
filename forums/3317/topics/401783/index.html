              <p><span>SINGAPORE : More tourists are coming to Singapore and staying 
              longer since the opening of the country's two integrated resorts (IRs). </span></p>
              <p><span>Even though both attractions are only partially opened, in-bound 
              tour agencies said business has spiked by as much as 40 per cent.
              <br> <br> Many tourists are also extending their stays here by another night or 
              two.
              <br> <br> They are also giving other attractions a miss to check out Resorts World
               Sentosa (RWS) and Marina Bay Sands (MBS).
              <br> <br> One company described the IRs as "exciting properties" which tourists 
              would want to see "even if they are not complete".
              <br> <br> Both IRs have had a slew of hiccups since its opening.
              <br> <br> RWS' Universal Studios Singapore lost its main ride, the Battlestar 
              Galactica, to technical faults barely a week after the theme park opened
               in March. The ride remains closed.
              <br> <br> Tour East Singapore general manager Yvonne Wong said: "Tourists just 
              want to have a feel of the theme park first even if it's not fully open 
              or some rides aren't working, because it's the newest in the region and 
              has some unique rides."
              <br> <br> She said the fact that they cannot try Battlestar Galactica now doesn't 
              bother them.
              <br> <br> "If they like the place, they can come back. The desire is based on the 
              experience of the whole theme park, and not one or two rides," said 
              Wong.
              <br> <br> Marina Bay Sands also had problems with its conference facilities and 
              hotel rooms.
              <br> <br> MBS drew flak when it hosted its first event, the Inter-Pacific Bar 
              Association's 20th annual conference last month. The conflict is the 
              subject of a legal suit now.
              <br> <br> But glitches aside, demand continues to flourish.
              <br> <br> Tour agents said most tourists accept that kinks are common when 
              mega-attractions open.
              <br> <br> For now, the more family-friendly RWS appears to be ahead in the race to
               woo tourists.
              <br> <br> But agents said MBS will put up a tough fight once its SkyPark and 
              resident show The Lion King opens.
              <br> <br> The only question is when. The show's debut is expected to be delayed, 
              as MBS' theatres will not be ready by September. </span></p>
