              <p>MOSCOW, October 6 (RIA Novosti) - Russian officials have held
              "secret meetings" with Arab states, China and France <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>on ending the use
              of the U.S. dollar in international oil trading</strong></span></span>, Britain's Independent
              newspaper reported on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The countries are reportedly seeking to switch from the dollar to a
              basket of currencies including the euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan,
              gold, and a new unified currency of leading Arab oil producing
              countries.</p>
              <p>"Secret meetings have already been held by finance ministers and
              central bank governors in Russia, China, Japan and Brazil to work on
              the scheme, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>which will mean that <span style="color: #ff0000;">oil will no longer be priced in
              dollars,</span>" the paper said.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Independent said the meetings have been confirmed by Chinese and Arab banking sources.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"These plans will change the face of international financial
              transactions," a Chinese banker told the paper. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"America and Britain
              must be very worried. </strong></span></span>You will know how worried by the thunder of
              denials this news will generate."</p>

              <p>End to USA financial dominance in the works?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
                  <p>Looks like it's the end for USA's ambitions for global dominance.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The dollar then did not become a ‘petrodollar’
                  although Kissinger spoke about the process of ‘recycling petrodollars.’
                  Instead what he referred to was the initiation of a new phase of US
                  global hegemony in which the ‘petrodollar’ export earnings of OPEC oil
                  lands would be recycled into the hands of the major New York and London
                  banks and re-lent in form of dollar loans to oil deficit countries like
                  Brazil or Argentina, creating what soon came to be known as he Latin
                  American Debt Crisis.</p>
                  <p>The dollar at that time had been a fiat currency
                  since August 1971 when President Richard Nixon first abrogated the
                  Bretton Woods Treaty and refused to redeem US dollars held by foreign
                  central banks for gold bullion. The dollar floated against other major
                  currencies, falling more or less until it was revived by the turbo
                  change of the 1973-4 oil price shock.</p>
                  <p>What the 1973 oil shock achieved for the sagging
                  dollar was a sudden injection of global demand from nations confronted
                  with 400% higher oil import bills. At that time, by postwar convention
                  and convenience, as the dollar was the only reserve currency held
                  around the world other than gold, oil was priced by all OPEC members in
                  dollars as a practical exigency.</p>
                  <p>With the 400% price rise, nations such as France,
                  Germany, Japan and other importers suddenly found reason to try to buy
                  their oil directly in their own currencies—French Franc, German
                  Deutschemarks or Japanese Yen—in order to lessen the pressure on their
                  rapidly declining reserves of trade dollars. T<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he US Treasury and
                  Pentagon made certain that did not happen,</strong></span> partly with some Kissinger
                  secret diplomacy, bullying threats, and a whopping big US military
                  agreement with the key OPEC producer, Saudi Arabia. At that time it
                  helped that the late Shah of Iran was seen in Washington to be a vassal
                  of Kissinger.</p>
                  <p>The point was not that the dollar became a ‘petro’
                  currency. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The point was that the reserve status of the dollar, now a
                  paper currency, <span style="color: #ff0000;">was bolstered by the 400% increase in world demand for
                  dollars to buy oil.</span> But that was only a part of the dollar story. </strong></span>In
                  1979, following the accession to power of the Ayatollah Khomeini in
                  Iran, oil prices shot through the roof for the second time in six
                  years. Yet, paradoxically, later that year the dollar began a
                  precipitous free-fall, not rise. It was no ‘petrodollar.’</p>
                  <p>Foreign dollar holders began dumping their dollars
                  as a protest to the foreign policies of the Jimmy Carter
                  Administration. It was to deal with that dollar crisis that Carter was
                  forced to bring in Paul Volcker to head the Federal Reserve in 1979. In
                  October 1979 Volcker gave the dollar another turbo-charge by allowing
                  interest rates in the US to rise some 300% in weeks, to well over 20%.
                  That in turn forced global interest rates through the roof, triggered a
                  global recession, mass unemployment and misery. It also ‘saved’ the
                  dollar as sole reserve currency. The dollar was not a ‘petrodollar.’ It
                  was the currency of issue of the greatest Superpower, a superpower
                  determined to do what it needed to keep it that way.</p>
                  <p><strong><em>The F-16 dollar backing</em></strong></p>
                  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Since 1979 the US power establishment from Wall
                  Street to Washington has maintained the status of the dollar as
                  unchallenged global reserve currency. </strong></span>The role, however, is not a
                  purely economic one. Reserve currency status is an adjunct of global
                  power, of the US determination to dominate other nations and the global
                  economic process. The US didn’t get reserve currency status by a
                  democratic vote of world central banks, nor did the British Empire in
                  the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. They fought wars for it.</p>
                  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For that reason, the status of the dollar as reserve
                  currency depends on the status of the United States as the world’s
                  unchallenged military superpower. </strong></span>In a sense, since August 1971 the
                  dollar is no longer backed by gold. Instead, it is backed by F-16’s and
                  MI Abrams battle tanks, operating in some 130 US bases around the
                  world, defending liberty and the dollar...</p>
