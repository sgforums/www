              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The controversial move to raise salaries for foreign 
              domestic workers (FDWs) - which got 16 agencies into trouble with the 
              competition watchdog - has not eased the dire shortage of maids, 
              agencies have told TODAY. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>And with Kuala 
              Lumpur and Jakarta signing a new agreement on Monday, which will pave 
              the way for the lifting of a two-year freeze on Indonesian maids working
               in Malaysia, the situation will get worse, they have added.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Earlier this year, 
              the 16 agencies tried to collectively raise the monthly salaries of new 
              Indonesian maids to S$450 but the Competition Commission of Singapore 
              (CCS) stepped in and ruled that the agencies had engaged in 
              anti-competitive conduct. <br><br>They have up till June 27 to submit their arguments before the CCS decides if there was an infringement. <br><br>In
               spite of the CCS move, other agencies - TODAY has learnt - have, in the
               last six months, unilaterally raised salaries from S$380 for new FDWs 
              from Indonesia and the Philippines to up to S$450.<br><br>Said Ms Ivy 
              Lee, proprietor of Maid-Power: "There was no benchmark before as they 
              were paid according to their skills. The pay hike is overdue and is an 
              accepted norm now."<br><br>With countries such as Hong Kong and Taiwan 
              reportedly paying the FDWs about S$600, prospective maids and agents 
              have the bargaining power.<br><br>Ms Lee recounted how an Indonesian 
              domestic helper almost backed out of coming to Singapore until she 
              secured S$400 in monthly pay instead of S$380.<br><br>Ms Yuni Dwiastuti,
               31, a domestic helper who hails from Semarang, Central Java, earns 
              S$440 now. She has been working here for six years. And, while she is 
              happy with her employers, she hopes for a S$50 pay raise. She said: "All
               my friends who asked for more pay got it and even the new ones get 
              S$450. I want to provide more for my family."<br><br>Responding to 
              TODAY's queries, a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) spokesperson noted that 
              FDW household penetration rate in Singapore is currently "much higher 
              than that in Hong Kong".<br><br>Said the spokesperson: "There are about 
              200,000 FDWs in Singapore, equivalent to 175 FDWs per 1,000 household, 
              compared to 122 per 1,000 household in Hong Kong."<br><br>The high 
              demand accentuates the shortage. Ms Lee, who has been in the industry 
              for 26 years, noted that many employers do not realise the severity of 
              the situation. <br><br>Advising employers not to change maids at whim, 
              Ms Lee said: "Some (maids) are willing to forego a pay increase if their
               employers are good to them. This is the time for employers to really 
              improve the living conditions of their helpers."<br><br>A property firm 
              owner, Mrs Anna Lee, 49, who pays her maid S$340 a month, felt that an 
              FDW's salary "should be based on experience". She noted that there are 
              also other costs borne by employers here, such as the levy that costs 
              between S$200 and S$265 a month and incidental costs such as food and 
              utilities.<br><br>Association of Employment Agencies of Singapore 
              (ASEAS) president K Jayaprema reiterated that the long-term solution 
              does not lie in increasing the pay. <br><br>She told TODAY: "We have to 
              ask how we can go beyond pay and make Singapore an attractive 
              destination for the women. Domestic helpers are no longer a luxury for 
              Singaporeans - they are a necessity."<br><br>MOM WILL CONTINUE TO FINE-TUNE POLICIES<br><br>ASEAS
               is asking the MOM to reduce the minimum age requirement for FDWs and to
               review the current English language entry test. The MOM had raised the 
              minimum age from 18 to 23 years in 2004 to ensure that the maids who 
              come here to work are responsible and mature enough to take care of 
              themselves and adapt to a foreign working environment. <br><br>The MOM 
              spokesperson noted that the Philippines "also maintains a minimum age of
               23 for their domestic workers to work in a foreign country". <br><br>Still,
               Ms Jayaprema said: "The legal working age is 21 - why does anyone need 
              to be 23 to do household chores? The passing rate for the English test 
              is very high but the helpers and their agents do not want any risk of 
              failure." <br><br>According to Ms Jayaprema, there are no entry tests 
              for foreign domestic workers in other countries. Last Saturday, an 
              Indonesian maid reportedly tried to hang herself at a maid hostel. 
              According to a press report, the hostel staff said the maid was feeling 
              depressed after thrice failing the English language test.<br><br>Noting 
              that the average passing rate was "more than 95 per cent", the MOM 
              spokesperson said that most FDWs "who have completed eight years of 
              formal education in their home countries would not face difficulties 
              understanding the test". The spokesperson added that the tests ensure 
              the FDWs "can understand basic safety instructions and have basic 
              numeracy and literacy skills to perform household tasks".<br><br>Said 
              the spokesperson: "We regularly examine all options related to improving
               the quality and supply of domestic workers coming to Singapore, 
              including the entry test and range of source countries. We will continue
               to work with interested stakeholders to fine-tune our policies."<br><br>In
               the meantime, ASEAS is banking on its marketing efforts to alleviate 
              the crunch. Said Ms Jayaprema: "We have taken overseas trips to market 
              Singapore to agents there, telling them we have good laws that protect 
              workers and the women are treated reasonably well here." </span></span></p>
