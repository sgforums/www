              <p>Christmas is not only a season for giving but for some, dating as well. <br> <br> Dating professionals say more singles are signing up for their services this month, up 20 per cent from last month. <br> <br> The Newsdesk finds out why the love bug is biting some singles this month. <br> <strong><br> </strong>Some singles aren’t comfortable with the thought of being on their own this month. <br> <br> 27 year old Linda hopes that she won't be standing alone under the mistletoe this year. <br> <br> And so she has taken the first step to finding Mr Right. <br><br> "I guess sense of humor is very important being a gentleman is a plus
              point but then again I think characteristics play a huge role . The
              festive season is around the corner and my friend do encourage me to
              meet people from all trade." <br><br> Linda is not alone in the year end rush to date. <br> <br> Dating agencies MediaCorp spoke to say it is the peak season for them
              as many clients have taken some time off work to find the right
              partner. <br> <br> Betty Goh , co founder of dating agency 'Who Works Around You' says she
              sees more working professionals from the banking and IT industry
              signing up this month. <br> <br> They are generally between 27 and 35 years old. <br><br> "They are more for working professionals during this festive break time
              they just get out and relax and it’s the best time they are taking time
              off to go dating you know." <br> <br> Dating agencies MediaCorp spoke to say they have not increased their prices during the festive period. <br> <br> Dating agencies charge between 40 and 300 dollars to set up a date. <br> <br> Lydia Gan, manager of dating agency Cliquewise, feels that the increase
              in numbers might be due to unfulfilled new year resolutions. <br> <br> "For Christmas and new year people probably reflect on
              the previous years resolution that they've made it could be that they
              wanted to find a partner by the end of this year when the end of the
              year reaches it kind of gives them an urgency to reach their goal." <br> <br> Activities such as Christmas parties and even high tea sessions are planned for these singles to mingle. <br> <br> However, will such relationships last ? <br> <br> Betty Goh from dating company, Who Works Around You. <br><br> "Not all of them. People just come for the fun of it just get a date to spend during the festive so it’s a one off thing." <br> <br> However, Ada Wong co founder of the Dating Loft says relationships do not just happen during the festive season. <br> <br> Perhaps it’s just a good excuse for more people to meet. <br><br> "So I think it’s more of a numbers game, they see more people the
              higher chances of seeing someone they like and the higher chances of
              them going into a relationship as well." <br><br> Whether it’s simply a numbers game, time off during the festive year
              end definitely seems to be helping singles get into the mood for love.</p>
