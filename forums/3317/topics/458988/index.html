              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A former tuition teacher was sentenced to 15 years' 
              jail on Friday for sexually abusing seven male students, two of whom 
              were brothers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his defence, the 
              51-year-old man claimed that he was instructed by "a ghost of a boy to 
              perform oral sex on the victims", who were all between eight and 15 
              years old.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his sentencing, 
              High Court Judge Woo Bih Li chastised him for abusing his position of 
              authority and that he should "take primary responsibility" for his 
              conduct.<br><br>The man, who cannot be named due to a gag order, earlier
               pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual offences involving two victims 
              in 2011. 29 other counts, which included outrage of modesty and underage
               sex, were taken into consideration during sentencing.<br><br>As the accused is above 50 years of age, he cannot be caned.<br><br>According
               to court documents, he taught English, Maths and Science for 25 years 
              at a tuition centre operated by the Residents Committee in the northern 
              part of Singapore. He preyed on his young charges over three years, 
              beginning from May 2007.<br><br>The unmarried man, who is represented by
               lawyers Anand Nalachandran and Josephus Tan, appeared contrite before 
              the court where his family was also present.<br><br>His ruse included 
              asking the boys to stay behind after tuition class when other students 
              had left, or asking them to return to the tuition centre when no else 
              was around.<br><br>Noting this, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sabrina Choo 
              said it showed that the offences were "clearly premeditated, calculated 
              and carefully planned."<br> <br>The accused would then ask his victims 
              to strip, before kissing and performing oral sex on them. He also 
              blindfolded some of his victims, and even took obscene photographs and 
              videos of them.<br><br>He was arrested in November 2009 and has been remanded since.<br><br>In
               mitigation, Mr Nalachandran brought up his client's previous years of 
              voluntary service including receiving an appreciation certificate from 
              YMCA in 1983. Describing his client as "a good man who had done bad 
              things", he urged the court to consider "the good work" his client had 
              done over the years.<br><br>During a psychiatric examination, the 
              accused also claimed that he was instructed by a "ghost" to commit the 
              offences, but he did not always comply with the instructions.<br><br>To 
              this, DPP Choo pointed out that there had been a "conscious choice" on 
              the part of the accused to commit the offences, and his actions were 
              voluntary. She also condemned him for treating his students as his 
              "personal sex toys", adding that he had caused "irreparable emotional 
              harm" to them.<br><br>One of them was said to have suffered "some emotional turmoil and sexual confusion" as result of the sexual abuse.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
