              <p><span>SINGAPORE: In 2005, names like Muhammad Ali, Sebastian Coe and 
              David Beckham visited Singapore for the 117th International Olympic 
              Committee Session. </span></p>
              <p><span>Three years later, 100,000 fans heard the roar of 300km/h engines 
              for the first time, as the SingTel Singapore Grand Prix - the world's 
              first Formula 1 night race - hurtled along the spectacular Marina Bay 
              street circuit.  
              <br> <br> Last year, Singapore organised the first Asian Youth Games, and in 148 
              days' time, Singapore will welcome an estimated 3,600 athletes aged 14 
              to 18 from 205 National Olympic Committees for the inaugural Youth 
              Olympic Games.  
              <br> <br> The Republic has also hosted the World Cup short course swimming series,
               and the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon has witnessed record 
              entries.  
              <br> <br> As a result, Singapore is in the running for the prestigious Sport 
              Business Ultimate Sports City Award 2010.  
              <br> <br> The Republic was one of 25 cities shortlisted on Thursday for the 
              biennial award - first held in 2006 - by London-based Sport Business 
              Group, the world's leading supplier of information, media and 
              business-to-business marketing services to the global sports industry.  
              <br> <br> The winning city will be announced at the Sport Accord Convention in 
              Dubai next month.  
              <br> <br> "All cities are awarded a value according to the events they host 
              annually, have hosted or will host between 2006 and 2014, as well as 
              federations in their locale," Rachael Church-Sanders, author of the 
              Ultimate Sports City report, told MediaCorp in an interview on Thursday.
                
              <br> <br> "Singapore's score was boosted by events such as the 2010 Youth 
              Olympics, World Netball Championships and the Formula 1 Grand Prix ...  
               
              <br> <br> "(There is) no monetary award, but as Melbourne (our winner in 2006 and 
              2008) will tell you, the kudos from winning the award has given them 
              exposure for promotional purposes and attracting future events."  
              <br> <br> Singapore is believed to be among the frontrunners to topple reigning 
              Ultimate Sports City Melbourne - it has won both editions in 2006 and 
              2008 - which it pipped in the bid to host next year's World Netball 
              Championship.  
              <br> <br> The shortlist was comprised by analysing the locations of over 2,000 
              sports events and federations globally between 2006 and 2014 and 
              awarding points according to the importance of the event or federation. 
               
              <br> <br> It is the first time Singapore has made the shortlist, and the Republic 
              is one of five Asian cities - and the only South-east Asian city - in 
              the mix.  
              <br> <br> Some of the other shortlisted cities include Moscow, Beijing, 2010 
              Winter Olympics host Vancouver, Johannesburg, venue of the 2010 World 
              Cup Final, and London, host of the 2012 Olympic Games.  
              <br> <br> For the award itself, the 25 cities will be judged on criteria including
               stadia and venues, transport and infrastructure, government and public 
              support, legacy, standard of living, marketing and promotional ability 
              and testimonials of event personnel.  
              <br> <br> The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) hailed the development as an 
              "achievement".  "We are truly honoured to be one of the 25 Ultimate 
              Sports Cities to be shortlisted ..." said SSC chief (sports marketing 
              group) Kelven Tan.   
              <br> <br> "To stand alongside some of the world's best sports cities and be one of
               only five Asian cities ... is an achievement in itself. Whatever 
              happens after this is a bonus." </span></p>
