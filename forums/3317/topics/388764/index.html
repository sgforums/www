              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Her husband, a former police officer, recently had
              his sentenced doubled to 24 months last month for abusing their then
              23-year-old Indonesian maid. </span></p>
              <p><span>Now it is her turn to face the music.
              <br> <br> On Thursday, Chua Hwee Hwa, 37, was charged in a district court with
              allegedly abusing the same maid at their Woodlands flat between January
              and May 2006.
              <br> <br>Chua, who was represented by former district judge Lee Teck Leng,
              remained silent during the proceedings and did not enter a plea.
              <br> <br>Her husband, 37-year-old Lawrence Lim Hwang Ngin, was found guilty
              of kicking the maid, hitting her on the head and rapping her forehead
              with his knuckles on five occasions between January and May 2006. <br> <br> Normally, maid abuse cases are heard at the Subordinate Court but Lim's
              case was taken to the High Court because he also faced allegations of
              sexual assault on the maid who had been working for his family since
              2004. However, he was later acquitted of rape because of
              inconsistencies in the latter's testimony.
              <br> <br>Lim was sentenced to a year's jail in November 2008 on the other
              five charges of physical abuse. But after an appeal by the prosecution,
              the Court of Appeal - the highest court in the Singapore justice system
              - upped the sentence to two years.
              <br> <br>During the trial, the court heard of details of how Lim waged a
              'psychological war' against the maid. Not only was she ordered her to
              record her chores in a notebook hung around her neck, she was also
              required to keep another notebook for recording her mistakes,
              prosecutors said.
              <br> <br>In the 114-page written judgment released last month following
              Lim's new sentence, Justice V K Rajah said the Court of Appeal had
              opted to take a firmer stand on bosses who terrorised their domestic
              helpers.
              <br> <br>He added: "Surely, it cannot be said that an abusive employer who
              persistently mistreats and humiliates a maid and then later physically
              injures her should be sentenced similarly with one who ordinarily
              treats a maid well, but then on a solitary occasion loses control of
              himself and then inflicts a similar injury?" <br> <br> In the meantime, Chua's case will be heard at a pre-trial conference on
              February 8. She could be jailed up to 18 months and/or fined up to
              S$1,500 on each charge if found guilty. </span></p>
