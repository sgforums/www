              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's 60,000 civil servants will get a modest
              one-off year-end payment of 0.25 month, capped at S$750, instead of the
              Annual Variable Component (AVC). </span></p>
              <p><span>This is the first time civil servants are not getting their AVC for the full year.
              <br> <br> In its statement, the Public Service Division (PSD) said on Thursday
              that the rank-and-file staff will get the full 0.25 month payment while
              the S$750 cap will help maintain wage restraint. Civil servants will
              also receive their 13th month payment.
              <br> <br>Singapore's economy is expected to shrink by 2 to 2.5 per cent this
              year. Although there are signs of recovery, PSD said growth for the
              whole year is still negative and the outlook remains uncertain.
              <br> <br>As such, the one-off payment is in line with the call by the
              tripartite partners to acknowledge employees' support for wage
              restraint and the work they have put in to help deal with the
              recession.
              <br> <br>Even with the one-off payment and 13th month payment, the annual
              salaries of civil servants in 2009 will still fall by 8 per cent to 22
              per cent, compared to the annual salaries in 2008. Those in senior
              positions will see the largest drop.
              <br> <br>On top of that, the government will again defer salary adjustments
              for Administrative Officers, Political, Judicial and Statutory
              Appointment Holders.
              <br> <br>Commenting on the year-end payment, Deputy Prime Minister and
              Minister in charge of the Civil Service, Teo Chee Hean, said the
              country's economy has yet to see a sustained recovery. Hence, the
              government was taking a cautiously optimistic and balanced approach in
              giving a modest one-off-year-end payment.
              <br> <br>He added that the government wants to recognise the willingness of
              civil servants to accept an overall reduction in annual wages and their
              hard work during the crisis to help the economy turn around.
              <br> <br> Welcoming the move, Singapore's labour movement hopes the private sector will also reciprocate where possible.
              <br> <br>The National Trades Union Congress' deputy secretary-general,
              Halimah Yacob, said: "We hope that the private sector will also follow
              suit... to recognise workers for their sacrifices, which is good for
              morale especially for companies that are doing well.
              <br> <br>"In some sectors, the labour market is already tightening, so
              companies should recognise their workers' contributions in bad times to
              help them get out of the recession."
              <br> <br>Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong said: "The important basis is that
              companies should take into account their own performance, their
              business prospects, as well as the individual performance of the
              workers.
              <br> <br>"We need to make sure that on the one hand, we need to give
              recognition to workers who have made contributions; on the other hand,
              we should not undermine the competitiveness of the company."
              <br> <br> At a community event on Thursday, Mr Teo was asked when civil servants could expect better bonuses.
              <br> <br>"We will watch the market conditions and we will still maintain the
              market principle that the pay in the civil service should be market
              competitive. It has served us well thus far. We've been able to
              attract, retain and have a good civil service," he said.
