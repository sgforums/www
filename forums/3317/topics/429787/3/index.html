              <p><strong>Tin Pei Ling's Cooling-off Day 'comment': pursue or not?</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: National Solidarity Party's (NSP) Nicole Seah told 
              reporters on Sunday that the party has not made a decision on whether to
               further pursue a potential violation by the People's Action Party's 
              (PAP) Tin Pei Ling, on Cooling-off Day.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The NSP reported that Ms Tin could have breached Cooling-off Day regulations with a Facebook post.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Cooling-off Day -- observed on the eve of Polling Day -- was proposed in 2009 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. <br><br>Candidates are not allowed to campaign on this day.<br><br>On May 6, the eve of the 2011 General Election, a post appeared on Ms Tin's Facebook page.<br><br>The post was apparently a reply to an earlier Facebook comment made on May 5, by Ms Tin.  <br><br>Netizens who spotted the May 6 post then circulated a screen capture of Ms Tin's Facebook page. <br><br>The comment, however, was removed within 20 minutes.<br><br>When
               contacted by Channel NewsAsia on May 6, Ms Tin said she was alerted to 
              the post by her friends, adding that it was inadvertently made by Ms 
              Denise He, one of Ms Tin's administrators. <br><br>Ms He had apparently 
              commented on Ms Tin's Facebook page using a mobile phone, without 
              realising that she was actually logged in as 'Ms Tin'. <br><br>Commenting
               on whether NSP would pursue the matter, Ms Seah said: "From my 
              knowledge, we went through the actual process (of filing a complaint) 
              and we did not get any results out of it -- no conclusion, no progress, 
              so I think we do recognise it is an uphill battle to get any results out
               of this.<br><br>"And we are being very realistic here, so that's why I say I would rather devote my time and resources to the residents".<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>This news is shown on T.V. I believe PAP knows how unpopular Tin Pei Ling is and is a threat to their 'new image'. PAP may use this opportunity to dismiss Tin Pei Ling as no matter what, the Facebook account is still hers, though posting was done by that 'Denise He'. Even if she is dismissed, she will not feel too pai seh as the 'culprit' is Denise , not her. Better way for Tin Pei Ling to make an exit.</p>
