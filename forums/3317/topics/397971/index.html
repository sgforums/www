              <p>A team of military doctors backed by India's national defence
                  research centre is studying an 83-year-old holy man who claims to have
                  spent seven decades surviving without food or water.</p>
              <p>The
                  long-haired and bearded yogi, Prahlad Jani, has been sealed in a
                  hospital in the western city of Ahmedabad where he is under 24-hour
                  observation by 30 doctors and will be subjected to a series of medical
                  tests.</p>
              <p>"The observation from this study may throw light on
                  human survival without food and water," doctor G. Ilavazahagan,
                  director of India's Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences
                  (DIPAS), told AFP.</p>
              <p>The DIPAS is part of the Defence Research
                  and Development Organisation, India's state defence and military
                  research institute also behind a grenade packed with chilli powder that
                  recently hit headlines.</p>
              <p>"This may help in working out
                  strategies for survival during natural calamities, extreme stressful
                  conditions and extra-terrestrial explorations like future missions to
                  the Moon and Mars by the human race," Ilavazahagan said.</p>
              <p>The
                  tests on Jani include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, measuring
                  brain and heart activity with electrodes and other neuro-physiological
                  studies, in addition to blood tests.</p>
              <p>The experiment started on
                  April 22 and will take 15-20 days. Since the beginning, Jani has
                  neither eaten nor drunk and has not been to the toilet, Ilavazahagan
                  said.</p>
              <p>"The exercise of taking this yogi under the medical
                  scanner is to understand what energy supports his existence," he added,
                  explaining that soldiers could benefit from his apparent ability to
                  survive.</p>
              <p>"Jani says he meditates to get energy. Our soldiers
                  will not be able to meditate, but we would still like to find out more
                  about the man and his body," he said.</p>
              <p>Neurologist Sudhir Shah,
                  who studied Jani in 2003 and is part of the new experiment, said that
                  the extremely skinny but apparently active man faced round-the-clock
                  observation.</p>
              <p>"Two stationary 24-hour video cameras have been
                  set up in his room, while a mobile video camera follows him whenever he
                  needs to step outside," he said.</p>
              <p>Jani, who dresses in red and
                  wears a nose ring, grew up in Charod village in the Mehsana district in
                  Gujarat and claims to have been blessed by a goddess aged eight, which
                  has enabled him to survive without sustenance.</p>
              <p>Shah said that
                  Jani told him the key to his survival was a mystical and unexplained
                  process by which he receives drops of water through a hole in his
                  palate.</p>
              <p>Analysis of data, to determine his secret or expose his fraudulence, will take at least two months, the doctors said.</p>
              <p>Fasting
                  is a part of Indian culture, made famous by independence leader Mahatma
                  Gandhi, who brought himself to the brink of death on several occasions
                  by refusing food and water to protest against colonial rule.</p>
              <p>A
                  monk from India's minority Jain religion -- devout followers of which
                  undertake frequent fasts, sometimes to death -- claims to have deprived
                  himself of food for one year, which is believed to be a record</p>
              <p>"If
                  you're busy with something you don't feel hunger, thirst, or the heat
                  and cold," said Sri Sahaj Muni Maharaj, who took daily glasses of warm
                  water during his fast which ended on May 1998.</p>
              <p>"I'm busy contemplating the infinite," he told India's Outlook magazine one month before the end of his experiment.</p>

              <p>Wow that's some serious constipation if you HAD been eating but not shitting for a month! For this dhalsim he had not eaten nor drink water so that explains for zero outputs since the digestive systems of a human body extract wasted from food we consume. No food sure no shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is just one individual so special. They are not all the same so i think they can save it from the military. Ask the soldiers not to eat where to get the energy to even move a limb.</p>

              <p>I will like to go into battle with an army of people not eating or having food for a month. We need not go into the field with any weapons. Just with charsiew fan and lor mee, pork also can. See their will stronger or stomach weaker. see their faith and belief also strong or not. A contridiction of will, hunger and faith. Want to eat also don't dare to eat hahaha.</p>
              <p>sure win one</p>
              <p>so what's the next weapon type?</p>
              <p>Balistics?</p>
              <p>Type - long range missile</p>
              <p>warhead - conventional</p>
              <p>Payload - curry powder</p>

              <p>chilli curry also lethal. imagine those exploding in mid air. our air will be hot and our eyes in tears.</p>
              <p>this is just to make news. clearly the will and 'powes' of this man not eating for 70 years draws from his yoga practise. something he might had started since young. will and mind state changes his body behaviour making him able to adapt to a life without food. one in millions special person i say. while most other normal yoga masters i see before are muscular and piak piak plump. not like dhalsim trust me.</p>
