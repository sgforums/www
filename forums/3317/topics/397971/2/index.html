              <p><strong>No food or water for 70 years</strong></p>
              <p>AHMEDABAD (India) - AN 83-YEAR-OLD Indian holy man who says he has 
              spent seven decades without food or water has astounded a team of 
              military doctors who studied him during a two-week observation period.</p>
              <p>Prahlad Jani spent a fortnight in a hospital in the western India 
              state of Gujarat under constant surveillance from a team of 30 medics 
              equipped with cameras and closed circuit television. During the period, 
              he neither ate nor drank and did not go to the toilet.</p>
              <p>'We still do not know how he survives,' neurologist Sudhir 
              Shah told reporters after the end of the experiment. 'It is still a 
              mystery what kind of phenomenon this is.' The long-haired and bearded 
              yogi was sealed in a hospital in the city of Ahmedabad in a study 
              initiated by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation 
              (DRDO), the state defence and military research institute.</p>
              <p>The DRDO hopes that the findings, set to be released in 
              greater detail in several months, could help soldiers survive without 
              food and drink, assist astronauts or even save the lives of people 
              trapped in natural disasters.</p>
              <p>'(Jani's) only contact with any kind of fluid was during 
              gargling and bathing periodically during the period,' G. Ilavazahagan, 
              director of India's Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences 
              (DIPAS), said in a statement.</p>
              <p>During the 15-day observation, which ended on Thursday, the 
              doctors took scans of Mr Jani's organs, brain, and blood vessels, as 
              well as doing tests on his heart, lungs and memory capacity. 'The 
              reports were all in the pre-determined safety range through the 
              observation period,'Mr Shah told reporters at a press conference last 
              week.</p>

              <p><br>No need to wory lah. They can study the man for all they want and present on paper the results. But i can tell you it will not have any impact on their military strength. their curry powder are better i can tell you. If i want to train a group of elite soldiers with powerful mind and will i will send some of our guys over to china monastery and train there. Their shaolin exponents can bring the physical body to a certain state of prowess (although training from young yields the best results), and their meditation strngthens the mind and will. books and way of life and compassion builds a leader's ability to make correct judgement and decision in the field. And overall the reason to fight is to defend not conquer or for agression.</p>

              <h3><span class="x3-large" style="font-family: inherit;">Holy man 'proves no food or drink claim' </span></h3>
              <div class="content">
              <p>AHMEDABAD, India (AFP) - â A team of
              military doctors backed by India's national defence research centre is
              studying an 83-year-old holy man who claims to have spent seven decades
              surviving without food or water.</p>
              <p>The long-haired and bearded
              yogi, Prahlad Jani, has been sealed in a hospital in the western city
              of Ahmedabad where he is under 24-hour observation by 30 doctors and
              will be subjected to a series of medical tests.</p>
              <p>"The
              observation from this study may throw light on human survival without
              food and water," doctor G. Ilavazahagan, director of India's Defence
              Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), told AFP.</p>
              <p>The
              DIPAS is part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation,
              India's state defence and military research institute also behind a
              grenade packed with chilli powder that recently hit headlines.</p>
              <p>"This
              may help in working out strategies for survival during natural
              calamities, extreme stressful conditions and extra-terrestrial
              explorations like future missions to the Moon and Mars by the human
              race," Ilavazahagan said.</p>
              <p>The tests on Jani include magnetic
              resonance imaging (MRI) scans, measuring brain and heart activity with
              electrodes and other neuro-physiological studies, in addition to blood
              tests.</p>
              <p>The experiment started on April 22 and will take 15-20
              days. Since the beginning, Jani has neither eaten nor drunk and has not
              been to the toilet, Ilavazahagan said.</p>
              <p>"The exercise of taking
              this yogi under the medical scanner is to understand what energy
              supports his existence," he added, explaining that soldiers could
              benefit from his apparent ability to survive.</p>
              <p>"Jani says he
              meditates to get energy. Our soldiers will not be able to meditate, but
              we would still like to find out more about the man and his body," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Neurologist Sudhir Shah, who studied Jani in 2003 and is
              part of the new experiment, said that the extremely skinny but
              apparently active man faced round-the-clock observation.</p>
              <p>"Two
              stationary 24-hour video cameras have been set up in his room, while a
              mobile video camera follows him whenever he needs to step outside," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Jani, who dresses in red and wears a nose ring, grew up
              in Charod village in the Mehsana district in Gujarat and claims to have
              been blessed by a goddess aged eight, which has enabled him to survive
              without sustenance.</p>
              <p>Shah said that Jani told him the key to
              his survival was a mystical and unexplained process by which he
              receives drops of water through a hole in his palate.</p>
              <p>Analysis of data, to determine his secret or expose his fraudulence, will take at least two months, the doctors said.</p>
              <p>Fasting
              is a part of Indian culture, made famous by independence leader Mahatma
              Gandhi, who brought himself to the brink of death on several occasions
              by refusing food and water to protest against colonial rule.</p>
              <p>A
              monk from India's minority Jain religion -- devout followers of which
              undertake frequent fasts, sometimes to death -- claims to have deprived
              himself of food for one year, which is believed to be a record</p>
              <p>"If
              you're busy with something you don't feel hunger, thirst, or the heat
              and cold," said Sri Sahaj Muni Maharaj, who took daily glasses of warm
              water during his fast which ended on May 1998.</p>
              <p>"I'm busy contemplating the infinite," he told India's Outlook magazine one month before the end of his experiment.</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The above report quotes unless their media made some inaccuracy in interpretation or translation to the man's words it do not make sense. Meditation frees the mind of all worldy thoughts and the mind is never busy then. In fact the supreme state defines it as being detatched from the body and thus body feels nopain and feel. really doubt the words if every bit was translated as what the holy man said when interviewed.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>a person is said to be immune to some poisons by taking up small doses during training at interval periods of time until the body build up resistence to the side effects, very similar to having flu and building up resistence to it after recovery.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>keeping a person occupied may not divert his attention from hunger and will to be distracted. However if an individual cultivates a love and intense interest to achieve something for example an artiste with inspeiration to complete a painting work piece may shut himeself from noise and distractions and disturbances of the mundane world in a retreat or a personal room for long periods of time until work complettion. this is no bodut true about mind being occupied and overtakes any feel and crave from hunger and food. However converting this concept into practical application on soldiers what will keep them occupied then in the field? any idea, revenge for death of love ones, plunder and pillaging from the spoils of war, or maybe just the love for their country?</p>
