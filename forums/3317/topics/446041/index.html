              <p><em>Under our "Inspiring People" monthly column, we highlight the 
                  incredible journey of one person who has overcome tremendous odds to 
                  achieve personal success. This column celebrates the triumph of the 
                  human spirit and we hope it will inspire you to reach for your dreams 
                  too. This month, we bring to you a man who pursues a not-so-lucrative career in helping a very large, but neglected, community.</em></p>
              <p>Once some of you learn what 32-year-old <span id="lw_1327462742_0" class="yshortcuts">Jolovan Wham</span> does for a living, you might not take an immediate liking to him.</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, he works full-time on one mission: to provide support to the expanding community of <span id="lw_1327462742_1" class="yshortcuts">foreign workers</span> living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>As the executive director and one of the founding members of the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), Wham has for the past seven years reached out to <span id="lw_1327462742_8" class="yshortcuts">migrant workers</span> here to help fight for their rights.<br><br>Despite the groundswell of xenophobic sentiment among so many Singaporeans toward <span id="lw_1327462742_2" class="yshortcuts">foreign workers</span>, Wham took particular interest in them, even while in university.<br><br>“As
                   a social work student I learned a lot about stuff involving Singaporean
                   families and Singaporean issues, and it struck me that we had so many <span id="lw_1327462742_9" class="yshortcuts">migrant workers</span> among us and we weren’t talking about them,” he told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>.
                   “So it started out as a kind of curiosity for me — what kind of 
                  problems and issues did they face? Why aren’t we talking about them?”<br><br>With this in mind, he volunteered once a month during his final year with the Commission for the pastoral care of Migrants and Itinerant people (CMI), the only group in Singapore dealing with migrant worker issues 
                  at that time. There, he spent two hours on one Sunday of each month at 
                  Lucky Plaza getting acquainted with Filipino domestic workers.<br><br><strong>A new view on <span id="lw_1327462742_3" class="yshortcuts">foreign workers</span></strong><br><br>Wham’s interest in <span id="lw_1327462742_4" class="yshortcuts">foreign workers</span>’
                   issues was sparked at a young age. Having grown up in a family that 
                  hired domestic help, he remembers how his mother was once scolded for 
                  “spoiling the market” after deciding to give her Indonesian helper one 
                  day off each month.<br><br>“Even as a child, I thought to myself, ‘I 
                  didn’t want to go to school every day, so why should I expect my 
                  Indonesian maid to work for us every day of the week?’ So even back 
                  then, that logic made sense to me,” he said.<br><br>Why reach out to 
                  help foreigners and not locals? Wham dismisses the categorisation of 
                  “local” and “foreign” workers, arguing that people should be fighting 
                  for the rights of all workers here.<br><br>“I see it as a false 
                  dichotomy,” he says. “If we didn’t see them as different, we wouldn’t 
                  have this situation. They’re easier to bully, so employers continue to 
                  hire them because they accept much lower wages. It’s very frustrating,” 
                  he adds. “These people literally built this country. Literally… yet the 
                  kind of recognition we give them is disproportionate to their 
                  contributions.”<br><br>Abuse, exploitation, underpayment — Wham says 
                  he’s pretty much seen them all. He cites how some Bangladeshi cleaners 
                  live, sleep and cook in bin centres, earning about $15 for between 12 
                  and 16 hours of work each day, and how many workers from China are 
                  forced to sign outrageous contracts that withhold pay or subject them to
                   punishment, for example, should they file complaints with the 
                  authorities.</p>
              <p>He says he has lost count of the number of construction workers’ 
                  dormitories he has visited, most of which are unlikely to ever sniff 
                  acceptable standards of sanitation or hygiene. He shares that one of the
                   worst container blocks he visited required workers living there to 
                  squeeze into three beds stacked on top of one another — with 10 of these
                   stacks crammed into a room that fits all 30 beds just nicely, leaving 
                  hope of having any available walking space zero to none — sleeping on 
                  wooden boards to reduce the number of bedbugs they would have to deal 
                  with, should they have mattresses.<br><br>He often has to pay late-night
                   visits to the dormitories, where security is not as tight, taking 
                  pictures of the appalling state of living conditions so many of them are
                   used to, and frequently submitting them to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), whose representatives he is now familiar with.<br><br>“I don’t see myself as a pest. They do!” he says, laughing. “I always think I am giving constructive feedback. <br><br>More
                   seriously, he points out, “It’s important to raise awareness, to hold 
                  those in power accountable for their actions. I speak out to effect 
                  change, to shape attitudes and opinions.”<br><br><strong>Working every day, round the clock</strong><br><br>His
                   is pretty much a 24/7 occupation, saying he receives calls at 1am from 
                  workers on the brink of being forcefully repatriated after being 
                  dismissed, and has at times travelled to Changi Airport to help them 
                  negotiate with burly, gangster-looking men from repatriation companies.<br><br>“They
                   usually refuse to let me talk to him (the worker), so I have to call 
                  the police, inform immigration officers of the matter; I have to insist 
                  that the workers are allowed to remain behind,” said Wham, who shared 
                  that he once sat down with a worker and the repatriation staff for more 
                  than an hour, refusing to leave until the latter gave up.<br><br>He 
                  admits, however, that it is often quite difficult to dispute their being
                   sent back when salary issues or injuries are not involved.<br><br>“You 
                  get very disheartened, and I’ve had a lot of these kinds of setbacks,” 
                  he says. “It’s inevitable, it’s part of the work, and it’s going to be 
                  difficult for workers to realise their rights because of the way 
                  policies are,” he added.<br><br>Since beginning his outreach efforts 
                  with HOME in 2004, he has frequently found himself at the receiving end 
                  of strange looks, angry phone calls, news of complaints filed with the 
                  MOM and more.<br><br>“You’re dealing with a lot of people’s anxieties, 
                  you’re dealing with people who dislike you, employers who think you’re 
                  poking your nose into their business and agencies who say you’re siding 
                  with the workers and no one else,” he says. <br><br>In HOME’s first 
                  three years, Wham says they were frequently visited by angry employers 
                  of domestic workers who, with policemen in tow, demanded that they 
                  handed over their helpers to them.<br><br>Despite the intimidation, 
                  which he says he experiences “less often these days”, Wham says he 
                  simply explains “very rationally” to the employer that his or her helper
                   does not belong to them, and that there is no law that says a maid is 
                  required to stay with her employer at all times.<br><br>“There’s nothing they can do. We haven’t violated any laws,” he says confidently.<br><br><strong>Impact and recognition</strong><br><br>Despite the challenges he and HOME face, the organisation helps between 1,000 and 1,500 <span id="lw_1327462742_5" class="yshortcuts">foreign workers</span> each year on various human rights issues.<br><br>“What
                   we see is probably the worst of the lot,” he said. “We can’t say it’s 
                  indicative of the scale (of conditions faced by low-wage <span id="lw_1327462742_6" class="yshortcuts">foreign workers</span> here), but the fact that these do happen shows that there are gaps in our policies that need to be corrected.”<br><br>Yet,
                   he estimates that the number of people HOME helps amounts to less than 
                  one per cent of the total number of foreign workers in Singapore now, 
                  which he believes should have hit — or even exceeded — one million by 
                  now.<br><br>“We only see these because they happen to find us,” he adds.
                   “There are so many others out there who probably have no idea we 
                  exist.”<br><br>Wham’s passion for the cause has been recognised. Two 
                  awards were conferred upon him recently — independent political research
                   initiative Think Centre gave him the Human Rights Defender Award, while The Online Citizen at its inaugural awards named him Social Worker of the Year 2011. <br><br>His joy at receiving these awards, however, comes partly from the knowledge that they help raise awareness for <span id="lw_1327462742_7" class="yshortcuts">foreign workers</span>’ plight.<br><br>“It
                   adds recognition to the importance of the migrant worker cause. That 
                  for me is significant; it’s a cause that’s not very popular… so anything
                   that helps to raise the profile of the issue is good,” he says.<br><br>Wham says he is driven by the stories of injustice and mistreatment he hears each day, whether or not he’s heard them before.<br><br>“I’m
                   amazed at how I still get shocked and outraged (hearing these stories),
                   even though it’s the same thing every day. I go to work with a sense of
                   déjà vu,” he says with a laugh. “You need that anger, that sense of 
                  justice, otherwise it becomes another case… and you don’t do the work 
                  any justice.”</p>

              <p>you really think life is hard there? their country welfare so good so bochap and no taxesthat if they are complacent they can - live. most who came over are greedy ones, they want to earn quick money - if possible the esy way out. or some who are rally in devbts (i ask why?) have to earn money quick. so they flock here.</p>

              <p>in my other posts i already wrote why sg gahmen is sucking dry everything from doing businesses here, and tehy open one on avenue - a distored miracle of hope - cheap labor market so that bosses can draw some comfort that cheap abundantly redundant labor is avaialble - all made possible by the gahmen! then gahmen double the happiness cna taxe from these cheapo foreign labor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              sees is pity and grow up help the enemy call them family. it will
              be the same no matter what you are. grow up in the wild with tigers
              you will no doubt be like one. these is sending the wrong signal to

              <p>Sometimes its hard to tell. Its like everyone who comes to the community law centre seeking legal advice, 90% of them will claim they did no wrong. But how can u tell ? Will you turn them all away ? What if there is 1 out of 100 that is genuine ? Not easy man... still waiting on the development of The Intention Machine 2000. lol</p>

              <p>this guy family is really screwed! maid are really redundant if the woners are not lazy. and why not sgreans nany or house keeper? nope becasue maid is fuking cheap they can mark down the price and maids they can control like the lesser human sgreans like slaves. if they started hiring sgreans housekeeprs, sgreans will have jobs. if gahmen control and limit maids influx 50 percent or even lesser by thge passing years, more sgreans will have the jobs. the problem is with the cheap trashe businesee, more people will turn into business and gahmen in turn can taze them and the labor trashes a win win situation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
