              <div>SINGAPORE: Tuberculosis screening is being offered to residents of Block 203 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 after six cases of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) were found there.</div>

              <div>Member of Parliament (MP) for Ang Mo Kio GRC Koh Poh Koon was on site on Thursday (Jun 16), speaking to residents to share information about TB. Dr Koh also applauded Dr Cynthia Chee, the clinician who first made the connection between the TB cases.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“All of us have seen many patients on a daily basis, and the amazing thing is how she connects six patients over a four to five year period... Many of us would link patients by name, maybe by surname or family name, but to link addresses over a period of four years I think is a very astute observation.”</div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>Dr Koh noted that while the screening was not mandatory, he cautioned that it is “important for residents to understand the disease process of TB” and to visit a doctor should they experience symptoms such as having a cough or fever.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Dr Koh also said that grassroots volunteers and MOH officials posted pamphlets under the doors of those who had not been at home last night, and would continue to make visits over the next few nights.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“I guess there will be no way we can cover this one hundred percent because some might be overseas and some may not be home the time we visit. But we will make sure that the information is put under their door, so as and when they are home, they can read it at their leisure,” he said.</div>

              <div>Taxi driver Ani said that she would bring her four-year-old daughter to the hospital for a skin test as recommended by officials last night. While she was unconcerned for herself, she said: "I think it's best if we just stay at home and not go out at all.”</div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ang Mo Kio TB cluster: 2 possible active cases found</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (Jul 4) that two residents of Block 203 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 may have active tuberculosis (TB), based on the results of chest x-rays from the on-site screening exercise conducted last month.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Authorities offered the free screenings after an unusual cluster of six multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) infections was detected at the block.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In a news release on Monday, MOH said that the two possible active TB cases are currently being followed up on for treatment, monitoring and contact tracing. DNA fingerprinting analysis will be conducted to ascertain if they are related to the unusual cluster of MDRTB and this may take some time.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MOH said that a total of 223 residents and former residents were screened on-site from Jun 16 to 19. Of these, 164 tested negative for TB and do not require follow-up action.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>LATENT TB CASES IN BLOCK 203 WITHIN EXPECTED RANGE</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MOH added that 45 residents may have latent TB, which is likely caused by past exposure to the TB bacteria, but that these cases are not infectious. As it is not possible to determine the specific strains of latent TB, as a precaution, these residents have been advised to monitor themselves for any TB symptoms, and will be followed up by the Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) on a six-monthly basis for the next two years.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>To date, treatment has started for four individuals who were found to have latent TB through the on-site screening exercise.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MOH added that the rate of latent TB among those who were screened on site is within the upper end of the expected baseline prevalence range. It said: "As latent TB is prevalent in Singapore’s population, the baseline prevalence of latent TB among residents in Block 203 is expected to be up to 23 per cent, taking into consideration the demographic profile and other factors.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"The rate of latent TB among those who were screened on-site (not including those screened on Jul 2) is about 22 per cent, within the upper end of the expected baseline prevalence range."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It noted that people with latent TB show no symptoms, do not feel sick and cannot spread TB to others, and that about 90 per cent of them will never develop active TB in their lifetime.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Additionally, three Block 203 residents were found to have previously contracted TB earlier in life and had completed treatment. According to MOH, their abnormal chest x-ray results were likely a result of scarring from their previous infection and are not related to the Ang Mo Kio cluster of MDRTB.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MOH said that residents and former residents of Block 203 can continue to make appointments for free TB screenings at the TBCU and at SATA clinics in Ang Mo Kio. </div>
