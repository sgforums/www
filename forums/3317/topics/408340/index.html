              <p>Yio Chu Kang Secondary School will be celebrating its 45th anniversary this month and STOMPer Buntalk is unhappy that the school has asked its students to contribute $50 for the celebrations.<br><br>The STOMPer explained that even the performers have to pay, even when they are contributing to the celebrations.<br><br>The STOMPer wrote:<br><br>“Yio
               Chu Kang Secondary school will be celebrating its 45th anniversary this
               coming month and last week they asked the performers to sell the 
              tickets at $50 each. <br><br>“And today, they actually forced everyone 
              in the school to contribute $50 from Edusave and it is compulsory, even 
              some Edusave accounts are empty. <br><br>“They will have to pay in cash. <br><br>"In
               a letter sent to all the students, it states: ‘To achieve a high 
              standard of productions for this musical, we have invested heavily in 
              engaging the expertise of various specialists and vendors in training 
              the students. We seek your support in releasing $50 from your 
              child's/ward's Edusave Account to help defray some of the cost’ <br><br>“And
               from what I know, these ‘expertise’ are instructors who are paid by the
               students yearly, by Edusave to teach different areas of talent such as 
              the Enrichment programme which is in the school timetable so I don't see
               the need to pay another $50 where the students have already paid.<br><br>"Even the performers have to pay for it where they do not get to view the performance at all.<br><br>“Plus the performance only includes Dance, Drama, Band and Choir. Does that really worth that much of money?<br><br>“Or
               are they just trying to get more money out of it? If the school doesn't
               have that much of money then they shouldn't even host this celebration 
              and having the programme at all.”</p>
