              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says while a strong 
              economy will always be a priority, Singapore must also build a united 
              society which leaves no Singaporean behind, and a well-functioning 
              political system that delivers good government to Singapore. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of Singapore's seventh President Dr Tony Tan at the Istana on Thursday. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee said 
              Singapore faces considerable challenges. And to surmount them, 
              Singaporeans must remain cohesive and united, supporting one another, 
              and making tough choices together. <br><br>Then the country can continue to progress and prosper, and create more opportunities and a better life for everyone.<br><br>Mr Lee noted that the recently concluded general and presidential elections were fiercely contested.<br><br>In
               the Presidential Election, some candidates championed various policies 
              while campaigning, even though policymaking is the responsibility of the
               government and not the President. <br><br>Mr Lee said the debate was intense, at times even divisive. <br><br>But now both elections are over and voters have decided. <br><br>Prime Minister Lee stressed that Singaporeans need to come together again and move forward as one people and one nation.<br> <br>Mr Lee also spoke about the custodial functions of the President who holds the second key to unlock the reserves.<br><br>He said the government will continue to be prudent and build up the reserves year by year. <br><br>But
               he noted that there will surely be future occasions when the government
               will have to seek the President's approval to draw on the hard-earned 
              past reserves again.<br><br>Mr Lee said it could conceivably happen 
              within the term of Dr Tony Tan as President, if the dangers facing the 
              world economy escalated and precipitated a major crisis. <br><br>In such
               an eventuality, Mr Lee assured the new President that the government 
              will work with him to handle the request and decision deliberately, 
              systematically, and in the best interests of Singaporeans.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee noted that Singapore's elected presidency is a unique institution. <br><br>It
               has been created within a parliamentary system of government for the 
              specific purpose of instituting certain vital safeguards, particularly 
              to protect the past reserves and key appointments. <br><br>But Mr Lee 
              added that it remains a parliamentary system, and as in all 
              parliamentary systems there is still only one centre of power, which is 
              the government, as pointed out by President Dr Tony Tan.<br><br>Prime 
              Minister Lee said: "We need to continue to develop and adapt this 
              important institution from time to time, to take into account new 
              circumstances and our growing experience. <br><br>"This will give 
              Singapore a more resilient and stable political system that continues to
               deliver good government for the benefit of citizens. <br><br>"But the 
              fundamental purpose of the second key will not change: to have the 
              President and Council of Presidential Advisors act as a safeguard to 
              ensure that our reserves are not squandered, and the integrity of the 
              public service is protected."<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
