              <p><strong>Disabled librarian takes on three-day journey around S'pore for charity</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Charitable contributions may be drying up during
              these tough times, but one disabled man hopes to counter that by
              raising S$200,000.
              <br> <br>So far, he has only raised S$67,000 of his target by making a
              three-day journey around Singapore and fundraising will continue until
              he meets it.
              <br> <br> Librarian Dennis Kweh suffers from spinal sclerosis which has stunted his growth, and he has weak lungs so he tires easily.
              <br> <br> But that hasn't stopped him from organising and completing a three-day sports quest to raise funds for charity.
              <br> <br>Starting off from Pasir Ris, Kweh travelled on all types of
              terrain, through housing estates, forest trails and finally through the
              city centre, completing a total of 200 kilometres.
              <br> <br>Kweh said he encountered many challenges on his journey, and
              travelling in the intense heat was by far one of the most difficult
              part of his journey.
              <br> <br> Travelling with eight volunteers, Kweh kept hydrated throughout the three days.
              <br> <br>"The first day was the longest day. We started at 10 am and ended
              at almost 10:30 at night. It was an endurance test for everyone, not
              just myself," said Kweh.
              <br> <br> But it was also support from his employer that helped him complete his journey.
              <br> <br>"The senior management was very supportive and they encouraged NLB
              (National Library Board) staff to be part of this whole process. There
              were people who actually came out and said I will volunteer to run with
              you, keep you company and keep pace along the way," said Trudy Loh.
              assistant director of Community Partnership &amp; Outreach, Natioinal
              Library Board. <br> <br> Member of Parliament Penny Low who joined Kweh for parts of the journey looks forward to working with him in future.
              <br> <br> The money raised is for the Spastic Children's Association of Singapore
              to invest in assistive devices for the disabled, such as Kweh's
              motorised wheelchair which has helped him through his arduous
              charitable journey. </span></p>
