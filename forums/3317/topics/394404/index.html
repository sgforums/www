              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Changi Airport has bounced back from third placing in 
              2009 to become the "World's Best Airport" this year in Skytrax World 
              Airport survey. </span></p>
              <p><span>In the annual survey of travellers worldwide last year, Changi was
               placed third, trailing behind Seoul's Incheon and Hong Kong. But this 
              year, Changi overtook Incheon and Hong Kong to top the ranking. Changi 
              also won the Skytrax award for Best Leisure Amenities.
              <br> <br> This is the third Best Airport award Changi has received this year. Last
               month, the airport won the Top Worldwide Airport by Wanderlust and Best
               Airport in Asia Pacific by DestinAsian.
              <br> <br> Changi has won the awards by Wanderlust and DestinAsian eight and five 
              times
              <br> respectively.
              <br> <br> Since its opening in 1981, Changi Airport has won more than 340 airport 
              awards.
              <br> <br> Changi Airport Group's CEO, Mr Lee Seow Hiang, expressed appreciation to
               Changi Airport's many stakeholders for their support. 
              <br> <br> He said: "changi's success would not be possible without the 
              affirmation, encouragement and feedback that we have received from our 
              stakeholders, including the millions of passengers and visitors we serve
               every year. 
              <br> <br> "This has motivated us to continue to improve and innovate. We are 
              honoured to receive these awards and thank everyone for their vote of 
              confidence."
              <br> <br> Mr Lee added: "In an ever-competitive operating landscape, these awards 
              are also a testament to the hard work and tireless efforts of all 
              airport staff and partners in the Changi community to deliver the Changi
               Experience. I want to thank them too for their contributions."
              <br> <br> Mr Edward Plaisted, chairman of Skytrax, said: "This is the largest ever
               Skytrax airport survey with 9.8 million travellers from over 100 
              nationalities taking part, and underlines the unrivalled, global 
              coverage of this study. 
              <br> <br> "Taking pride of place in being named World's Best Airport for 2010 is 
              Singapore Changi Airport. 
              <br> <br> "Changi has always been one of the world's best performing airports 
              during the 10 years of the World Airport Survey, and I congratulate them
               on achieving this number one position in 2010.... in what was an 
              extremely competitive survey environment".
