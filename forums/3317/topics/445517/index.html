              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore's 
              economy is already starting to see a slowdown, particularly in the 
              electronics sector.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But he sounded a note of confidence, saying that Singapore is prepared for the uncertainties ahead.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"The economy... 
              probably will grow slower than last year. We're projecting 1 to 3 per 
              cent growth. We have to take that in our stride, and accept that. But 
              within Singapore, we should continue to build, we should continue to 
              develop, we should continue to prepare ourselves and our next generation
               for the future," said Mr Lee.<br><br>Mr Lee said what the government 
              can do is to improve the education and public transport systems, and 
              build more homes so that young couples can start their families.<br><br>He
               made these points at a Lunar New Year event on Sunday morning in his 
              constituency of Teck Ghee, which is part of Ang Mo Kio GRC.<br><br>He 
              also officiated the re-opening of a wet market and food centre at Block 
              409, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, which had recently been renovated.<br><br>He said more of such markets will be built over the next few years, with the aim of keeping food prices affordable. <br><br>The prime minister also distributed red packets, each with S$150 in cash and supermarket vouchers to low-income residents.<br><br>It's
               a small gesture that brought a smile to housewife Haslinah Mahmood, who
               said she's concerned her Malaysian husband will be affected by the 
              downturn.<br><br>"I'm more worried because he has a work permit. Who 
              knows... if one day he can't carry on working with the work permit, what
               will happen to us?" <br><br>Madam Haslinah has two young children, and she plans to use the money for school fees and transport fares.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

               Tharman said what this shows is the "fact that a certain number of 
              retrenchments occur at all times, even when the economy is healthy as it
               was in 2010".<br><br>Of the 2,090 laid off residents, 1,290 were PMETs.<br><br>"With

              <p><strong>Economy likely to be slower in 2012: PM Lee</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says the economy is 
              likely to be slower this year, but it is not going to be as bad as the 
              recession during 2008 and 2009.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking to 
              reporters after meeting public transport workers during his traditional 
              visit to essential services during the Lunar New Year, Mr Lee said 
              Singapore has to take the slowdown in it's stride.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He indicate that the Government will know what it needs to do.<br><br>The upcoming Budget next month is expected to address the impending economic slowdown.<br><br>On the issue of the growing the country's fertility rate, Mr Lee said providing baby bonuses is not the first thing on his mind.<br><br>But he said the government will look at the scheme and review it from time to time.<br><br>Mr Lee stressed that the critical point is not financial incentives.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said: "The bigger point now is social mood and social climate as 
              well as attitudes of parents and couples towards children, career, what 
              they would like to see as fulfilling and satisfying, rounded and 
              complete satisfaction in their lives and that includes having children 
              that's something we have to get across progressively step by step."<br><br>In
               his Lunar New Year message on January 22, Mr Lee announced that 
              Singapore's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) picked up slightly last year to 
              1.20, up from a historic low of 1.15 in 2010.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: President Tony Tan Keng Yam said Singapore is well positioned to cope with the global slowdown.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is because it has an educated and well-skilled workforce and one of the most business-friendly environments in the world.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said unlike 
              countries with high sovereign debt, fiscal prudence over the years has 
              enabled Singapore to build up its reserves, providing the government 
              with the resources to intervene when necessary to support businesses and
               homes.<br><br>Dr Tan was speaking at the Singapore Chinese Chamber of 
              Commerce and Industry's (SCCCI) annual Lunar New Year celebrations on 
              Monday morning.<br><br>He said even as Singapore braced itself for 
              leaner growth over the next couple of years, the country and people can 
              face the future with confidence.<br><br>This is provided everyone 
              presses on with efforts to upgrade, raise competitiveness and emerge 
              stronger when the external environment improves.<br><br>Dr Tan noted 
              that the government has committed substantial funding support for 
              businesses to invest in productivity improvements and to restructure.<br><br>Businesses
               also must continue to invest in the training of workers, innovation in 
              products and business models, and building capacity to tap on new market
               opportunities in emerging economies.<br><br>President Tan said 2012 is the year of the Water Dragon - one gifted with courage, tenacity and intelligence.<br><br>And
               he's confident that by staying united as one people, Singapore can ride
               any storm with dauntless determination, just like the dragon.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p><br>its rental - now even small space rental is sky high! that the vendors and businessess have to transfer the cost to consumers! that results in higher cost of living, and businesses hire more cheap foreign labor and increase goods prices to offset rentals and taxes. that results paying more for goods and services, no jobs for locals who cannot take lower salary dur to the rising cost of living. the gahmen put us in a loop so that they can make more through rentals and taxes - they are the ones responsible gfor more influx of cheap foreign labor and high cost of living!</p>
