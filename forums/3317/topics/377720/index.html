              <p><strong>Tenants at Orchard Central concerned about slow traffic at mall</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Orchard Central, one of Singapore's newest malls along
              Orchard Road, is having some issues with its tenants. Just four months
              after its opening, some tenants are complaining about slow traffic at
              the mall.
              <br> <br>Besides having Singapore's first indoor rock-climbing wall, the
              12-storey mall has billed itself as a one-stop shopping destination for
              the modern individual, with its range of retail and F&amp;B outlets.
              <br> <br> However, shoppers are reportedly not thronging the mall as yet.
              <br> <br>Poh Yu Seung, base camp manager, Border X, said: "During weekends,
              the mall is okay, but unfortunately on weekdays, I think Singaporeans
              are too busy working so the mall is kind of quiet. But the fact is, if
              you look at Orchard Road on the weekdays, it is terribly quiet." <br> <br> Garage Shop House, which imports foreign brands, said its sales have
              fallen since it opened two months ago. It is one of 20 tenants – out of
              a total of 170 – that have asked for rental rebates, ranging from 50 to
              70 per cent.
              <br> <br>Lim Li Yuen, managing director of Garage Shop House, said: "We came
              into this mall in a different economic situation. At that time, maybe
              we were prepared to pay higher rates... But the market reality is that
              business has dropped by quite a lot."
              <br> <br>Orchard Central's management, Far East Organisation, is already
              taking steps to offer tenants a helping hand. It has been meeting up
              with tenants and it has committed up to S$5 million in advertising and
              promotion efforts to drive traffic to the mall.
              <br> <br>Kelvin Ling, chief operating officer, retail business, Far East
              Organisation, said: "Every mall is different. All the malls need time
              to grow, just like building a brand. There are established ones and
              there are also new ones. Likewise, the established tenants will have a
              following and the new ones might need more help."
              <br> <br>Far East has added that Orchard Central has a unique shopping
              concept with a rooftop garden and art gallery. Shoppers, it said, will
              need time to appreciate such elements.
              <br> <br> In fact, Far East added, some of its tenants are doing well.
              <br> <br>Joshua Yang, managing director, Molecule, said: "I'm quite
              satisfied with the visitorship although it's not the busiest mall in
              Singapore because right now, it's still new. Normally, for a new mall
              to kick in, it takes about six months to a year. So basically, I would
              say there is great potential in the mall."
              <br> <br>"Singaporeans are well-travelled and I think if they have a unique
              niche brand that they are bringing in and they can create excitement
              around these brands, Singaporeans will patronise these new shopping
              centres," said Dr Prem N Shamdasani, associate professor of marketing
              at the National University of Singapore Business School.
              <br> <br>"The challenge is that these brand owners will also have to invest
              and create excitement around the brands, work with the new shopping
              centre management and develop themes and activities around their
              products and new mix of brands."
              <br> <br>Dr Shamdasani added that if tenants and the mall management get the
              formula right, excitement and buzz over a new mall can be generated on
              the onset.
