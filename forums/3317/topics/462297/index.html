              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the government is
               adjusting the balance between its key goals to achieve Singapore's 
              future objectives.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee, who likened 
              these goals to yin and yang elements that complement each other, said it
               is important to strike a balance between them.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee, who is also 
              secretary-general of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), said this 
              at the party's 32nd conference on Sunday morning.<br><br>Stressing that the PAP must set a clear direction, he highlighted three key goals.<br><br>First,
               it wants to achieve a vibrant economy by creating good jobs for 
              everyone, as well as a harmonious society where people can enjoy a 
              balanced and fulfilling life.<br><br>Second, it wants a meritocratic 
              system where people succeed based on their effort and contributions, 
              along with special effort to help those who start off with less to do 
              well in school and upgrade at work.<br><br>Third, it wants to build a 
              Singapore where citizens belong and feel as one, as well as an open, 
              cosmopolitan city that welcomes foreigners with the skills and talents 
              to help the country succeed.<br><br>Mr Lee said the balance between these goals - just like yin and yang elements - will change will over time.<br><br>The government, he said, is in the process of adjusting them.<br><br>He said it is useful to re-examine the goals as Singapore advances as a nation.<br><br></span><strong>Society must continue to be based on meritocracy</strong><span><br><br>Mr
               Lee said meritocracy is a fundamental principle of the PAP, and that it
               is the reason why the party fought for a Malaysian Malaysia and left 
              Malaysia in 1965.<br><br>He noted that there has been vigorous debate on
               meritocracy, with the most recent discussions revolving around the 
              Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and school rankings.<br><br>Mr Lee said some people are even asking if meritocracy is a good thing.<br><br>The
               prime minister said merit not only refers to academic success, and 
              pointed out that while school grades are important, they are not the 
              only measure of ability or determinants of success.<br><br>He described the PSLE as an important examination, saying "it is right that students study hard".<br><br>However, he said, it is "not the be-all and end-all".<br><br>Mr Lee said for those who did well, there is no free ride to success in life<br><br>But
               for those who did not do as well and missed entering their school of 
              choice, Mr Lee said there are more opportunities to develop and succeed 
              later in life.<br><br>He said he is worried when people say that meritocracy is wrong.<br><br>He asked Singaporeans what Singapore would base its society on, other than merit.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said Singaporeans have to be careful not to go overboard and 
              abandon the values and principles which have brought the country this 
              far.<br><br>He pointed out that the ongoing "our Singapore Conversation" process brings people together to discuss these fundamental issues.<br><br>The PAP, he said, has been taking part in this process to develop consensus.<br><br>Mr
               Lee stressed that as the ruling party, it must also lead Singapore; and
               that after all the discussions, the party must be clear about what it 
              stands for.<br><br>The prime minister said for Singapore to achieve its 
              goals, the country needs good leadership - and it is the PAP's duty to 
              offer this to Singapore.<br><br></span><strong>PAP to give WP a "tough fight"</strong><span><br><br>Mr Lee also touched on the PAP's plans in opposition-held Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC).<br><br>He said the party is regrouping in the GRC and will give The Workers' Party's (WP) Members of Parliament a "tough fight".<br><br>He added that the PAP will support its team in Aljunied.<br><br>A branch chairman of a division in Aljunied GRC also shared views on the PAP's plans in Aljunied GRC at the conference.<br><br>Mr
               Victor Lye, who heads the Bedok Reservoir-Punggol branch of the PAP, 
              believes it is not impossible to win back the GRC, even though it will 
              be an uphill task.<br><br>He believes what is needed is a five-per cent swing in votes.<br><br>He said he is focusing on building a team of activists - different from the grassroots network.<br><br>It will be more targeted in its approach and reach out to the PAP's core supporters, as well as swing voters and new voters.<br><br>Mr Lye said he understands the odds against the PAP and stressed the need for party activists to win the hearts of the people.<br><br>Ultimately, he said, the outcome will also be shaped by national perceptions of the PAP and the opposition. <br><br>Mr Lye said while the PAP has made adjustments, the test lies in how connected the people feel towards the party. <br><br>The
               WP team of MPs in Aljunied GRC comprises Mr Low Thia Khiang, Ms Sylvia 
              Lim, Mr Muhd Faisal Abdul Manap, Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Pritam Singh.<br><br>It
               beat the PAP team of Mr George Yeo, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Mr Zainul Abidin 
              Rasheed, Ms Cynthia Phua and Mr Ong Ye Kung in the 2011 general 
              election.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
