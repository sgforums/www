              permanent residence passes granted in 2010, compared to the year before.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Deputy Prime 
              Minister Wong Kan Seng said 29,265 PR passes were issued last year - a 
              sharp drop from the 59,460 in 2009 and some 79,000 granted in 2008.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He added there has also been an improvement in the quality of new PRs.<br><br>The number of new citizens remained relatively steady at 18,758 in 2010, compared to 19,928 for 2009.<br><br>Mr
               Wong, who heads the newly formed National Population and Talent 
              Division, revealed the numbers as he laid out the country's long term 
              strategy for managing population growth.<br><br>Speaking at the 
              Singapore Perspectives 2011 conference, he said the function of the new 
              division is to formulate, coordinate and review all of the government's 
              policies related to population and talent.<br><br>In doing so, he said the focus is on achieving a "sustainable population profile".<br><br>Three
               principles will guide this effort - to preserve and uphold what is 
              distinctive and unique about Singapore, to ensure growth and change 
              benefit Singaporeans, and to remain nimble and prepared as well as make 
              adjustments along the way.<br><br>Mr Wong said what is unique about Singapore is that its people "value hard work, thrift and honesty".<br><br>Singapore has also made multi-ethnic diversity work for it.<br><br>In
               managing the population, Mr Wong said the government will "always be 
              guided by the need to preserve a strong citizen core" and to "maintain 
              stability" in the ethnic mix.<br><br>To ensure that growth and change benefit Singaporeans, he reiterated that citizens' interests will always come first.<br><br>However, he stressed the government will need to tap on immigration to augment the population.<br><br>This is to ensure sufficient manpower for economic growth and to mitigate the impact of an ageing population.<br><br>As
               Singapore is still facing the problem of having not enough babies, Mr 
              Wong said the government will continue to support couples' decision to 
              get married and have children.<br><br>He added authorities will aim for a pro-family environment but he also acknowledged that boosting fertility will take time.<br><br>Preliminary
               estimates show that the country's total fertility rate fell further to 
              1.16 in 2010 - even lower than the 1.22 recorded in 2009.<br><br>"Singapore's
               population story is still evolving. Looking ahead, continual 
              refinements will need to be made at appropriate junctures to ensure that
               Singaproe will remain our best home. Like other countries around the 
              world, we must continue to welcome suitably qualified people to work and
               live in Singapore and contribute to our society," said Mr Wong.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>"The Party has put forward nineteen reforms that we want to make to put Singaporeans first (<a href="http://votingrp.wordpress.com/about/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://votingrp.wordpress.com/about/</span></span></a>). These include stricter curbs on foreign labour, a minimum wage, reform of housing policy to deliver affordable housing to those who need it, universal comprehensive medical insurance, a basic old age pension, <strong>giving you control over your CPF savings</strong> and a stake for Singaporeans in our sovereign wealth funds. "</p>

              <p><br>There will be 2 elections this year. One is the general election and the other is the president election in August. So PAP has to schedule the general election in the first half of the year so as not to clash with the president election. Hope there will be no walkover for president election.</p>
