              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bukit Batok linkway roof collapses after lorry crashes into it</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: A lorry driver crashed into a linkway in Bukit Batok West on Friday morning (Jun 17), causing the linkway's roof to collapse and crush at least one car.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>No one was injured in the incident, which occurred at 9.37am, according to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). The lorry driver, who is in his 60s, has been arrested, the police said.</div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>The linkway, located between Block 116 and 118 Bukit Batok West Avenue 6, collapsed after the lorry driver forgot to lower an attached crane arm before driving through and crashing into the roof, according to a flyer given to residents by the Jurong-Clementi Town Council.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The lorry is owned by Tai Hoe Building Products, the flyer said.</div>
              <div><br></div>

              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>A stationary car was seen crushed by the collapsed roof when a Channel NewsAsia reporter visited the scene at about 11.20am.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Bukit Batok MP Murali Pillai, who is currently overseas, told Channel NewsAsia that he will be meeting with the owner of the damaged car after his return to Singapore. Mr Murali said he will personally give the car owner legal advice on pursuing a compensation claim.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The town council said it is working to clear the car park as soon as possible. Mr Ho Thian Poh, General Manager of Jurong-Clementi Town Council, said: “We're dismantling now, but the structure is huge, so we have to cut it into sections to carry it. It's a very delicate process that involves experienced engineers and workers. That's our priority at the moment."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Bukit Batok resident Jeremy Chua, who was on his way home from breakfast, said he heard a loud crash in the distance at about 9.30am. Assuming that it was some construction work, he did not think much of it until he got closer to the scene.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>"When I reached the far end of the path, I saw the collapsed linkway shelter and a lorry with a crane just in front of it," he said. The car was completely crushed by the roof and its alarm was going off, he added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Mr Chua also said curious onlookers started to gather around to take photos. "One of the owners, who drives a Subaru, had a near miss from the collapsed walkway and he quickly moved his car after getting a few snapshots," he added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>When Channel NewsAsia visited the site of the incident on Friday evening, the walkway's roof had been moved, and was placed across a few lots at the estate's open-air car park. </div>

              <p>In a statement issued on Friday afternoon, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) said the structural integrity of the surrounding HDB blocks was not affected by the incident. It cited the professional engineer appointed by the Jurong-Clementi Town Council.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BCA added that it has directed the Town Council to appoint a professional engineer to carry out a detailed investigation and recommend permanent rectification works. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In the interest of public safety, the affected area will be cordoned off until the collapsed and damaged parts of the sheltered walkway have been removed," BCA added. </p>
