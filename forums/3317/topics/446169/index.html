              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>DAVOS: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said society and the 
              population will not remain static and Singaporeans and the leaders have 
              to work together to find a new way to govern Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He made the point at a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong said the rapid changes in Singapore society had caused 
              certain unease and disquiet among some segments of the population, and 
              it showed at the polls last May.<br> <br>As to whether one can expect 
              significant political reform in the next five years in Singapore, Mr Lee
               said the situation will continue to change, and Singapore must find its
               own way forward.<br><br>"It is not so simple as to say if we have more 
              political parties we will have a perfectly functioning government. You 
              need more openness, you need more engagement. At the same time you need 
              people to pay more attention to what is happening in their lives and 
              think about what is happening to their country and to us as 
              Singaporeans. This calls for effort on both parts - Singaporeans and 
              government," said Mr Lee. <br> <br>Rising inequality in the world, a hot
               topic at the meetings here in Davos, was also raised during the 
              interview with Mr Lee. And he said Singapore tackles the issue in 
              multiple ways.<br> <br>That includes making education, healthcare and 
              public housing more accessible to the people, as well as the Workfare 
              scheme to help supplement wages.<br><br>"We make sure that everybody 
              starts with some chips in life, you don't start with zero. If you're 
              poor in Singapore, it's no fun, but I think you're less badly off than 
              in any other country in the world, including in the US," said Mr Lee. <br> <br>Mr Lee was also asked why the ministerial pay was revised recently. <br><br>He
               said that ministers' salaries became an issue at the 2011 general 
              election and he had appointed an independent committee to look into it 
              after the election.  <br><br>"They decided that the principles were 
              sound - you have to pay competitively - but they recommended a different
               benchmark and a different number and we accepted it. I don't think it 
              will be the last word on the matter but it is a very difficult issue 
              because it is important that we get the right quality of people into 
              government," said Mr Lee. <br> <br>There were also some light moments 
              during the interview, where Mr Lee was asked about following in the 
              footsteps of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and what it is like to have that legacy.<br> <br>"I don't know I have never not had it. (laughter) It's tough enough but you have to live with it," said Mr Lee. <br> <br>And was Mr Lee Kuan Yew a strict disciplinarian? <br><br>"He
               had expectations... but he left me to do my own thing, he didn't push 
              me into this, and neither would it have worked had he done so. I had to 
              make up my mind whether I wanted to go this way," said Mr Lee. <br> <br>Similarly, Mr Lee said his children will have to make up their own minds about going into politics.<br> <br>But he said the odds are not on it at the moment. <br> <br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p>I reject more minority over majority rule. 50 years of minority over majority, peranakan over chinese, I consider to be enough. Father and son and other peranakan allies all in power for long time already. Now all the chinese and other local cultures all weakened due to this problem ofÂ minority over majority.</p>
              <p>The problem should be settled in a progressive way, not reactionary way.</p>
