              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Giving Singaporeans a bigger say in both national and
               municipal issues is a key way for communicating and connecting with the
               electorate, say MPs from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The need for the PAP
               to respond to Singaporeans' desire for greater engagement was 
              highlighted as one of the Party's shortcomings, following a review of 
              its performance in the last general election.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Edwin Tong, MP 
              for Moulmein-Kallang GRC, said that since the general election in May, 
              grassroots leaders at the Jalan Besar division of Moulmein-Kallang GRC 
              have been busy looking at different ways to share the constituency's 
              programmes with residents.<br><br>Mr Aldrick Tay, grassroots leader for Moulmein-Kallang GRC, said: "Five years down the road, it is going to be tough.<br><br>"As
               in Jalan Besar, the younger generation is playing a very important role
               as in the latest GE. And, five years down the road, the competition is 
              much more.<br><br>"I don't think we (should) just engage through Facebook, Flicker, Youtube or Twitter.<br><br>"What
               we need to do is (to) emphasize a lot of rightful information on the 
              website on new media channels to let the younger generation know that 
              they have a role to play in Singapore politics."<br><br>MPs and 
              Ministers are already taking the lead, by posting issues on their blogs 
              and seeking the views of Singaporeans in policy formulation.<br><br>Mr 
              Edwin Tong, MP for Moulmein-Kallang GRC, said: "Not more than half a 
              year ago, the PAP thought that this was noise. It was not relevant and 
              this was a small proportion of people.<br><br>"I think that has changed.<br><br>"And,
               that viewpoint change is very important to me because that means it's a
               recognition that you can look into what's on the blogs and websites to 
              get a sense of what the ground sentiment is.<br><br>"And with that, you start taking steps to be more organised.<br><br>"There
               is a lot of misimpression on the Internet. It represents good views but
               at the same time when there are misimpressions, you have to correct 
              them.<br><br>"The PAP has to be organised in correcting them, the 
              government must issue statements and we have seen how some of our senior
               ministers have embraced it."<br><br>MP for Sembawang GRC Ong Teng Koon added that: "Emails and Facebook messagings have been useful to me.<br><br>"Previously,
               residents brought their issues to MPs during MPS (Meet-the-People 
              Sessions), block visits or walkabouts. Now, they can engage via online 
              tools.<br><br>"Residents often have a hectic lifestyle, so they 
              appreciate the option to bring up issues at their convenience. This 
              might mean more work for myself and my activists, but it is part and 
              parcel of the digital age that we live in, and it allows us to engage 
              and serve residents more effectively.<br><br>"Posters, namecards, calendars now come with the MP's email and Facebook addresses to bring about more awareness."<br><br>Views shared by residents can also be useful for MPs during their debates in Parliament, said Mr Zaqy Mohamad.<br><br>Mr
               Zaqy Mohamad, MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC, said: "The first few years were
               about the PAP sensing the platforms and understanding how to use it.<br><br>"Now
               it's really how to use these platforms for political mileage and 
              political advantage and as well as not just engaging but to a certain 
              sense also.<br><br>"How you can use crowd sourcing, sharing ideas, 
              residents telling you how you can do things better or are there gaps in 
              what we are doing today and these are ways we can solicit feedback and 
              that helps a lot.<br><br>"MPs for example, you could sense people's 
              opinions on certain things you want to say in Parliament and this gives 
              normal citizens the ability to try to put their voice, have their voices
               heard in parliament as well so you can carry certain views.<br><br>"The
               MPs can also use the new media for political activism, something they 
              stand for, a cause, and at the same time brand themselves as 
              politicians.<br><br>"Politicians today, at least in Singapore, what they
               don't really have is the personal branding - what do you really stand 
              for as such that you get labelled sometimes either the media or by the 
              general public.<br><br>"The way you brand yourself online gives an 
              impression of your view on certain things and what you believe in such 
              that when someone looks at an MP or Minister, they know what you stand 
              and what you have been doing and also your beliefs."<br><br>While the 
              social media and the Internet are the buzzwords of the day, Members of 
              Parliament also acknowledge the importance of addressing the needs of 
              the older generation in their respective constituencies and hence the 
              need to continue the traditional house-to-house visits and face-to-face 
              meetings with residents."<br><br>Mr Zaqy Mohamad added: "Face-to-face 
              touch points are just as important, otherwise people are going to say we
               only see our MPs once every five years."<br><br>As MP for Sembawang 
              GRC, Mr Ong Teng Koon puts it, there is value in observing first hand 
              the body language and facial expressions, when an MP comes face to face 
              with a resident. <br><br>Mr Ong Teng Koon said:"She might tell us about 
              her concerns when we shake her hand which she wouldn't have otherwise, 
              and thereby offering us an opportunity to try to help her and make the 
              human connection.<br><br>"Part of the problem with the modern lifestyle 
              is that residents are often at work. We are very happy whenever we have 
              more than 40 per cent of residents at home when we visit.<br><br>"With 
              the average MP having around 100 blocks in the constituency, it takes 
              around one to two years to complete one cycle of visitation. So 
              approximately two to three visitations over an election cycle.<br><br>"Mathematically,
               that would mean there is a fair chance that we wouldn't have reached 
              out to every single resident over the course of five years.<br><br>"Good
               neighbourliness therefore pays an important role here, as we have had 
              cases whereby the resident was not at home when we visited, but 
              neighbours then provided her with my email address and resulted in us 
              being able to assist her."<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
