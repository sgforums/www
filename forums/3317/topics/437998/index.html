              <p>SINGAPORE - The opposition should remain "competitive" in Singapore's political landscape but former Minister Mentor <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lee Kuan Yew doubts if the country will be able to sustain a two-party political system.</span></strong><br><br>Speaking at a forum during the 7th anniversary celebrations of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy yesterday, Mr Lee <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">felt a two-party system will not be good for Singapore.</span></strong><br><br>"Amongst other reasons, I don't believe Singapore can produce two top class teams. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We haven't got the talent to produce two top class teams," he said. </span></strong><br><br>Mr Lee made these comments when responding to a forum participant's question on his vision for Singapore's future. In response, Mr Lee began by saying: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"The question has got to be your vision, not my vision ... It's not for me to tell you what vision you should have."</span></strong><br><br>Mr Lee, who was Prime Minister for more than three decades, said that he had "simpler problems" to tackle when he was in charge of the Government. "We are in the First World and many highly-educated people believe we must have more competition, more pressure on the government," he said.<br><br>"A generation that grows up in a period of affluence believes that we have arrived and as the saying goes the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 'First World Parliament' must have a 'First World Opposition'. </span></strong><br><br>"So the restlessness, whether that leads to better governance, I am not able to say. We will wait and see - how constructive the opposition can be, or will be."<br><br>Mr Lee addressed a broad range of topics during yesterday's 50-minute long dialogue. They included how the European debt crisis would evolve to addressing widening income gaps. He said Singapore has no plans to buy bonds from European countries facing a debt crisis, and felt Europe's monetary union will eventually break apart into two or three separate tiers because of economic differences among the member states.<br><br><strong>'The solution is immigration'<br></strong><br>Immigration, which was a talking point in Mr Lee's dialogue session with Nanyang Technological University students last week, surfaced again as a topic during the forum yesterday.<br><br>One of the participants asked Mr Lee how Singapore can do better in population policy now that the country is facing an ageing population <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">after the stop-at-two children policy.</span></strong><br><br>Mr Lee said <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the policy had "nothing to do with what's happened".</span></strong> He noted ageing populations are seen in developed countries where women are educated and "do not see their future just bearers of children".<br><br>"So the solution is immigration ... and as we age, and there are not enough young people to look after the old,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> then maybe the population will be receptive to taking in more immigrants,"</span></strong> Mr Lee said, and added Singapore could add about 20,000 to 25,000 immigrants annually to grow the population. <br><br>Professor Kishore Mahbubani, Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, then asked Mr Lee <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">what can be done for Singaporeans to understand better the importance of immigration.</span></strong><br><br>Mr Lee replied: "I think we have explained it but they just don't want to see so many foreigners in their midst." The turning point for Singaporeans to understand the importance of immigrants, he felt, would be when they realise the immigrants are needed desperately and "are hurt by objecting to immigrants coming to Singapore".<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another forum participant asked Mr Lee if Singapore's national identity is strong enough to absorb the immigrants.</span></strong> Mr Lee replied that Singaporeans do not accept the need for immigrants because some immigrants do not speak English. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I don't think they (the immigrants) can learn English in their lifetime enough to become Singaporeans. We have to wait for that to happen in the next generation," he added.</span></strong></p>
