              <p>Madam Chin's only child is now prone to violent outbursts after getting 
              hooked onto computer gaming. At her wits' end, she hopes that national 
              service will help to discipline her 17-year-old son.</p>
              <p>According to The New Paper today (Aug 22), two years ago, Mike (not his 
              real name) was well-behaved and did well in his studies and music. 
              However, after he was introduced to gaming by his school friends, he 
              turned violent and would skip school and exams.<br><br>"I hope where I 
              failed as a mother, national service would be better able to discipline 
              him. At least, in there, he will have no time for gaming. I want him to 
              reflect on what he had missed out in the last two years," Madam Chin 
              said.<br><br>Mike would hit his mother when she tried to take his laptop
               away. He has also beaten her for 'asking too many questions about his 
              lifestyle', reported The New Paper in its previous report on the 
              troubled teen on Aug 29, 2010.<br><br>Their arguments would get so bad 
              that police were called to Madam Chin's mother's flat nine times last 
              year. The teen was kicked out of school and has been through five 
              counsellors for his gaming addiction.<br><br>Said STOMPer GamingSiao in response to the article:<br><br>"This
               guy is really addicted to gaming. I used to be quite an addict myself, 
              and I have had friends who were too, but have since quit gaming.<br><br>"Perhaps
               it's a phase of life, I thought. However this fellow is really too 
              much! How can he hit his own mother, play hooky from school and even 
              skip his exams!<br><br>"Although I have a friend who did badly in her 
              final exams because of gaming, she has since quit and is doing really 
              well in school.<br><br>"I'm quite curious to find out what game he is playing, and how it may feed his violent tendencies.<br><br>"Even if he is gaming to earn money (it's possible), I think he has lost his head and is way overboard.<br><br>"I hope NS will 'fix' his behaviour!"</p>
