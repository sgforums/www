              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The women and youth wings of the ruling People's 
              Action Party (PAP) are planning to "pursue policy advocacy", as a 
              response to members' greater desire to have their views reflected in 
              policy decisions.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This new approach could include taking a public position on policies.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In an article 
              headlined "WW to pursue policy advocacy", party newsletter Petir 
              interviewed PAP Women's Wing (WW) chief Grace Fu, who said the group 
              wants to provide a more distinctive voice for women here and allow the 
              party to engage women voters more directly.<br><br>Instead of conducting
               dialogues, where the main speaker, usually a minister, explains 
              policies and answers questions, "participants will now instead be 
              divided into small groups, to allow for more frank and direct discussion
               of issues", the article said. Views could also be collected for a 
              policy paper.<br><br>Ms Fu, who is also Senior Minister of State, said: 
              "Although the PAP won 60 per cent of the votes, the WW suffered a 
              setback - we lost a woman minister. This is a way to galvanise the 
              party, by encouraging the activists to provide input to the 
              policy-making process, so they can actively influence the direction of 
              future policies and push for changes."<br><br>PAP MP Ellen Lee, who also
               sits on the WW exective committee, told Channel NewsAsia that the new 
              direction is also in response to the "new environment". Ms Lee 
              reiterated that the WW has "lobbied" for changes and policy reviews "all
               this while". <br><br>she said: "But it's all on the quiet... now that 
              the environment has changed, we've got more women - not just women MPs 
              but wing members and younger ones... they would like to see their 
              efforts not go to waste in that sense."<br><br>Adding that there have 
              also been people "who asked what is it that we have been doing", Ms Lee 
              said: "It is time for us to come out in the open about what we are 
              doing."<br><br>For Young PAP (YP) chairman Teo Ser Luck, it is about 
              making policy advocacy in YP a "much more systematic process.. and maybe
               share it with the public".<br><br>YP vice-chairman Zaqy Mohamad added 
              that with the "new normal" brought on by the May General Election, there
               are "a lot more sentiments, even among Young PAP members, to do more, 
              because they feel strongly (on issues)."<br><br>Mr Zaqy said: "Right 
              now, there is a sense that there are a lot of opportunities but people 
              do not feel rooted? we need to tell the leadership to find ways for 
              youth to be more engaged so that they can sink their roots deeper and 
              feel more valued."<br><br>On whether there could be a conflict of 
              interest for the PAP's women and youth wings to advocate changes or 
              review of policies crafted by the PAP government, Mr Zaqy felt that PAP 
              backbenchers in Parliament can, at times, be more critical of policies 
              than the opposition.<br><br>He added: "So I think some of the MPs are already leading the way."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
