              <p>The Taiwan government has filed a lawsuit at the High Court to retrieve
              42 million Sing dollars (US 29.8 million) in a multi-million dollar
              diplomatic scandal.</p>
              <p>The lawsuit involves two men, government-appointed Mr Ching Chi Ju and businessman Wu Shih Tsai.<br><br> The duo acted as intermediaries in Taiwan's discussions with Papua New Guinea to establish full diplomatic ties in August 2006. <br> <br> After an agreement was signed between both governments, the two men
              were given 42 million Sing dollars to be used for technological aid to
              Papua New Guinea. <br> <br> The money was deposited into an OCBC Bank account in Singapore under the names of Mr Ching and Mr Wu. <br> <br> But the diplomatic discussions fell through in October 2006 and the Taiwanese government wanted the money back. <br> <br> Then in December, Mr Ching was supposed to meet a Taiwanese government
              official in Singapore to return the money, but did not do so. <br> <br> Subsequently, both he and the money went missing. <br> <br> Mr Wu, a Singaporean, was sentenced to two years and four months jail
              last October after being convicted of forging a document in 2008.<em> <br> <br> </em>He had tried to mislead officials into thinking that the money was still in an OCBC Bank account in Singapore.<br> <br> The Taiwan government has since retrieved 2.1 million Sing dollars from Mr Wu. <br> <br> Mr Ching will be testifying at the trial via a video conference from the United States.<em> <br> <br> </em>He claims that some 14 million Sing dollars was his remuneration
              for being a secret emissary from 1995 to 2006 to improve the
              relationship between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China. <br> <br> The remaining sum was used by Mr Wu to establish a diplomatic
              relationship with Taiwan and Papua New Guinea and also for the two
              men's role as intermediaries. <br> <br> Taiwan's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Huang Chih-Fang, who assumed the position from 2006 to 2008, took the stand today. <br> <br> Mr Huang testified that an account under the two men was set up here
              and that some 42 million Sing dollars were banked into that account. <br> <br> He also said he wasn't aware of any emissary role played by Mr Ching. <br> <br> Mr Huang will continue to take the stand tomorrow.</p>
