              <p>THE body of a 29-year-old man was found on a grass patch in the 
              compound of the Church of Saint Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok East 
              Avenue 2 on Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>The man was found lying motionless at the back of the church compound
               near some classrooms and later pronounced dead at the scene by 
              paramedics, at about 10.20am.</p>
              <p>There were bruises on his face and blood stains on his chest.</p>
              <p>Besides the church, police also cordoned off the void deck of a block of flats opposite the church.</p>
              <p>Members of the church interviewed were unaware of what happened and the church has so far declined comment.</p>
              <p>It is not clear whether there is foul play involved.</p>

              <p>Two possibilities. <br>1) He had halluncination that somebody is trying to kill him, but he was actually pretending to be someone else and trying to kill himself. Probably banged himself against the wall due he died.<br>2) He could have offended somebody and got killed. <br>3) He could have been robbed and killed.</p>
