              <p>isn't it strange that the US Govt has refused to hand over the to the US military to stop the oil spill ?</p>
              <p>isn't it strange that the US Govt has also refused help from other countries ?</p>
              <p>the US Govt has also refused to heed Russia's advice to use a nuke to collapse the seabed and thus closing the oil well even after this technique has been successfully used by the Russians at least 4-5 times.</p>
              <p>THERE ARE NOW AT LEAST 3 CONFIRMED CRACKS ON THE SEABED LEAKING OIL with other cracks expected to form soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how long will it take before all the oceans of the world will be covered with oil ?</p>
              <p>imagine years and years of toxic rain from the oil and the toxic chemicals used to disperse the oil !!!!</p>
              <p>people will have to evacuate all along the coastlines and crops will fail due to toxic rain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>In
              1903, Austrian banker, writer and occultist </strong>Gustav Meyrink(1868-1932) wrote a novella,
              "<strong>Petroleum, Petroleum"</strong>.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">The
              novella tells the story of Dr. Jessegrim decides to go into oil. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.19cm; line-height: 0.64cm;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mexico was standing on connected caverns filled
              with petroleum. Jessegrim resolves to
              blast away the caves. After that, oil flowed from the caverns
              under Mexico into the ocean and form a barrier
              surface, which continues to grow,
              covering the entire Atlantic. The coasts were barren as populations evacuated.</span></span></span></p>

              it will cover all oceans of the world and
              there will be no more rains ever, as water can not evaporate
              anymore. At best, it will rain petroleum."</span></span></span></p>

              <p>oil is traded on the commodity exchange - the price is determined mainly by the banks that traded oil, THERE'S NO SUPPLY OR DEMAND that's affecting the price at all.</p>
              <p>in the 1990s, oil was around USD10 a barrel then it shot up to USD147 a few years ago ! don't tell me demand and inflation shot up by over 14 times ???!!!</p>

              <p>oil is traded on the commodity exchange - the price is
              determined mainly by the banks that traded oil, THERE'S NO SUPPLY
              OR DEMAND that's affecting the price at all.</p>
              <p>in the 1990s, oil was around USD10 a barrel then it shot up to
              USD147 a few years ago ! don't tell me demand and inflation shot up
              by over 14 times ???!!!</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In 1970, Russians drilled Kola SG-3, an oil well at a world record depth
                of 40,230 feet.  Since then,  Russian oil majors including Yukos drilled  more than 310 successful super-deep oil wells.</span></p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; THERE'S NO ANIMAL OR PLANT LIFE AT THAT DEPTH TO TURN INTO OIL !!!</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Russians moved
                three deep-drilling rigs into North Korea, where will repeat the process in Vietnam by drilling through granite
                and basalt, without a single trace of  'decaying marine life' so essential for the 'accepted' production of crude
                 oil.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">They discovered they were naturally  occurring ultra-deep
                oil wells, leaking vast quantities of oil from  the mantle of the earth
                upwards through fractures into "sedimentary
                oilfields", located relatively  close to the surface. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">As oil companies draw oil out of  these oil wells, field
                pressure is  reduced and more ultra-deep oil migrate up from the  mantle and restock the reservoir from below.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">That radically Russian approach to the discovery of oil led to develop huge oil discoveries in regions previously judged unsuitable, according to Western
                  geological exploration theories. The new petroleum
                  theory was used to drill for oil in a region believed to be geologically barren - the Dnieper-Donets Basin. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> Russians began drilling in a supposedly barren
                  region of Siberia. There they developed eleven major oil fields and one giant field.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <span style="font-size: xx-small;">Dr. J. F. Kenney, a Western geophysicists said :</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"to have produced the amount of oil to date that
                  (Saudi Arabia's) Ghawar field has produced would have required a cube of
                  fossilized dinosaur detritus, assuming 100% conversion efficiency, measuring
                  19 miles deep, wide and high." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In short, an absurdity. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In reality, Proceedings of the National
                  Academy of Sciences reported that oil is not a fossil fuel. It is continuously
                  being created by a process deep in the Earth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Dudley Herschbach, a Baird Research Professor of Science
                  and recipient of the 1986 Nobel Prize for chemistry conducted the original
                  experiments to prove how methane is created in the Earth, said that new
                  findings corroborate that the Earth's oil reservoirs refill as
                  they're pumped out. Herschbach said his observations support the view that
