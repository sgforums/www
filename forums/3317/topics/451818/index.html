              Jail, cane for four youths involved in Downtown East riot
              
              SINGAPORE: Four more youths who were part of a group accused of rioting at Downtown East in 2010 were sentenced to jail and caning on Wednesday.
              
              23-year-old Tang Jia Min received a jail term of six years and three months, as well as six strokes of the cane. 19-year-old Ho Wei Quan was sentenced to five years' jail and six strokes of the cane. 22-year-old Lewis Wee Jun Jie was sentenced to four years and 10 months' jail and six strokes of the cane.
              
              20-year-old Chong Rui Hong was given the lightest sentence - of four years jail and three strokes of the cane.
              
              The district judge described his culpability as "slightly lower" compared with his fellow accomplices.
              
              The four were members of an unlawful assembly that caused grievous hurt to 19-year-old Darren Ng Wei Jie at the foyer of Downtown East on October 30, 2010.
              
              One or more members of the group stabbed and slashed the Republic Polytechnic student with knives, choppers and a screwdriver.
              
              Ng, a member of the "Fong Hong San" gang, died of multiple injuries.
              
              Previously in mitigation, the lawyers of Ho, Wee and Chong highlighted the relatively minor role their clients played in the incident. However, the court heard that Tang had played a "very instrumental part".
              
              Deputy Public Prosecutor Peggy Pao emphasised that Tang was not a bystander and was "very much part of the active group that confronted the victim". The court also heard that Tang had a string of previous offences, including snatch theft and mischief.
              
              Six of the 11 accused have been sentenced so far.
              
              Jason Chew Wei Beng, the first of the group to be prosecuted for rioting, was given four years' jail and six strokes of the cane, while 21-year-old Puay De Feng received five years' jail and six strokes of the cane.
