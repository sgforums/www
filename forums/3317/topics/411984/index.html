              <p>A barefooted woman was seen kowtowing to her angry husband in front of their children at an HDB void deck. STOMPer BowWow,
               who saw the photos in The New Paper today (Sep 28), thinks some 
              Singaporean women are just too subservient and would not stand up to 
              their men, even when they are being abused.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"I read story and saw the photos in The New Paper today.<br><br>"It
               was not really known what had happened, but apparently, the kids and 
              their mother were punished by the husband because one of the children 
              had left the house without permission.<br><br>"And it seemed the two boys were also made to run around the block for hours.<br><br>"Even
               as a guy, it made me really angry to see the photo of the woman down on
               her knees and bowing her head, hitting it repeatedly on the concrete 
              ground. There was also a photo showing bruises on her head.<br><br>"What kind of man would do such a thing to a woman? It's such a cowardly act, abusing someone weaker than him.<br><br>"And what's even more shocking to me is, why did the woman do it?<br><br>"What
               happened to her pride? No matter how much she loves her husband, she 
              should never have done something as degrading as that, especially not in
               front of her kids!<br><br>"I think some Singaporean women are just too 
              subservient. Personally, I know girls who were beaten up by their 
              boyfriends, but refused to stand up to them, because they thought their 
              undying love could soften their men.<br><br>"All I can say is that, it's
               pure nonsense. No man has the right to physically abuse and degrade 
              you, so please stand up for yourselves, girls!"</p>

              <p>I'm more worried about the long term effect. On how her kids would view her in future, will she still be able to command respect from them? Would their kids in future hit on their wives too? </p>
              <p>Hope more girls would be willing to speak out. Love does not equate to beating. But I'm very sure nowadays girls are more equipped to walk out! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>This is so sick. The sons will grow up looking down on women. Are the authorities doing anything about this? If this was USA, women NGOs would be up in arms for this guy. I can't believe that in UK, when a woman dump a cat into a bin, there were thousands of facebook users threatening her life and she is also charged in court for abusing animals. However in this case, nobody is bothered. So she returns back to her husband and the monster continues to abuse his wife and kids. All PAP cares is to feed their rich supporters, nobody cares about social problems.</p>
              <p>Singaporean women subservient? I don't think so but I am throuroughly surprise that this woman would go to such extends to obey her husband.</p>

              <p>Hmm.... Stealing is wrong, when compared to hands being chopped off in Islamic law, this is definitely better. But why would she steal a shoe, who knows the inside story?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My guess is:</p>
              <p>This man cannot provide a happiness family, because he lost in gambling (The event occured in MacPherson area which is known to be a "complicated" place) and thus unable to provide the family with the basic needs.</p>
              <p>Then the wife, no money to buy new shoe, hence steal one as her shoe was broke.</p>
              <p>Then kena punished by this hubby, but one of the son cannot take it, so instead run out to become this end-result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So who's fault again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Source: If the wife can ask for water from her neighbour, I bet that they have owe utility bills.</p>

              <p>His brother, who appeared when the gate opened, shouted at us to "get lost" and then grabbed a badminton racquet and gestured aggressively.</p>
