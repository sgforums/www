              <p>She had to turn her head to the right to listen to the questions with her left ear. Her pair of broken spectacles was taped back with sticky tape.</p>

              <p>The mother and the boys, aged nine and 10, were later told to kneel and prostrate in front of the flats and ordered to stay outdoors for seven hours.</p>

              <p><strong>By Zaihan Mohamed Yusof</strong></p>
              <p>NEIGHBOURS saw the barefoot woman kowtowing to her angry husband at the foot of the HDB block.</p>
              <p>On her knees, she bowed her head, hitting it repeatedly against the hot floor.</p>
              <p>Her two sons flanking her seemed to be giving her encouragement.</p>
              <p>For three hours on Sunday afternoon, the woman and her sons were forced to run round their Circuit Road block about 40 times, neighbours told Lianhe Wanbao.</p>
              <p>Apparently, they were being punished because one of the boys had left the flat without asking for permission.</p>
              <p>What man would inflict public humiliation on his loved ones, punishing them in such severe fashion in front of their neighbours?</p>
              <p>Lianhe Wanbao couldn't find out because the man turned nasty on its team.</p>
              <p>When The New Paper team visited the family yesterday hoping to get some answers,we saw one of the sons outside the flat.</p>
              <p>When he was asked if he was the one pictured in the Lianhe Wanbao report, he merely shrugged at first.</p>
              <p>Then he turned aggressive and flung the contents of his soft drink at us.</p>
              <p>He threw the soft drink can from the third-storey corridor to the ground below before kicking the front gate of his flat to get his mother to open the door.</p>
              <p>When she opened the door, his brother, dressed in an all-white school uniform, was just as aggressive.</p>
              <p>He shouted at us to "get lost" and then grabbed a badminton racquet and gestured aggressively.</p>
              <p>According to the Lianhe Wanbao report, the boys, who looked to be of primary school age, were seen carrying their school bags as they ran with their mother.</p>
              <p>One neighbour recalled seeing the man standing on the third floor corridor and shouting at them in Mandarin: "You better run faster...If you don't, I will punish you more."</p>
              <p>None of the residents dared to intervene as it was said that the man had a reputation for being bad-tempered.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, one of them helped the woman and her tired sons by giving them a quick drink when the man was not looking.</p>
              <p>The neighbour, who also gave them tissues to wipe their perspiration, told Lianhe Wanbao: "The woman told me, 'Don't ask (what's happening)...Quick, give it (water) to me...I don't mind tap water'."</p>

              <p>Later, the family could be seen under a covered walkway near the block.</p>
              <p>The father stood in the shade while the mother and her sons stood in the afternoon sun.</p>
              <p>He was heard shouting: "Do you know how to kneel and kowtow?"</p>
              <p>One of the sons gestured to his mother to do what the man had ordered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              <p><strong>Bruised</strong></p>
              <p>Neighbours told Lianhe Wanbao that the woman bowed at least three times. They reported seeing that her forehead and knees were bruised.</p>
              <p>Yesterday,when we tried to speak to the mother, her forehead was still black and blue. There seemed to be dried blood on her lower lip.</p>
              <p>One resident told Lianhe Wanbao that even if the boys had done wrong, they should not have been punished so harshly.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, a neighbour, who gave his name only as Mr Samat, told The New Paper that the boys "were no angels". The ground-floor resident claimed that they were mischievous.</p>
              <p>Mr Samat said: "I think it was one of them (the boys) who had started a fire last year by throwing a lit paper onto one of the neighbours' canvas which was drying outside.</p>
              <p>He and three other people saw the boy hurling the soft drink can yesterday.</p>
              <p>"We were not surprised when we saw him throw the can when you tried to approach him.</p>
              <p>"These boys are wild. Luckily, nobody was standing below," he told this reporter.</p>
              <p>While Mr Samat was being interviewed, one of the boys flashed a vulgar sign at us from the third floor.</p>
              <p>A neighbour who lives on the fourth floor and did not wish to be named said she often heard shouting from the flat below.</p>
              <p>Said the woman: "I don't speak Mandarin, but from the tone, I know that an adult man is angry at some children."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              <p><strong>Nervous wife</strong></p>
              <p>None of the residents interviewed by The New Paper knewhow long the family has been living there. It is also not known whether the family is Singaporean.</p>
              <p>When tried to ask the boys' mother if she was all right after Sunday's ordeal, she seemed worried, as though she wanted us to leave quickly.</p>
              <p>Her nervousness became apparent barely five minutes later when her husband returned home.</p>
              <p>By then, The New Paper team was on the ground floor. The man stared at us from his corridor and muttered something.</p>
              <p>The police said yesterday that they received a call for help at about 3.30pm on Sunday.</p>
              <p>A spokesman said all the parties were advised accordingly.</p>
              <p>Mr Samat confirmed that he saw the woman and her two sons being questioned by the police. They were later allowed to return home.</p>
              <p>But their front gate had been locked by the man.</p>
              <p>According to Lianhe Wanbao, the three of them huddled outside the flat to share a packet of rice, which hadbeen left by the man.</p>
              <p>An hour later, at about 6pm, they were seen entering the flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              <p><strong>Set limits to punishment before it goes overboard</strong></p>
              <p>TWO lawyers told The New Paper that there were limits to disciplining children, even naughty ones.</p>
              <p>But setting those limits may vary from parent to parent.</p>
              <p>Said lawyer S Balamurugan: "I know sometimes a father needs to discipline his children. But this must be done reasonably.</p>
              <p>"Asking boys to run around for a few hours is just too much."</p>
              <p>In cases where a pattern of abuse can be shown and there's constant ill-treatment by the father, then he could be punished under the Children and Young Persons Act.</p>
              <p>Added Mr Balamurugan: "You don't have to physically abuse the child or hit him to be guilty of this...as long as it can be proven there is continued ill-treatment."</p>
              <p>Another lawyer, Mr Satwant Singh, offered another view, saying: "Was the punishment cruel or extreme? After all, he didn't lay a hand on the boys.</p>
              <p>"The question that needs to be answered is, 'Can society condone such a punishment'?"</p>
              <p>Of course, the children must be aware of why they are being punished, he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Singh said the boys' school should be told of the incident and allowed to intervene.</p>
              <p>"The school can develop a better relationship with the family...There should not be a knee-jerk reaction to get the authorities involved just because someone is not comfortable with the manner a parent disciplines a child," he said.</p>
              <p>Too harsh a punishment could also have repercussions, warns a psychologist.</p>
              <p>Dr Carol Balhetchet, director of Youth Services at the Singapore Children's Society (SCS), expressed concerns when told of the punishment faced by the children.</p>
              <p>The aggression the boys showed towards The New Paper team was just as worrying.</p>
              <p>They could follow the wrong example the father sets, she said.</p>
              <p>"Generally, children are victims. Most of them are not born with this type of aggression," Dr Balhetchet added.</p>
              <p>"What they observe from their parents are mimicked. These learnt behaviours are possibly used by them to solve problems."</p>
              <p>She said the boys' aggression could also be due to their wanting to protect their mother.</p>
