              <p>The woman who gave birth to a stranger’s child after a mix-up in sperm 
              samples has sued those she believes are responsible for the tragic 
              bungle. <br><br>The 36-year-old mother of two is waging a legal battle 
              against Thomson Medical, Thomson Fertility Clinic, and two embryologists
               for general and special damages. <br><br>According to court documents, 
              the special damages, which include the loss of her earnings and medical 
              expenses will amount to about $750,000. General damages are to be 
              determined by the court. <br><br>This landmark in-vitro fertilisation mix-up case is expected to set a precedent here for similar legal battles. <br><br>The
               Straits Times reported that the woman claimed to be in “mental agony” 
              whenever her second child was seen by others to be different from its 
              older sibling, also conceived through IVF.<br><br>She also asked the 
              court to factor in that her second child would have to be financially 
              provided for on a level similar to her sibling. <br><br>The cost of the 
              child’s upbringing had become a cause of concern after her husband, a 
              senior executive in a car company, did not express that he wanted to be 
              named as the child’s father on its birth certificate. <br><br>In a 
              statement to The Straits Times, Thomson Fertility Centre responded that 
              they had "acknowledged the unfortunate incident and accepted its 
              responsibilities in the IVF matter”, adding that they had expressed 
              their sincere apologies and extended assistance, waiving all hospital 
              and doctor’s charges.  <br><br>“TFC will not deny the clinical error was
               made, but the real issue is what the reasonable quantum of compensation
               should be.” It read. <br><br>TFC was fined $20,000 last year for failing to ensure suitable practices were followed in the IVF  procedure. <br><br>Court
               documents showed that the woman and her husband, who are now in 
              Beijing, noticed “marked differences” in their second child’s skin tone 
              and hair colour after it was born in October 2010. <br><br>They later 
              discovered that the baby had a different blood group and further tests 
              showed that there was no paternal link between the child and the woman’s
               husband. <br><br>Court documents filed by the woman’s lawyer, Straits 
              Law’s S. Palaniappan, described the couple as “utterly devastated” and 
              “torn between their love for the newborn on the one hand, and social, 
              legal, and economic implications on the other.”</p>
