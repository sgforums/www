              <p>SINGAPORE, in its push to become a Global City, must not create a 
              'second-rate' Western city, said a Nominated MP who fears this is 
              happening given what he sees as the island-state's obsession with 
              Western content.</p>
              <p>In a hard-hitting speech in Parliament on Friday, NMP Calvin
               Cheng did not mince his words, asserting that Singapore is the 'only 
              country in Asia with such an overwhelming hang-up with what is Western,'
               based on his own observations and experience in the media, 
              entertainment and media scene.</p>
              <p>Mr Cheng, who owns a modelling agency, said during the 
              debate on the Ministry of Informsation, Communication and the Arts' 
              budget: 'Singapore needs to recognise that being a Global City does not 
              mean being a Western City; Globalisation also does not mean 
              Westernisation. Singapore must understand that no matter how globalised 
              or modernised it may be, it is still an Asian city.</p>
              <p>'International recognition will also not come from aping the
               West. I strongly believe that it would be futile to try to be the New 
              York of the East, or the Las Vegas of Asia, or build a Harvard of the 
              East. In this globalised world, people are highly mobile - if the 
              original is so easily reachable, there is no attraction in the replica.</p>
              <p>'If one can hop on a plane and visit the real Paris, why 
              visit the Paris of the East? This is I think a common misconception that
               many Singaporeans still have, that West is best, and that imitation of 
              the West is the same as being global and modern.'</p>
              <p>Citing fashion shows as another example, he noted that most,
               if not all of the models used at every fashion festivals here, are 
              Caucasians. Calling this trend 'ludicrous,' he asked: 'Why would 
              tourists want to come to Singapore to see a replica fashion show trying 
              to imitate the runways of the West? Do they also not realise that as an 
              Asian city, a fashion event that is primarily Asian yet international 
              event would be more representative of our country and would generate 
              more international interest?'</p>
              <p>He also slammed fashion and lifestyle magazines for using 
              mostly Caucasian models on the covers and inside stories. 'It is obvious
               that again, our media labours under the false impression that Western 
              is International,' he maintained, and went on to criticise advertisers 
              for also using Western faces in their advertisements.</p>
              <p>'There is an assertion that the content-providers are 
              catering to the tastes and mindsets of consumers, who want to see 
              Caucasian faces, given that they are seen to be more glamorous. I refuse
               to believe this, as believing this would mean that Singaporeans are 
              still stuck with this puerile, colonial hang-up,' said Mr Cheng.</p>
              <p>'Even if this were so, the vicious cycle needs to be broken,
               otherwise Singapore will never be a first rate Global City, but only a 
              second rate wannabe Western City.'</p>
              <p>Urging MICA to go beyond its role as a facilitator and a 
              regulator and be 'an influencer', he said: 'Regulating the hardware, the
               technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for building up 
              Singapore's soft power. It needs to step up, step forward and start 
              setting an agenda on how Singapore's culture can be grown, how we can 
              draw from the richness of our 'rojak' culture, embrace it, be proud of 
              it, so we can truly grow as a nation, and create a Singapore we have an 
              emotional connection to.'</p>

              <p>in my opinion..</p>
              <p>this western culture is ever spreading from the 80's. most of the teens now behave like they're westerners, music/fashion even behaviours at times.</p>
              <p>its all a matter of influence. if we can learn about the good influences, very well, kudos. but if not then it strikes otherwise, may eventually cause some problems in the future.</p>
              <p>people need to know what individuality is, or where their roots are from. also, i feel it is important to ensure that the roots of an individual is emphasised.</p>
              <p>personally i feel many here are not happy about their roots.</p>
