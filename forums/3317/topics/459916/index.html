              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Needy Singaporeans will find it easier to get help, with a shared database for the social service sector.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The integrated 
              information system will be set up in two to three years, providing a 
              history of the cases that are being handled by various agencies and 
              voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Acting Minister for 
              Community Development, Youth and Sports Chan Chun Sing likened the 
              system to the one that is being put in place in the healthcare sector - 
              where electronic medical records of patients are shared across the 
              hospitals and polyclinics.<br><br>Speaking at an annual members 
              conference of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) on Thursday,
               Mr Chan said such a system will be useful, as it is not always easy for
               those who need help to navigate and access the current network of 
              social service agencies and programmes.<br><br>He said: "The clients who
               are seeking help are already in need, so you don't want to make them 
              repeat their stories over and over again.<br><br>"You also want to make 
              sure that the help by the different agencies are coordinated so that 
              while they overlap each other to cover the gaps, there won't be too much
               of a overlap whereby we provide repeated services for areas of need 
              that are already fully covered."<br><br>Mr Chan said this means the 
              first agency must work with the others at the back end, and that it will
               take two to three years to develop the common database, which will have
               the case histories of clients.<br><br>Issues related to confidentiality and privacy will have to be worked out before the system is rolled out.<br><br>Mr
               Chan added: "These are definitely planning parameters that we 
              definitely have to grapple with when we implement the system. We must 
              also ask the clients whether they are comfortable to share this 
              information across agencies that are helping them. So we will definitely
               need to respect that.<br><br>"In fact, that's one reason why we will 
              take our time to work through some of these issues as to who has access 
              to the data and who can share the data."<br><br>Chairperson of the 
              Government Parliamentary Committee for the Ministry of Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), Seah Kian Peng, said: "I think the
               information that's required, will only be the key and critical 
              information that's needed for this purpose.<br><br>"So I think the 
              public will be assured that we do not need much information. We only 
              need those that are critical, and the concerns over privacy are valid 
              and will be of value and be taken intio account in devising and forming 
              this database."<br><br>MCYS will also be looking at different models for
               funding the infrastructure of voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) as
               some are facing challenges in raising funds.<br><br>To help VWOs 
              leverage technology to better serve the needy, the MCYS, NCSS and 
              Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore are conducting a study to 
              understand the existing ICT capabilities and constraints in the sector.<br><br>This
               is part of efforts under the Social Service Sector Infocomm Technology 
              Master Plan to raise the ICT capability of some 500 VWOs and help 
              agencies drive productivity and innovation in the next five years.<br><br>The study will be completed by the first half of next year.<br><br>Mr
               Chan also said his ministry is looking at ways to fund the capital 
              costs of VWOs differently, as some face challenges with fundraising - in
               particular, to cover their share of the capital expenditure.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ac</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think this is good, the funding should also look into contribution from surplus of other charitable organisations, singapore pools, singapore gambling association in sentosa etc, as this a central agency to make life goodness. However, the database is surely a concern, I guess that historical information of patients will never be accessable by other in all costs, and another best option for security measure is to identify patient in the manner of nickname stored in the database <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/messenger.png" alt="messenger.png"></p></div>
