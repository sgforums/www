              <p>i have been reveving this in my hotmail account. one of it is shown here</p>

              <pre><strong>FROM THE DESK OF:<br>MR. KAMAL USMAN,<br>BILLS AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,<br>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,<br>OUAGADOUGOU ANNEX,<br>BURKINA FASO.<br> <br>My Dear Friend,<br> <br>  First and foremost, I want you to accept my apologies for any inconveniences <br>this mail might cause you to read. <br>  I am the Manager of Bills and Exchange Section at the foreign remittance <br>department of African Development Bank here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.<br>  In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15.2m US dollars <br>(Fifteen million, two hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs <br>to one of our foreign customer who died in a plane crash. Since we got <br>information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come <br>over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies <br>for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking <br>guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of <br>kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody <br>behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to <br>make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of <br>kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since <br>nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank <br>treasury as unclaimed bill.<br>  The banking law and guide lines here stipulates that if such money remained <br>unclaimed after fours years, the money will be transferred into the bank <br>treasury as unclaimed fund, The request of foreigner as next of kin in this <br>business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a <br>Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.<br>  I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision <br>of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the <br>business and 50% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for <br>disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the <br>immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged, you must apply first to the <br>bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your <br>bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and <br>effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted. Upon <br>receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the <br>application. <br>  I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free and <br>that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements <br>have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as <br>you receive this letter.<br> <br>Trusting To Hear From You Immediately.<br>Yours Faithfully,<br>Mr. Kamal Usman</strong></pre>

              <p>I once tried to reply one of with a fake account number. They actually replied that they couldn't access that account at all! Duh!</p>
              <p>That means you are telling others that you are trying to access the bank account without the permission of the owners! How stupid!!!</p>
