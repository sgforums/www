              <p>ISA/ ISD can arrest anyone and everyone in Singapore who is suspected to be of danger to the society and the governement without evidence and trial, in other words, ISA/ ISD can pretty much slience anyone who is against PAP, including opposition parties. They write up various ''unjust'' laws so that Singaporeans will never be able to change the government democratically again.

              <p>Aiya, this is a 2007 article lah... old already... anyway, Hong Kong is more densely populated... Hong Kong's Central District is PACKED to the brim with people, but they have more land, albeit 1/3 of it is not suitable for living conditions (mountains). Singapore is low lying, perfect for habitation. Anyway, high population density isn't exactly a good thing you know.... unless you like getting brushed or bumped in public on a daily basis.... and this is especially bad if you're female. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
