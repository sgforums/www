              SINGAPORE: A Singaporean family of six, believed to be on holiday in Australia, met with a car accident near Melbourne on Monday.
              
              The accident occurred near the town of Seymour in the morning just after 7 am local time. The family was heading south towards Melbourne in their Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV).
              
              According to Australian news reports, the father was driving a van along the Hume Freeway before crashing it into a tree.
              
              His nine-year-old son was killed instantly while two other children aged 12 and 15 suffered major head injuries. They were air-lifted to the Royal Children Hospital, where they remain in a critical condition.
              
              The 47-year-old father was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and is in a serious condition.
              
              The 44-year-old mother and a 13-year-old child were sent to the Northern Hospital and are in a stable condition.
              
              Australian police said it could have been fatigue-related, and that the family may not have worn their seatbelts.
              
              "In this early stage (of investigation), it appears it (the crash) was fatigue-related, as in the driver may have fallen asleep. We don't know for sure, but it appears they may not have been wearing seat-belts because several of the passengers were ejected from the vehicle when it rolled over," acting-sergeant Paul Gordon from the Seymour Police said.
              
              The police added that the Hume Freeway is not a high-collision area, and that they were still investigating the accident.
              
              Singapore's Foreign Ministry said it is in contact with one of the injured victims and their next-of-kin in Singapore.
              
              An officer from the High Commission in Canberra is now in Melbourne to provide assistance to the family.
              
              This is the second accident this week involving Singaporeans overseas.

              <p>Aiyoh, Royal Melbourne Hospital is the worst hospital in the world.</p>
              <p>Last time, I accompany my cousin who had painful headaches. Took him to the ER at 10pm. But no doctor see him until 3am. Then while I was waiting at the ER ward, I hear a lot of patients screaming in pain. One Australian elderly woman was suffering abdominal pain was screaming for help for 2 hours, so excrutiating, no doctor went to help her.</p>
              <p>The facilities is tip top, and the equipment is state of the art. They even have helicopter ambulance 24 hours. I saw the pilot came in with ER people carting some trauma victims full of blood into the emergency surgical room. When once they left them at the doorstep with full of blood and cuts all over, nobody came to help them.</p>
              <p>There were only 3 doctors (all foreigners) to service over 100 patients screaming in terror. The doctors were so tired, had panda eyes like half dead from 72 hours work, non-sleep. Only the Aussie nurses and administrators look like so free, sitting by their PCs</p>

              Newly-wed Singapore couple killed in car accident
              
              What was supposed to be a trip of newly-wedded bliss ended in tragedy when a Singapore couple was killed on their honeymoon in New Zealand. 
              
              Just eight days after they tied the knot, Mohamed Najibullah Suhaimi, 26, and Ms Raihana Mohd Rashid, 25, were killed when their car collided with a van in a stretch of road at Mangatawhiri near Auckland on Friday afternoon. According to local reports, the two recent deaths bring the total death toll at this stretch of road to 39 in 12 years -- making it one of the most dangerous roads in New Zealand.
              
              Channel NewsAsia reported that the family has been informed of the accident and has since gone to New Zealand to claim the bodies.
              
              According to the Straits Times, Lt Mohamed Najibullah was working with the Singapore Armed Forces, while Ms Raihana Mohd Rashid was a nurse at KK Womenâ€™s and Childrenâ€™s Hospital.
              
              The two people in the van escaped without injuries.

              <p>This is why when I was in Melbourne recently, I vetoed the idea of driving along the Great Ocean Road.</p>
              <p>The distances involved are great, and I'm not gonna risk driving all the way considering I only have experience driving on our roads.</p>
              <p>Besides, I did my homework and found that following a tour group would not cost much more. Which was what I ended up doing.</p>
