              </p><div>Tang found himself not merely participating in politics, but running for election. His reasons for this decision were very much based on his concerns over what was happening to the Chinese community and other minority communities, in Singapore.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-English speaking Singaporeans, including Chinese, Malays and Indians have, he says, been discriminated against unnecessarily under the PAP policies, particularly, for example the Chinese-educated, the Buddhists, the Taoists, the Hindus and the Muslims.</span> </span></span></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">The discrimination, he says, takes various forms: Nanyang University was restructured;</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">there is no Chinese-language business paper; there is discrimination in the intake of university students, in the engagement of university lecturers and school teachers, in the manning of positions in the army and police forces, and an absence of representation of the non-English-speaking Singaporeans in the decision-making process and in many top government posts.</span> </span></span></strong>These are just a few examples.<br><br>"Once in a blue moon," Tang says, "when world conference on Confucianism was held in Singapore, the PAP would seize the opportunity to launch its massive propaganda to the outside world and hood winked the Chinese communities around the world, especially those scholars in China, into believing that Singapore promotes Confucianism. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is just another fraud."</span></span></strong><br><br>Later, he adds, "Confucianism is not taught in schools – only Confusionism!"<br><br>Tang has been accused of being a Chinese chauvinist because of his comments on education and language. He has been misquoted and his words taken out of context when he tried to describe the richness that words from different languages have to offer.<br><br>"Take the word ‘equity’," he says. "That one word – you can write a book on it. You cannot translate it verbatim into Chinese. It means fairness. It also has legal and technical meanings. It means also having clean hands and a fair mind. It is not possible to translate it into one word. On the other hand, the Chinese word ‘xiao’ is usually translated as piety, or filial piety. But that’s just a small fraction of the concept. You can translate the concept, but not word for word. They distorted my view by accusing me of believing that ideas can only be expressed in Chinese. I have never [been] opposed to learning English." <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">By knowing only English, and not knowing Chinese language, Chinese people miss out on the richness of culture that might be available to them. This loss helps no one. "The Chinese stand to lose by not knowing his own language and culture," Tang says. "Their loss is not a gain to the other races."</span></span></strong></div>

              <p>There will still be a role for english in Singapore, maybe as secondary language or something else.</p>
              <p>English speakers like the peranakans - Tony Tan, Lee Hsien Loong, Harry Lee Kuan Yew etc, their mother tongue english won't be suppressed. English won't be annihilated from this island. There will still be english.</p>
              <p>But english cannot be the dominant language. That is not logical, despite all the PAP propaganda.</p>
              <p>No minorities will suffer, all languages, all cultures will be respected. There will be no suppression or repression of any culture or language, although some necessary adjustments like de-westernisation, de-anglicisation will take place.</p>
              <p>Since all these western and anglo elements of Singapore society are alien imports, I think their root will be weak and there should be no big problems regarding de-westernisation, de-anglicisation.</p>
              <p>Singapore will have to rely on its own local, native cultures and not on alien imports. </p>
              <p>A stronger national state will be the only result of such a policy.</p>
