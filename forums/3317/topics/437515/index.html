              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's former Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, has 
              spoken of how the choice of English as the country's working language 
              has ensured the country's survival.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Launching the 
              English Language Institute of Singapore on Tuesday afternoon, he said 
              that had the nation not chosen English as a working language, it would 
              have been left behind.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee said: "When 
              Singapore became independent in 1965, we had a population that spoke a 
              range of different dialects and languages. This was a result of the 
              colonial education system which favoured the English-speaking, but 
              allowed vernacular schools with different mediums of instruction to 
              co-exist.<br><br>"Political and economic realities led us to choose 
              English as our working language. 75 per cent of the population then was 
              Chinese, speaking a range of dialects; 14 per cent Malays; and eight per
               cent Indians. Making Chinese the official language of Singapore was out
               of the question as the 25 per cent who were non-Chinese would revolt.<br><br>"In
               addition, the geographical reality was and remains today, that 
              Singapore would be economically isolated from the wider world if Chinese
               was chosen. And China then could not be of much help to our economic 
              development."<br><br>He explained that the choice of English as 
              Singapore's "lingua franca" gave all races equal opportunities through a
               common language to learn, communicate and work in.<br><br>Mr Lee added:
               "We kept our original languages by our policy of bilingualism, allowing
               opportunities for people to study their respective mother tongues. This
               built a sense of belonging to their original roots and increased their 
              self-confidence and self-respect. Thus, a united multi-ethnic, 
              multi-lingual people ensured Singapore's survival. Had we not chosen 
              English, we would have been left behind.<br><br>"We are the only country
               in the region that uses English as our working language, the main 
              medium of instruction in our schools. This has given our young a strong 
              advantage of growing up in a multi-cultural multi-lingual society, all 
              speaking the international language of commerce and trade, English, and 
              their mother tongues, Chinese, Malay, Tamil and others as their second 
              languages."<br><br>Mr Lee added that it has also benefited Singapore 
              economically. As an English-speaking society, Singapore has drawn 
              foreign talent to its shores as they found it easier to work and live in
               the country and remain plugged into the global economy.<br><br>He said:
               "There is an intense worldwide competition for talent, especially for 
              English-speaking skilled professionals, managers and executives. Our 
              English-speaking environment is one reason why Singapore has managed to 
              attract a number of these talented individuals to complement our own 
              talent pool.<br><br>"They find it easy to work and live in Singapore, 
              and remain plugged into the global economy. Singapore is a popular 
              educational choice for many young Asians who want to learn English, and 
              they get a quality education. This has kept our city vibrant."<br><br>Mr Lee said one of the challenges ahead is to decide whether to adopt British English or American English.<br><br>He
               said: "I think the increasing dominance of the American media means 
              that increasingly our people, teachers and students will be hearing the 
              American version, whether it is 'potatoes' or 'tomatoes'. They will be 
              the dominant force through sheer numbers and the dominance of their 
              economy.<br><br>"I believe we will be exposed more and more to American 
              English and so it might be as well to accept it as inevitable and to 
              teach our students to recognise and maybe, to even speak American 
              English."<br><br>Turning to the future, Mr Lee stressed that 
              communication skills are one of the most important competencies needed 
              in the 21st century workforce. <br><br>He said Singapore has built a 
              good English language foundation for its students, with achievements in 
              international benchmark tests like the Programme for International 
              Student Assessment (PISA) and Progress in International Reading Study 
              (PIRLS) being well documented.<br><br>But he felt that Singapore can do 
              better and must help every child to attain higher standards in English. 
              Singapore's best students must also be able to hold their own 
              internationally.<br><br>For this, Mr Lee added that the home background played an important role in developing good English language skills.<br><br>So
               to maintain the high standards of English competency in Singapore, he 
              said there is a need to ensure that from the time a child steps into 
              kindergarten, he is exposed to good English. <br><br>Mr Lee said: "Our 
              schools must provide a rich language environment. There must be a strong
               reading culture where children can access and enjoy good books. There 
              must be a culture of oracy. Opportunities must be given to students to 
              speak in English. Students must present information and ideas, to 
              clarify and to debate robustly with each other in English."<br><br>Also, developing a high level of English language competency in students cannot be the work of the English teacher alone.  <br><br>Mr
               Lee said that it is the responsibility of every teacher who teaches 
              subjects in English. They must use good English when they question, 
              speak and write in the classroom and they are the best role models for 
              children, if the young are to be effective communicators.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>It doesn't have to be dominant language, it can be secondary language. Anyway I don't buy the idea that english makes Singapore "attractive". English as dominant language in Singapore makes me want to vomit.</p>

              <p>Harry Lee concocted a fraud in saying that english is "neutral" language and thus can be used as official language since the 25% non chinese won't revolt.</p>
              <p>In the first place Harry Lee failed to mention the fact that his mother tongue is english and thus he and his baba friends would benefit from the policy.</p>
              <p>In the second place, Harry Lee's argument is illogical in that he would rather use a language that only about 5% of people in Singapore understood to act as the "official working language" and thus alienate the rest of the 95% non english speakers.</p>
              <p>This is illogical. You cannot find a state in the world that pursued such policies besides Harry Lee's Singapore.</p>
              <p>He would go to such lengths as to deny the most obvious, the most logical, the most simple solution by using mandarin as the dominant language and instead push for english.</p>
              <p>Of course, knowing that Harry Lee is a Hakka peranakan baba and that english is the mother tongue of the peranakans in Singapore would go a long way in clearing the matter up as to why he is so insistent on using english as the dominant language.</p>

              <p>He would be the last guy in Singapore that I would choose to save dialects. He was the chief figure in suppressing dialects in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Somehow he has an irrational hatred of dialects. It is probably due to the insecurity and inferiority that he feels as someone from a minority group, an outsider, ruling over a majority dialect speaking group. Their dialect languages had to be suppressed. They must forget their mother tongues and speak english.</p>
              <p>In this he is similar to Chiang Kai-shek, who also suppressed dialects in Taiwan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; "> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; ">If Taiwan were a province of China, long-time residents in Taiwan would speak Taiwanese. This may seem counter-intuitive, but if you think about it, it would also be true. I met a Taiwanese immigrant to the US when I arrived in Princeton, and one day, he said something really interesting to me. He told me, "I want to learn Taiwanese." I didn't attach much importance to it at the time, though I was surprised that he didn't know it, but now I think it's a reflection of the problems of identity, history, and politics in Taiwan.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; ">Of course, this Taiwanese friend is descended from a "mainlander," those people who fled to Taiwan after the the CCP soundly defeated the Nationalists. So some would say it's understandable that he doesn't know Taiwanese.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; ">Wrong. Let's look at my personal history as a comparison. My father is from Hubei province, and my mother comes from a Hakka family in Guangdong, so they spoke Mandarin at home. I was born in Guangzhou and lived until I was 5 in a college campus, where everyone spoke the official dialect, Mandarin. Yet even then, I understood Cantonese. After that, I moved to Zhanjiang and went to a public school there. After one month, I could speak Cantonese even though the official language in school was Mandarin. My father never learned Cantonese because he went to Switzerland and then immigrated to the US after a few years in Guangzhou, but my mother, since she lived in Guangdong province her whole life, even though Hakka is her native dialect, spoke perfect Cantonese.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; ">Now let's look at my Taiwanese friend again. His GRANDPARENTS fled the Chinese mainland and went to Taiwan. If we make the same comparison with my life, then we can assume that it'd be at least reasonable if his grandparents never learned Taiwanese, but he is a second generation already, and he still doesn't know.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; ">If Taiwan were a real province and had been integrated into the mainland, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chiang Kai-shek would never have needed to suppress the Taiwanese dialect to such an extent.</span></span></strong> I mean, on the mainland, a lot of TV, all movies, music, government communications, and all schools use Mandarin, and yet people who live in a province that speak another dialect would learn that dominant dialect naturally in one generation.</p>

The local Taiwanese were quite japanized after almost 50 years of Japanese colonial rules. They spoke Japanese, Hokkien or wore Japanese clothings.</span><br><br><span style="color: #282828;">2. The 2 million mainlanders spoke different Chinese dialects, causing communication problems to occur.</span><br><br><span style="color: #282828;">3. There was an urgency to de-japanize the local Taiwanese and sinicize the Taiwanese.</span><br><br><span style="color: #282828;">4. Mandarin became the main tool to create a 'cultural unity' and to overcome the communication problems and to sinicize the Taiwanese population.</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Other dialects were suppressed in Taiwan. For instance, if you speak a Non-Mandarin dialect in school, you will be fined and penalized. Speaking dialects were seen as "uneducated".</span></span></strong><br><br><span style="color: #282828;">However after the removal of martial law in 1987 followed by democratization of Taiwan, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">there is a rise in the movement for protecting and speaking "mother tongue". However, this pertains mainly to native dialects of Taiwan such as Taiwanese Min Nan, Hakka, aborigine languages, which are supported by the Taiwanese government.</span></span></strong><br><br><span style="color: #282828;">While some of the young mainlander Taiwanese can still speak their own dialect (such as Wu), there is hardly an incentive for them to speak. Most of the mainlander Taiwanese (of Wu heritage) I know today spoke Mandarin as like their native language.</span></span></p>

Mainlander Taiwanese are assumed to speak Mandarin as their native 'mother tongue' and there were no incentives to promote other dialects such as Wu, Shandonese, Sichuanese, causing these dialects to be almost dying in Taiwan... </span></p>

              <p>Under Harry Lee's PAP regime, the dialect chinese in Singapore is in a unique position.</p>
              <p>When they enter the education system, they are forced to learn not one but two non-mother tongue languages - mandarin and english.</p>
              <p>I believe the language policies of Harry Lee have all been largely a failure due to his political motivated policies of suppressing some languages and then pusing for some languages to be spoken while not making the effort to reform language policies in school to fit those goals.</p>
              <p>That is why today, after 45 years of independence as a state, the language problem is still in a mess and all sorts of half hearted policies to push people to speak this or that language has all not produced results.</p>

              I think it was a good move to promote English and Chinese. While suppressing dialects doesn't sound optimistic, it does bode well for the country's future. Come on, we can still pick up dialects from our parents and grandparents, and I'm sure we can pass it on! 
              
              If all the Chinese in Singapore spoke their own dialects, we'll be divided and communication would have been difficult. There was a need to have a more unifying language that could also work for our economy. As much as I dislike Mandarin, it is the language that is so crucial today. 
              
              I have had the privilege of learning Cantonese from my parents, and I can also speak English, Chinese and a bit of French. I think we must agree that the government has at least succeeded in making us conversant in both English and Chinese!

              <p>British English or American English - means be British or American, any different. If you choose British, the American may not be happy, and if you choose American, the British may not be happy. So it is better to remain status quo on english as Spore has been doing so well because of loving-kindness and compassion in all that made it works. <br>Singlish is good cos it is middle path between American and British, it allows chinese to embrace as well. Indian and Malay feel friendlier as they could associate their Malay_ish, Indian_ish and Chinese_ish as that of Spore_ish english. It affects the teachers and ministery of education that needed to adjust for nitty-gritty, and in may mentally unsound for them. May all be safe and be happy :)</p>
