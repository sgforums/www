              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 11px;"> </span></p>
              <p>The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice. They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired. The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;">The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge. If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="color: #333333;">Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">it was the babas who dominated public decision-making. In effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents.</span></span></strong> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;">"Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but as a baba who looked to England. He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways?</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">No. He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have aspired.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;">That other great framer of Singapore's institutions, Goh Keng Swee, who rose to become finance minister and deputy prime minister, is the epitome of the baba elite. Goh was born in 1918 in Malacca, the epicentre of baba culture, into a baba family. His parents were English-oriented Chinese Methodists.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em;">The baba influence is now more subtle, but still there. Singapore's current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has the strongest baba pedigree of any of the country's leaders.</p>

              <p><strong>Babas And Nyonyas</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>German scholar JURGEN RUDOLPHhas produced the latest, and possibly most</p>
              <p>comprehensive, social history of the Babas in Singapore. We publish an</p>
              <p>extract here on his account of the two key turning-points of their recent</p>
              <p>past</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THE Japanese Occupation was a crucial turning-point for the Babas. This is</p>
              <p>already obvious in an analysis of the terminology. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After World War II, the previously respectable designations such as "Baba"</p>
              <p>and "Peranakan" became almost terms of abuse if used by the "non-Baba</p>
              <p>Chinese". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The non-Baba Chinese gave the Babas condescending names, which implied that</p>
              <p>they were not "complete Chinese" because of their (supposed) inability to</p>
              <p>speak "Chinese", their alleged adoption of "foreign" (i.e. non-Chinese)</p>
              <p>cultures and their British orientation. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Japanese Occupation turned the Peranakan world upside-down by</p>
              <p>triggering important changes in the political role of the Babas as well as</p>
              <p>in their cultural identity. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many Babas fell victim because they were among the groups targeted during</p>
              <p>the Japanese sook ching operation. Hastily arranged "intermarriages"</p>
              <p>between Nyonyas and non-Baba Chinese were to lead to radical changes in the</p>
              <p>Baba way of life and to "sinicisation". The British patronage of the Babas</p>
              <p>was interrupted in 1942 and was never again fully restored. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The decline of Baba culture is usually thought to begin with the Japanese</p>
              <p>Occupation. The Babas lost fortunes and much of their "material culture"</p>
              <p>during this time. Much of the previous Nyonya and Baba material culture</p>
              <p>disappeared or deteriorated in the '40s and '50s. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, many ceremonies which were too time-consuming and expensive in</p>
              <p>the new "environment" had to be abandoned or at least simplified. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Japanese Occupation also forced many Nyonyas into the labour force,</p>
              <p>with the result that these true bearers of Baba culture became less</p>
              <p>domestic-bound. Other factors in the decline included conversions to</p>
              <p>Christianity (which usually conflict with ancestral rites), the dispersion</p>
              <p>of demographic concentrations and the trend from extended family units to</p>
              <p>nuclear ones. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In an interview, Tan Kong Wee told me that he and other Babas realised</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">their "Chineseness" during the Japanese Occupation: </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"The Japanese did not discriminate between the Peranakan and the</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">China-Chinese. I remember my fellow Peranakans were shocked because they</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">suddenly realised that there was one thing missing. They did not know their</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">roots. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They could not speak Chinese. They said: 'The Japanese called me a</p>
              <p>Chinese. But all along, I would say I'm not a Chinese. I was 11 years</p>
              <p>old... it dawned upon me that I am a Chinese. For this, I have to thank the</p>
              <p>Japanese.' " </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although Tan's realisation may not have been shared by many Babas (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Japanese, in fact, distinguished between the Straits Chinese and the</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">China-born Chinese, at least for the collection of the $50 million "gift"</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">extorted by the Japanese</span></span></strong>), it is a fact that the Chinese-speaking Chinese</p>
              <p>were becoming more influential and insulted the Babas mainly because of</p>
              <p>their inability to speak "Chinese". Consequently, many Babas made an effort</p>
              <p>to learn "Chinese".</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Whereas many English-educated Babas re-emphasised their</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">allegiance to the British Empire and were afraid that full independence</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">might harm their still privileged position, the vast majority of</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chinese-educated Chinese were vehemently anti-colonial and</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">anti-imperialist. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A HIGHER CLASS OF CHINESE</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AS "sons of the soil", the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Straits Chinese British Association's Straits</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chinese defended their citizenship (or subjecthood) rights against the</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">China-born Chinese and those first-generation Singapore-born Chinese who</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">had a dual loyalty. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The chasm between the Babas and the sinkehs (literally "guests", or recent</p>
              <p>immigrants from China) may also be illustrated by the typical occupations</p>
              <p>of the China-born Chinese which self-conscious Babas would have shunned. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As S.C. Wong wrote, in a letter to The Straits Times in 1948:<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "Our</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">China-born brethren are very useful in Singapore.</span></span></strong> Without them, we must</p>
              <p>look to automatic machinery, for few Straits-born Chinese care to take up</p>
              <p>the following trades: tailor, shoe-maker, launderer, barber, farmer,</p>
              <p>butcher, fisherman, grocer, market stallholder, carpenter, bricklayer,</p>
              <p>painter, machine-shop artisan, boiler-maker, blacksmith, lumberjack,</p>
              <p>sawmill worker, stevedore, lighterman, lorry-driver, taxi-driver, omnibus</p>
              <p>driver and conductor, mining coolie, tapper, and the indispensable</p>
              <p>night-soil coolie." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Despite some signs of "resinicisation", many Babas tended to reciprocate</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the insults and teasing of the non-Baba Chinese by calling them "country</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">bumpkins" and low-class guests. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the increased ambiguity of the status of the Babas, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">many of them</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">neither dared to admit they were Babas nor spoke Baba Malay in public. </span></span></strong>The</p>
              <p>days of Baba Malay as an inter-group language of commercial value were also</p>
              <p>gone, and Baba Malay stagnated and became confined to the domestic domain. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The once flourishing literary activities in Baba Malay came to a grinding</p>
              <p>halt and wayang peranakan and dondang sayang were in crisis. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thus, the most</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">important "Malay" aspect of the previous Baba identity was indeed in</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">decline. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a political level, the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> good relations between the Babas and the Malays</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">also deteriorated</span></span></strong> somewhat when, during the pre-independence struggle for</p>
              <p>Merdeka, the Malays were infuriated by secessionist Babas. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">To the Malays,</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">those Babas were "puppets" or even "pariahs" of the British Queen. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In contrast, the British, using eulogistic terms for the Babas, referred to</p>
              <p>their loyalty to Singapore and their pioneer status. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the twilight years of British rule here, between 1945 and 1959, the</p>
              <p>SCBA appeared to continue with its successful tradition of providing</p>
              <p>leadership. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In its midst were not only city councillors, executive and</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">legislative councillors, but also the presidents of the then leading</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">political parties. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">British openly viewed the "King's" or "Queen's Chinese" of the SCBA as</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the "natural leaders" of the Chinese of Singapore. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>THE SECOND TURNING-POINT</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HOWEVER, there were early warning signs of the Babas' loss of influence.</p>
              <p>Eventually, with the waning British influence, the failure of the</p>
              <p>secessionists, the death of conservative "Baba politics" and the rapid rise</p>
              <p>of the People's Action Party which led to self-rule in 1959, the Babas</p>
              <p>reached the second crucial turning-point in their social history. This</p>
              <p>usually ignored turning-point was marked by self-rule and the takeover by</p>
              <p>the PAP. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although leading members of the PAP, such as Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Toh</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chin Chye and Dr Goh Keng Swee, were publicly described as English-educated</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Babas, the Babas as a group were openly belittled as "deculturalised". </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a result, the Babas' influence as a group further declined in every</p>
              <p>respect. Many Babas were in a state of shock and attempted to behave less</p>
              <p>conspicuously in the immediate post-1959 period. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the British no longer holding the reins of power, and the PAP's</p>
              <p>victory, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">SCBA and its successor organisations, the Singapore Chinese</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Peranakan Association and the Peranakan Association, became politically</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">impotent. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the aims of the SCBA had been to serve Straits Chinese interests</p>
              <p>politically in the context of British colonialism, the PA officially</p>
              <p>emphasised values such as inter-racial and inter-cultural harmony,</p>
              <p>religious tolerance and a common national identity. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unofficially, though, the PA turned apolitical and revived its somewhat</p>
              <p>dormant tendency to preserve the Babas' cultural heritage, a tendency which</p>
              <p>became more marked with the so-called "revival of Baba culture". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The post-1959 period highlighted the relative unimportance of the Babas as</p>
              <p>a politically, legally and economically defined group. The Babas, who were</p>
              <p>formerly a rather heterogeneous group were affected by political interests</p>
              <p>and an emphasis on a particular "Chineseness", and soon lost their</p>
              <p>rationale for existence. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the disappearance of this rationale and the heavy stress placed on the</p>
              <p>political correctness of a "Chineseness" other than that of the Babas, we</p>
              <p>not only observe radical changes in Baba culture but also an</p>
              <p>ever-increasing number of intermarriages between Baba and non-Baba Chinese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Marital unions between non-Baba Chinese and Babas had been facilitated</p>
              <p>earlier by the Japanese Occupation and the anglicisation of Singapore</p>
              <p>society. Baba cultural traditions or values no longer tended to be</p>
              <p>transmitted to the children of these unions. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other important factors which led to radical changes in Baba culture were</p>
              <p>the erosion of demographic concentration and the subsequent disruption of</p>
              <p>interactive networks, the advent of modern communications and the</p>
              <p>simultaneous processes of "sinicisation" and "Singaporeanisation". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a result, former courtship and marriage practices as well as other</p>
              <p>customs and traditions such as ancestral and funeral rites were largely</p>
              <p>abandoned. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">From the end of World War II, many Babas abandoned Chinese</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">religion and a syncretic system of beliefs, and embraced Christianity,</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">particularly Catholicism. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moreover, Baba Malay and dondang sayang standards deteriorated, the sarong</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">kebaya was less seen in public</span></span></strong> and the art of Nyonya cuisine was at least</p>
              <p>simplified, if not abandoned. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>BEADED SLIPPERS MAKE A COMEBACK</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THIS is not to deny the possibility of unexpected comebacks, such as the</p>
              <p>current renewed interest in beaded -- and even beading! -- slippers in</p>
              <p>Singapore or the recent revival of dondang sayang in Malacca, according to</p>
              <p>William Gwee, an expert on Baba culture. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Baba Malay as a lingua franca had been on the decline from the '20s</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">onwards, and after Merdeka, English became the most important lingua</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">franca. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> a gradual and incomplete switch in mother tongue from Baba</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malay to English occurred among the Singapore Babas. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the level of Baba Malay tended to be still high among the older</p>
              <p>generation, it was deteriorating among, and not transmitted to, the younger</p>
              <p>generation. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The younger Babas, in particular, showed little interest in</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Baba culture and were often reluctant to conceive of, or at least to openly</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">identify, themselves as Babas or Nyonyas. Occasionally, there was an</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">outright rejection of one's "Babaness", as in this view of one Baba who</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">declined to be named: </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My brother thinks the Baba culture is chaotic... it is completely out of</p>
              <p>touch. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You are a Chinese living in a community of Chinese, so how to</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">survive? </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My grandmother, grand-aunties, according to my brother, are such misfits.</p>
              <p>My brother hates it with a passion. When he makes fun of the Peranakans, he</p>
              <p>will always speak in a fake Malay accent saying, 'I not Malay, I Chinese.'</p>
              <p>He finds that most humiliating, hard to break away from a 'non-culture'." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The same informant told me about a middle-aged Nyonya and the perceived</p>
              <p>impracticality of the way of life of the older generation: </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"One of my aunts purposely denies her 'Peranakanness'. To the Peranakans,</p>
              <p>[it is] 'just enjoy', happy-go-lucky, almost ostentatious, leaving things</p>
              <p>in the hands of God. To this auntie, materialism is more virtuous,</p>
              <p>frugality, more to take charge of the future and welfare of your family,</p>
              <p>investments. This is conceived of as more 'Chinese'. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Auntie said, 'I'm glad that I married a Chinese. Mother is impractically</p>
              <p>meticulous. [She] wants to go to church every day.' She curses her mother</p>
              <p>right in front of her. 'My mother is good for nothing. She doesn't seem</p>
              <p>able to cope, and she considers work a burden.' " </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Generally, the younger generation became less and less distinguishable from</p>
              <p>non-Baba Chinese. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In 1984, the then Prime Minister <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew remarked: "In the generation</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">that is under 40 years, the differences between the Chinese-educated and</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the English-educated have been blended and blurred by interaction in</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">integrated schools, the schools that first started to teach Chinese-stream</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">and English-stream students in the same school. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Then there were many integrated families where some children went to</p>
              <p>English-stream and others went to Chinese-stream schools. So the cultural</p>
              <p>differences have almost disappeared." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The most important move towards a single Chinese identity among the Chinese</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporeans was the Government's equation of Mandarin with the Chinese</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">language. In 1981, a new educational policy for ethnically Chinese pupils</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">was put into effect, which makes the learning of Mandarin as their "mother</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">tongue" compulsory. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>ADOPTING AN ALIEN 'MOTHER TONGUE'</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FOR the Babas, the significance of the new policy was that they no longer</p>
              <p>had the option to elect Malay as a second school language, but were <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">obliged</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">to study Mandarin, a language which many of them regarded as rather alien. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A good number of Babas were in disagreement with the notion of Mandarin</p>
              <p>being the "mother tongue" of the Babas and other Chinese Singaporeans, and</p>
              <p>the equation of Chinese ethnicity with the ability to speak Mandarin was</p>
              <p>contested. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They also felt strongly that their culture was no less Chinese than that of</p>
              <p>other Chinese Singaporeans. However, by force of circumstances, the Babas</p>
              <p>have accepted the heavy emphasis placed on Mandarin and have done what the</p>
              <p>Babas have always been particularly good at: They have adapted to the</p>
              <p>situation. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the younger Babas becoming less and less distinguishable from non-Baba</p>
              <p>Chinese, the former's need to separate themselves from the Malays was no</p>
              <p>longer a problem. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Significantly, it was in Malaysia rather than in Singapore that the Babas</p>
              <p>were seen as in a "unique position" to bridge the gap between the Malays</p>
              <p>and Chinese. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, only the traditional Baba wedding was perceived by observers</p>
              <p>such as Seow Peck Leng of the Young Women's Christian Association in 1968</p>
              <p>as a "concrete proof that the spirit of co-operation, tolerance and</p>
              <p>compromise did exist between the early Chinese immigrants and the early</p>
              <p>Malay residents of Singapore". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the British as colonial masters were history,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> a leaning towards</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">British traits could be observed among some younger Babas. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For instance, Dick Lee (an internationally acclaimed Singaporean pop star),</p>
              <p>in a newspaper interview in 1993, said he had suffered an identity crisis</p>
              <p>for all of his life. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"My [Nyonya] grandmother was very British. She drank</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">tea at four and read Jane Austen. I thought I was a character in an Enid</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Blyton novel." </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He only realised he was not English when he visited England at age 14. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my description of the social and cultural history of the Babas, I have</p>
              <p>refused to apply a modern, culturally-based definition of the Babas. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">While the public focus until the electoral victory of the PAP was clearly</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">on Baba politics, there began -- after a decade of silence and the</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Peranakan Association's intermittent attempts to restore some political</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">weight -- a public emphasis on Baba culture. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Ironically, this switch of emphasis occurred at a time when aspects of Baba</p>
              <p>cultures not only began to disappear or be diluted, but they were also</p>
              <p>commercialised and used to promote tourism. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The new cultural definition, which necessitated a deviation from the</p>
              <p>equation of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Baba" with "Straits Chinese", is thus, in historical terms,</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">rather recent. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This assessment is not contradicted by the justifiable assumption that the</p>
              <p>synonymous usage of the terms Straits Chinese, Peranakan and Baba in</p>
              <p>written records was trailing behind the rapidly changing social reality of</p>
              <p>Singapore and was becoming increasingly ambiguous. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my interpretation, the Babas' newly-published distinctions between</p>
              <p>"Straits Chinese" and "Babas" along cultural lines have to be taken</p>
              <p>seriously when accounting for the time of their appearance and the more</p>
              <p>recent past, but not further back (namely, the period preceding the</p>
              <p>Japanese Occupation). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to the new cultural definition, a Baba should also be a Hokkien.</p>
              <p>According to some purist Hokkien Babas, who regard themselves as true-blue</p>
              <p>Baba jati, non-Hokkien Babas are only Baba chelup. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The expression suggests that the Baba chelup are only superficially dipped</p>
              <p>in the paint of Babaness and are at best "nominal" Babas. Apart from the</p>
              <p>conceptual history until the late '50s which contradicts such a narrow</p>
              <p>conception of a Baba, we have a few examples of prominent non-Hokkien</p>
              <p>Babas. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First and foremost, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">there is Hakka Baba Lee Kuan Yew (who regards himself</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">as a Baba only technically). </span></span></strong>Others are the Melaka dondang sayang singer</p>
              <p>and serunee player Yeo Kim Swee, who is a Hainanese Baba, and Ambassador to</p>
              <p>Germany Walter Woon, who is a Cantonese Baba. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the new public focus on Baba culture between the late '60s and '70s</p>
              <p>onwards, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">many Babas conceived of their culture as dying. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike these prophets of doom, less fatalistic Babas acknowledged the</p>
              <p>decline, but were more optimistic, contending that Babas should become more</p>
              <p>conscious about, and more action-orientated towards, their cultural</p>
              <p>heritage. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Signs of a so-called revival of Baba culture were many: mock traditional</p>
              <p>Baba wedding ceremonies, television documentaries, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nyonya fashion contests,</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the commercialisation of so-called Nyonya food, Peranakan festivals, the</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Baba "material cultures" turning antiques and museum exhibits, the</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">preservation of the so-called Peranakan architecture, books, popular</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">magazine and newspaper articles, the revival of plays in Baba Malay, annual</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Baba Conventions and so on. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, efforts were made to promote cultural tourism via the "exotic"</p>
              <p>and glorious aspects of the "unique" Baba culture. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, it soon became clear that the "revival of Baba culture" was</p>
              <p>nothing more than just a nostalgic curiosity item, an exotic tourist</p>
              <p>attraction and a museum showpiece. These developments notwithstanding,</p>
              <p>there is a minority of Babas who still follow what they perceive as the</p>
              <p>"essence" of Baba culture and who attempt to transmit this "essence" to the</p>
              <p>younger generation. </p>

              <p>using english as the main language is ok.  but we have to keep our chinese and dialects too.  thats how we keep our identity.</p>
              <p>but look around you.  singaporean chinese are not like chinese anymore.</p>
              <p>the malays and indians in singapore get the same education as chinese do.  but do you any malay or indians who hate their own language and cant speak them?  sadly it happens only to chinese.</p>

              <p>It's like some sort of racist shit, only english can save us, all other languages are worthless.</p>
              <p>This banana, his mother tongue english he will keep on promote, keep on push, keep on praise, the other languages, like dialects, he will want it to end in Singapore.</p>
              <p>So sickening, this cultureless banana.</p>

              <p>Why? No one's mother tongue will be suppressed. English will be reduced to secondary language and mandarin as dominant.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is malay dominant, english secondary.</p>
              <p>If I were a malaysian citizen, I would support malay as the dominant language. I would oppose any alien language such as english to be the dominant language.</p>

              <p>25% will revolt?</p>
              <p>As long as you don't go and restrict, go and suppress or disrespect other's people language, why should anyone go and revolt?</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's statement saying that 25% will revolt is based on what evidence?</p>
              <p>Was there an opinion poll for that policy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In colonial Singapore, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">nearest thing to a common language had been Bazaar Malay</span></span>, a form of Malay with simplified grammar and a very restricted vocabulary that members of many ethnic groups used to communicate in the marketplace.</p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">government used English</span></span>, with translators employed when necessary, as in the courts.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Among the Chinese a simplified form of Hokkien served as the language of the marketplace.</span></span></p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chinese schools, which were founded in large numbers in the early years of the twentieth century and associated with the rise of Chinese nationalism, attempted to teach in Mandarin Guoyu</span></span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">use of which on such formal occasions as weddings and Chinese national holiday celebrations came to carry some prestige.</span></span></p>
              <p>In the terminology of sociolinguistics, Singapore's language system was multilingual and diglossiac, that is, characterized by two languages or dialects, high and low, or classical and vernacular, each used in different social contexts and carrying differential prestige.</p>
              <p>Bazaar Malay and market Hokkien were the low languages, employed in the streets and market places, and English and Mandarin were the high languages, used in education, government offices, and public celebrations.</p>
              <p>In addition, such native tongues as pure Malay, Teochiu, Tamil, or Punjabi were used in the home and in gatherings of members of the same speech group.</p>
              <p>In a 1972 survey asking <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which language people understood, Hokkien came first, at 73 percent, followed by Malay, with 57 percent. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malay was the most important language for intergroup communication, with almost all the Indians and 45 percent of the Chinese claiming to understand it.</span></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">also deteriorated</span></span></strong> somewhat when, during the pre-independence struggle for</p>
              <p>Merdeka, the Malays were infuriated by secessionist Babas. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">To the Malays,</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">those Babas were "puppets" or even "pariahs" of the British Queen. </span></span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">From the end of World War II, many Babas abandoned Chinese</span></span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moreover, Baba Malay and dondang sayang standards deteriorated, the sarong</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">kebaya was less seen in public</span></span></strong> and the art of Nyonya cuisine was at least</p>

              <p style="color: #333333;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Baba Malay as a lingua franca had been on the decline from the '20s</span></span></strong></p>
