              <p><strong>Woods suffers cuts in minor car crash</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>MIAMI (AFP) - â€“ Golf superstar Tiger Woods
              suffered facial cuts and bruises when he crashed his 2009 Cadillac SUV
              outside his luxury Florida home.</p>
              <p>Woods was treated and
              released from hospital the same day, following the single-vehicle smash
              in which he hit a fire hydrant and then rammed into a nearby tree.</p>
              <p>"Tiger
              Woods was in a minor car accident outside his home last night. He was
              admitted, treated and released today in good condition," the Florida
              Health Central Hospital said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The golfer also issued the same statement on is website adding, "We appreciate very much everyone's thoughts and well wishes."</p>
              <p>The
              Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) said the 33-year-old Woods crashed into
              the hydrant while leaving his property early Friday in the Windermere
              community, a suburb of Orlando.</p>
              <p>The accident happened at around 2:25 am, police spokeswoman Kim Montes told AFP.</p>
              <p>The FHP had said earlier Woods was transported to the hospital in "serious condition."</p>
              <p>Florida
              Highway Patrol spokesman Mark Welch said the confusion may have stemmed
              from the initial police report. "Our criteria for serious injuries
              might be different from that of a hospital," Welch told AFP.</p>
              <p>Police
              said Woods was outside of the vehicle with his wife next to him when
              they arrived. Woods was in a semi-conscious state, suffering from cuts
              to both his upper and lower lip.</p>
              <p>His wife told police she heard the crash and then used a golf club to break a window of the SUV to help her husband.</p>
              <p>Windermere Mayor Gary Bruhn told CNN that Woods suffered "facial lacerations" in the accident.</p>
              <p>"I
              believe he struck his head and his wife came out and pulled him out,"
              Bruhn told CNN. "His wife was there and Mr. Woods was on the ground. I
              am not going to say in and out of consciousness, but he was dazed. He
              was bleeding from the mouth and nose."</p>
              <p>No charges have been laid as police said they are still investigating the cause of the crash.</p>
              <p>Bruhn said just because there is an ongoing probe doesn't mean there will be charges.</p>
              <p>"I
              personally feel it was an accident," Bruhn told CNN. "I have read the
              police report and it says there was no alcohol involved. I think it was
              just a simple accident."</p>
              <p>Superstar Woods, a 14-time major
              winner, had been set to play his last tournament of the year at the
              Chevron World Challenge at Thousand Oaks, California, December 3-6 - an
              event he hosts annually. Facts: Tiger Woods</p>
              <p>He was scheduled to hold a news conference Tuesday in California.</p>
