              <p><strong>Australian charged with raping daughter for 30yrs</strong></p>
              <div class="bd">
              <div class="content">
              <p>MELBOURNE - An
              Australian man has been charged with sexually abusing his daughter for
              30 years and fathering her four children, local media said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>The
              man, whose identity has been withheld, started abusing his daughter
              when she was aged 11, said the Herald-Sun newspaper, adding the girl
              had four children from her father, all of whom were born with birth
              defects. One of them later died.</p>
              <p>"Obviously any crime of this
              type is one that is shocking and that is personally repulsive to me and
              to other Victorians," said Victoria state Premier John Brumby.</p>
              <p>"It's
              a terrible case. It brings to all of us I think the worst possible
              thoughts about families and what might occur there, and what may have
              occurred," Brumby told reporters.</p>
              <p>Victorian police would not
              immediately comment on the details of the case, citing a court
              suppression order on the identity of the family, issued in August.</p>
              <p>News
              reports said the man was charged in February after his alleged victim
              approached police in the town of Morwell, southeast of Melbourne. The
              man, now aged in his 60s, denied sexually assaulting his daughter, but
              was charged by police after DNA tests proved he fathered the children,
              said the Herald Sun newspaper.</p>
              <p>The woman and her three surviving children were being held in a safe house with authorities, state radio said.</p>
              <p>The
              man would face court in November on around 13 charges, including five
              of incest, five of rape, two of indecently assaulting a girl under the
              age of 16 and one of assault.</p>
              <p>The father was initially charged
              with 83 offences at an arraignment hearing, but most of those were
              later withdrawn, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. The case shocked
              Australians and followed a state ombudsman's report on Wednesday
              pointing to chaos in Victoria's child protection system.</p>
              <p>The
              report, unrelated to the incest case, found social workers had placed
              three children under protection with convicted sex offenders, while the
              state's Department of Human Services also failed to carry out police
              checks on carers.</p>
              <p>"It's almost like they need to be charged
              for negligence. Somebody has to be blamed for this. Really, it is just
              something that we should not as a community accept," Bernadette
              McMenamin, from the charity Child Wise, told state radio.</p>
