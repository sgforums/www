              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: From January to October this year, 385 new cases of 
              human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported among Singapore 
              residents, said the health ministry on Thursday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Ministry of 
              Health (MOH) expects the total number of notified HIV cases in 2012 to 
              be similar to that of 2011, when there were 461 cases.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In the first six 
              months of this year, 215 new cases of HIV, which causes acquired 
              immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), were reported.<br><br>Between July and October, there were 170 new cases.<br><br>MOH said among the cases reported between January and June, 92 per cent (198) were males and 8 per cent (17) were females.<br><br>Most of them caught the virus through sex.<br><br>Half
               of those infected had heterosexual sex, while 43 per cent were infected
               from homosexual transmission, and 4 per cent from bisexual 
              transmission.<br><br>About half, or 47 per cent, of those infected were between 30 and 49 years.<br><br>63 per cent were single, 23 per cent were married and 10 per cent were divorced or separated. <br><br>Half
               of the new cases reported between January and June already had 
              late-stage HIV infection when they were diagnosed, similar to the 
              pattern in previous years. <br><br>Slightly more than half found out they had the virus during HIV testing, as part of medical care.<br><br>Another 15 per cent were detected through health screening. <br><br>14
               per cent were detected during voluntary HIV screening and the rest 
              found out they were HIV-positive through contact tracing and other 
              screening methods.<br><br>A higher proportion of homosexuals - or 28 per
               cent - were detected during voluntary screening, compared with 4 per 
              cent for heterosexuals.<br><br>MOH and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) 
              have urged individuals to protect themselves from HIV infection by 
              following the principles of "ABCD": abstinence, being faithful, correct 
              and consistent use of condoms and early detection.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
