              <p>BANGKOK – <span id="lw_1244125382_0" class="yshortcuts">Actor David Carradine</span>,
                          star of the 1970s TV series "Kung Fu" who also had a wide-ranging
                          career in the movies, has been found dead in the Thai capital, Bangkok.
                          A news report said he was found hanged in his <span id="lw_1244125382_1" class="yshortcuts">hotel room</span> and was believed to have <span id="lw_1244125382_2" class="yshortcuts">committed suicide</span>.</p>
              <p>A
                          spokesman for the U.S. Embassy, Michael Turner, confirmed the death of
                          the 72-year-old actor. He said Carradine died either late Wednesday or
                          early Thursday, but he could not provide further details out of
                          consideration for his family.</p>
              <p>The Web site of
                          the Thai newspaper The Nation cited unidentified police sources as
                          saying Carradine was found Thursday hanged in his <span id="lw_1244125382_3" class="yshortcuts">luxury hotel room</span> and is believed to have committed suicide.</p>
              <p>Carradine was a leading member of a venerable Hollywood acting family that included his father, character actor <span id="lw_1244125382_4" class="yshortcuts">John Carradine</span>, and brother Keith.</p>
              <p>In all, he appeared in more than 100 <span id="lw_1244125382_5" class="yshortcuts">feature films</span> with such directors as <span id="lw_1244125382_6" class="yshortcuts">Martin Scorsese</span>, <span id="lw_1244125382_7" class="yshortcuts">Ingmar Bergman</span> and Hal Ashby.</p>
              <p>But he was best known for his role as <span id="lw_1244125382_8" class="yshortcuts">Kwai Chang Caine</span>, a Shaolin priest traveling the <span id="lw_1244125382_9" class="yshortcuts">1800s American frontier West</span> in the TV series "Kung Fu," which aired in 1972-75.</p>
              <p>He reprised the role in a mid-1980s TV movie and played Caine's grandson in the 1990s syndicated series "<span id="lw_1244125382_10" class="yshortcuts">Kung Fu: The Legend Continues</span>."</p>
              <p>He returned to the top in recent years as the title character in <span id="lw_1244125382_11" class="yshortcuts">Quentin Tarantino</span>'s two-part saga "<span id="lw_1244125382_12" class="yshortcuts">Kill Bill</span>."</p>

              <p>Thai police say actor David Carradine may have died from accidental suffocation</p>
              <p>BANGKOK (AP) — The body of American actor David Carradine, best known for the 1970s TV series "Kung Fu," was found in a hotel room closet with a rope tied to his neck and genitals, and his death may have been accidental suffocation, Thai police said Friday.</p>
              <p>The 72-year-old actor's body was discovered Thursday in his luxury suite at Bangkok's Swissotel Nai Lert Park Hotel. Police initially said they suspected suicide, though Carradine's associates had questioned that theory.</p>
              <p>Police Lt. Gen. Worapong Chewprecha told reporters that Carradine was found with a rope "tied around his penis and another rope around his neck."</p>
              <p>"The two ropes were tied together," he said. "It is unclear whether he committed suicide or not or he died of suffocation or heart failure due to an orgasm."</p>
              <p>Thai police completed an autopsy on Carradine Friday but so far have not released the results.</p>

              <p><strong>Carradine may have died from sex act: Thai police</strong></p>
              <p class="first">BANGKOK (AFP) - - A Thai police commander said Friday
              that US actor David Carradine, found hanged in his Bangkok hotel room,
              may have died from a sex act gone wrong.</p>
              <p>"There was a rope tied around his neck and another rope tied at his
              sex organ, and the two ropes were tied together and hung in the
              closet," Lieutenant General Worapong Siewpreecha told reporters.</p>
              <p>"Under these circumstances we cannot be sure that he committed suicide but he may have died from masturbation," he said.</p>
              <p>Carradine
              , star of 1970s TV series "Kung Fu" and the "Kill Bill" movies, was
              found naked and hanging in a closet in his hotel room by a housekeeper
              on Thursday morning. He was 72.</p>
              <p>He was in the Thai capital to shoot a film called "Stretch."</p>
              <p>Worapong
              said police had questioned the production crew working on the film on
              the day of Carradine's death, who told them the actor "drank beer from
              morning until evening the day before he was found dead," he said.</p>
              <p>Police
              said an autopsy report was expected within the next day, while forensic
              police had dusted the hotel room and were testing a drink found in
              Carradine's room.</p>
              <p>They have also asked the United States embassy for permission to question his wife, Worapong said.</p>
              <p>Forensic
              expert Porntip Rojanasunan, who works with Thailand's Ministry of
              Justice, said the death appeared to be caused by an "auto-erotic
              accident."</p>
              <p>"It's not suicide or murder but he died... after masturbation," Porntip told AFP.</p>
              <p>Police
              officer Pirom Janthapirom told AFP that there was no sign of bruising
              on Carradine's body. Security cameras showed no one going in or out of
              Carradine's room, which had been locked from the inside, he said.</p>
              <p>The
              producer of "Stretch," French firm MK2, said Carradine was found at the
              Nai Lert Park hotel three days before the end of filming for the movie.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the company said Carradine's death "could be accidental."</p>

              <p>Cuz u can control your orgasm by breathing correctly when having sex or whatever la.</p>

              commit suicide, expert says </span></h1>
              <p class="article_date">Friday 12th June, 06:00 AM JST</p>
              <div id="article_content">
              <p id="article_credit">LOS ANGELES —</p>
              <p>The forensics expert hired by David Carradine’s family has concluded that the 
              “Kung Fu” actor did not commit suicide, but said that more information was 
              needed from Thai investigators before the cause of death could be 
              determined.<br><br>Carradine’s brothers, Keith and Robert Carradine, each read 
              part of a prepared statement to reporters from The Associated Press at a Los 
              Angeles hotel Thursday morning. In their first appearance since their older 
              brother was found hanging in a Bangkok hotel room closet last week, they thanked 
              supporters and asked for privacy.<br><br>“This is a devastating loss for our 
              family and we greatly appreciate the compassion pouring in from all over the 
              world,” Keith Carradine said.<br><br>They also released a statement by Dr 
              Michael Baden of New York that indicated a second autopsy determined Carradine 
              didn’t kill himself.<br><br>“However, to reach a final determination as to the 
              cause and the manner of death, we must wait for further information from 
              Thailand as to the scene findings and the completion of the crime laboratory and 
              toxicology studies that are still being performed,” Baden’s statement 
              said.<br><br>Reached by phone after the morning briefing, Baden said he expects 
              to receive more information from Thai authorities in a week or two and stressed 
              that the information at hand was incomplete. Baden didn’t elaborate on how 
              suicide was ruled out.<br><br>“The autopsy is only part of the analysis,” he 
              said.<br><br>In the meantime, Robert Carradine asked the public and press for 
              patience and time to allow the family to grieve.<br><br>“Until we have all of 
              the pending results of the investigation we respectfully ask ... that we be 
              allowed to lay our beloved brother, husband, father, grandfather and 
              great-grandfather to rest in peace and with dignity,” Robert Carradine 
              said.<br><br>Rampant speculation about the actor’s death has swirled since a 
              chambermaid at the luxury Swissotel Nai Lert Park Hotel in Bangkok discovered 
              his body hanging in the closet of his room June 4. A Thai newspaper published a 
              graphic photo of the death scene that police have said appears to be a leaked 
              forensics image.<br><br>Thai police initially said they suspected Carradine’s 
              death was a suicide, but later conceded it could have been accidental. Their 
              description—that the actor’s body was found nude, with ropes around his neck, 
              wrist and genitals—fueled speculation that he was killed while engaging in a 
              dangerous sex practice called auto-erotic asphyxiation.<br><br>Thai authorities 
              said on June 5 that it would take about three weeks for the results of their 
              autopsy to be released.<br><br>Medical examiners in the United States and Canada 
              generally classify auto-erotic asphyxiation deaths as accidental.<br><br>Keith 
              Carradine last week asked the FBI to take a role, and Thai authorities later 
              said they would allow FBI agents to observe their investigation, but not take an 
              active role. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said earlier this week that the 
              agency would not make any more comments about its role in the Carradine 
              investigation, but that agents stationed in Thailand have a good relationship 
              with local authorities.<br><br>Agents typically only get involved in the deaths 
              of U.S. citizens abroad when foul play is involved, she said.<br><br>Others who 
              knew the 72-year-old actor have said they suspect foul play was involved. Keith 
              and Robert Carradine on Thursday urged everyone to wait until the investigation 
              has concluded.<br><br>“Once the investigation is fully completed and definitive 
              conclusions have been reached, we will address the findings with the public,” 
              Robert Carradine said.<br><br>Both Keith and Robert Carradine shared the screen 
              with their brother, a prolific TV and film actor. David Carradine rose to 
              prominence for his role on the “Kung Fu” series in the 1970s and experienced a 
              resurgence in popularity after his role in Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” 
              movies earlier this decade.<br><br>The family’s statement did not indicate the 
              location of his body, or offer any information about funeral arrangements. They 
              did not take questions Thursday after reading the statements.</p>
