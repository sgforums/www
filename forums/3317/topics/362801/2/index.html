              <p><strong>David Carradine died of asphyxiation - pathologist</strong></p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES - The medical examiner who oversaw a private autopsy on
              David Carradine said on Wednesday that the "Kung Fu" star died from
              asphyxiation and the way the actor's body was bound allowed him to rule
              out suicide.</p>
              <p>Carradine was found hanging in the closet of his
              Bangkok hotel suite on June 4 and his family hired New York-based
              forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden to conduct a follow-up death
              investigation to the one handled by Thai authorities.</p>
              <p>Baden had
              earlier said the actor's death was not a suicide, but details of
              autopsies have been scant and on Wednesday Baden stressed that his full
              determination of how Carradine died will not be ready until at least a
              week.</p>
              <p>"The cause of death was asphyxiation, an inability to
              breathe, now why that happened is still what we're working on," Baden
              told Reuters.</p>
              <p>Authorities in Thailand conducted the first autopsy
              on Carradine shortly after his death, and said on June 8 it would take
              a month to know how he died. A Thai police colonel told Reuters early
              in the probe the likely cause of death was asphyxiation.</p>
              <p>Baden,
              the host of cable channel HBO's "Autopsy" series, also said the
              ligatures, or ties that bind, which were on Carradine's body at the
              time of his death helped him rule out suicide.</p>
              <p>"He didn't die of
              natural causes, and he didn't die of suicidal causes from the nature of
              the ligatures around the body, so that leaves some kind of accidental
              death," he said.</p>
              <p>The media has suggested Carradine could have
              died from accidental autoerotic asphyxiation. In response to a question
              on that topic, Baden did not rule out that possibility, but he also did
              not say autoerotic asphyxiation was the cause.</p>
              <p>Contradicting
              media reports saying Carradine's hands were tied behind his back, Baden
              told Reuters the actor's hands were above his head.</p>
              <p>A representative for Carradine's brothers said the family had no comment on preliminary results of the second autopsy.</p>
              <p>Baden,
              who oversaw a second autopsy in the United States after Carradine's
              body was flown to Los Angeles from Bangkok, said he is awaiting more
              information from Thai police to rule out the possibility that Carradine
              was killed by someone.</p>
              <p>Baden said he wants to see data from the
              pass keys for the hotel where Carradine died, and security video to
              ensure no one was in the room with him at the time.</p>
              <p>The forensic
              pathologist said he is not disappointed with how long it has taken Thai
              authorities to send him material for his death investigation. "It takes
              time to finish a case sometimes, so it's not unexpected," he said.</p>
