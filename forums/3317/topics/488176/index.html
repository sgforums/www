              <p>Two foreign workers - Subramaniam Shanmuganathan and Ponnan Muthukumar were commended by the SCDF on Friday for their public spiritedness.</p>
              <p>The duo received the SCDF Public Spiritedness Awards on Friday for climbing onto a balcony to rescue a toddler.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the media at the SCDF headquarters, the two said they were not expecting any reward, and were just happy to be able to save a life.</p>
              <p>A video of them saving a baby in Singapore surfaced on local website Alvinology Friday.</p>
              <p>In the video taken Thursday, a bawling toddler has its head stuck between the rails of a balcony window, with its body hanging off the ledge.</p>
              <p>The foreign worker then came into scene in the video and climbed up the wall to the ledge and got to the baby.</p>
              <p>As the babyâ€™s head was stuck, he lifted the baby so that the weight on its head was lessened. A second foreign worker then climbed up the ledge as well to help.</p>
              <p>Lifestyle blogger Alvin Lim, editor of the website, said the video was taken by a friend at the scene and he asked for help in identifying this life-saving foreign worker.</p>
              <p>According to the blogger, witnesses say that a woman was the first to notice the baby and was the one who asked for help. It appeared that no one was home at that time.</p>
              <p>The incident occurred on 23 April afternoon at Jurong East Ave 1, and initially, two other men tried to climb up the ledge but were not strong enough.</p>
              <p>The commotion went on until the foreign worker appeared. According to witnesses, he was one of three foreign workers working on road repairs nearby, said Lim.</p>
              <p>He added that the (SCDF) arrived on scene five minutes later and managed to free the baby.</p>
