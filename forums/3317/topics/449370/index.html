              <p>A woman in her 20s, the wife of a Gurkha, was allegedly molested by a 
              half-naked man at a petrol kiosk in Upper Aljunied Road on Sunday 
              evening. Four Gurkhas and two police officers came to her rescue, 
              pinning down the man.<br><br>According to a report in Shin Min Daily, 
              the incident happened at around 5.45pm on March 18 at the Esso petrol 
              kiosk beside Hotel Windsor. The woman was withdrawing money from an ATM 
              in the convenience store there when a man clad only in jeans suddenly 
              gave her a 'bear hug' from behind.<br><br>The man, a Singaporean in his early 30s, had shocked the woman, who screamed and then angrily questioned the man, according to an eye-witness.
               An off-duty Gurkha who happened to be standing outside saw the frantic 
              woman chase after the man. Sensing something was not right, he stopped 
              the man from leaving.<br><br>The man, described as very tall and 
              big-sized, tried to escape, but other off-duty Gurkhas arrived to lend a
               hand. Two policemen also arrived at the scene to arrest the man. It 
              took four Gurkhas and two policemen to subdue the man.<br><br>The woman is a wife of a Gurkha and stays in a dormitory near where the incident occurred.<br><br>Said STOMPer Gee who read the news report:<br><br>"Luckily it was only a bear hug and nothing else. However, still freaky.<br><br>"The man was also described as very fierce looking.<br><br>"However,
               he chose the wrong woman to target. She's the wife of a Gurkha soldier,
               and the Gurkhas are widely regarded as the most fearsome fighters in 
              the world."</p>

I can one punch the guy knock out and he's taken care of... but the nice Garkhas chose the civilise way by holding him from running away... if you're trying to hold something that's wriggling and struggling to get free, you know it's difficult...
