              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Inflation in Singapore continues to climb with housing and transport costs topping the increase.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The consumer price 
              index, a key gauge of inflation, rose to 5.3 per cent year-on-year in 
              June, according to a statement from the Department of Statistics.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The data exceeded market expectations of a 5.1 per cent increase.<br><br>Prices
               remain firm as the effect of housing becomes stronger, gaining 9.7 per 
              cent in June, with the cost of accommodation increasing by 10.8 per cent
               on-year.<br><br>Transport cost gained 8.7 per cent last month from 
              2011, with the increase mainly in private road transport because of 
              higher car prices.<br> <br>Together, accommodation and private road transport costs accounted for around two-thirds of CPI-All Items inflation in June.   <br><br>Measured month-on-month, the index was unchanged after climbing 0.2 per cent in May.<br><br>MAS
               Core Inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private 
              road transport, was unchanged at 2.7 per cent for the third straight 
              month.<br><br>Accommodation cost inflation was stronger than expected 
              due to leasing contracts being renewed at considerably higher rentals, 
              particularly in the HDB segment, a joint statement issued by the 
              Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry 
              said.<br><br>COE premiums have also risen sharply recently, and will 
              remain at elevated levels, given the further reduction in COE supply 
              from August. <br><br>For the whole year, the authorities expect 
              inflation rate to be lower in the second half of the year, compared to 
              the first half. <br><br>However, it will remain above its historical average. <br><br>They
               add that inflation for the whole year is likely to come in at the upper
               half of the 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent forecast range. <br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Singapore's central bank raises inflation forecast</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on 
              Wednesday revised its 2012 consumer inflation forecast for Singapore to 
              4% to 4.5% from 3.5% to 4.5%. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is because the central bank expects housing rentals and COE premiums to remain high.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>However, the MAS kept unchanged its core inflation forecast of 2.5%-3.0% for the year. <br><br>The
               MAS core inflation measure, which excludes costs for accommodation and 
              private road transport, moderated to 2.7% in the April-to-June quarter.<br><br>"It
               (core inflation) is likely to ease further and approach 2 percent by 
              the end of the year. This is not far from the historical average of 1.7 
              percent," MAS managing director Ravi Menon said at a press conference.<br><br>Local food inflation should remain relatively contained for the rest of the year, he added. <br><br>Official
               figures on Monday showed Singapore's Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
              inflation rate rose to 5.3% year-on-year in June from 5.0% the previous 
              month. The CPI rose by 5.1% in the first half of the year, down from 
              5.5% in the second half of 2011.<br><br>Mr Menon said bringing down 
              inflation remains one of the central bank's top priorities. He said that
               MAS' monetary policy has had a restraining effect on inflation and the 
              current policy stance remains appropriate.<br><br>On Singapore's economic outlook, MAS retained its projection that the economy would grow between 1% and 3% this year. <br><br>But
               Mr Menon warned that Singapore's economic growth could dip below 1% for
               2012 if several downside risks take a turn for the worse.<br><br>These 
              scenarios include a recession in the US, significant escalation of the 
              eurozone crisis and a "hard landing" for China's economy. <br><br>Still,
               growth momentum is slowing and the MAS expects average growth in the 
              second half to be lower than the first six months of the year. <br><br>Singapore's gross domestic product grew an average of 4.2% in the first half of 2012. <br> <br>Mr Menon was speaking at an event to launch the central bank's annual report for the year ended March 31, 2012.<br><br>MAS
               made a net profit of S$2.77 billion in fiscal 2011/12, reversing from 
              the loss of S$10.94 billion in the previous financial year when the 
              strong local dollar reduced the value of reserves held in other 
              currencies. <br><br>Mr Menon said MAS made foreign investment gains of 
              S$12.1 billion, but overall net profit came in at S$2.77 billion due to a
               strong exchange rate.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ir</span></span></p>
