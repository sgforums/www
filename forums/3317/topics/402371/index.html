              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT">WASHINGTON — The United States
              has discovered nearly $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan,
              far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the
              Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself, according to senior American
              government officials. 
              <br><br> The previously unknown deposits —
              including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial
              metals like lithium — are so big and include so many minerals that are
              essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed
              into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States
              officials believe. 
              <br><br> An internal Pentagon memo, for example, states
              that Afghanistan could become the "Saudi Arabia of lithium," a key raw material
              in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys. 
              <br><br> The
              vast scale of Afghanistan’s mineral wealth was discovered by a small team
              of Pentagon officials and American geologists. The Afghan government and
              President Hamid Karzai were recently briefed, American officials said.
              
              <br><br> While it could take many years to develop a mining industry, the
              potential is so great that officials and executives in the industry believe it
              could attract heavy investment even before mines are profitable, providing the
              possibility of jobs that could distract from generations of war.
              
              <br><br> "There is stunning potential here," Gen. David H. Petraeus,
              commander of the United States Central Command, said in an interview on
              Saturday. "There are a lot of ifs, of course, but I think potentially it is
              hugely significant." 
              <br><br> The value of the newly discovered mineral
              deposits dwarfs the size of Afghanistan’s existing war-bedraggled economy,
              which is based largely on opium production and narcotics trafficking as well as
              aid from the United States and other industrialized countries.
              Afghanistan’s gross domestic product is only about $12 billion.
              
              <br><br> "This will become the backbone of the Afghan economy," said Jalil
              Jumriany, an adviser to the Afghan minister of mines. 
              <br><br> American and
              Afghan officials agreed to discuss the mineral discoveries at a difficult moment
              in the war in Afghanistan. The American-led offensive in Marja in southern
              Afghanistan has achieved only limited gains. Meanwhile, charges of corruption
              and favoritism continue to plague the Karzai government, and Mr. Karzai seems
              increasingly embittered toward the White House. 
              <br><br> So the Obama
              administration is hungry for some positive news to come out of Afghanistan. Yet
              the American officials also recognize that the mineral discoveries will almost
              certainly have a double-edged impact. 
              <br><br> Instead of bringing peace, the
              newfound mineral wealth could lead the Taliban to battle even more fiercely to
              regain control of the country. 
              <br><br> The corruption that is already
              rampant in the Karzai government could also be amplified by the new wealth,
              particularly if a handful of well-connected oligarchs, some with personal ties
              to the president, gain control of the resources. Just last year,
              Afghanistan’s minister of mines was accused by American officials of
              accepting a $30 million bribe to award China the rights to develop its copper
              mine. The minister has since been replaced. 
              <br><br> Endless fights could
              erupt between the central government in Kabul and provincial and tribal leaders
              in mineral-rich districts. Afghanistan has a national mining law, written with
              the help of advisers from the World Bank, but it has never faced a serious
              challenge. 
              <br><br> "No one has tested that law; no one knows how it will
              stand up in a fight between the central government and the provinces," observed
              Paul A. Brinkley, deputy undersecretary of defense for business and leader of
              the Pentagon team that discovered the deposits. 
              <br><br> At the same time,
              American officials fear resource-hungry China will try to dominate the
              development of Afghanistan’s mineral wealth, which could upset the United
              States, given its heavy investment in the region. After winning the bid for its
              Aynak copper mine in Logar Province, China clearly wants more, American
              officials said. 
              <br><br> Another complication is that because Afghanistan has
              never had much heavy industry before, it has little or no history of
              environmental protection either. "The big question is, can this be developed in
              a responsible way, in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible?"
              Mr. Brinkley said. "No one knows how this will work." 
              <br><br> With virtually
              no mining industry or infrastructure in place today, it will take decades for
              Afghanistan to exploit its mineral wealth fully. "This is a country that has no
              mining culture," said Jack Medlin, a geologist in the United States Geological
              Survey’s international affairs program. "They’ve had some small
              artisanal mines, but now there could be some very, very large mines that will
              require more than just a gold pan." 
              <br><br> The mineral deposits are
              scattered throughout the country, including in the southern and eastern regions
              along the border with Pakistan that have had some of the most intense combat in
              the American-led war against the Taliban insurgency. 
              <br><br> The Pentagon
              task force has already started trying to help the Afghans set up a system to
              deal with mineral development. International accounting firms that have
              expertise in mining contracts have been hired to consult with the Afghan
              Ministry of Mines, and technical data is being prepared to turn over to
              multinational mining companies and other potential foreign investors. The
              Pentagon is helping Afghan officials arrange to start seeking bids on mineral
              rights by next fall, officials said. 
              <br><br> "The Ministry of Mines is not
              ready to handle this," Mr. Brinkley said. "We are trying to help them get
              ready." 
              <br><br> Like much of the recent history of the country, the story of
              the discovery of Afghanistan's mineral wealth is one of missed opportunities and
              the distractions of war. 
              <br><br> In 2004, American geologists, sent to
              Afghanistan as part of a broader reconstruction effort, stumbled across an
              intriguing series of old charts and data at the library of the Afghan Geological
              Survey in Kabul that hinted at major mineral deposits in the country. They soon
              learned that the data had been collected by Soviet mining experts during the
              Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, but cast aside when the Soviets
              withdrew in 1989. </span></p>
