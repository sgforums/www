              <p>Singapore is likely to face a labour shortage as a result of 
              dwindling manpower supply from major suppliers such as China, warned 
              labour leader Ong Ye Kung on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Speaking at a conference organised by Human Capital Singapore, the deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress explained that major manpower suppliers are holding on to their workers as they battle their own labour crunch.</p>
              <p>As wages rise in China for instance, industries are moving back to 
              advanced economies like Singapore, driving up demand for workers here, 
              he said.</p>
              <p>"We are, therefore, likely to be at a turning point of history, from labour glut to labour crunch."</p>
              <p>"This presents a whole new challenge to industries in the medium term
               -- how to find enough workers and continue to remain competitive?"</p>
              <p>Ong added that many economists believe a slowdown in cheap labour 
              supply is on the cards, and that it will lead to a reprieve from current
               problems due to the influx of such labour, reported <em>The Straits Times.</em></p>
              <p>He noted that while low-cost foreign workers have helped reduce 
              business costs, they have also added downward pressure on wages in 
              labour-importing countries, including Singapore. Those that did not let 
              foreign labour in also suffered higher unemployment and lower wages as 
              industries moved abroad for cheaper labour.</p>
              <p>Citing figures in a recent <em>Financial Times</em> report that 
              showed stagnating or falling wages for workers at the bottom and in the 
              middle in developed countries, Ong noted that real wages have been 
              rising in Singapore. Increases for the bottom 10-20 percent, on the 
              other hand, have been modest.</p>
              <p>But a labour crunch would also pose challenges to employers, he told 
              the 300 business leaders and HR practitioners at the conference.</p>
              <p>To tackle them, Ong suggested companies raise productivity through 
              technology, invest in skills upgrading, and motivate workers by sharing 
              with them the rewards of productivity gains. Employers were also urged 
              to be flexible and open in hiring new workers.</p>
              <p>Noting that while some job seekers can be picky, he said the labour 
              movement has also seen many who are open to lower-paying jobs in 
              different industries.</p>
              <p>"As manpower becomes scarcer, it would make sense for the HR 
              community to take a hard look at its systems and processes to ensure it 
              is open and flexible, so as to consider every willing and able candidate
               for every position," he said.</p>

              <p>Labour crunch? What labour cruch? To grow at 15% GDP with all-and-sundry of industries, we need need another 1 million people! <br><br>Will these all-and-sundry help us compete in the long term? Do they bring us long term benefit?</p>
              <p>Do we still need the marine industry where 95% of the workers are foreigners? Over the long term, will we still benefit from the casino industry when China and India take centrestages as the world economies, opening up further with casinos of their own?</p>
              <p>Right now 50% to 60% of the visitors to the casinos are Singaporeans and we have became gambling addicts.    <br><br>Better still! What about growing at 30% or 50% of GDP and import the world to our island country?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, so far with 15% GDP growth, has it brought better living standard to your life? with the housing, transport inflation, wave of co. structuring and difficulties in finding jobs for older workers! </p>
              <p>Labour crunch is hogwash by the PAP govt. Do not be seduced by their propaganda.</p>

              <p>lol beta and charlize damn funny man. And it's true....they keep asking us to readjust mindsets, accept lower pay bla bla bla. This is just to help the govt plug economic figures. They must ask themselves: after having attained a certain lifestyle and prestige in life, would they dein down to lead lesser lives?</p>
              <p>They wouldn't......people also got property to pay for, children to feed and educate, the usual leisure activites etc etc. How can sgporeans, after a lifetime of toil be asked to accept lower paid jobs because of cheapo foreigners replacing them?</p>

              waiter/waitress/kitchen assistant temporilary for some income as u
              cant find work at present..."...The answers are all the same
               : "... its long hours, tiring, dirty (at kitchen) and
              $6.50/hr wage niah... LOW." they dun even think about it.!!!</p>

              <p>yes, there is one question per se....</p>
              <p>we find our waiter/waitress faces "stone faced", hardly any smiles, lack of enthauism, lack of customer services, unattentive... etc..what is the lacking factors that caused them to shy away from these positions/work.</p>
              <p>Normally we pay service charge 10% at expensive restaurants/cafe, do the staff gets them or the food establishment keeps them.?</p>
              <p>I have friends who told me that in their countries ( Europe/Australia/US), the locals are most willing to work as waiter/waitress job as the tips are the incentive/daily bonus ie...top up way much than their usual pay (which is not too bad).... therefore bringing home a decent income... and they are motivated to work everyday :D</p>

              <p>I went packpacking in Aust recently. saw some ads for low-level jobs. but wow, the pay is not low at all.</p>

              <p>Construction crew: $20/hr  (no experience, transport provided)</p>

              <p>if these menial jobs are paying so much, imagine what their professionals must be making.</p>
              <p>you may say that cost of living in Aust is expensive, but with that level of pay, i think you still have plenty leftover after paying off food, transport and lodging. The system works, with no locals left behind.</p>
              <p>A$20(money made in an hour) can buy you 2 McDonalds Big Mac meals, while in S'pore, S$6.50( dishwashing job) barely buys you a McDonalds meal.</p>
              <p>Using the McDonalds' Price Index, our cost of living is actually twice as high as Australia's. This is further confirmed by the news report about S'pore being the 8th most expensive city in the world.</p>
