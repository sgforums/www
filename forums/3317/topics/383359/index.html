              <p>Singapore-based shipping tycoon Chang Yun Chung and his brother attended a ceremony on Kinmen yesterday to mark the inauguration of a memorial hall to their late father and mother built on their parents' home island.<br><br>The inauguration of the memorial hall, located in Kinmen's northeastern township of Chinsha, was attended by nearly 400 people, including Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.<br><br>Addressing the ceremony, Chang, 90, founder of Singapore's Pacific International Lines (Private) Ltd (PIL) , said the memorial hall was built to allow the brothers to express their gratitude for the love and care given to them by their parents.<br><br>"The hall is also dedicated to telling our offspring scattered around the world that our roots are in Kinmen,"Chang said.<br><br>Y.C. Chang and his younger brother Chang Yun Fu, 83, traveled from Singapore to Kinmen via the Chinese city of Xiamen.<br><br>An older brother, Chang Yun Chung, who also donated toward the memorial, died last month.<br><br>The Chang brothers also made another donation of NT$10 million (US$309,310) to establish an educational foundation aimed at helping young people from Kinmen to receive better education.<br><br>PIL was ranked the 20th-biggest container shipping company in the world in 2005. The growth of the privately held family-owned shipping firm was achieved against the odds in the political and economic environment faced by many Singapore-based shipping firms that emerged in the 1960s.<br><br>Started as a small regional shipping company based in Singapore in 1967, it has since grown into an international shipping company, operating over 90 vessels with an annual turnover of US$1.7 billion in 2004. Chang Yun Chung has in recent years passed the company baton over to the second generation.<br><br>Chang Yun Fu, chairman of the World Chang Clan, is also a respected Singapore business leader who has received a Singaporean presidential citation and medals from Singapore's Ministry of Education for his contributions to public service.<br><br>At the ceremony, Lee praised the Chang brothers for their filial piety, their remembrance of their parents and their compassion for their parents' ancestral home.</p>
