              <p><span>SINGAPORE: In the spirit of International Women's Day, which fell 
              on March 8, women from various walks of life in Singapore took time out 
              to reflect on their roles and place in society. They also shared their 
              stories of inspiration. </span></p>
              <p><span>At the Singapore Expo, some 2,000 teenage girls, who could one day
               become tomorrow's leaders, were joined by women who have made a 
              difference to society. They include Members of Parliament Indranee Rajah
               and Josephine Teo.
              <br> <br> Once the ice was broken, it was down to business. Amid the inspiring 
              life stories that were shared, came calls to blaze a new trail for 
              women.
              <br> <br> Ms Indranee said: "We have brought up a society, where often we are 
              taught to be modest, self-effacing, don't put yourself forward. But 
              women very often don't automatically think of themselves as, 'Yes, I'm 
              the one who should take charge. I'm the person who should say that it 
              should go this way or that way'." 
              <br> <br> So it is time to change the way women perceive their roles.
              <br> <br> She added: "What we need to learn to do better is to have that balance, 
              where you can have all the values that make you a nice human being, but 
              at the same time, cultivate that sense that - I'm a leader, there are 
              things that I need to do to give a vision to others. And if I don't step
               up to the plate and take responsibility for this, then if everybody 
              thought the same way, then we wouldn't have people who can lead."
              <br> <br> International Women's Day was also celebrated at the Singapore Chinese 
              Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
              <br> <br> The guests of honour include Minister of State for Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, as well as chairperson 
              of the chamber's Career Women's Group, Claire Chiang.
              <br> <br> The event was an opportunity to catch up with their peers, and learn 
              more about healthy lifestyles.

              <p>that would be another terrible mistake by the ruling party...</p>
              <p>the first priority should be to balance the gender rights and amend divorce or marital laws...right now Sg is a feminist country (including its medias)....</p>

              <p>Whenever I see the advertisement about the TV about celebrating women's day, no offense to women, but I think wtf is this? Next thought would be where is men's day, don't we contribute too?</p>
              <p>Women (in Singapore) always want equality but what they don't know (maybe they do know but act ignorant) is that they already had advantage over the men.</p>
              <p>Women's charter is one thing. Maybe the equality they meant along is to abolish the women's charter and include drafting of females into NS.</p>
              <p>Speaking of NS, women like to use the excuse of being weak and they have to suffer when pregnant, they can use these excuses in the past but definitely not now. How are they weak now?</p>
              <p>Fk, they are increasingly becoming more fierce and aggressive than before. Some are even fiercer and more aggressive compared to some of our men.</p>
              <p>Singapore is repeatedly reporting low birthrate, so tell me, how do they have to suffer during pregnancy when it is a fact some (maybe most) of the women do not want to have kids?  BTW, in order to have kids, women need men to be part of the play. No sperm, no pregnancy, simple as that.</p>
              <p>Women, in the past, maybe weak and ignorant which needs to be protected which I agree and think it is mainly due to the fact that they are not as highly educated as the men. It is known that chinese in the past favors men over women. Parents would rather spent more efforts in their sons, for example, giving them education, over their daughters.</p>
              <p>Not anymore, women these days are highly educated.</p>
              <p>They are smarter. Some are smarter than some of the men, no doubt.</p>
              <p>They know how to choose. They know exactly what is in their disadvantage and they will, no doubt, raise objections to it when things are not in their favor. They knows their rights.</p>
              <p>They are bolder. Definitely bolder compared to the past and some are bolder than most of the men.</p>
              <p>They are craftier. Some of them are even more craftier than men as they now know that the tool (women's charter) they originally had not only served as a defense but also as an offense. They are able to manipulate the tool they had into a weapon of men (mass, pun intended) destruction.</p>
              <p>Want some evidences to that? Look at facebook, look at STOMP, that's your evidences.</p>
              <p>Here's some of the examples:</p>
              <p>Women fighting for seats in MRT? Women pushing someone off their seat in order to have their boyfriend seat beside them in MRT? Women whacking their boyfriend's balls in the public? Posting their shoplifting adventures in their facebook? Cases of women using women's charter to their advantage by not marrying with their new  boyfriend because they want to continue to leech off their ex-husband? The list goes on.</p>
              <p><span>The article mentioned "We have brought up a society, where often we are
                                                                  taught to be modest, self-effacing, don't put yourself forward. But
                                                                  women very often don't automatically think of themselves as, 'Yes,
                                                                  I'm the one who should take charge. I'm the person who should say
                                                                  that it should go this way or that way'."</span></p>
              <p>That's totally off. Women, today, think of themselves. They ask for equality only when things is not in their favor. They are not dumb. They put themselves forward.</p>
              <p>Some of the women don't even appreciate that men are serving NS in order to protect the country, they think NS is some walk in the park. Maybe they should come experience it themselves, not for 2 years, but for a few months then they will learn to appreciate it. They don't have to be in those chiong sua vocation, they can be a medic or maybe a driver.</p>
              <p>Women appreciate what you have now and stop asking for equality because men should be the one asking for it.</p>
              <p>Note: The women I'm talking about only meant to the women in Singapore which the  more fortunate ones compared to some of the other countries and they have no idea how lucky they are.</p>
