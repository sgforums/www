              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Like many jobseekers, he thought nothing of it when
              his employer made copies of his identity card. After all, the
              21-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Jack, had his identity card
              photocopied when he applied for previous part-time jobs. <br> <br> But the past weekend turned out to be a nightmare for Jack. His home
              was targeted by loan sharks: A shoe rack was set on fire on Saturday
              and paint was splashed on his door early Monday morning. <br> <br> Jack believes he had unwittingly given his personal details as part of
              an illegal loan transaction. Told that his part-time job involved the
              securing of property loans, Jack’s “work” included picking up calls,
              giving his personal details and handing over money transferred into his
              personal bank account to his employer. <br> <br> Jack, who has lodged a police report, is not alone. TODAY understands
              that at least eight people may have fallen victim to this alleged
              employment scam. A police spokesperson said investigations are ongoing.
              <br> <br> Other jobseekers who have disclosed their personal details have found
              themselves on the receiving end of unsolicited sales pitches of
              insurance and other products. <br> <br> Last month, Mr Jason Lim received three calls from insurance agencies
              after his online resume was viewed by six financial advisory firms or
              insurance-related companies. <br> <br> “I felt that my private information had been misused and it could have
              been worse,” said the 28-year-old. “Imagine an illegal group using the
              information to make a hoax kidnapping threat. They basically have all
              my personal information.” <br> <br> Ms Jennifer De Souza, who responded to a classified ad asking
              jobseekers to reply with an SMS of their names and dates of birth,
              found herself receiving six calls within a week from companies peddling
              insurance and other products. <br> <br> “Does MOM (Ministry of Manpower) check whether these companies have an
              opening or do they just collect information for a database of these
              applicants?” she wondered. <br> <br> Pointing to the Employment Agency Licensing Conditions, an MOM
              spokesperson said licensed agencies cannot give, divulge or reveal to
              any persons, directly or indirectly, any information regarding any
              client without the client’s written consent. Otherwise, the agency’s
              licence may be revoked. <br> <br> The MOM has not received any complaints against the more than 2,000
              licensed employment agencies here on the misuse of client information
              this year, added the spokesperson. <br> <br> But jobseekers enter into a grey area when they turn to online job
              portals and classified ads. Portals that allow employers and jobseekers
              to search and post job postings and resumes need not be licensed. Only
              those that match and place jobseekers have to be. <br> <br> At present, there is no generic personal data protection law, even
              though there are strict provisions that apply to specific sectors.
              These include the Banking Act and codes for medical professionals to
              protect sensitive information about a person’s finances and health. <br> <br> Online job portals TODAY contacted said they do not sell databases of
              jobseekers and have put in place measures to prevent unscrupulous
              businesses from mining personal data other than for employment
              purposes. <br> <br> Mr Lim Der Shing, chief executive for job portal JobsCentral, believes
              the situation is worse offline. “Actually, offline, an unscrupulous
              business could also run a newspaper ad claiming to have lots of job
              positions and use the resultant databases generated for other purposes
              such as sales,” he said. <br> <br> With the economy in the doldrums, jobseekers such as Ms De Souza and
              Jack hope that the authorities will crack down on unscrupulous
              employers. <br> <br> “Please do not make us a fool, requesting a resume and not getting back
              to us,” said Ms de Souza, who has been unemployed since last August. <br> <br> Jack, who is awaiting National Service enlistment, is enduring
              sleepless nights. He stays up to monitor a surveillance camera he has
              installed, worried that his family members may be harmed. <br> <br> On Monday, the family even bought a cable cutter in case the loan
              sharks chain their gates. “I only wanted to earn some income and help
              my family. I never thought it could end up like this,” said Jack. </span></p>
