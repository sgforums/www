              <p>Motorists were forced to make a detour from the area near Shangri-la
              Hotel this morning after a crane broke into two and was left dangling
              from the top of a building since last night.</p>
              <p>Construction of the 36-storey Ardmore II, located along Ardmore Park Drive, is supposed to be completed this year.</p>
              <p>No one was injured, but Mediacorp News Hotline caller Richard Heng,
              who works just opposite the building, says he was caught in a jam while
              on his way to work this morning.</p>
              <p>It took him about 20 minutes to get from his home in Bukit Panjang to Ardmore Park, when normally it'd take about 5 minutes.</p>
              <p>He says construction at the site has been ongoing for three months.</p>
              <p>Extremely windy conditions last night may have caused the incident, he feels.</p>
              <p>"It looks dangerous because it's been cordoned off by the police and
              the construction workers cannot be at the site. It looks very awkward
              because the whole main arm is bent and down. So it's dangling down with
              the wires and the cable all."</p>
              <p>Police were alerted to the incident at 11.20pm last night.</p>
              <p>The Manpower Ministry is investigating.</p>

              <p><strong>Broken tower crane at Ardmore II construction worksite removed</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The broken tower crane at the Ardmore II condominium
              construction worksite has been removed. The 22-hour operation took two
              days to complete.
              <br> <br> Two large mobile cranes were used in the recovery operation, one of which has now been removed.
              <br> <br> Anderson Road, which had been cordoned off for the recovery operation, is now re-opened to traffic.
              <br> <br> A second crane, parked along Ardmore Park Drive, is being dismantled and the road will re-open to traffic on Monday morning.
              <br> <br>The Manpower Ministry says it is still investigating the cause of
              the crane incident. It reminds all industry stakeholders using cranes
              to ensure they adhere to all safety processes when using cranes.
              <br> <br>These include regular maintenance, annual checks by an Authorised
              Examiner, daily pre-operation checks before work and ensuring only
              trained personnel are engaged in using the cranes. <br> <br> The ministry says it will take action against anyone found to have
              violated the requirements under the Workplace Safety and Health Act and
              its subsidiary regulations.
              <br> <br> Those who do so face a fine of up to $500,000 and/or two years' imprisonment.

              <div class="gray12VA"><em>Taipei, April 24 (CNA) A section of a crane's boom fell 37 stories onto
              a moving tour bus carrying a group of Chinese tourists in Taipei
              Friday, leaving two passengers dead, another in critical condition, and
              two others injured, according to the city's fire department.<br><br> One passenger, 46-year-old Li Fuqing, was cut in half and killed
              immediately when the boom smashed through the back of the bus as it was
              heading toward Taipei 101 in Taipei's upscale Xinyi shopping district.<br><br> Another tourist, 57-year-old Wang Bingkun, died after being taken to
              the Zhongxiao branch of Taipei Municipal Hospital. Zhang Shiguang, 63,
              suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) before arriving at
              Taipei Medical University and is in critical condition.<br><br> The bus
              was carrying a total of 27 people at the time, including 25 Chinese
              tourists, and a Taiwanese tour guide and driver.<br><br> Police  cordoned  off the area where the accident  occurred,  and Taipei prosecutors are on the scene to investigate.<br><br> A preliminary investigation found that a small crane was operating a
              mid-sized boom on the 37th floor of the construction site when the boom
              broke off and fell to the street below.<br><br> Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin  immediately  ordered  the construction company to halt work at the site.<br><br> The tour group, from Guangdong, China, arrived in Taiwan via Hong Kong
              April 20 for a six-day sightseeing trip. They were scheduled to return
              home Saturday, according to the Tourism Bureau.<br><br> The tourists
              were on their way to Taipei 101 for a visit when the accident occurred,
              according to the Taipei travel agency that is hosting the tour group.<br><br>(By Y.L. Kao)</em></div>
