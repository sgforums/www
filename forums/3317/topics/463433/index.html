              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's economic growth slowed significantly this
               year, as subdued external demand affected most sectors of the economy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But findings from 
              the Ministry of Finance's second issue of the Singapore Public Sector 
              Outcomes Review (SPOR) showed that Singapore's economic fundamentals 
              remain strong. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The labour market is near full employment and job creation remains healthy. <br><br>Singapore
               continues to attract investments due to its stable business 
              environment, a highly educated and skilled workforce, and good 
              connections to the region and the world.<br><br>The Singapore economy is expected to grow by about 1.5 per cent in 2012. <br><br>Global
               economic growth is expected to remain sluggish in the near term, as 
              governments and households in developed economies continue to rein in 
              spending. <br><br>Consumer price inflation remained elevated in 2012, 
              driven by higher car prices and imputed rental costs on owner-occupied 
              homes.<br><br>Published once every two years, SPOR provides a 
              perspective on how the public sector and Singapore have fared in six 
              broad range of areas of national interest including growing incomes and 
              fostering strong families and a cohesive society.<br><br>The review said
               immediate challenges remain but are being addressed. These include 
              relieving pressure in public housing and transport infrastructure.<br><br>The report also pointed out that Singapore's fertility rate had declined steeply over the past decade. <br><br>Currently at 1.2, it remains well below the replacement rate of 2.1. <br><br>The
               government notes that despite strenuous efforts to encourage family 
              formation, the trend of marrying later and having fewer children is 
              unlikely to reverse soon. <br><br>With immigration, Singapore's 
              population continues to expand, although more slowly now with the 
              tightening of the immigration framework since 2009.<br><br>Turning to 
              the public sector, the report notes that the public image of the civil 
              service had been dented recently by some high profile cases of 
              corruption, even though public sector cases formed only a small part of 
              corruption-related cases brought before the courts.<br><br>Six out of 135 offenders charged in court in 2011 were public sector employees.<br><br>It
               sai the government's swift and resolute response to these incidents 
              demonstrates its resolve to uphold the highest standards of integrity in
               the public sector.<br><br>Public policy will also have to take into account a greater diversity of needs and interests as society evolves. <br><br>The
               current Our Singapore Conversation is an effort to involve many 
              Singaporeans in gathering aspirations and hopes for Singapore's future, 
              and ideas on how we can achieve them together. <br><br>The report added 
              that improving service delivery and strengthening public engagement are 
              key priorities for the public sector. The volume of public feedback 
              received by the government has also grown significantly over the years.<br><br>REACH
               has seen a three-fold increase in the feedback it has received over the
               past five years. In the first 11 months of 2012, this figure has 
              already reached 64,000. <br><br>The report said this reflected the public's desire for greater engagement with government on matters of public policy.<br><br>In
               fact, in a 2011 survey conducted by the former Ministry of Information,
               Communications and the Arts, 75 per cent of respondents felt that the 
              government should always consult the public and consider their views 
              when crafting policies.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
