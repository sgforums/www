              <p>LOCAL actress Joanne Peh raised a ruckus online when she complained 
              about the service at the Nandos restaurant at Tanglin Mall (above) on 
              her Twitter account.</p>
              <p>First, she was told to pay $3.90 for hot water. Then, when she 
              refused and eventually left the restaurant with her boyfriend, the staff
               started clapping. This angered Peh, who believed the staff were mocking
               them.</p>
              <p>The online furore resulting from her tweet caught the attention of Nando's, which has since apologised for the incident.</p>

              <h1 class="headline">Restaurant staff’s clapping was uncalled for: Joanne Peh</h1>
              <p>Popular restaurant chain Nando's is in the spotlight after local celebrity Joanne Peh stormed out of its Tanglin Mall outlet on Monday evening, complaining of bad service.</p>
              <p>What made the incident worse was that after she left the restaurant 
              with her boyfriend, Nando's staff started clapping, she claimed.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old actress, incensed by the fact she had been asked to 
              pay S$3.90 for a cup of warm water, vented her frustrations on Twitter 
              later that night.</p>
              <p>"Somebody please save this restaurant. They have no idea what service
               and initiative means," she tweeted via @JoannePeh, triggering a flurry 
              of comments from her 20,000 followers, many of whom supported her.</p>
              <p>In an interview with <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> three days after the 
              incident, Peh reiterated that the underlying issue is not whether the 
              restaurant plans to charge customers for tap water or not.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to come off like I'm very petty... but the clapping was
               what I felt was most uncalled for in the whole string of events," she 
              said.</p>
              <p>"A lot of people have asked me, 'why did they do that?' I don't know,
               I'm just as bewildered. Their behaviour is so bizarre, even Nando's 
              can't explain it either. I also want to know why."</p>
              <p>"Different establishments have different rules and policies, and I 
              respect that," she added. "But every customer has the right to walk 
              away."</p>
              <p>The incident took place when Peh and her actor-deejay boyfriend Bobby Tonelli, 36, went for dinner at the restaurant, which is famed for its grilled chicken. It has three outlets here.</p>
              <p>After placing their orders, Peh asked for hot water but was told by 
              the waiter that this was not possible. She then asked to speak to the 
              manager, who said the same.</p>
              <p>"The manager actually told us he once got into trouble for serving 
              hot water, which I have never heard of before," she said, reported <em>The Straits Times</em>.</p>
              <p>The couple was eventually told that hot water would cost S$3.90, 
              which is the menu price for a cup of tea. However, Tonelli went on to 
              point out that a bottle of water on the same menu only cost S$1.80, to 
              which the manager agreed to charge them that and heat up the bottled 
              water instead.</p>
              <p>However, the message was apparently not conveyed to other staff, who 
              were  "dumbfounded" when the couple had to request for hot water again.</p>
              <p>Finally, when neither their food nor drinks had arrived 30 minutes 
              after being seated, an exasperated Peh and Tonelli decided to leave the 
              outlet.</p>
              <p>It was then that Peh said she heard the restaurant's service staff clap and cheer.</p>
              <p>"In all honesty we'd have dropped it as another unfortunate 
              experience if not for the fact that they applauded on our way out," said
               Peh on Twitter.</p>
              <p>"The worst thing is the manager clapped too," Peh added.</p>
              <p>It was the first time Peh had walked out of a restaurant fuming.</p>
              <p>"We are not asking to be treated in any special manner just because 
              we are celebrities. It's just hot water, how hard can that be to serve?"
               Peh told <em>The New Paper.</em></p>
              <p>Tonelli also said that he and Peh have always tried to be "very low 
              key" in public. This incident, he said, was "certainly not about diva 
              behaviour."</p>
              <p>Peh later told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that the online furor seemed
               to be "opening up a whole can of worms", with regards to other negative
               reviews of the restaurant that have since surfaced. She suggested that 
              the problem could be "all internal".</p>
              <p>"There is a lack of a proper charging system in place, and a lack of 
              proper training," she said. "Service staff needs to know how to handle 
              requests."</p>
              <p>Ironically, the last time the couple dined at the restaurant, they 
              received such good service that Tonelli, a Class 95FM deejay, raved 
              about it on air.</p>
              <p>Nando's have since called the actress to apologise. It also tweeted 
              an apology the following day and said, "We saw ur tweets abt ur 
              experience and would like to sincerely apologise for this incident."</p>
              <p>"We do appreciate and value all our guests' feedback. Your tweets highlighted some issues which we are currently looking into."</p>
              <p>Nando's regional marketing manager Fanny Chai has also come forth to 
              explain that it is a  "corporate decision not to serve water on the 
              house as beverage sales is a key source of business revenue".</p>
              <p>She said that staff members usually offer bottled water or a hot 
              beverage such as tea as an alternative, when customers request hot 
              water.</p>
              <p>This was not clearly explained to Peh at the time, resulting in a "misunderstanding", continued Chai.</p>
              <p>She also said the restaurant was still assessing the water policy at 
              this point, adding that "it is not true" that a staff member would be 
              fired for serving water to a customer.</p>
              <p>As for the clapping incident, Chai declined to confirm details as 
              "internal investigations of the incident are currently underway to 
              understand and verify the situation and chain of events."</p>

              <p>People can be rude and sarcastic without realising it. They can shout at service staff and then deny it. When they lodge a complain, they will say the service staff was rude and shouted at them, when in fact it is the other way round.</p>
              <p>So she <strong>just ask</strong> for a glass of water, got fed up and walked out, and they clapped hands?</p>
              <p>I don't believe the story is so simple.</p>

              <p>well i realli have to say this...such incidents are not the first time and have often been happening in so called "upclass" or pop places....u could have gotten better cust. svc at a simpler setting with even better food and smiley staffs...</p>
              <p>on the other hand, cust. are not always right and realli ought to refine themselves in public even when they dun get what they wanted...though they pay for it...</p>
              <p>but the clapping is really uncalled for and the restaurant realli has to look into better supervisory and staff re-training...certain policies should be reviewed to enhance cust experience ...ultimately it is repeated businesses that every org is looking for....</p>
