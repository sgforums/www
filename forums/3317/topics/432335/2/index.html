              <p><strong>Mixed bag of experiences at Woodlands Checkpoint</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans and Malaysians who transited through the
               Woodlands Checkpoint from the Causeway on Sunday evening spoke of a 
              mixed bag of experiences, with 10 minutes to an hour spent at Malaysian 
              Customs.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>While Singaporean 
              Harun Wasimon, 49, found the finger-printing process quite easy, with 
              each person taking two minutes on average, his wife Nina Begum, 46, 
              found it "quite awkward".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>She experienced two rounds of errors before successfully scanning her fingerprints.<br><br>The couple and five of their relatives took half an hour altogether to clear Malaysian Customs.<br><br>Several
               commuters told MediaCorp of a vehicle tailback stretching one to three 
              kilometres into Johor from the Malaysian checkpoint.<br><br>Malaysian 
              security guard Morthy Veerasamy, 58, had to wait an hour at Woodlands 
              before his company bus arrived to pick him up at 7.15pm.<br><br>The bus came from Pelangi in Johor and was caught in a jam stretching 3km, said Mr Morthy.<br><br>Commuters cited various factors for the jam.<br><br>A
               35-year-old Singaporean, who only wanted to be known as Mr Chong, said 
              he took an hour to clear Malaysian Customs while heading across the 
              Causeway to pick his mother up at 3pm, due to a tour group ahead of him 
              and the finger-printing process.<br><br>But the trip back into Singapore at about 6pm was smoother and took just 15 minutes, he said.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Travellers thinking twice about Johor trips</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The traffic snarl plaguing the Causeway and the 
              Second Link on weekends is causing some frequent travellers to hold back
               on trips up north.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Motorists have been locked in jams the last two weekends, with some reportedly taking up to seven hours to clear immigration.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This comes after 
              Malaysia rolled out its biometric fingerprint system at the start of the
               month, which requires travellers to scan both index fingers in addition
               to getting their passports stamped.<br><br>46-year-old engineer, Rene Gorada, organises bi-monthly golf tournaments for people living in Singapore.<br><br>The
               group, which typically consists of 50 to 70 golfers, would travel to 
              neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand for 
              their Sunday tournaments.<br><br>Mr Gorada said half their games are held in Johor Bahru.<br><br>He
               said: "You need to get to the golf course on time. Some of them are 
              suggesting going somewhere else, maybe Batam. But (there are) some other
               concerns.....going to Batam, it's a whole-day affair because you have 
              to take a ferry. So most of the golfers still prefer Malaysia, because 
              it's nearer. The only thing is that you really have to plan and beat the
               traffic jam."<br><br>Mr Gorada said the group has to leave at 6am to make the 8am tee-off. This is an hour earlier than previously.<br><br>Another golfer living in Singapore, 51-year-old Ren Carino, said he drives to Johor three times a month to play golf. <br><br>But
               with the current congestion, he may move his game to another country. 
              He said: "We would rather go to Batam now, or Bintan, Indonesia. It's a 
              lot better now in terms of traffic jams.. there are no traffic jams 
              (there)."<br><br>With Singaporeans avoiding the hassle of crossing the Causeway, businesses in Johor Bahru are reporting a drop in sales.<br><br>P.
               Sivakumar, president of the Malaysian Indian Business Association 
              (MIBA), said the city heavily depends on business from Singaporeans.<br><br>"Most
               of them (Singaporeans) patronise all the eateries that have cropped up 
              everywhere in Johor Bahru. And it's of great concern at the moment, 
              because what we're receiving is that initially the jam was 7 hours, now 
              it's around 5 hours, and it's not good for business," he said.<br><br>Mr
               Sivakumar said no formal survey has been conducted yet on how badly 
              business has been affected, and his assessment is based on feedback 
              received from merchants.<br><br>Malaysia's Home Ministry 
              secretary-general Mahmood Adam has said it's "unfair to blame the 
              biometric system for causing the congestion".<br><br>He said the 
              congestion only happened at the Causeway and the Second Link, but not at
               any of the other 67 checkpoints across Malaysia.<br><br>He pinned the blame on the high volume of human traffic and daily movement between Johor Bahru and Singapore.<br><br>But MIBA's Mr Sivakumar disagrees. <br><br>He
               said there has always been high traffic flow at the Causeway, and the 
              jams only started after the biometric system was implemented.<br><br>Mr 
              Sivakumar said he plans to make another appeal to the Malaysian 
              government to remove the system and revert back to just stamping of 
              passports.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
