              <p>HEALTH Minister Khaw Boon Wan devoted his first post on the Health
              Ministry's new blog to explaining how parents can get a pneumococcal
              vaccine for their babies under the childhood immunisation programme.</p>
              <p>He had announced the move in Parliament on Tuesday, in response to a
              request by MP Fatimah Lateef to include the vaccine in the schedule,
              but could not expand on it as he was not asked any questions.</p>
              <p>He wrote on the blog at mohsingapore. blogspot.com: 'Dr Fatimah
              Lateef and Dr Lam Pin Min told me, during tea break, that they had not
              expected a positive reply and were too shocked to ask supplementary
              questions.' Asked by e-mail if not being allowed to elaborate was his
              reason for blogging, the minister replied: 'Ha! You saw the
              disappointment on my face :( '</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw joins other ministers and MPs like Foreign Minister George
              Yeo and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Teo Ser Luck who have started
              blogging to engage the public in a more personal way.</p>
              <p>He said he wants to use such online platforms to share the Ministry
              of Health's (MOH) plans, get feedback and suggestions and 'forge
              consensus'.</p>
              <p>He added: 'I hope to anchor in this platform a large constituency
              of Singaporeans who are interested in health matters, whom we can
              directly engage through this medium.'</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw said he hoped to be open with the workings of the ministry
              through the blog, which was set up earlier this month and is not a
              personal one. 'Every health policy should be based on sound arguments
              and we do not monopolise wisdom,' he wrote. 'If our policy is flawed
              and can be enhanced, we welcome comments and will adopt practical
              suggestions.'</p>
              <p>He has also encouraged other ministry officials to use MOH's Facebook page, also set up recently, to post their blogs.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw said he might post frequently, given the many health
              issues, adding that on Thursday he 'may blog about workplace health
              screening after the event and before I go for my gym exercise at lunch
              time'. The event at Chai Chee will see the launch of mobile health
              screening.</p>
              <p>Next on the agenda: Twitter.</p>

              <p><strong>Minister Khaw's blog on frontline H1N1 staff at F1 race</strong></p>
              <p>The organisers of this year's Singapore F1 race have allocated 60 free
              tickets to the front line staff working in the trenches against the
              H1N1 flu. <br> <br> And Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan says it's a great gesture to honour
              these wonderful fighters for their bravery and dedication to their
              fellow human beings. <br> <br> In a posting on the Health Ministry's blog today, Mr Khaw says not
              everyone could be invited to the race, but the gesture was well
              appreciated by the front line staff. <br> <br> He adds that they've ensured that every institution would be represented, and not just those from hospitals or clinics. <br> <br> For instance, invitations were extended to some who measured
              temperatures at the borders, and some who work in the Aloha Chalets. <br> <br> Some GPs manning the flu clinics were also invited to the race. <br> <br> Mr Khaw says he looks forward to meeting up with fellow H1N1 fighters, on a different track, under different circumstances. <br> <br> He adds that there'll be two reasons for him to feel proud at the race tonight. <br> <br> One is Singapore's successful hosting of the F1 event despite the global recession. <br> <br> And the other is the H1N1 fighters who keep Singapore safe. <br> <br> Minister Khaw says that if H1N1 had gone out of control, the F1 event would not have been the only casualty.</p>
