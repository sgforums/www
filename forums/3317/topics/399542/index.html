              <p><strong>By Connie Er</strong></p>
              <p>A CONFIDENT-LOOKING teenager strode up to the microphone at a recent 
              forum in Singapore and asked if China's leaders had what it took to push
               for even greater reforms than what the legendary Deng Xiaoping 
              accomplished.</p>
              <p>Noting that the late paramount leader had the support of the military
               when he pushed through economic reforms, the Dunman High student 
              wondered aloud how far President Hu Jintao and his likely successor Xi 
              Jinping would be able to take reforms without a comparable military 
              background.</p>
              <p>Would China's economic development falter, causing instability or 
              even the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party, asked the student.</p>
              <p>The occasion was the first in the China Insight forum series 
              organised by Singapore-based networking group Business China. The guest 
              speaker was Hong Kong Phoenix TV commentator and veteran journalist Yang
               Jinlin.</p>
              <p>The student's question earned him praise from Dr Yang.</p>
              <p>'I'm very impressed that Singaporean students are of such high 
              calibre. There's certainly great hope for Singapore!' declared Dr Yang.</p>
              <p>The teenager replied: 'Er, sorry, but I'm from China.'</p>
              <p>The audience roared with laughter.</p>
              <p>The student was not the only Chinese person who spoke up. Out of 
              eight questions from the floor, six others came from his countrymen.</p>
              <p>It was a sober reminder that in Singapore-China networking, it is the
               recent arrivals from China who are taking the lead.</p>
              <p>The forum had drawn some 500 people, mainly Business China members, 
              working partners and university and Special Assistance Plan school 
              students.</p>
              <p>Many were Chinese exchange students. They were concerned about how 
              China could win over the hearts of the Taiwanese and the world. In 
              short, they wanted to know how China could promote its culture globally.</p>
              <p>Resourceful young Chinese people studying or working in Singapore 
              have been quick to link up with their countrymen and to stay abreast of 
              new developments back home.</p>
              <p>In a sign of the active participation of the Chinese in local 
              networks, the April 4 inaugural forum was supported by the Xiamen 
              University Alumni. (Dr Yang holds a doctorate in history from the 
              university.)</p>
              <p>Previous waves of immigrants, dating back to the 1850s, might have 
              joined clan associations. But many of the recent arrivals from China, 
              including students, are not from southern China. They do not speak the 
              southern dialects of Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese or Hainanese.</p>
              <p>They come from all over China, including mega-cities such as Beijing 
              and Shanghai, and north-eastern provinces like Heilongjiang and the 
              central provinces like Hunan.</p>
              <p>Many of the newly arrived Chinese are better educated than previous 
              generations of assimilated ethnic Chinese. They are keen to join 
              broad-based associations organised by bilingual new migrants, like the 
              Hua Yuan Association, reported Professor Liu Hong, formerly of the 
              Chinese Studies department at National University of Singapore, in his 
              book New Migrants And The Revival Of Overseas Chinese Nationalism.</p>
              <p>The Hua Yuan Association as well as the Tian Fu Club and Tianjin Club
               are some of the groups formed by mainland Chinese in Singapore. The 
              three groups have more than 4,000 members between them, many of whom are
               university graduates.</p>
              <p>But the new generation of Chinese expatriates and immigrants is also 
              keen to network through local organisations like the Singapore Chinese 
              Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) - which in fact started as a 
              self-help group in 1906 to serve new Chinese immigrants.</p>
              <p>To help the new arrivals integrate into society, the SCCCI set up its
               Immigrants Liaison Group in 2007 and it drew entrepreneurs and 
              professionals into the fold.</p>
              <p>Business China - a brainchild of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew - was 
              also set up by the SCCCI, in November 2007.</p>
              <p>It aims to help those who are interested in sharpening their 
              bilingual and bicultural edge to engage China. The new forum series it 
              is organising will invite academics and industry experts from China, 
              Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore to offer their views on issues that will
               have an impact on China and the world.</p>
              <p>Business China's chief executive officer Josephine Teo, who is an MP 
              for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, has said special attention would be given to 
              helping younger Singaporeans know China better.</p>
              <p>Judging from the response at the forum, Chinese nationals are also 
              benefiting.</p>
              <p>Only one question at the forum was posed by a Singaporean. It came 
              after the forum's moderator, Ms Chun Guek Lay, specifically invited 
              Singaporeans to speak up.</p>
              <p>The Singaporean, who identified himself as an alumnus of Dunman High,
               greeted Dr Yang in Hokkien, and then asked, in Mandarin, about 
              conflicts between old and new forces in China as it emerges as a strong 
              power.</p>
              <p>But it was the Chinese who had led the way in asking the questions. 
              Singaporeans have much to learn from them - even in their own country.</p>
              <p>After the session ended, the Dunman High student who had asked the 
              question about Deng Xiaoping approached his teacher - also a Chinese 
              national - who evaluated his performance.</p>
              <p>'I think you should have got straight to the point when asking 
              questions, instead of providing so much context,' the teacher said. 'But
               hey, well done,' she added, beaming.</p>
              <p>When even a question is a teachable moment, you know the Chinese here
               mean business.</p>

              <p>Asking a cliched question also can get praises ah? Sinkies dont ask bcos they dont want to waste time asking STOOPID question. Want to ask, ask something that really requires an interesting response.</p>
              <p>Ask STOOPID open ended question like this, sure get the usual rhetorical answer la. Like "Sure can, China can rise with the support of its proud citizen (and PAP's open door policy)"</p>
              <p>All these ah tiongs ask question, do they rly ask those that got make sense one ah? Quality, not quantity!</p>
              <p>And the "<em>I'm from China</em>" part also KNN super patriotic of them sia. Come here to SG want to show off the tiong-ness. ...claim to want to blend in but in times of praise suddenly want to stand up and announce to the whole world that he's from PRC. Like dont want praise for Sinkies, only want praise for China ppl like that.</p>

              <p>we are just a drop in the ocean.</p>
              <p>if you think china threatens us then you must be crazy.</p>
              <p>US and japan are the ones that should be worried about china.</p>
              <p>pleaseÂ dont over-estimate ourselves.</p>
              <p>remember what one taiwanese said, "Ã©Â¼Â»Ã¥Â±Å½Ã©âÂ£Ã¤Â¹ËÃ¥Â°ï¿½Ã§Å¡âÃ¥âºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶...."Â - its crude but nonetheless true.</p>

              <p>look at the number of wars china fought, civil ones. they were infact i say the last of the more 'civilized' country to declare independence and a country as a whole. when they do look at what they did to the world. cutting down costs with super cheap labor, throwing their cheap labor and employment problems to other countries, with compromise to quality. look at what they eat to stay warm. look at what they business men did to make a quick buck (milk powder and fake tonics with uneatable metals).</p>
              <p>if you think what japan did to them during the sino-jap era and WW2, think now the number of people who fled instead of staying to fight the japs, think the number of traitors who wock or tip off the japanese so that they can be pay, have safe passage and food only for their own family. Now they put the blame back at japan.</p>
              <p>china is a continent that has to be controlled. russia, US, Japan, Europe and other muslim countries all know. I am just glad that Taiwan hs her own army unblike HK, i am just gald that N.korea is there to keep everyone busy. to get to sg they have to get past MY and Indonesia first.</p>
