              <p>98% of western Europe don’t add fluoride to the water
              supplies in many communities. Countries with fluoride in the
              water have taken it out. </p>
              <p>Today the fluorides that goes in our drinking water is raw industrial pollution from the Phosphate
              Industry. It’s a waste that’s scrubbed from the smokestacks and dumped into reservoirs. That is a raw industrial poison.</p>
              <p>Sodium fluoride is used as a rat poison for a long time.</p>
              <p>Fluoride is a key ingredient in industry used for making aluminum. It’s
              used for making steel. It is used for producing high-octane gasoline,
              to name a few industries the dental story is a minor story.</p>

              <p>If you think that's something, get this: a normal ingredient of normal potato chips is also found in NUCLEAR BOMBS.<br> <br> I'm not kidding either. It's SALT!</p>
              <p>Salt isn't going to kill you, it's
              delicious and healthy and your body needs it. It also just happens to
              have other crazy less-healthy applications, and those don't make it any
              less healthy.<br> Same goes for flouride. It has amazing dental health benefits, only it
              also happens to be useful as a poison for certain animals that can't
              deal with it in concentrated when also combined with other chemicals
              (in equal doses, which you would never normally ingest, you would maybe
              throw up at best, but not die). Just because it's also used in poisons
              doesn't stop it having great health benefits when used in the way you
              normally use it (through water in many states, and from your doctor).<br> <br> I bet you at least half the chemicals you regularly consume and that
              are a vital part of your diet can also be found in something that will
              kill you.<br> I've already started off and I'll keep going.<br> Iron is in meat and bullets.<br> Potassium is in bananas and gunpowder.<br> Sulfur is found in many of the plants we eat, and gunpowder again.<br> Various thickening agents can be found in processed food, and napalm.</p>
              <p>Nitrogen is a basic component of our atmosphere and can be found in semtex plastic explosives.and the list goes on. And so what? Chill the fuck out and deal with the fact that chemicals have more than one use.</p>

              <p>in the 1970's, children in US were given daily fluoride tablets until some died of fluoride poisoning.........</p>

              <p>And btw theres no fluoride. The word fluoride means it has fluorine in it. If you say "Fluoride is rat poison", you're wrong. "Fluoride" doesn't
              appear in nature by itself. Fluorine is highly attracted to other
              chemicals . You RARELY
              find it by itself in nature.</p>
              <p>As far as the chemical (sodium fluoride) being in rat poison - again,
              this is just fearmongering bred from a misunderstanding of chemistry.
              Sure, it might be in rat poison - that doesn't MAKE THIS chemical rat
              poison. That doesn't mean this chemical has even close to the same
              properties as rat poison.<br> <br> You know what's used for bombs? Hydrogen! You know what you breathe? Hydrogen! OMG ur gonna diiiiiiie! Stupid, stupid bullshit.</p>

              <p>Sodium Fluoride is a real compound, and in high quantitys can cause damage to humans. <br> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride">Basic coverage of Sodium fluoride on wiki</a>.<br> The average percentage of sodium fluoride is often well below 1%(commonly around 0.2%).<br> If anyone says that sodium fluoride is safe, they are wrong. Like all things, we must have moderation.<br> You can have 0.001 of mercury in your body and be fine. But get to 2% mercury and your body will be poisoned.<br> Yes I am comparing the two. Both have been used in the medical community for medical purposes, both are toxic.<br> <br> Now that's not to say sodium fluoride doesn't do it's job. It does help in cleaning your teeth.<br> Can it be poisonous/toxic? Yes, thus we only put very small quantity into our toothpastes.<br> <br> Do we need it? Unproven, if we had a much cleaner + healthy diet. We
              would not need to worry so much about our teeth. But that is not easy
              for most of us living in the city.<br> <br> In summary:<br> Sodium Fluoride generally has been fine for the majority of the worlds population. <br> <br> The question going forward are: Do we still need Sodium Fluoride? and is there better alternatives?<br> <br> <br> (BTW stop the conspiracy theory action and stop the conspiracy bashing.
              Both are pointless, only things worth it, are real action for the

              <p>info not from me hor...............truth about fluoride came
              from doctors and scientists.............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are a number of states in US and few European countries
              trying to stop fluoridation of their water
              supplies.................</p>
              <p>in the 1970's, children in US were given daily fluoride tablets
              until some died of fluoride poisoning.........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, you're most welcome to continue consuming fluoride and
              aspartame..............in fact, i hope you do.</p>

              <p>there is conspiracy for toothpaste but I'll not say it out  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>well, a little bit of fluoride wouldn't kill. Switch to organic toothpaste if one is so afraid of it. Be prepared to pay more as well...have everything that's able to be organic, organic</p>
