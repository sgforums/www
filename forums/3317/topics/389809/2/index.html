              <p>Solar technology has always had the problem of energy storage. There might be enough sunlight to provide us with the energy to run Singapore during the day but where do we get the power at night?</p>
              <p>It is the same with wind, how are we going to store the excess energy so it would be enough for us to use at night or when there's no wind?</p>
              <p>The most solar and wind farms can do is to supplement our energy needs, it's too unstable to rely on for everyday use.</p>
              <p>Unless we retool our entire economy to be able to function factoring such disruptions i don't see it being applicable. Hell, i think it might actually be enjoyable.</p>

              <p><strong>Samsung C&amp;T wins deal to build Singapore's first LNG terminal</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: South Korea's Samsung C&amp;T Corporation has won the
              tender to build Singapore's first liquefied natural gas terminal. </span></p>
              <p><span>Samsung C&amp;T will handle the engineering, procurement and
              construction of the terminal under a contract worth about S$1 billion.
              <br> <br>The Singapore LNG Corporation (SLNG) announced this at a signing
              ceremony on Monday. SLNG was incorporated by the government's Energy
              Market Authority to own and develop Singapore's first LNG import
              terminal.
              <br> <br>SLNG's executive director, Neil McGregor, said: "There were many
              factors that led to selecting the Samsung proposal. Key to this was a
              very novel and efficient design, which minimised the footprint of the
              new terminal, thereby freeing up land within the site that SLNG can
              capitalise on to expand its business and the range of services it can
              provide in the future."
              <br> <br> All in, the government is investing S$1.5 billion in the LNG terminal project.
              <br> <br> LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid form, making the gas more practical to transport and store.
              <br> <br>The LNG terminal, which will occupy 30 hectares of land on the
              southwestern part of Jurong Island, is expected to be Asia's first
              open-access, multi-user terminal. <br> <br> It will not only provide capacity for Singapore to import re-gasified
              LNG for its own needs, but also open up opportunities for companies to
              make use of the terminal for LNG trading. <br> <br> The LNG terminal will have an initial capacity of 3.5 million tonnes
              per year, slightly above past projections of 3 million tonnes, with
              provisions to expand it to 6 million tonnes per year or more if needed.
              <br> <br> The terminal is now due to be completed in early 2013, after a
              deferment of one year. Foster Wheeler Asia Pacific has been named the
              project management consultant. <br> <br> The government said in June last year it was taking over development of
              the terminal to avoid more delays due to the credit crunch. The project
              was previously fronted by a PowerGas-led consortium, which included GDF
              Suez.
              <br> <br>Currently, 80 per cent of Singapore's electricity comes from
              gas-fired power plants. LNG will be an additional source to help
              Singapore meet increasing energy needs.
              <br> <br>Lawrence Wong, chief executive of Energy Market Authority, said:
              "From an energy security point of view, our imperative is to want to
              diversify our sources of gas. The terminal enables us to do that,
              because with the LNG terminal, we plug into the global gas market and
              we would have a much more diversified source of gas that we can get
              from all over the world.
              <br> <br>"Of course, through our aggregator British Gas, whom we've
              appointed, we would be able to access gas on a market basis, on a
              competitive price. So, I think, from that point of view, the LNG
              terminal is a critical infrastructure that will provide for our energy
              security and ensure that we have a more sustainable energy future."

              <p>The human body is not a very efficient machine, the energy wasted in the construction of specialized infrastructure in order to hook humans up and use their bio electrical energy to power is extremely wasteful and impractical.</p>
              <p>That energy is better off spent in creating farmlands to produce biofuels to burn directly, instead of having to go through the middle man of the human body to convert it to energy.</p>

              <p>In consideration of type of energy generation options I believe the benefit of our people should be the major factor to consider. Year ago we heard that the conversion of fuel power generation to gas power generation could save us lots of money but of course we could see it very clear that our people don't really benefit much from such conversion. If we utilize nuclear power generation system, I could foresee that any cost saving would only benefit few small groups of people and corporations but not the general public. If this is the case why should we taking such high risk of demolishing Singapore into rubbles. Even if we have to build nuclear power plant, we must first consider building it in some nearby country to minimize possible risks. If such is the case than why don't we just build wind or solar energy plants? I have personally managed the design and construction of both wind and solar power plants and understand they are not really difficult choices.</p>
              <p>We all know that the initial investment cost is high, we all know that the supply of electricity by these green power generation plants are not constant and regular but I can assure you that we could manage it. I am not talking about having 100% green energy but 20 to 30% would be feasible target within the near future. If China could manage its green energy at the ratio of 20%, I believe we are in better position to do so, unless we are only looking at short term gains and benefits.</p>
              <p>Nuclear power generation is an easy way out but we do not need it within the near future.</p>

              <p><br>The problem has always been the same since solar and wind power were first brought up as an alternative.</p>
              <p>Storage. Storage. Storage.</p>
              <p>You can keep your fossil fuels/NG/coal in a metal can during off peak power usage and increase the output during peak hours. It is the same with nuclear.</p>
              <p>For solar and wind you can't store the energy effectively and increase output whenever you please.</p>
              <p>I can understand the gradual adoption of wind and solar to compensate for reducing production of fossil fuels but nuclear is the only technology currently that could hope to provide a permanent solution to the fossil fuel problem.</p>
              <p>I have said it before and i'd say it again i don't mind a change to the way we use energy to adapt to the unstable source of solar and wind but if we want to continue BAU as we do now nuclear is the only reliable source.</p>
