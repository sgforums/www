              <p id="story_continues_1" class="introduction">Police
                   are trying to trace the owner of a life-sized tiger toy which sparked a
                   major police alert in Hampshire over fears a real animal was on the 
                  loose.</p>
              <p>Officers were deployed and a helicopter was scrambled with 
                  specialist thermal imaging cameras over the field, near Hedge End, on 
                  Saturday afternoon.</p>
              <p>The scare stopped play at the Rose Bowl cricket ground for 20 minutes.</p>
              <p>Hampshire police said the toy was being treated as lost property but they were investigating whether it was a hoax.</p>
              <p>They said they did not know how it got there but was similar to one which would be won at a fair.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="cross-head">Tranquiliser darts </span></strong></p>
              <p>The alarm was raised by a member of the public who spotted 
                  what they thought was an escaped white tiger hiding in a field, through a
                   camera's zoom lens.</p>
              <p>Officers said they had responded as if it was a real incident, close to junction seven of the M27.</p>
              <p>Animal specialists at nearby Marwell Zoo were enlisted by 
                  police to offer advice and were prepared to send a team with 
                  tranquiliser darts to overcome the tiger.</p>
              <div class="caption body-narrow-width"><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/52885000/jpg/_52885111_012039760-1.jpg" alt="The tiger" width="304" height="171"></div>

              <div class="caption body-narrow-width"><span style="width: 304px;">The stuffed toy is being treated as lost property</span></div>
              <div class="caption body-narrow-width"><br></div>
              <p>John Pullen, curator of mammals, said: "We offered advice to 
                  the police and we immediately gathered a team of staff who have been 
                  trained to deal with situations such as this.</p>
              <p>"We were moments away from making the journey when we received a call from police to say it was a stuffed toy."</p>
              <p>Golfers at County Golf Club were also escorted from the 
                  course and Saturday's cricket game between Hamsphire Academy and South 
                  Wilts was suspended for about half an hour.</p>
              <p>Tony Middleton, Hampshire Cricket Academy director, added: 
                  "Rumours came round that there was a tiger on the golf course and we 
                  just carried on playing until a policeman came over and told us to clear
                   the area.</p>
              <p>"I assumed there was [a tiger] with everything that was going on, but we felt quite safe here."</p>
              <p>Officers discovered it to be a stuffed toy after it rolled over in the down draft from the police helicopter.</p>
              <p>"It is being treated as lost property but we don't know how it came to be in the field and whether it may have been a hoax.</p>
              <p>"Police are keen to reiterate that they have a duty to 
                  protect the public and therefore take calls of this nature as serious as
                   any other calls reporting potential dangers to members of the public," a
                   spokeswoman said.</p>
