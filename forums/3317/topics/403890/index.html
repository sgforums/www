              <p>MOSCOW (AFP) - â€“ Reclusive Russian mathematician Grigory Perelman, 
              who shot to global fame after claiming to solve the seemingly 
              intractable Poincare conjecture, has refused another prize for the 
              achievement.</p>
              <p>The Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) said Thursday that Perelman 
              informed the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research center that he 
              would not accept its million-dollar prize.</p>
              <p>"I have turned down (the award)," Perelman told the Interfax news 
              agency by telephone. "The main reason is disagreement with the organised
               mathematics community. I do not like their decisions, I consider them 
              unfair."</p>
              <p>"I think that the contribution of American mathematician (Richard) 
              Hamilton in solving this problem is no less than mine."</p>
              <p>On June 8-9, the institute held a conference in Paris to celebrate 
              Perelman's resolution of the Poincare conjecture, a riddle on properties
               of multi-dimensional space that had perplexed mathematicians since it 
              was coined by Frenchman Henri Poincare in 1904.</p>
              <p>The prize was announced after teams of experts examining his 
              findings found Perelman's solution to be flawless.</p>
              <p>CMI said it would announce in the fall how the prize money turned 
              down by Perelman "will be used to benefit mathematics."</p>
              <p>Perelman, who is also known as Grisha Perelman, already has a long 
              history of turning down awards and not showing up at award ceremonies.</p>
              <p>He published his findings on the Internet in 2002 and 2003, and by 
              2006, Perelman was awarded the mathematics world's version of a Nobel 
              prize, the Fields Medal, as experts said he had indeed worked it all 
              out.</p>
              <p>But the 44-year-old mathematician became the first person to turn 
              down a Fields Prize, awarded every four years since 1936, saying he did 
              not want to be a figurehead for the mathematics community from which he 
              says he has withdrawn.</p>
              <p>The Poincare conjecture is regarded as one of the most important 
              questions in topology, a geometry-related branch of mathematics which 
              deals with spatial properties.</p>
              <p>In simple layman's terms, it asserts that any shape without a hole 
              can be stretched or shrunk into a sphere.</p>
