              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) said it expects its air-conditioning system to be fully restored by this Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This came after the resort encountered a malfunction in the system's chilling units on Monday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>RWS said the impact has been minimal, as back-up systems are in place.<br><br>It will also be reviewing procedures to avoid a similar incident.<br><br>The integrated resort (IR) said it's due to a technical fault in the motor unit of its chilling system.<br><br>The resort uses a centralised system, so the problem is resort-wide.<br><br>Clement
               Ng, Senior Executive of Communications at Resorts World Sentosa said: 
              "Our chiller units actually undergo regular maintenance and at the same 
              time, they are monitored round the clock. However, the part at fault 
              this time round is the motor, and the parts are not being observed 
              during the regular maintenance. As such it triggered this incident. <br><br>"We
               view this incident very seriously and we will be stepping up and 
              reviewing our provisions for air-conditioning as well as learning from 
              this incident."<br><br>The resort said back-up chillers were activated 
              once it got word of the situation. The move does not restore conditions 
              to a 100 per cent, but it's expected to minimise the impact on visitors.<br><br>A family from Malaysia said their dining experience at the IR was affected.<br><br>"It's
               very humid, very hot inside so it's very uncomfortable, it's totally 
              unacceptable. It made the dining experience very unsatisfactory," said a
               visitor. <br><br>At another store, a couple from New Zealand had a different view.<br><br>"It's
               very pleasant, we do not have a lot of air-conditioning from where we 
              come from," said the New Zealand couple. "When you come inside, it cools
               you right down nicely."<br><br>The resort's Festive Hotel said business has not been affected and it has not received any complaints from guests. <br><br>"We
               are monitoring the situation very closely. Our room attendants are 
              working on the floors. We have briefed (them) already to be in touch 
              with us immediately if they notice the air-conditioning system is having
               problems. So we are monitoring from there and we will take corrective 
              action," said Henry Cheah, director of Rooms, Festive Hotel, Resorts 
              World Sentosa.<br><br>Still, the incident has had some impact.<br><br>Two shows of Voyage De La Vie had to be cancelled - with the next show slated for Friday.<br><br>RWS said some customers are seeking a refund, though numbers are small.<br><br>Visitors have the option to switch dates for other shows.<br><br>Universal Studios' extended operating hours of 10am to 9pm for the school holiday period will also resume on Friday.<br><br>It's unclear if tenants have lodged complaints for loss of business as a result of the incident.<br><br>RWS said it will work closely to assist them in providing a pleasant experience for guests.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Air-conditioning woes at Resorts World Sentosa resolved</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The air-conditioning woes at Resorts World Sentosa 
              are over. The integrated resort said the motor breakdown of its air 
              conditioning system's chilling units has been fixed and that 
              temperatures are now back to normal.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The malfunction 
              which first began on Monday, triggered the resort to roll out portable 
              chiller units to tenants to help keep visitors cool.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Two shows of Voyage de la Vie also had to be cancelled. <br><br>Clement
               Ng, a spokesman for the IR, said: "As of this morning, we have deployed
               our facilities team physically, to check the temperatures and the air 
              conditioned places within the resort. We made sure that the temperatures
               are all below 24 degree celsius.<br><br>"All our shows, including our 
              resident show Voyage de la Vie, will resume tonight, the Universal 
              Studios Singapore will also resume our extended operating hours from 
              10am to 9pm."<br><br>The resort said it will conduct a review of its air
               conditioning system. This include looking into additional backups and 
              enhancing maintenance by creating an early warning system through the 
              installation of additional monitoring sensors.<br><br>It is unclear 
              whether the malfunction has had an impact on businesses. The resort said
               it will listen to feedback from tenants and deal with any issues on a 
              case-by-case basis.<br><br>When Channel NewsAsia visited the resort for 
              about two hours on Friday afternoon between 1 and 3pm, some 
              establishments were still using the portable chiller units provided to 
              them. A spokesperson from Hard Rock Cafe said they were doing so, even 
              though it noted that it is much cooler in the restaurant. At least two 
              other outlets said that temperatures have yet to return to normal. <br><br>The integrated resort said the portable chiller units will be removed by Friday.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
