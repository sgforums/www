              <p><span id="lw_1301914807_3" class="yshortcuts">London</span>, Apr 4 (ANI): A woman bigamist in <span id="lw_1301914807_1" class="yshortcuts">Britain</span> is said to have married a second man, who is 20 years her junior, while
               still being married to her first, and then running off with a third 
              after her honeymoon.</p>
              <p>Sharon Broadley, 40, who was already married to Paul Russell, 
              admitted to tying the knot with Darryl Broadley, 20, who described their
               marriage and honeymoon on the <span id="lw_1301914807_0" class="yshortcuts">Isle of Wight</span> as "wonderful".</p>
              <p>"We had a wonderful day and a wonderful honeymoon on the Isle of 
              Wight," the Daily Mail quoted Darryl, who was only 19 at the time of the
               wedding, as telling police.</p>
              <p>"We were planning to have a blessing at the church in Market Lavington," he said.</p>
              <p>But the week before the blessing was to take place, he received a 
              text message from Sharon to say she was sorry but she could not see him 
              again.</p>
              <p>He subsequently heard that she had formed a relationship with another man.</p>
              <p>"She made me feel deceived and cheated. I don't think she knows how 
              to tell the truth. She makes me feel not very good about myself. My 
              confidence was down a lot but it is returning very slowly," he said.</p>
              <p>At Salisbury Magistrates Court, Michelle Hewitt, prosecuting, said 
              that Sharon had married Paul in July 2004 but they split in 2008 
              following allegations of domestic abuse.</p>
              <p>She met Darryl, who lived with his parents in Erlestoke, Wiltshire, 
              at the pub and they formed a relationship, having a child together.</p>
              <p>Darryl told police that his "wife" had said she had got a decree absolute and they were now free to marry at <span id="lw_1301914807_2" class="yshortcuts">Devizes</span> register office on November 14, 2009.</p>
              <p>Stephen Clifford, defending, said his client had made a full 
              admission to police and wanted to apologise to Darryl in open court.</p>
              <p>"She did not commit this offence for financial gain or for 
              immigration purposes. She is a victim of domestic violence who had to 
              live in a safe house in <span id="lw_1301914807_4" class="yshortcuts">Marlborough</span> before being re-housed," he stated.</p>
              <p>Sharon was sentenced to a 12-month community order and ordered to do 
              120 hours unpaid work in the community. There was no order for costs.</p>
              <p>After the case Paul, Sharon's legal husband, from Corsham in Wiltshire, denied all his wife's allegations of physical abuse.</p>
              <p>"She is a compulsive liar and a very manipulative person. It really 
              amazes me that she has got away with a community order," he said.</p>
              <p>"I did get divorce papers from her solicitor three years ago citing 
              me as the villain of the piece but I would not have anything to do with 
              it.</p>
              <p>"I feel sorry for the young man. It has ruined his life," he added.
