              <p>I'm sorry if some of you guys misunderstand me.. I don't think I would disregard the risk of this virus and I know it is highly infectious.. But really, do people need to panic as such? I'm just tickled as to see why people are gancheonging as though its T-Virus spreading.. Perhaps it is highly infectious, sure, but to close down schools for another week and for some people in the public to gancheong so much is really a bit too drama mama.. If everyone just practise personal hygiene then, there should not be any problem really.. even if they shut down schools, not as though the kids will quarantine themselves at home.. That was my main point lah that I think some people in the public are just over-dramatizing and exagerrating the extent of this virus.. Its alright if you disagree, I welcome any points..</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Samsung Singapore has confirmed its first H1N1 case.
              The person is an employee from South Korea who is in Singapore for
              training.
              <br> <br> In an email reply to 938LIVE, the company said the employee was diagnosed as being infected on Friday.
              <br> <br> He displayed symptoms of the virus when he reported for work and was immediately sent to hospital.
              <br> <br> Samsung said he is currently recovering well in hospital.
              <br> <br> All 25 employees from Samsung Singapore were tested for H1N1 and all tested negative for the virus.
              <br> <br> As a precautionary measure, all 25 employees are exempted from office duties, and will operate from home until Friday, July 3.
              <br> <br> The company said it has since thoroughly disinfected its office. </span></p>

              <p>I understand that bro, but whats your point bro? If you talk about possibilities, there are millions of possibilities.. We are not even done with solving HIV problems to start with.. So you trying to say closing down schools for one extra week will solve the problem? Do you know other implications of closing down schools for one extra week?<br><br>IMO, most students, they lobbying for the extra school closure idea, mainly because its extra holiday for them, not really cos they care about mitigation of virus or what not. Take note I said most and not all.<br><br>Marcteng: doubt its gonna disappear any sooner.. Normal flu is already like so easily passed around, and this h1n1 is even more infectious so it's almost impossible to eliminate it fully. But perhaps, the medical industry can press on to find a vaccine to combat this virus and its future mutational capabilities. That is the only hope, imo.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Doctors at polyclinic told me twice I had common flu - H1N1 student at RI</span></strong></p>
              <p>One of the students at the Raffles Institution Boarding School, who
              is down with H1H1, said he was told twice by doctors at a polyclinic
              that he had the common flu.</p>
              <p>And it was not until he saw a doctor at a private clinic before he
              was sent to the Communicable Disease Centre and tested positive for
              H1N1.</p>
              <p>The second year junior college student who is a foreigner also said
              he had not travelled out of Singapore during the June holidays.</p>
              <p>The JC 2 student said he developed a high fever, headache and a
              runny nose last Tuesday, two days after he returned from a volunteering
              camp.</p>
              <p>He was told by a teacher in his boarding school to see a doctor immediately.</p>
              <p>The student subsequently went to the Ang Mo Kio polyclinic on the same day and again on the following day.</p>
              <p>" They think it is just like a normal virus so they gave me normal
              flu treatment, like antibiotics and all that. They said it is just like
              a normal flu, then on Thursday night I went to a family clinic because
              I got high fever and afterwhich they refer me to Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital. "</p>
              <p>The student who has been admitted to the CDC since Saturday, says his fever has subsided and he is doing well.</p>
              <p>As for the camp which he attended, the organiser YMCA says it has
              yet to verify that the student had indeed gotten the virus there.</p>
              <p>The 4 -day camp was attended by nearly 250 people about half of whom were beneficiaries from special needs organisations.</p>
              <p>YMCA's General Secretary Albert Ching says they have conducted
              temperature checks throughout the camp and have since called up all the
              participants and told them to monitor for flu-like symptoms.</p>
              <p>So far, there have been no suspected cases.</p>
              <p>Over at the Raffles Institution Boarding School where the student
              was residing, boarders have been quarantined due to the four confirmed
              cases of H1N1.</p>
              <p>According to one student staying there, mid term tests for those who
              had been in close contact with the affected students, are being taken
              in individual rooms.</p>
              <p>These students will not be graded in this round of tests.</p>
              <p>" What we are doing right now is to have our exams in our respective
              rooms. We received the papers around an hour and a half after the paper
              in school is being distributed, then our teacher will then give us the
              paper for us to do it by ourselves. "</p>
              <p>At other boarding schools, preparations have been made for students quarantined after returning from affected countries.</p>
              <p>ACS Independent for instance has issued 217 Leave Of Absence, half of which are for the students residing in its nine halls.</p>
              <p>Principal of ACS I , Dr Ong Teck Chin.</p>
              <p>" We do not allow them to have easy access and contact with other
              students, they are all in their individual halls, we also have a
              medical centre, they do not go down to the dining hall for meals, we
              pack food for them. Our hall is built quite differently, every level
              has their own entertainment area so if they are isolated then still
              have the TV, radio and computers and we have staff on both levels to
              check on them. "</p>

              <p><strong>S'pore confirms 82 new H1N1 flu cases, makes transition to mitigation phase</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed 82 new cases of H1N1 flu, bringing the total to 783 so far. Most are local cases.
              <br> <br> Three hundred patients have fully recovered, while the rest are in
              stable condition. And the Health Ministry says it is making the
              transition to the mitigation phase, so those with flu-like symptoms may
              see polyclinic or pandemic preparedness clinic doctors, who will make a
              preliminary assessment. They need not call 993 for the special
              ambulance.
              <br> <br>Only severely ill or high-risk patients will be tested for the H1N1
              flu virus, and hospitalised if needed. Those with mild symptoms may be
              sent home and if necessary, prescribed anti-viral drugs.
              <br> <br>The ministry says doctors will take into account patients' risk of
              developing influenza-related complications, prevalence of H1N1 flu in
              the community and weigh the risks and benefits of treatment. <br> <br> Depending on the severity of patients' illness and other risk factors,
              they may be referred to the hospital for further management. Hospitals
              will increasingly focus on managing more complex cases.
              <br> <br>In this transition stage, MOH says hospitals have used their
              clinical discretion to selectively test patients for H1N1 flu only when
              required for clinical management (e.g. severely ill patients) and/or in
              situations where it will be of significant public health importance. <br> <br> Cases that are assessed to be very mild are not hospitalised but placed on home quarantine orders.
              <br> <br> The ministry says H1N1 flu testing is not necessary before treatment is
              started and there is no need for GPs to send all suspected cases to
              hospital for testing. <br> <br> - CNA/yt </span></p>

              <p><strong>Singapore confirms 95 new cases of H1N1 flu, bringing total to 878 cases</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed another 95 cases of H1N1 flu on Thursday, bringing the total to 878 so far.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry says 329 patients have been discharged and the rest are recuperating.</p>
              <p>Five
              new cases are from the cluster at Republic Polytechnic, where 4,500
              first—year students who had been on a one—week precautionary suspension
              of classes went back to school on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Those who think they
              have contracted the H1N1 flu are advised to visit polyclinics or
              pandemic preparedness clinics instead of calling 993 or going to the
              hospitals if the symptoms are not too serious.</p>
              <p>The polyclinics
              have set up separate queues for suspect H1N1 flu cases. There are also
              separate waiting areas and pharmacies for flu and fever patients to
              minimise the spread.</p>
              <p>With Singapore transiting into the mitigation phase, only some suspect H1N1 flu cases will be sent for lab testing.</p>
              <p>Assistant
              director of clinical services, SingHealth Polyclinics, Ruth Lim, said:
              "These will be patients who are severely ill, or special groups of
              patients who are at higher risk of developing complications. For
              example, pregnant women, patients with immuno—suppression those
              receiving active cancer treatments, or patients who are at the extreme
              of ages, like if you are a child less than one year old."</p>
              <p>Doctors
              say in many cases, patients do not necessarily have to be treated with
              Tamiflu, and symptomatic treatment, such as the prescription of
              antihistamines and cough syrup, works well.</p>
              <p>Dr Lim said: "H1N1
              flu so far has been mild. Complications have only been seen in patients
              with underlying medical conditions. If the patients are in the low—risk
              group, chances are they will recover after a period of rest, even if it
              is just with symptomatic treatment."</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry says doctors should prescribe Tamiflu judiciously, even though Singapore has no shortage of the drug.</p>
              <p>Doctors say like antibiotics, the course of Tamiflu should be completed for it to be effective.</p>
              <p>And
              from Friday, Singapore’s courtesy mascot, the Singa lion, will don a
              giant mask to spread the social responsibility message to fight the
              H1N1 flu.</p>
              <p>Twenty life—sized Singas, located at 17 strategic areas
              in town, will also have a sticker urging the public to wear a mask if
              coughing, and to see a doctor and rest at home if they have a cold.</p>

              <p>This because Monday is Youth Day, a scheduled school holiday.</p>
              <p>But with community spread of H1N1 on the rise in Singapore, MOE says
              schools will continue to be vigilant and keep up precautionary measures
              to slow the spread of the H1N1 virus in schools.</p>
              <p>Regular temperature taking and checks to identify those with flu-like illness will continue.</p>
              <p>Staff and students who are unwell will be asked to seek medical attention and to rest at home.</p>
              <p>Schools will also continue to remind its students about the importance of personal hygiene and social responsibility.</p>
              <p>MOE also says that feedback from schools shows that the
              precautionary measures for H1N1 that were implemented in the first week
              of Term 3 have been carried out smoothly.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed 91 new cases of H1N1 flu, bringing the total to 969 so far.
              <br> <br> The Health Ministry (MOH) says it plans to stop listing affected
              countries on its website soon, as more countries stop reporting their
              cases. <br> <br> It also says travel advisories are becoming less useful, as the risk of picking up the virus at home or overseas has evened.
              <br> <br> It adds that the virus strain remains mild, except for high-risk
              individuals with underlying medical conditions where complications and
              even deaths can occur.
              <br> <br> That is why MOH says its focus is on caring for those with more severe illness.
              <br> <br>But it also says that managing the virus should be largely based on
              personal hygiene and those unwell with flu-like symptoms should seek
              immediate medical attention.

              <p><strong>H1N1 cases up 56 to 1,111 in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed 56 new cases of H1N1 flu.
              <br> <br> The Ministry of Health says this brings the total tally to 1,111 confirmed cases. 
              <br> <br> Investigations are ongoing for 31 cases.
              <br> <br> Of the 77 cases investigated on Monday, there were 59 local cases and 18 imported ones.
              <br> <br> Of the total 1,080 cases investigated so far, 650 were local cases and 430 were imported ones. 
              <br> <br> Of the 56 new confirmed cases, almost all were mild, although there were two notable cases.
              <br> <br> A 63-year-old man sought emergency treatment at Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital's Emergency Department on Sunday, after three days of flu-like
              symptoms.
              <br> <br> He was immediately admitted and isolated for treatment of several complications, including pneumonia and heart disease.
              <br> <br> Laboratory diagnosis confirmed that he was also infected with H1N1 and he was started on Tamiflu that night.
              <br> <br>As he has multiple co-morbidities (coronary heart disease,
              hypertension, hyperlipideamia), he was transferred to ICU on Monday
              morning.
              <br> <br> He remains ill, and is being monitored closely.
              <br> <br>The other case involves a 40-year-old Indonesian man from the Asian
              Youth Games (AYG) Indonesian contingent, who developed flu-like
              symptoms on 2 July.
              <br> <br> He was treated symptomatically by the Indonesian team's doctor. 
              <br> <br>He sought medical attention again on 5 July at the AYG Medical
              Centre and laboratory diagnosis confirmed that he was infected with
              H1N1.
              <br> <br> The MOH said in a statement he is in a stable condition.
              <br> <br> Two close contacts of this case will be issued home quarantine orders, but are currently well.
              <br> <br>MOH says it conducts routine bio-surveillance on samples of
              patients presented with influenza-like illness in its clinics and
              hospitals.
              <br> <br> Latest data shows that 13 per cent of samples taken from patients with such illnesses are positive for H1N1.
              <br> <br> This means that 13 in 100 patients with influenza-like illness have H1N1.
              <br> <br> MOH says that this proportion will grow as the virus spreads further in the community, and displaces other influenza strains.
              <br> <br>The ministry also says that the current strain remains mild, except
              for high-risk individuals with underlying medical conditions where
              complications and even deaths may occur.
              <br> <br> At-risk individuals are advised to seek prompt medical attention if unwell.

              <p>Singapore has a total of 150,000 courses of influenza drug, Relenza,
              in its national stockpile and another 600,000 more courses of Relenza
              to be delivered.</p>
              <p>A Health Ministry spokesperson revealed this to 938LIVE today, when
              asked whether the ministry will consider stockpiling Relenza instead of
              Tamiflu, the main antiviral flu drug against H1N1 now.</p>
              <p>Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 cases have cropped up in places like Hong Kong, Denmark and Japan.</p>
              <p>But the MOH spokesperson said this doesn't indicate whether widespread resistance will develop in future.</p>
              <p>She added that currently, the World Health Organisation has not changed its recommendation with regards to the use of Tamiflu.</p>

              <p><strong>H1N1 patient with multiple underlying conditions sent to ICU</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>A 63-year-old H1N1 patient was transferred to
              the Intensive Care Unit at Tan Tock Seng Hospital this morning, where
              he remains ill.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry says the man has multiple underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease and hypertension.</p>
              <p>The patient sought treatment at Tan Tock Seng's Emergency Department yesterday, after three days of flu-like symptoms.</p>
              <p>He was immediately admitted and isolated for treatment of several complications, including pneumonia and heart disease.</p>
              <p>MOH says the man is being monitored closely.</p>
              <p>The man is among the 56 new confirmed cases of H1N1 today, bringing the total tally to 1111 confirmed cases.</p>
              <p>Investigations are on-going for 31 cases.</p>
              <p>Of the 1080 cases investigated so far, 650 were local cases and 430 were imported cases.</p>
              <p>Latest data also shows that 13 percent of samples taken from patients with influenza-like illness are H1N1-positive.</p>
              <p>The Scientific Committee on Influenza A H1N1 says Singapore will
              move into full mitigation mode once confirmed cases go beyond 15 per
              cent of all flu cases.</p>
