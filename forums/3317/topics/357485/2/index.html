              <h1><strong>Only 7 swine flu deaths, not 152, says WHO</strong></h1>
              <p class="details">April 29, 2009 - 4:34PM</p>
              <div id="adSpotIsland"></div>
              <p>A member of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has dismissed claims that more than 150 people have died from swine flu, saying it has officially recorded only seven deaths around the world.</p>
              <p>Mexico has lowered its confirmed death toll from swine flu from 20 to seven, Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told reporters. He also raised the toll of "probable'' deaths from the H1N1 virus from 152 to 159. A total of 1311 people remain in hospital after exhibiting symptoms of the flu, he said.</p>
              <p>Vivienne Allan, from WHO's patient safety program, said the body had confirmed that worldwide there had been just seven deaths - all in Mexico - and 79 confirmed cases of the disease.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately that [150-plus deaths] is incorrect information and it does happen, but that's not information that's come from the World Health Organisation," Ms Allan told ABC Radio today.</p>
              <p>"That figure is not a figure that's come from the World Health Organisation and, I repeat, the death toll is seven and they are all from Mexico."</p>
              <p>Ms Allan said WHO had confirmed 40 cases of swine flu in the Americas, 26 in Mexico, six in Canada, two in Spain, two in Britain and three in New Zealand.</p>
              <p>Ms Allan said it was difficult to measure how fast the virus was spreading.</p>
              <p>She said a real concern would be if the flu virus manifested in a country where a person had had no contact with Mexico, and authorities were watching all countries for signs of that.</p>
              <p>"There is no pattern that has emerged at this stage to be able to say that it is spreading in a particular way or it is spreading into a particular country ... the situation is continuing to evolve," she said.</p>
              <p>She said the WHO was not recommending against overseas travel, but urged those who felt sick to stay home and others to ensure they kept their hands clean.</p>
              <p>No decision had yet been made about vaccinations.</p>
              <p>"This virus is not airborne, it's caused by droplets ... so it's not a time for worry. It's a time to be prepared," Ms Allan said.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crude oil price drops</span></p>
              <p>Oil prices dipped in Asia today as concern that a swine flu outbreak could undermine crude demand overrode optimism about an eventual recovery from a global slump.</p>
              <p>Benchmark crude for June delivery was down 39 cents to $49.53 a barrel by midday in Singapore, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract Tuesday fell 22 cents to settle at $49.92.</p>

              <div class="top_headline"><strong> Swine flu could be man-made</strong></div>
              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="top_headline">JAKARTA - INDONESIAN Heath Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said on Tuesday
              the deadly swine flu virus could have been man-made, as she urged calm
              over its spread around the world.
              <p>The controversial minister did not elaborate but in the past she
              has said Western governments could be making and spreading viruses in
              the developing world to boost pharmaceutical companies' profits.</p>
              <p>'I'm not sure whether the virus was genetically engineered
              but it's a possibility,' she told reporters at a press conference
              called to reassure the public over the government's response to the
              swine flu threat.</p>
              <p>No cases of the disease have been reported in Indonesia, the
              country worst hit by the bird flu virus which has killed about 250
              people worldwide since 2003.</p>
              <p>Indonesian authorities have increased body temperature
              scanners at airports and banned imports of live pigs and pork products,
              amid World Health Organisation (WHO) warnings of a pandemic.</p>
              <p>Ms Supari, a cardiologist, also claimed that the H1N1 strain
              of swine flu, which is believed to have killed more than 150 people in
              Mexico, could not survive in tropical countries like Indonesia.</p>
              <p>'We have to be alert at all times although swine flu in
              Indonesia is not a cause for panic,' she said. 'H1N1 survives in
              countries with four seasons. The type A H1N1 virus hopefully won't be
              able to sustain itself once it enters the tropical climate of
              Indonesia.'</p>
              <p>The virus has been found in 11 countries including Mexico,
              the United States and Spain, while several other countries from
              Colombia to New Zealand are investigating suspected cases.</p>
              <p>Ms Supari said the health ministry had prepared 100 hospitals
              to handle swine flu cases should the disease enter Indonesia.</p>
              <p>The minister has refused since 2006 to share all but a
              handful of Indonesia's bird flu virus samples with WHO researchers,
              saying the system is being abused by rich countries to develop
              profitable vaccines which poor countries must buy.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore raises swine flu pandemic alert from yellow to orange</strong></p>
              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry (MOH) has sounded the orange alert
              for the Mexican swine flu pandemic, moving one notch up from yellow the
              previous day. So far, there are no confirmed cases here.
              <br> <br> Singapore is also imposing a home quarantine order on those who have recently travelled to Mexico.
              <br> <br> The move comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) raised its pandemic alert phase from level 4 to level 5 on Thursday.
              <br> <br>According to Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan, it is only a matter of
              time before the Mexican swine flu strikes Southeast Asia and its first
              case could well be in Singapore – one of the region's most globalised
              cities.
              <br> <br>When that happens, Singapore should not be "shocked into panic or
              inaction". He said the country must be prepared for a long fight, with
              a very different type of enemy.
              <br> <br>"We must not be trapped into a SARS battle mindset. As I said
              yesterday, we are fighting a new war. What worked during SARS may not
              be effective or even necessary this time round," he cautioned.
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw also advised hospitals and Singaporeans against going into
              "overdrive" in their precautionary measures, lest they "exhaust
              themselves" even before the first wave of swine flu strikes.
              <br> <br> MOH has said it would escalate the pandemic alert to red, should the global situation deteriorate.
              <br> <br>Under the orange alert, infection control measures will be stepped
              up further. Temperature screenings and checks for flu-like symptoms
              will be mandatory at hospitals, and patients will be allowed only one
              visitor each time.
              <br> <br> Hospital staff must also wear full protective gear in all areas with patient contact.
              <br> <br> "All of us are participants in this war. We are not just bystanders watching the developments," Mr Khaw said.
              <br> <br>MOH is imposing a seven-day home quarantine order on those who have
              travelled to Mexico in the past week. They will be monitored for
              symptoms of the H1N1 virus and should symptoms develop, they will be
              referred to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) for further
              assessment.
              <br> <br>The health minister said arrangements would be made for
              non-residents to put up in chalets or hotels and to undergo phone
              surveillance for symptoms of swine flu.
              <br> <br>If it is found that other countries, besides Mexico, are exporting
              cases, MOH may also impose similar conditions for travellers returning
              from those areas.
              <br> <br> While Mr Khaw cautioned against complacency, he said Singaporeans should not get unduly stressed over the situation.
              <br> <br>"For healthy Singaporeans or those who have not been overseas
              recently, get on with your life! Go out! Exercise! Bicycle! Brisk walk!
              Go dancing, whatever! We all know when you're active and have enough
              sleep, you're at your top form; you're less likely to get flu," he
              urged.
              <br> <br>Of the 22 cases referred for medical assessment, one is still
              pending lab investigations. The rest have been cleared of swine flu.
              <br> <br>MOH said 19 have been tested negative for Influenza A, while two
              are tested positive for the usual circulating strains of Influenza A.
              <br> <br> For more information on Mexican swine flu, members of the public can access MOH's website at </span><a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/"> www.moh.gov.sg </a><span> or call its hotline at 1800-333 9999.

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">WHO discussing name of swine flu</span></strong></p>
              <p>The World Health Organisation is re-examining the name of the swine flu virus</p>
              <p>This follows complaints that the virus is causing an unjustified clampdown on pork trade.</p>
              <p>Officials in the United States yesterday decided to call the H1N1 flu virus that emerged in Mexico "2009 H1N1 flu".<br> <br> Pig farmers in the United States, Canada and Mexico are reeling from
              bans on their exports of live swine and pork meat imposed by several
              nations including Russia and China.<br> <br> The WHO has stuck by swine flu so far, arguing that the virus -- whose
              exact origins are still unknown -- does have a substantial swine
              component.<br> <br> WHO Director General Margaret Chan said, while raising the
              international alert level yesterday, the WHO did not believe that
              people were getting infected by pigs in the current outbreak.<br> <br> At least 12 countries have reported cases of swine flu, with the Netherlands being the latest to join the list.</p>

              <p>"Keep good personal hygiene, wash your hands regularly, avoid
              crowded areas, if you're ill, stay at home. If you have to go out when

              in Hong Kong on Friday after a Mexican man who arrived via Shanghai
              tested positive, Chief Executive Donald Tsang announced.</div>
              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>Guests and staff at the hotel where the patient had briefly
              stayed were placed under quarantine for seven days as officials
              announced 'draconian' measures in a bid to contain the disease.</p>
              <p>'We have our first confirmed swine flu case in Hong Kong. He is Mexican,' Mr Tsang told reporters.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Mexican arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday from
              Mexico via Shanghai on China Eastern Airlines flight 505, Mr Tsang
              said.</p>
              <p>He was admitted to hospital on Thursday night suffering from
              a fever and tested positive on Friday for swine flu. He was in stable
              condition, Mr Tsang said.</p>
              <p>The Metropark Hotel in Wanchai district where he had been staying had been cordoned off, he said.</p>
              <p>'I will raise the alert level from serious to emergency,' the chief executive said.</p>
              <p>Despite putting Hong Kong on the highest level of alert, Mr
              Tsang said all social activities and exhibitions would go ahead as
              normal and schools would remain open in the city, which is still
              scarred by memories of the Sars epidemic in 2003.</p>
              <p>'I stress we don't need to panic,' he said.</p>

              <br> <br> They are among 350 people under quarantine at the Metropark Hotel where a sick Mexican tourist had stayed.
              <br> <br> Three of the Singaporeans are at the Metropark Hotel in Wanchai, and four are at the Lady MacLehose Holiday Village. 
              <br> <br> According to the Hong Kong SAR government, some Metropark Hotel guests
              who were not willing to stay in the hotel had moved to Lady MacLehose
              Holiday Village in Sai Kung.
              <br> <br>Staff and guests are required to stay either in the hotel or
              holiday villages which are used as isolation centres until the end of

              <p><strong>CDC working on research to combat Influenza A (H1N1)</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The first case of Influenza A H1N1 has surfaced in Asia. 
              <br> <br> Although Singapore does not have any such cases, health authorities
              here are working to collect data on how to combat this new flu strain.
              <br> <br> The H1N1 virus was discovered in the 1970s, but it's still unknown how the new virus is transmitted from human to human. 
              <br> <br>"If you look at the current virus, this virus, it is genetically
              different compared to the human one. All of us will be susceptible. You
              open the floodgate and you will have this wave," said Associate
              Professor Leo Yee Sin, clinical director, Communicable Disease Centre
              (CDC), Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). <br> <br> Research is currently underway. And fortunately, there is hope of treating Influenza A, the same way as the other types of flu. 
              <br> <br> "The current circulating seasonal human H1N1 has a very high resistance
              rate to Tamiflu. However for this current swine influenza, from the
              information given to us from the infected area, (shows) that resistance
              to Tamiflu is not something that they have detected yet. So it gives us
              the assurance that at least we have something we can use to treat and
              overcome this," said CDC's clinical director. <br> <br> Dr Leo said there were three recent pandemics - the Spanish flu from
              1918 to 1919, which is the H1N1 subtype; the H2N2 virus in the 1950s;
              and the H3N2 virus in 1968.
              <br> <br> There are currently no cases of Influenza A in Singapore. 
              <br> <br> Still, to detect the new virus, the CDC is gathering tissue samples of patients from family doctors, polyclinics and hospitals.
              <br> <br>The head of the CDC said washing hands frequently can help rid the
              virus, which can survive outside the human body for several hours in
              tropical Singapore. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Khaw says S'poreans should not be surprised by H1N1 cases in HK, SKorea</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore Minister for Health Khaw Boon Wan said
              Singaporeans should not be surprised by the cases H1N1 virus occurring
              in Hong Kong and South Korea.
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw said: "I have been warning that this thing will come to
              Asia, if not already here. And one day, it may appear in Singapore too.
              So our gearing up (over the) last few days were all in anticipation of
              this. <br> <br> "I think at this stage we are quite well on the alert and the
              measures... Take it in its stride; this thing may just blow over.
              Hopefully that's the case, in which we will treat this as a good
              exercise of our plan. <br> <br> "But if this thing were to become more serious, and we were to turn
              (pandemic alert) red or black, then at least we have the pieces in
              place to gear up speedily."
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a candlelight procession by the Buddhist Welfare services.
              <br> <br>He was asked if the ministry has plans to vaccinate those at the
              frontline, like immigration officers, against common flu to eliminate
              false alarms.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said while it would be useful move, it would not be critical to rush to do so now. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Two suspected H1N1 under investigations </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Ministry of Health says there are two additional flu cases for investigations today.</p>
              <p>Of the 27 cases investigated so far, 23 cases have tested negative for Influenza A.</p>
              <p>3 cases tested positive for the usual circulating seasonal strains of Influenza A, and one is pending laboratory investigations.</p>
              <p>So far, 3 Singaporeans and 2 foreigners who have been to Mexico in the last seven days were put on voluntary phone surveillance.</p>
              <p>Of these, one Singaporean has completed the seven-day phone surveillance and is well.</p>
              <p>One other Singaporean was reported to have flu-like symptoms and was admitted to CDC this morning.</p>
              <p>Laboratory investigations are however negative for influenza A.</p>
              <p>The others are doing well.</p>
              <p>This means there have been no human cases of H1N1 in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The pandemic alert level continues to be at orange.</p>
              <p>Providing an update, MOH adds that precautionary measures are in
              full swing to forestall the spread of the virus to Singapore for as
              long as possible.</p>
              <p>MOH also says that thermal scanning has been deployed at the land checkpoints.</p>
              <p>It says temperature checks at the checkpoints may not pick up all
              infected cases as travelers may be asymptomatic in the early stages of
              the infection.</p>
              <p>However, it enables us to take precautionary measures and reduce the risk to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Travellers entering Singapore with a travel history to Mexico over
              the past seven days will be issued with a home quarantine order.</p>
              <p>This will require them to be quarantined for seven days when they enter Singapore.</p>
              <p>Those who can't be quarantined at their own residential homes will
              be quarantined at government chalets, such as Aloha Chalets at Loyang.</p>
              <p>The home quarantine order takes effect tomorrow.</p>
              <p>For travellers who are returning from other areas with evidence of
              community transmission of Influenza A, MOH advises them to stay at home
              for seven days and check themselves for symptoms of flu-like illness.</p>
              <p>In view of the confirmed H1N1 in Hong Kong, MOH is requesting those
              who stayed at Metropark Hotel in the territory and who have since
              returned to Singapore to call its hotline at 1800-3339999.</p>
              <p>This will enable the ministry to advise them on monitoring their own health in light of the confirmed case in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>MOH advises members of the public to postpone or avoid non-essential travel to Mexico and affected areas.</p>
              <p>In the event that travel is unavoidable, they should take
              precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded areas and maintaining
              high standards of personal hygiene at all times.</p>
              <p>MOH also advises the public to maintain high standards of personal hygiene.<br> Those who are unwell with respiratory illness should stay at home and wear a surgical mask if possible.</p>

              pre-test jitters may not be the only thing making them anxious.</p>
              <p>Students were told last week via email and SMS to turn up for their exams an hour earlier to have their temperatures taken.</p>
              <p>The school's provost, Tan Eng Chye, said that students running a

              them to continue with their exams, but they would have to be properly
              masked, and also later on they would be referred to the university
              health centre for treatment."</p>
              <p>Daily temperature taking has also been made mandatory for students staying on campus and all NUS staff.</p>
              <p>In an email circular, student residents and staff were told to record their temperature reading online every day by 10 AM.</p>
              <p>As the school will continue to buzz with activity until the school's
              vacation break next week, temperature screening stations have been set
              up at certain buildings that see high volumes of visitors.</p>
              <p>These include the libraries, the University Cultural Centre and the Computer Centre.</p>
              <p>Further measures taken by NUS include the suspension of all official
              travels until the 15th of May, and the school is keeping close tabs on
              those who have travelled to Mexico and other affected countries.</p>
              <p>To date, the school is aware of 1 staff member and 1 student with a travel history to Mexico.</p>
              <p>Both have been advised to be quarantined at home, and NUS will continue to follow their progress via phone surveillance.</p>
              <p>The school adds that both staff and student are doing well and have not displayed any symptoms of influenza A.</p>
              <p>A group of students who were on exchange programmes to the United
              States and Canada are expected to return to Singapore by the end of
              this month.</p>
              <p>Professor Tan says these students will also be put under home quarantine.</p>
              <p>And while the school can't prevent anyone from travelling for
              personal reasons, the school has appealed for staff and students to
              stay within contact, says Professor Tan.</p>
              <p>"We have strongly advised them to give us their travel schedule so that they remain contactable."</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">HSA advises consumers to be wary of products claiming to treat Influenza A</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Health Sciences Authority, HSA, has issued an advisory for
              consumers to exercise caution when purchasing health products claiming
              to prevent or treat Influenza A, H1N1.</p>
              <p>Such products may be marketed as health supplements, medicinal products, medical devices or vaccines.</p>
              <p>It said these products could be offered at retail outlets, via unsolicited spam emails or from the Internet.</p>
              <p>HSA said currently only two antiviral drugs - Tamiflu and Relenza - are used for the treatment of Influenza A.</p>
              <p>These drugs should only be used when prescribed by a doctor and taken under medical supervision.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that taking these antiviral drugs
              indiscriminately without medical supervision will raise the risk of
              viruses developing resistance and reducing the effectiveness of the
              drugs.</p>
              <p>HSA said there are no "generic" versions of Tamiflu and Relenza.</p>
              <p>There are also no test kits available over-the-counter for individuals to conduct self-diagnosis at home for Influenza A.</p>
              <p>Test kits, which are promoted via websites or emails, are unlikely to provide results that are reliable and accurate, HSA said .<br> <br> It encourages the public to report any suspicious sale of illegal,
              counterfeit and substandard health products related to Influenza A by
              calling them at 6866 3485.</p>
