              <p><strong>53% of flu cases in Singapore are H1N1 positive</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: More than half of flu cases here (53%) are H1N1
              positive. The number jumped from just 13 per cent in a span of only
              four weeks.
              <br> <br>The latest data by Singapore's Health Ministry shows that the
              country is well past the mitigation stage for the management of H1N1
              flu cases.
              <br> <br>Giving an update in Parliament on Monday, Health Minister Khaw Boon
              Wan said the virus circulating in Singapore currently is largely
              benign, with almost all patients recovering fully.
              <br> <br>He added Singapore remains in Yellow alert because unlike seasonal
              flu, the at-risk groups involve younger adults with underlying medical
              problems. <br> <br> Moving forward, Mr Khaw said H1N1 prevalence in the country should peak within a week or two.
              <br> <br> He said more Singaporeans will get infected, reaching a peak before the
              numbers start to decline as in New York where the wave peaked in May
              and June. <br> <br> Experts refer to this phenomenon as the community acquiring "herd immunity".
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said temperature taking in schools should step down from next month.
              <br> <br> Army camps will also step down their H1N1 control measures according to their specific operational needs. 
              <br> <br> Hospitals, though, will remain on high vigilance. Visitation will
              continue to be discouraged and infection control measures will remain.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw also outlined three key priorities.
              <br> <br>MOH will focus on high-risk patients and encouraging them to come
              forward promptly and not wait until their symptoms become too severe.
              <br> <br>The ministry will also review its control measures and prepare
              Singapore for the next wave of H1N1 which may come when winter returns
              to the Northern hemisphere.
              <br> <br>As for the managing of patients, Mr Khaw said doctors will treat
              them clinically rather than send every suspected H1N1 case for lab
              tests.
              <br> <br> Most patients are being treated by GPs as outpatients and hospitalisation is the exception, only for high-risk cases.
              <br> <br>Likewise, travel advisory, temperature screening at airports,
              contact tracing and home quarantine measures have been largely stepped
              down.
              <br> <br>The 993 ambulance service for H1N1 suspected cases will also be
              wound up from Tuesday. Callers will hear an automated message telling
              them to visit their nearest GP or Pandemic Preparedness Clinic if the
              symptoms are mild or to call 995 if they have severe symptoms.
              <br> <br>While the government has put in place orders for a H1N1 vaccine
              once it is available, Mr Khaw pointed out that the most basic strategy
              is maintaining a high standard of personal hygiene. <br> <br> - CNA/ir</span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Three more patients have been admitted to the
              Intensive Care Units after coming down with H1N1 infections. Two are in
              critical condition.
              <br> <br>One is a 51-year-old woman who has asthma. The Ministry of Health
              (MOH) said she sought treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Monday
              after two days of fever and breathlessness. She was admitted to the ICU
              on the same day as her condition worsened.
              <br> <br>The other is a 13-year-old boy with epilepsy. He went to National
              University Hospital's (NUH's) emergency department on Sunday after a
              day of cough and fever.
              <br> <br> He suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest while at the emergency department and was admitted to NUH's Paediatric ICU.
              <br> <br>Another patient admitted to ICU is a 46-year-old foreigner with
              hypertension, and is on dialysis. She went to Mount Elizabeth Hospital
              on Sunday after a week of fever and sore throat.
              <br> <br>She was admitted and transferred to the hospital's ICU on Monday
              when she became breathless. She is currently in stable condition.
              <br> <br>Two patients - a 55-year-old man suffering from motor neuron
              disease and a 42-year-old woman with multiple health problems - who
              were admitted to Changi General Hospital's ICU on July 18 remain in
              critical condition.

              <p><strong>2 more deaths bring H1N1-related fatalities in S'pore to 3</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Two patients died on Wednesday, bringing the total number of H1N1-related deaths in Singapore to three. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Ministry of Health (MOH) said a 13-year-old boy, who was admitted
              to National University Hospital's Paediatric ICU on Sunday, died on
              Wednesday morning. He had epilepsy and the cause of death was due to
              prolonged seizures, with H1N1 as a contributing factor. </span></p>
              <p><span> The second H1N1-related death on Wednesday was a 55-year-old man. He
              was admitted to Changi General Hospital's ICU last Saturday. The MOH
              said the cause of his death was severe pneumonia with advanced motor
              neuron disease and underlying H1N1. </span></p>
              <p><span> Singapore's first H1N1-related death was a 49-year-old man with severe
              heart disease and multiple health problems. He died from a heart attack
              with H1N1 infection on July 18. </span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, one more H1N1 patient was admitted into ICU on
              Wednesday. She is a 42-year-old foreigner with a history of
              hypertension and who is overweight. <br> <br> She sought treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department,
              after suffering three days of shortness of breath. She was found to
              have low oxygen saturation and low blood pressure.
              <br> <br> The MOH has been reminding people in the high-risk groups who develop flu-like symptoms to seek medical treatment early. 
              <br> <br>Elsewhere, a 42-year-old woman with hypertension and thyroid
              disease - who was admitted to Changi General Hospital's ICU on July 18
              - remains in critical condition. <br> <br> A 46-year-old foreigner with hypertension and kidney disease on
              dialysis, who was admitted to Mount Elizabeth's ICU on July 20, is in
              stable condition.
              <br> <br> Also in stable condition is a 51-year-old woman with asthma. She was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital's ICU on July 20.
              <br> <br>Of the three patients in Singapore General Hospital's ICU, one has
              been transferred to the general ward. The other two who are still in
              the ICU are in stable condition.
              <br> <br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had said more people in Singapore
              were expected to be infected with H1N1 as the transmission peaks within
              the next one to two weeks. <br> <br> Recent data showed that more than half of all flu cases in Singapore were H1N1 positive.

              <div>
              <p>The Health Ministry says it will set aside 10 million dollars to tackle the H-1-N-1 virus.</p>
              <p>This is a grant given out by the Ministry to fund H-1-N-1 research and related operational issues.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the National Medical Excellence Awards ceremony, Health
              Minister Khaw Boon Wan said further research and clinical trials will
              help experts better understand the diseases.<br> <br> "We hope emerging research in epidemiological studies, clinical trials
              and diagnostics can help us better understand the disease and prepare
              us for a second wave."</p>
              <p>So far, the Ministry has received about 45 proposals from grant applicants.</p>
              <p>Open to local hospitals and research institutes, the various projects will receive funding for about one to three years.</p>
              <p>The Ministry said while it hasn't decided how many projects it will
              fund, the proposals should addresss a range of H1N1 related issues.</p>
              <p>This include pattern and spread of the infection, disease progression, as well as complication rate in the population.</p>
              <p>MOH said the grants are to be awarded latest by September.</p>
              <p>Earlier, Mr Khaw also pointed out that the number of deaths resulting from H1N1 infections has gone up to three.</p>
              <p>He noted that all three had underlying serious medical illnesses which he said, were probably the primary causes of their death.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw stressed that high-risk patients have to take extra precaution.<br> <br> "I think just be extra careful during this period; avoid crowded places
              and if you have to leave home, just put on a surgical mask, it may just
              save your life."</p>

              <p>My unit has just had one confirmed case of h1n1 and my superior
                                      has told me not to report to camp tomorrow and go polyclinic for
                                      h1n1 test.. May I know how fast will the results be out, including
                                      saturdays and sundays too? Will I be issued home quarantine before
                                      the result is out? And how efficient is polyclinic in dealing with
                                      h1n1? Because I've heard polyclinic doctors telling patients they
                                      are free from the virus and need not go for any test until they
                                      found out they are actually affected after results from private
                                      clinics.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: More than half of flu cases here (53%) are H1N1 positive. The number jumped from just 13 per cent in a span of only four weeks.<br><br>The latest data by Singapore's Health Ministry shows that the country is well past the mitigation stage for the management of H1N1 flu cases.<br><br>Giving an update in Parliament on Monday, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the virus circulating in Singapore currently is largely benign, with almost all patients recovering fully.<br><br>He added Singapore remains in Yellow alert because unlike seasonal flu, the at-risk groups involve younger adults with underlying medical problems.<br><br>Moving forward, Mr Khaw said H1N1 prevalence in the country should peak within a week or two.<br><br>He said more Singaporeans will get infected, reaching a peak before the numbers start to decline as in New York where the wave peaked in May and June.<br><br>Experts refer to this phenomenon as the community acquiring "herd immunity".<br><br>Mr Khaw said temperature taking in schools should step down from next month.<br><br>Army camps will also step down their H1N1 control measures according to their specific operational needs.<br><br>Hospitals, though, will remain on high vigilance. Visitation will continue to be discouraged and infection control measures will remain.<br><br>Mr Khaw also outlined three key priorities.<br><br>MOH will focus on high-risk patients and encouraging them to come forward promptly and not wait until their symptoms become too severe.<br><br>The ministry will also review its control measures and prepare Singapore for the next wave of H1N1 which may come when winter returns to the Northern hemisphere.<br><br>As for the managing of patients, Mr Khaw said doctors will treat them clinically rather than send every suspected H1N1 case for lab tests.<br><br>Most patients are being treated by GPs as outpatients and hospitalisation is the exception, only for high-risk cases.<br><br>Likewise, travel advisory, temperature screening at airports, contact tracing and home quarantine measures have been largely stepped down.<br><br>The 993 ambulance service for H1N1 suspected cases will also be wound up from Tuesday. Callers will hear an automated message telling them to visit their nearest GP or Pandemic Preparedness Clinic if the symptoms are mild or to call 995 if they have severe symptoms.<br><br>While the government has put in place orders for a H1N1 vaccine once it is available, Mr Khaw pointed out that the most basic strategy is maintaining a high standard of personal hygiene.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></p>
