              <p><strong>Singapore confirms ninth H1N1 case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed its ninth Influenza A(H1N1) case. 
              <br> <br> The patient is a 19-year-old Singaporean studying in the United States, who returned for the summer holidays. 
              <br> <br> She arrived in Singapore from New York via Tokyo on All Nippon Airways NH901 at 11:40pm local time on May 28.
              <br> <br> She developed symptoms on Monday morning (June 1), and a 993 ambulance
              was called to send her to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) at Tan
              Tock Seng Hospital. <br> <br> She was admitted to the CDC on the afternoon of the same day. 
              <br> <br> Laboratory results confirmed her infection at 9pm on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Health Ministry (MOH) has assessed that no flight
              passengers needed to be quarantined as the case only developed onset of
              symptoms more than 24 hours after disembarkation, hence she was
              assessed to be non-infectious during the flight. <br> <br> MOH added on Wednesday that tracing for the local contacts has been initiated. 
              <br> <br> So far, two close contacts involving the case's family members have been identified. 
              <br> <br> They are currently well and home quarantine orders will be served to them. 
              <br> <br> Tracing for other local contacts is on-going.
              <br> <br> The Ministry said that so far, all the nine cases are imported and have a travel history. 
              <br> <br> There is currently no evidence of community spread. 
              <br> <br> MOH said it is monitoring the situation closely and will update the public on any new developments. 
              <br> <br> For more information on Influenza A(H1N1), please access MOH's website
              at www.moh.gov.sg, call the hotline at 1800-333 9999, or visit

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">WHO official says world edging towards pandemic</span></strong></p>
              <p>The World Health Organisation said that the spread of H1N1 flu in
              Australia, Britain, Chile, Japan and Spain has nudged the world closer
              to a pandemic.</p>
              <p>For now, the WHO's pandemic scale remains at the second-highest level but the threshold may soon be crossed.</p>
              <p>The Health body noted that patterns of infection in some countries
              are moving from travel-related cases to more sustained patterns of
              transmission within the local community.</p>
              <p>Acting assistant director-general Keiji Fukuda said that the new
              strain had caused more infections than seasonal influenza at the start
              of Chile's flu season.</p>
              <p>He added that the future impact of this infection has yet to unfold.</p>
              <p>Experts say it is nearly impossible to gauge how widespread the H1N1 flu has become.</p>
              <p>That's because many patients suffer only mild symptoms and are not formally diagnosed, treated and documented.</p>
              <p>And this has raised concerns about how it would spread in the southern hemisphere.</p>
              <p>The WHO consulted more than 30 public health experts from 23
              countries on Monday about how to revamp its pandemic alert scale to
              reflect both the severity of the flu and its geographic spread.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed another three
              Influenza A (H1N1) cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of
              people infected in Singapore to 11.
              <br> <br>The 9th patient is a 19-year-old Singaporean student returning from
              the US for the summer holidays. She arrived on 28 May from New York via
              Tokyo on All Nippon Airways NH901 at 2340 hours on 28 May.
              <br> <br>The MOH says no one else needed to be quarantined as the case
              developed more than 24 hours after disembarkation, hence she was
              assessed to be non-infectious during the flight. <br> <br> The 10th and 11th patients were on the same flight as the 7th confirmed
              case, a 30-year-old Australian male tourist who was seated at row 54 on
              Singapore Airlines SQ25 which arrived in Singapore from New York via
              Frankfurt at 0618 hours on 1 June.
              <br> <br>The 10th patient is a 33-year-old Singaporean woman who took a taxi
              to Tan Tock Seng Hospital after developing symptoms. She was in New
              York from 23-30 May and was seated at row 19 on SQ25. She was admitted
              to Communicable Disease Centre 2 (CDC2) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital
              (TTSH) before midnight on 2 June.
              <br> <br>The 11th patient is an 18-year-old American woman. She was seated
              at row 57 on SQ25. She developed symptoms in the afternoon of 2 June,
              took a taxi with her relative to seek medical attention at Raffles
              Hospital's Emergency Department in the evening and was sent to CDC,
              TTSH via a 993 ambulance. She was admitted to CDC2 in the early hours
              of 3 June.
              <br> <br> Contact tracing has been initiated for the 10th and 11th confirmed cases.
              <br> <br>Passengers seated within rows 17 to 21 and 57 to 59 on SQ25 on 1
              June who have not been contacted by MOH yet should call the MOH hotline
              at 1800-333 9999.
              <br> <br>The MOH is expanding the list of "affected areas" to include
              Melbourne and the State of Victoria in Australia, Kobe and Osaka in
              Japan, and Chile, besides USA, Canada and Mexico.
              <br> <br>Affected areas are those with clear evidence of widespread
              community transmission. The number of cases in the State of Victoria,
              particularly in its capital, Melbourne, has been rising rapidly, with
              the number of cases doubling to reach almost 400 over the last two
              days.
              <br> <br> For Japan, more than 90 per cent of its cases are found in the two cities of Kobe and Osaka.  
              <br> <br>For Chile, the government has announced that H1N1 is entrenched in
              the community and mitigation measures have replaced containment
              efforts.
              <br> <br>Indications are that there is widespread infection throughout the
              Chile, although a large majority of cases are found in the capital
              city, Santiago.
              <br> <br> MOH advises the public to avoid non-essential travel to these affected areas.
              <br> <br> So far, all the 11 cases in Singapore are imported and have a travel history.
              <br> <br> There is currently no evidence of community spread.

              <p>In an update on the 10th case, a 33 year old Singaporean female who

              <p>As the case developed onset of symptoms more than 24hrs after

              <p><strong>Singapore confirms 12th case of H1N1</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed its 12th case of Influenza A (H1N1). The patient is an 18-year-old Singaporean.
              <br> <br> He went to Melbourne on 16 May and returned on 1 June on Emirates EK405 at 11.50pm. He was seated at row 18.
              <br> <br> The Health Ministry says he was sent to hospital at about 12 noon on Thursday by ambulance via 993.
              <br> <br> Laboratory results confirmed his infection at 7.25pm on the same day and he was admitted to the Communicable Disease Centre.
              <br> <br> Contact tracing has begun.
              <br> <br> And as for the 10th and 11th cases, the ministry says all contacts have been accounted for.
              <br> <br> For the 10th case, two close contacts on the same flight and another
              two close household contacts have been identified and served Home
              Quarantine Orders. <br> <br> The patient, a 33-year-old Singaporean female, had travelled to the US from 23-30 May.
              <br> <br> The ministry says contact tracing for the 11th patient is also completed, with four household contacts placed under HQOs.
              <br> <br> The ministry says that since the 19-year-old American student, here to
              visit a relative, only developed symptoms more than 24 hours after
              getting off the plane, no contact tracing of flight passengers was
              needed.
              <br> <br> This is on the basis that she was unlikely to be infectious when on board the plane.
