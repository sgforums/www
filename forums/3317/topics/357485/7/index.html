              <p><strong>2 new H1N1 flu cases confirmed on Friday, bringing total to 14</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health has confirmed another two H1N1
              flu cases, bringing to 14 the total number of cases so far. Both
              patients have relatively mild symptoms and are in stable condition.
              <br> <br>The 13th case is a 23-year-old Singaporean man who went to
              Melbourne on May 27 and developed symptoms in the early hours of June 3
              while he was still there. He returned on Singapore Airlines SQ 238 (Row
              40) on June 4.
              <br> <br>His fever was detected by the thermal scanner at Changi Airport and
              he was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). He was subsequently
              admitted to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) for further
              assessment on the same night. <br> <br> Laboratory results confirmed his infection on June 5. Contact tracing has begun for passengers within rows 38 to 42.
              <br> <br> The 14th patient is a 22-year-old Singaporean woman who is a cabin crew
              with Singapore Airlines. She was on the same SQ 25 flight from New York
              to Frankfurt as three earlier confirmed cases.
              <br> <br>The seventh confirmed case involved a 30-year-old Australian male
              tourist who was seated at row 54. The tenth confirmed case was a
              33-year-old Singapore female who was seated at row 19 and the 11th
              confirmed case involved an 18-year-old American female visitor who was
              seated at row 57. <br> <br> While these three earlier confirmed cases arrived in Singapore on June
              1, she had stopped over at Frankfurt and returned to Singapore one day
              later on June 2 at 06:30 hours.
              <br> <br>Upon arrival, she went home by taxi from the airport. She developed
              symptoms in the afternoon of June 3. The next day, she consulted a GP
              in the evening.
              <br> <br>She was referred to TTSH via a 993 ambulance and admitted to the
              CDC for further assessment that night. Laboratory results confirmed her
              infection at 15:30 hours on June 5.
              <br> <br>Malaysia's Health Ministry has also informed Singapore of two
              confirmed cases arising from SQ 25. The two were foreign passengers who
              arrived in Singapore on June 1 and left for Kuala Lumpur on June 3. <br> <br> Passengers on board that flight are advised to monitor their health
              closely. If they are unwell, they should go to the CDC immediately,
              using the 993 ambulance.
              <br> <br>Separately, 40 people who were in contact with the 12th case
              involving an 18-year-old Singaporean man have been accounted for. Three
              others remain uncontactable and the Immigrations and Checkpoints
              Authority have been provided with their details. </span></p>

              <h1 class="clr">Melbourne world's swine flu capital: report</h1>
              <p><cite class="auth">AFP - <span>Saturday, June  6</span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">MELBOURNE
              (AFP) - - Australia's second city of Melbourne has become the "swine
              flu capital of the world", according to a report, as the country's
              confirmed tally of the disease soared to 1,009.</p>
              <p>Some 874 of the infections have been detected in the southern state
              of Victoria, with most of those cases concentrated in the north and
              west of the state capital Melbourne, the health department said
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>The disease has spread more than 1,000-fold in the past
              three weeks, hitting schools in the Melbourne area hard and making
              Victoria the worst affected area on earth per head of population, The
              Australian newspaper said.</p>
              <p>"Melbourne is now the swine-flu
              capital of the world, with the H1N1 virus twice as prevalent in the
              Victorian population as it is in Mexico, where the pandemic began," the
              respected daily reported.</p>
              <p>"With the state's comparatively small
              population, swine flu occurs in about one in 9,139 Victorians -- more
              than double the one in 21,860 Mexicans with the virus and triple the
              one in 27,295 people with swine flu in the US," it added.</p>
              <p>Australian
              swine flu cases now represent about 4.5 percent of the 21,940 confirmed
              cases in 69 countries reported to the World Health Organisation.</p>
              <p>Health Minister Nicola Roxon said late Friday that swine flu would remain on the rise here for some time.</p>
              <p>"I
              would have thought we are not at the halfway point, given that we still
              don't have an extensive spread in Australia," she told reporters.</p>
              <p>She said a vaccine was not yet available and all efforts were being directed at containing the disease.</p>
              <p>"The
              reason it is a marathon is we will potentially have this disease with
              us not just through this flu season but a risk of it again in the
              following year," she said.</p>
              <p>The UN health agency said Friday it
              was maintaining the pandemic alert level at five out of six, signalling
              that a pandemic is "imminent".</p>
              <p>Several Australian states and
              territories this week implemented voluntary quarantine measures for
              children returning from Victoria or the greater Melbourne area to
              prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

              <p><strong>Aunt of H1N1 patient becomes 15th case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH )has confirmed another
              H1N1 case bringing the total to 15 cases so far. The latest case is a
              39-year-old Indonesian woman who is the aunt of an earlier case.
              <br> <br> She went to Changi Airport to fetch her niece who returned from New York via Frankfurt on Monday.
              <br> <br> When the niece developed symptoms on Tuesday, the aunt brought her to Raffles Hospital by taxi.
              <br> <br>The aunt had been on home quarantine and was given medication but
              laboratory results confirmed on Saturday that she's been infected with
              the H1N1 virus. </span></p>
              <p><span> Three of her family members have already been placed on Home Quarantine Order (HQO). </span></p>
              <p><span> She has mild symptoms and is in stable condition. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Health Ministry said although the 15th case was started on
              chemoprophylaxis when she was served the home quarantine order, it
              should be noted that she could already have been infected through close
              contact with her niece prior to taking the medicine. </span></p>
              <p><span> While chemoprophylaxis can significantly reduce the risk of infection, it does not completely eliminate it. </span></p>
              <p><span> As such, MOH reiterates its advice to avoid non-essential travel
              affected areas such as Melbourne and the State of Victoria in
              Australia, Kobe and Osaka in Japan and Chile, USA, Canada and Mexico. </span></p>
              <p><span> For those returning from the affected areas, they should seek medical
              attention promptly and call 993 for an ambulance if they become unwell
              within seven days of their return. </span></p>
              <p><span>They should avoid taking public transport or taxi to minimise exposure.
              <br> <br> MOH said to date, six patients have been discharged and nine are still in hospital.
              <br> <br> The 12th patient involved an 18-year-old Singaporean man who took the MRT in the morning of June 3 to see his GP. </span></p>
              <p><span>MOH said its risk assessment showed that there is limited
              exposure to the public as it was only a two-minute train ride from
              Serangoon to Kovan. <br> <br> The Health Ministry said Singaporeans need not be unduly alarmed as the
              virus remains mild and all patients are stable. However, the ministry
              added that this is an example that should not be followed by others. </span></p>
              <p><span> MOH said that contact tracing for the 13th and 14th cases have been completed. </span></p>
              <p><span>The 13th case involved a 23-year-old Singaporean man who
              travelled to Melbourne from May 27 to June 3. MOH has identified 44
              close contacts on the flight. <br> <br> It managed to contact 18 out of the 19 passengers with entry records into Singapore. 
              <br> <br> They comprise 11 Singaporeans and seven foreigners and they have been placed under HQOs. 
              <br> <br> Their period of quarantine ends on June 11. One foreigner is uncontactable. 
              <br> <br> MOH has alerted the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to inform the
              ministry if he should turn up at Singapore's checkpoints. <br> <br> MOH has also informed WHO and its IHR counterparts of the 25 passengers who are out of Singapore.
              <br> <br> For the 14th case that involved a 22-year-old Singapore Airlines
              air-stewardess, MOH said it did not conduct contact tracing of flight
              passengers on SQ25 flight travelling from New York to Frankfurt on the
              basis that the confirmed case is unlikely to have been infectious while
              onboard the plane. <br> <br> She had developed symptoms more than 24 hours after disembarkation. 
              <br> <br> MOH has identified four close local contacts and they have been placed
              under HQOs. Her quarantine period is from June 5 to June 11. </span></p>

              <p><strong>No community spread of H1N1 so far is an achievement for S'pore: Mr Khaw</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It's been six weeks since the World Health
              Organization (WHO) sounded the alert on the Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak
              and there's been no evidence of communal spread of the virus in
              Singapore yet. Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said this is an
              achievement.
              <br> <br>As the number of infected individuals remain small, he said the
              Health Ministry will go all out to track every person who has been in
              contact with the patients.
              <br> <br>Speaking at the 60th anniversary celebration of medical social work
              service held at Changi General Hospital on Saturday, he urged
              Singaporeans to remain vigilant and practise good hygiene to keep the
              virus at bay.
              <br> <br>He said a good team of doctors from the public sector and
              scientists have been assembled under the charge of Director of Medical
              Services, Professor K Satku, to analyse the H1N1 influenza samples from
              the 14 H1N1 patients in Singapore. <br> <br> Their results will help determine if the virus in Singapore is behaving
              like the H1N1 bug that has been spreading elsewhere in the world.
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw said: "Every week that we earn without a community spread,
              it is useful because vaccines will eventually be produced. You shorten
              the time waiting for a vaccine, but let's be mentally prepared that
              sooner or later, there will be a community spread - not only in
              Singapore but all other places." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Poll shows some Singaporeans avoid those quarantined for H1N1</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A recent poll has shown that 25 per cent of
              Singaporeans will avoid those who have been quarantined for the H1N1
              flu, even after they have been given the all-clear. <br> <br> During the height of the H1N1 global outbreak, Darren – not his real
              name – was quarantined after coming into contact with someone with a
              recent travel history to Mexico. <br> <br> Recalling his experience, he said: "My aunt's sister, who stays next to
              us, told me not to share the plates and cups, and asked me not to share
              the same table... I felt annoyed, helpless and rejected." <br> <br> Although Darren's quarantine ended on May 7, he remains uneasy about
              his quarantine history and prefers not to disclose it to others.
              <br> <br>"You can see from their expression that they are a bit sceptical, a
              bit worried... From that reaction, it proved my view that people are
              still worried about this flu," he said.
              <br> <br>Like Darren, many of those who were on self or home quarantine have
              refused to be interviewed by Channel NewsAsia, citing privacy issues.
              <br> <br>According to sociologists, due to the fact that not much is known
              about the H1N1 strain, many of them are afraid of being stigmatised by
              others. <br> <br> In a recent MSN poll of some 4,700 Singaporeans, a quarter said they
              would avoid those who were previously quarantined, while 15 per cent of
              the respondents were unsure if they should stay away because they did
              not know enough about the H1N1 flu.
              <br> <br>Associate Professor Paulin Straughan, deputy head, Department of
              Sociology, National University of Singapore, said: "A lot has to do
              with how well they would recover. If they recover without incident, I
              don't think there would be that much public reaction to it." <br> <br> Since May 11, Singapore has lowered its pandemic alert level to yellow.
              Home quarantine orders are now issued to those who have had close
              contact with confirmed cases of Influenza A.
              <br> <br> Mandatory quarantine order for travellers to Singapore with a recent travel history to Mexico was lifted last month.

              <p>The two patients have relatively mild symptoms and are in stable condition.</p>
              <p>MOH said the 16th case is a 40-year-old male foreigner from India who works in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He went to Melbourne in late May on a business trip and returned to
              Singapore on Singapore Airlines SQ238 at around 4pm on the 6th of June.</p>
              <p>He was seated at row 45.</p>
              <p>The man developed symptoms the next day and was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital the following day.</p>
              <p>The 17th case is a 25-year-old Malaysian female who went on holiday
              in Melbourne on 21st May and developed symptoms on the 5th of June
              while she was there.</p>
              <p>She returned to Singapore on Emirates EK 405 close to midnight on the 7th of June.</p>
              <p>She was seated at row 32.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry says contact tracing has been initiated.</p>
              <p>Passengers within rows 43 to 47 on SQ238 on 6 June and rows 30 to 34
              on EK 405 on 7 June who have not been contacted by MOH yet should call
              the MOH hotline at 1800-333 9999.</p>
              <p>MOH advises the public to avoid non-essential travel to affected
              areas like Melbourne, Kobe and Osaka in Japan and the United States of

              <p><strong>Over 18,000 calls made to H1N1 hotline since it was activated</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Over 18,000 calls - or an average of 450 calls a day
              - have been made to the H1N1 hotline since it was activated in late
              April.
              <br> <br> About half are prank calls, or people who dialled the number by mistake. But what happens when there is a genuine case?
              <br> <br> It starts with a phone call to the 993 hotline, regarding a suspected case of the H1N1 flu.
              <br> <br>Callers are asked if they show symptoms of the flu, and if they
              have recently been to one of the affected areas, or have been in close
              contact with someone who has. If so, an ambulance will be despatched.
              <br> <br> The case is routed to the designated ambulance service, and moments later, the crew spring into action.
              <br> <br>Civic Ambulance has a fleet of 30 vehicles, of which five can be
              deployed to pick up cases at any time. Another seven can be activated
              at short notice, and should the need ever arise, two other ambulance
              services will be roped in as well, adding a further 10 vehicles to the
              pool.
              <br> <br>The number of despatches has more than doubled since the first case
              of H1N1 was reported on May 27 - from 10 to 25 a day on average.
              <br> <br>On Monday alone, Civic Ambulance picked up over 60 cases, the
              highest so far. Civic Ambulance said numbers tend to spike each time a
              case is reported.
              <br> <br> Civic Ambulance said about 70 per cent of requests come from clinics; it also ferries patients from airports.
              <br> <br>Pritpal Singh, operations director, Civic Ambulance, said: "We had
              a case where this guy was complaining that, why should he go to CDC and
              get tested when he knows there is nothing wrong with him.
              <br> <br>"And last night, we had this very funny case where this guy
              actually called in, insisted to go to hospital simply because he feels
              he has got too many American friends."
              <br> <br>Each ambulance is stocked with the standard supply of stretchers
              and oxygen tanks, as well as personal protection equipment such as
              gowns, masks and gloves. The medics are also trained in infectious
              control measures. <br> <br> When the ambulance reaches a housing estate, for example, the lights
              and siren are switched off. The driver and medic suit up in protective
              gear, and patients are asked to meet them at the void deck. The point
              is to be as discreet as they can.
              <br> <br>Mr Singh said: "When people get frightened, they all start to call
              in thinking they are sick. We had a very similar instance like this
              during SARS when people started to panic. And people called 993 and
              everybody wanted to go to hospital."
              <br> <br>On the way to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC), windows are
              kept open to minimise the spread of viruses. At the CDC, the patient
              will undergo tests which will take several hours. </span></p>

              <p>Children under the age of 16 years and pregnant women beyond 24
              weeks gestation will be referred directly to the Children's Emergency
              at K-K Hospital via the 993 ambulance.</p>
              <p>In situations where both parent and child are suspected H-1-N-1 cases, they will be referred to K-K Hospital together.</p>
              <p>This will allow the patients to receive timely paediatric and
              obstetric care by the medical teams on duty at the Children's Emergency
              unit.</p>
              <p>Separately, two more H-1-N-1 patients have been discharged from the C-D-C.</p>

              <p>The 19th case is a 21-year-old Singapore Permanent Resident who is studying in Melbourne.</p>

              <p>He returned to Singapore from Los Angeles via Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific Airways CX717 on 7th June at 1230pm.</p>
              <p>He was seated at row 38.</p>
              <p>The 21st case is a 21-year-old Indonesian studying in Australia.</p>

              seated between 45 and 49 on SQ228 also on 9th June should call the MOH

              <p>But for the 20th case, MOH has assessed that no flight passengers on

              infectious during the flight.</p>
              <p>He developed symptoms more than 24 hours after disembarkation.</p>
              <p>To date, 13 patients have been discharged from hospital.</p>
              <p>The rest are still in hospital and their conditions remain stable.</p>

              <p>The meeting comes a day after WHO chief Margaret Chan held a
              teleconference with representatives of countries worst hit by the H1N1
              flu to assess if there was undisputable evidence of local spread of the
              virus.</p>
              <p>So far the WHO has left its six-level pandemic alert scale unchanged at phase five -- signalling that a pandemic is "imminent."</p>
              <p>But if it determines that there are sustained local transmissions
              outside the United States, it could raise the alert to six --
              suggesting a full-blown pandemic.<br> <br> Nations such as Australia, Britain, Chile and Japan are reporting growing numbers of infections</p>
              <p>And they're being watched carefully as they are outside the Americas, where the H1N1 flu was first detected in April.</p>
              <p>The WH-O has put the number of H1N1 infections at around 27 thousand in 74 countries</p>
              <p>The figure includes 141 deaths.</p>

              <div>
              <p>In the event of a major community spread of the
              H1N1 virus, Singapore will move from a containment strategy to one of
              mitigation.</p>
              <p>This means suspected cases may not be screened at Tan Tock Seng Hospital but by General Practitioners too.</p>
              <p><em>Claire Huang</em> reports.</p>
              <p>With the World Health Organisation moving closer to raising a level
              six global pandemic, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan says Singapore and
              other countries cannot remain in a containment mode.</p>
              <p>He says a community spread of the virus is inevitable, and when it does happen here, Singapore has to change tact.</p>
              <p>"I think the significance of upgrade by WHO to level 6 will mean
              that increasingly countries will no longer play containment strategy.
              We are in containment mode, containment means protect the borders and
              try to stop spreading, but once it's into level six, I think more and
              more countries will have to go into what we call mitigation phase.
              Mitigation phase means the emphasis will then shift from stopping
              spreading to looking after patients who are infected."</p>
              <p>People suspected of H1N1 may then be able to go to their GPs for a swab test to determine if they do have the virus.</p>
              <p>They will then head home and remain home until they get their test results.</p>
              <p>Currently, suspected H1N1 cases are referred to Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital and they may have to wait several hours before getting their
              test results.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw adds that MOH is still in discussion with doctors on the protocol.</p>
              <p>"They must be confident themselves, that we are not, risking
              unnecessarily by letting these suspects go home. So once they're
              confident, then yes, I think we can. I like to think that we can trust
              our Singaporeans, because judging by the 18 patients we've had, they've
              been quite responsible."</p>
              <p>When Singapore moves into a mitigation phase, Mr Khaw says contact
              tracing will be done away with and laboratory capabilities of other
              hospitals ramped up.</p>
              <p>This is to supplement Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s capability.</p>
              <p>For now, Mr Khaw says his ministry will continue to enforce the containment strategy.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the sidelines of the signing of a Memorandum of
              Understanding between his ministry and three Voluntary Welfare
              Organisations, Mr Khaw adds that the government will consider buying
              vaccines in batches.</p>

              <p><strong>Shorter wait for H1N1 test results at TTSH</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Those who are sent for H1N1 testing at Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital (TTSH) now have a shorter wait for their test results, thanks
              to laboratory staff who are now working in several shifts round the
              clock and some newly-acquired equipment.
              <br> <br>Waiting for H1N1 test results at TTSH used to take up to 10 hours.
              This was because once a nose and throat swab sample was tested positive
              for the H1N1 flu virus, samples were sent to the National Public Health
              Laboratory for verification. This measure has since been eliminated, as
              the hospital's results proved it was an unnecessary step.
              <br> <br> In addition, because of the sensitive nature of the test for H1N1 flu virus, great care also has to be taken in its execution.
              <br> <br>The hospital says samples have to be labelled, packed and
              transported to the laboratory. Once the samples arrive, they have to be
              unpacked and checked carefully for correct labelling, and to make sure
              that the samples are acceptable, before they are keyed into the
              computer system.
              <br> <br>Samples first have to be neutralised to make them safe for the
              staff to handle, before being manually taken out one by one, and mixed
              with other reagents. Only then is the batch subjected to the actual
              test itself.
              <br> <br>According to TTSH, it takes about three to four hours to process
              one sample. But because of the sheer volume of samples tested and the
              processing work that goes into each test, it usually takes up to five
              to six hours to obtain results.
              <br> <br>To facilitate testing efficiency, TTSH has acquired new equipment
              capable of conducting a larger volume of tests than could be done
              manually.
              <br> <br> TTSH will also train more staff to conduct the tests, so that there will be enough people to work through the night.
              <br> <br>While this does not shorten actual testing time, it means that TTSH
              is able to conduct a larger volume of tests at one time, 24 hours a
              day, and thus minimising patients' waiting time.
              <br> <br>Senior consultant at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, TTSH,
              Timothy Barkham, said: "One of the biggest issues has been that we
              haven't had enough staff to run 24 hours a day. But we're changing
              that. And that will mean people who previously had to wait for their
              samples to be run the next morning, are going to have them being run
              throughout the night." <br> <br> Dr Barkham added that each test requires careful and particular work.
              Any mistake can ruin the whole run and the several-hour-long process
              will have to be repeated.
              <br> <br>The molecular tests used at TTSH detect all Influenza A and B flu
              viruses. The tests were developed in collaboration with researchers
              such as Li Jingguang who works at TTSH's laboratory under a special
              Ministry of Health grant to improve Singapore's capability in dealing
              with respiratory disease outbreaks. TTSH also has been collaborating
              with Masafumi Inoue from the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology
              since the SARS outbreak in 2003.

              <p><strong>Singapore confirms 6 more H1N1 cases bringing total to 27 so far</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed six more H1N1 flu cases. Five of them are children between the ages of three and 15.
              <br> <br> Two of them, aged six and seven, are Australian siblings from Melbourne, travelling in a family of five on holiday.
              <br> <br> The sixth case is the mother of the three-year-old boy, both of whom are Singaporeans.
              <br> <br> The mother and son had gone to Melbourne on holiday on June 3. Another
              boy, a 12-year-old Singaporean studying in Melbourne returned via Perth
              on a Tiger Airways flight at 2am on June 8. He later developed symptoms
              on the evening of June 10.
              <br> <br>All travellers had arrived from Melbourne since June 8, except the
              15-year-old boy who's a Singaporean studying in the United States.
              <br> <br> These cases bring the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 27. 
              <br> <br> The Health Ministry has initiated contact tracing for all six cases on the following flights:
              <br> <br> - Row 51 to 55 on Qantas Airways QF9 from Melbourne touching down at 21:15 hours on June 11,
              <br> - Row 30 to 34 on Japan Airlines JL711 from San Francisco via Tokyo, arriving at 00:30 hours on June 11,
              <br> - Row 31 to 35 on Singapore Airlines SQ228 from Melbourne at 21:40 hours on June 9.
              <br> <br> Those who have not been contacted by the Health Ministry yet should call its hotline at 1800-333-9999.
              <br> <br>The ministry said that two patients, the eighth and 16th cases have
              been discharged, bringing the total number of discharged patients to
              15. <br> <br> The remaining 12 patients - the 15th and the 17th to 27th cases - are
              still in hospital and are in stable condition. </span></p>

              attending a wedding in Melbourne.</p>
              <p>These cases had all attended the same wedding in Melbourne, but had returned to Singapore on separate flights.</p>
              <p>The 28th and 29th case, a 52-year-old Singaporean man and a
              42-year-old woman, had returned to Singapore from Melbourne on

              JL711 at 12.30am on 11th June.</p>
              <p>He was on the same flight as the 25th case.</p>
              <p>The 33rd case is a 32-year-old Singaporean woman who returned to
              Singapore from Phuket on Tiger Airways TR155 at 11pm on 5th June.</p>
              <p>As Thailand is not on the list of affected countries, she was
              discharged from Tan Tock Seng Hospital's emergency department with four
              days of medical leave on 12th June when she sought medical attention.</p>
              <p>But the next day, laboratory results confirmed her infection and she was admitted to Communicable Disease Centre 2 at night.</p>
              <p>The 34th case is a 6-year-old Australian female who came to
              Singapore from Melbourne with her mother on Emirates EK405 at 11.50pm
              on 12th June for a holiday.</p>
              <p>She was seated at row 28.</p>
              <p>Contact tracing has been initiated for the seven new confirmed cases.</p>
              <p>Given these recent cases, the Health Ministry would like to again
              remind travellers from infected areas to consult a doctor there as soon
              as possible if they feel unwell.</p>
              <p>They are also advised to refrain from travelling if they have symptoms within 24 hours of their planned departure.</p>
              <p>And for those who have recently travelled to affected countries,
              they are advised to stay at home if unwell, and not go about their
              usual activities such as going to school, shopping or work.</p>
              <p>MOH says doing so will significantly increase the risk of causing a community spread in Singapore.</p>
              <p>So far, 17 of the 34 H1-N1 patients here have been discharged from hospital.</p>
              <p>The rest remain in a stable condition.</p>

              <br> <br> Three of them are children, aged seven to nine.
              <br> <br> One of them, a nine-year-old Malaysian boy, had gone to Sydney and Melbourne before coming here for a holiday.
              <br> <br> He had developed symptoms while onboard a Jetstar flight (JQ61) from Melbourne (via Darwin) on June 13. He was seated at row 17.
              <br> <br> Another child, a seven-year-old girl from Australia, also flew in from
              Melbourne on Saturday, on Singapore Airlines SQ228 at 21:32 hours. She
              was seated at row 60.
              <br> <br>The third child, an eight-year-old Singapore permanent resident,
              had gone to the Philippines for a family visit on May 30, and returned
              on Saturday. Her mother, who was with her, has also been admitted.
              <br> <br>Both had boarded Singapore Airlines flight SQ915 on June 13 and
              were seated at row 38 and 39. The mother had developed symptoms before
              boarding, while the girl became ill during the flight. All four cases
              were picked up by airport thermal scanners and were sent to the
              Communicable Disease Centre on 993 ambulances.
              <br> <br>The fifth case is a 24-year-old Singaporean off-duty air stewardess
              who had flown in from Frankfurt on Singapore Airlines SQ25 on June 12,
              sitting in row 38.
              <br> <br>She had developed symptoms while in Frankfurt, but was given the
              all-clear to fly by a German doctor. Upon arrival in Singapore, she
              went to a clinic at Changi Airport and was sent to the Communicable
              Disease Centre via 993 ambulance on the morning of June 14.
              <br> <br> The final case is a 19-year-old Singaporean, returning from his holiday in Melbourne on June 12.
              <br> <br>He had arrived in Melbourne on June 7 and developed symptoms the
              next day. Upon return to Singapore on SQ238, row 43, he was not
              detected by airport thermal scanners as he was not feverish then and
              stayed at home. He was later sent to the CDC via 993 ambulance on the
              night of June 12
              <br> <br> Of the 40 cases so far, 19 had travelled to Melbourne, and another 14 had come from the US.
              <br> <br> The Health Ministry (MOH) has initiated contact tracing for all six patients.
              <br> <br>It reminds travellers to refrain from travelling should they have
              symptoms within 24 hours of their planned departure and to consult a
              doctor.
