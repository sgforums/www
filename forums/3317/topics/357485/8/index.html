              <p>Thai health authorities says they'll step up monitoring of
              workplaces and schools after the number of H1N1 flu cases soared
              twelve-fold in less than a week.</p>
              <p>Thailand's health ministry confirmed a further 51 cases of the H1N1 virus overnight.</p>
              <p>This takes the number of infections in the country to just over 200.</p>
              <p>Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has urged people not to panic
              about the growing number of H1N1 flu cases, especially after a cluster
              emerged in a key tourist resort in Pattaya.</p>
              <p>In Australia, the government says it's ready to raise its flu alert to 'sustain' as the national tally hit nearly 1,500 cases.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,</p>
              <p>British authorities have appealed for calm after the first H1N1 flu death outside the Americas was confirmed in the country.</p>
              <p>An infected patient who had "underlying health conditions", died in hospital in a Scottish hospital.</p>
              <p>British officials would not confirm the victim's identity.</p>
              <p>But media reports say she's a 38-year-old woman, who gave birth prematurely about two weeks ago.</p>
              <p>The Scottish patient was among 10 people hospitalised with the virus in Britain, out of over 1,200 confirmed cases.</p>

              <p>Singapore has confirmed seven more cases of Influenza A H1N1, bringing the total number of confirmed cases here to 47.</p>
              <p>One is a 39-year-old male Singapore PR.</p>
              <p>He went to the Philippines for a holiday and developed symptoms on 10 June while he was there.</p>
              <p>He returned to Singapore from Manila on 13 June.</p>
              <p>The next case is a 10-year-old Singaporean girl, who went to Melbourne with her family on 6 June for a holiday.</p>
              <p>She developed symptoms before she boarded the plane on 13 June, and wore a mask during the flight.</p>
              <p>She returned to Singapore from Melbourne on 13 June.</p>
              <p>The next three cases are Singaporean siblings who also went to Melbourne with their family for a holiday.</p>
              <p>They are two boys aged 8 and 6, and a 4-year-old girl.</p>
              <p>All three children developed symptoms on 13 June before they boarded the plane.</p>
              <p>They returned home on 14 June.</p>
              <p>The 6th case is a 10-year-old Australian girl who came to Singapore with her family for a holiday.</p>
              <p>She developed symptoms on 14 June while she was on the plane.</p>
              <p>The last case detected is a 22-year-old Singaporean female cabin crew with Japanese Airlines.</p>
              <p>She travelled as a cabin crew to New York on 6 June.</p>
              <p>She later left New York for Tokyo from where she returned home on<br> 12 June.</p>
              <p>Contact tracing is ongoing for the cases.</p>
              <p>Passengers seated within rows 15 to 19 on PR505 on 13 June,</p>
              <p>rows 44 to 48 on SQ228 on 14 June,</p>
              <p>rows 41 to 45 on SQ228 on 15 June,</p>
              <p>and rows 66 to 70 on QF9, who have not been contacted by MOH yet should call the MOH hotline at 1800-333 9999.</p>
              <p>All close contacts identified will be quarantined and provided with antiviral prophylaxis.</p>
              <p>MOH reminds travellers from infected areas to consult a doctor there
              as soon as possible if they feel unwell and to refrain from travelling
              if they have symptoms within 24 hours of their planned departure.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Risk of H1N1 community spread rises in Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>Singapore has confirmed two more cases of the H1N1 flu, bringing the total number here to 49.</p>
              <p>But the Health Ministry says unlike the earlier imported cases, a
              number of the recent imported cases have engaged in extensive community
              activities such as working and shopping since their arrival here.</p>
              <p>Some even travelled to Singapore even though they were already unwell prior to departure.</p>
              <p>The Ministry says this is contrary to its advice that travellers to
              affected countries should immediately call 993 for medical assistance
              if they feel unwell within seven days of arrival.</p>
              <p>It adds such behaviour has considerably increased the difficulty of
              contact tracing and significantly heightened the risk of community
              spread here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Of the two new cases, one is a 56-year-old German man who works in Singapore as a researcher at Biopolis.</p>
              <p>He had gone to Philadelphia in the United States to attend a conference, and developed symptoms while he was there.</p>
              <p>Upon his return, he went to work for three days.</p>
              <p>He also attended a concert, went shopping and had social activities, including one which was attended by some 70 people.</p>
              <p>The other new case is a 26-year-old Indonesian man who works in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He had gone to Melbourne for a holiday, and developed symptoms during the trip.</p>
              <p>The day after his return on 14th June, he sought medical attention at a clinic and was given two days of medical leave.</p>
              <p>Laboratory results confirmed his infection later that day, after he had gone shopping.</p>
              <p>Contact tracing is underway for the two cases.</p>

              <p><strong>S'pore confirms 17 new cases of H1N1 flu, bringing total to 66</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Health Ministry (MOH) has confirmed
              another 17 H1N1 cases, bringing the total so far in the republic to 66.
              <br> <br>All the latest cases were imported, with six from Melbourne, six
              from the Philippines and the rest also from countries with known
              community spread of H1N1.
              <br> <br>According to the ministry, some of these patients had proceeded
              with their travel plans, meetings or social activities despite having
              developed symptoms.
              <br> <br>Among the latest cases are two five-year-old children - one
              American boy in transit at Changi Airport while en route from
              California to Chennai via Hong Kong, and one Singaporean girl returning
              from the United States.
              <br> <br> Contact tracing is being carried out for the 17 cases. 
              <br> <br>The ministry reminds travellers, especially those who have been to
              countries with sustained community transmission or are in transition
              towards community transition, not to engage in extensive community
              activities such as working, shopping and participating in mass
              activities until they are well. <br> <br> This will help mitigate the risk of community spread in Singapore and make containment efforts more effective.
              <br> <br> The ministry adds that with many Singaporeans returning from their June
              holidays or coming home for their summer vacation from countries such
              as the US, UK and Australia, Singapore can expect an increase in the
              number of imported cases of H1N1 flu. <br> <br> Of the 66 confirmed cases so far, 31 are from Australia, 19 from the
              United States, 11 from the Philippines, with the rest from Thailand,
              Canada, UK and Chile. One case was a close local contact of an infected
              traveller.
              <br> <br> MOH says so far, 25 patients have been discharged. 41 are still in hospital and their conditions are stable.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore may have its first local case of H1N1 flu with no travel history to a known infected area.
              <br> <br> The 26-year-old Malaysian, a Singapore permanent resident, had
              developed symptoms the same day he flew to Kuala Lumpur last Sunday.
              <br> <br> He saw a doctor in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday and returned to Singapore on Wednesday.
              <br> <br> Upon his arrival at Changi Airport, he asked airport staff to call for a 993 ambulance.
              <br> <br>Singapore's Health Ministry said he could have come into contact
              with one of the earlier confirmed cases here. And unless further
              investigations show otherwise, and if more such unlinked cases emerge
              over the next few days, this would signal the beginning of community
              spread in Singapore.
              <br> <br>Ten other imported cases were confirmed on Thursday. Six are
              Singaporeans, one is a Singapore permanent resident and three are
              foreigners.

              three who appear to have acquired their infections in Singapore. <br> <br> 22 cases involve travellers returning from other countries while another case is a close contact of an earlier confirmed case.
              <br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The new cases bring the total number of infected people in Singapore to 103. </span><br> <br> The Ministry of Health (MOH) says the three unlinked cases have no travel history or known contact with confirmed cases. 
              <br> <br> One of them is a 27-year-old Filipino who works in Singapore. His
              six-member family from the Philippines came to Singapore from Manila on
              11 June. <br> <br> From 12-14 June, he took his family to several places of interest. His
              family returned to Manila on 14 June. His six family members appeared
              well during their stay in Singapore. <br> <br> He went to work from 15-17 June. He developed symptoms while he was in
              the office on 16 June evening. On 18 June morning, he sought medical
              attention at a GP clinic for fever and cough. A 993 ambulance was
              called to send him to the Communicable Disease Centre 2 (CDC2) at Tan
              Tock Seng Hospital. <br> <br> Swabs were taken from him for influenza testing under MOH's influenza
              surveillance programme, and he was discharged with three days of
              medical leave and medication. He went back and stayed at home for the
              rest of the day. Laboratory results confirmed his infection on the same
              day and he was admitted to CDC2 via a 993 ambulance at night. <br> <br> Another new unlinked case is a 16-year-old Singaporean student. He was
              at home all day on 12 June. From 13 to 15 June, he was out for social
              activities. He remained at home on 16 June and went out again on 17
              June. He developed symptoms on 17 June night while he was at home. <br> <br> On 18 June morning, he went to the polyclinic where swabs were taken
              under MOH's influenza surveillance programme, and he was prescribed
              some medication. He returned home thereafter and remained at home. On
              19 June, he received a call from the polyclinic informing him that he
              had tested positive for Influenza A (H1N1-2009). He was admitted to

              <div>
              <p>Organisers of the Asian Youth Games in Singapore say one of the athletes taking part has H1N1.</p>
              <p>The patient is from the Philippines football team.</p>
              <p>Organisers say the boy developed symptoms yesterday afternoon and a fever was detected during routine temperature checks.</p>
              <p>He then sought medical attention at the Games Village's medical centre at around 730 pm yesterday.</p>
              <p>He was placed in an isolation room and swaps from this throat were taken for further tests.</p>
              <p>It was confirmed this morning that he has the virus and is now being treated at the Communicable Disease Centre.</p>
              <p>The boy is in a stable condition.</p>
              <p>The Philippines football team was due to play its first match against Taipei at 5 pm today at Meridien Junior College.</p>
              <p>But now organisers say all matches involving the Philippines
              football team will be postponed, though the rest of the Games will
              still go on.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry is currently conducting contact tracing of the boy's close contacts.</p>
              <p>Organisers say all close contacts of the boy will be quarantined at the Aloha Resorts.</p>
              <p>So far, 13 youth teams are already in Singapore for the games.</p>
              <p>At an earlier media briefing on Thursday, AYG officials say they
              would consider canceling the games in the event of a ' large community
              outbreak' among the athletes.</p>
              <p>More than 1000 of them are expected to be Singapore during the week-long games which officially opens on Monday.</p>

              <p>Singapore's Health Ministry has confirmed another 23 cases of the H1N1 flu - bringing to 126 the total so far.</p>
              <p>Eight of these are local cases, from two clusters of local transmission.</p>
              <p>The first cluster is from the Riverlife Church, which saw five students fall ill after attending its services last weekend.</p>
              <p>One of them, a student at Chung Cheng High School, was reported on Friday.</p>
              <p>Four are new cases, including the student's younger brother.</p>
              <p>The second cluster is from the National University of Singapore, which saw three students fall ill.</p>
              <p>One case was reported on Friday, while the other two had their infection confirmed on Saturday.</p>
              <p>All three are foreign exchange students who had met up last week.</p>
              <p>But there are also two new cases with no confirmed links with previous patients.</p>
              <p>One is the father of a boy who is a close contact of an earlier case.</p>
              <p>The Ministry is investigating if both infections are related.</p>
              <p>The remaining 15 are all imported cases.</p>
              <p>They include a 14-year-old Asian Youth Games participant from the Philippines.</p>
              <p>He has been admitted to the Communicable Disease Centre.</p>
              <p>His team-mates and two coaches are quarantined at the Aloha Resort at Loyang.</p>

              <div>
              <p>There are now 142 cases of H1N1 flu here, after another 16 new cases were confirmed recently.</p>
              <p>Seven of the new cases are local cases, while 9 have a history of travel to affected areas.</p>
              <p>Popular nightclub Butter Factory at One Fullerton has been identified as the third cluster of locally infected cases.</p>
              <p>The new case is a 19-year-old Singaporean female student.</p>
              <p>She visited the club last Wednesday, when three previously reported cases were also there.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry has advised all who had visited Butter Factory
              on that day to monitor their health and seek medical attention if they
              feel unwell.</p>
              <p>The other 2 clusters are found at the Riverlife Church and the National University of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Two new cases were added to the Riverlife Church cluster.</p>
              <p>One is a 20-year-old Singaporean female student who attended a church function on the 13th of June.</p>
              <p>The other is a 12-year-old Singaporean boy whose cousin is an earlier case from the cluster.</p>
              <p>Of the other four new local cases, one is a colleague of an earlier
              case, while the other three have no known contact with confirmed cases.</p>
              <p>The three are:</p>
              <p>A 39-year-old man who was on leave;</p>

              <p>and a 21-year-old National Serviceman based at Clementi Police Station who developed a fever while on duty.</p>

              <div>
              <p>More confirmed cases of Influenza A H1N1 have emerged at the Asian Youth Games village.</p>
              <p>Three members of the Hong Kong football team taking part in the games are the latest confirmed cases.</p>
              <p>This after tests conducted by the Ministry of Health last night.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry had received information from their Hong Kong
              counterparts that two players contracted H1N1 and have missed training
              since 18th of June.</p>
              <p>They remained in Hong Kong and did not travel to Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Hong Kong team have been isolated at the games' village medical room for now.</p>
              <p>The team's match with Saudi Arabia at 5pm today is cancelled.</p>
              <p>The three confirmed cases have been sent to Singapore General Hospital.</p>
              <p>In an update on the football player from the Philippines, the
              organising commmittee says he's still undergoing medical treatment at
              the Communicable Disease Centre, where he is in stable condition.</p>
              <p>The 14-year-old developed flu-like symptoms last Friday, and tested positive for the virus a day later.</p>
              <p>One other Philippines team member had felt unwell and sent to KK Hospital but he tested negative for H1N1.</p>
              <p>He's now back at the Aloha Loyang Resort under quarantine with the rest of the team.</p>
              <p>All these confirmed Hong Kong and Philippines cases were imported cases.</p>
              <p>None caught the virus locally in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But the games' organising committee co-chair, Oon Jin Teik says they are not taking any chances.</p>
              <p>"They have activated the standard operating procedures to isolate
              the case and so on. Despite confirming these three cases from the HK
              team, we are not taking any chances. So in all, there are 16 athletes,
              5 officials, and also two of our liaison officers who are being taken
              care of right now."</p>
              <p>Chairman of the Olympic Council of Asia's Medical Committee, Dr Mani
              Jegatheesan says the immediate strategy is to keep infections to its
              lowest by providing timely medical assistance.</p>
              <p>He also emphasizes the priority to ensure the health and safety of the athletes.</p>
              <p>This will include stepping up temperature checks and reminding
              athletes to maintain their social distance to prevent chances of
              infection and community spread.</p>
              <p>"This is quite an unusual turn of events that we are dealing with in
              organizing a multi-sports games. Now, we have been working very closely
              with SAYGOC and with the Singapore health authorities in monitoring the
              situation, and we have been in close contact on all the measures put in
              place. I think the local authorities have done everything according to
              the books. And it is because of the stringent measures taken, as well
              as the close vigilance that the positive cases have been picked up and
              the appropriate action taken."</p>

              spokesman for Asian Youth Games.</p>
              <p>This brings the total number of confirmed cases for the Hong Kong team here to four.</p>

              Medical Centre at Games Village on 22 June, their swab results are
              negative.</p>
              <p>As they are not deemed close contacts of the confirmed cases, they will be released from the isolation room.</p>
              <p>But, the spokesman says, they should monitor their own temperature daily, and seek medical attention if they feel unwell.</p>
              <p>The number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Singapore is now believed to be 172.</p>
              <p>Apart from the cases at the AYG, 26 cases were confirmed earlier in the day.</p>

              <p>one additional case from the cluster at Butter Factory at One Fullerton,</p>
              <p>nine cases who attended the Fishermen of Christ Church camp together with an earlier patient,</p>
