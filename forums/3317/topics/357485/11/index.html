              <p><strong>MOH announces changes to H1N1 tracking measures</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: As Singapore moves gradually towards the full
              mitigation phase, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has made more changes to
              its H1N1 tracking measures.
              <br> <br>General practitioners will continue to refer those in high-risk
              groups - pregnant women and those with health complications - for H1N1
              testing. <br> <br> But contact tracing will be stepped down and Home Quarantine Orders
              (HQOs) will generally not be issued, except to patients deemed to be a
              risk to the community.
              <br> <br>This could include patients who are in close contact with people in
              high-risk groups. The MOH said HQOs can be "initiated under special
              situations, based on risk assessment by public health specialists".
              <br> <br>It said these changes are part of its shift towards the full
              mitigation phase under which it plans to focus on high-risk patients.
              <br> <br>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said countries no longer
              need to submit reports on laboratory confirmed cases. The WHO will also
              not be reporting the number of confirmed cases in each country. <br> <br> In response, MOH said it will be removing its list of affected
              countries from its website. It will also stop issuing daily updates on
              the number of new cases. Instead, it will only report the number of
              confirmed cases in hospitals. <br> <br> As of Tuesday, 85 were still warded at six public hospitals and the Communicable Disease Centre.
              <br> <br> The ministry said it will continue its influenza biosurveillance and report its findings regularly.
              <br> <br> Routine laboratory tests on random virus samples are taken from
              patients in the clinics and hospitals to determine the circulating
              influenza strains. Latest data showed that 13 per cent of patients with
              flu-like symptoms are due to the H1N1 flu.
              <br> <br> Doctors said patients have been adjusting well to the gradual changes. 
              <br> <br>Dr Lee Vik Voon, executive director of Singapore Medical
              Association, said: "They have been compliant with the treatment that
              we've prescribed. And up till now, we have not received any reports of
              unreasonable requests for Tamiflu."
              <br> <br>To allay public concerns over H1N1 risks while on the move, the
              Land Transport Authority, public transport operators and taxi companies
              have put in place precautionary measures.
              <br> <br>These include improving the ventilation of trains, buses and taxis,
              stepped-up cleaning and daily temperature screening of staff.

              <p><strong>Second patient in intensive care after contracting H1N1</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A second H1N1 flu patient in Singapore is in critical condition due to complications.
              <br> <br> The Health Ministry said the 51-year-old man, who also suffers from
              diabetes and hypertension, is in intensive care at Changi General
              Hospital. <br> <br> His family sent him to the hospital after he had flu-like symptoms for
              four days. Laboratory tests later confirmed that he had contracted the
              H1N1 flu.
              <br> <br>An earlier patient who was admitted to Tan Tock Seng's intensive
              care unit on Monday has been transferred to a general ward. MOH said
              the 63-year-old patient's condition has stabilised.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, the Taxi Operators Association said that while no taxi
              driver in Singapore has been confirmed with H1N1 yet, it is putting in
              place provisions as a precaution.
              <br> <br> Affected drivers will be able to claim a daily subsidy of S$30 for up to seven days, medical expenses and taxi rentals.
              <br> <br>The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) is also setting aside
              S$650,000 from its U Care fund to provide short-term relief for
              affected drivers. <br> <br> This aid package will also allow affected drivers to return their
              vehicles to taxi operators to save on rent while ill. Temporary drivers
              can also be arranged to take over the vehicles. <br> <br> Foo Chi Yong, president of Premier Taxi Operators' Association, said:
              "We always tell our members to see doctors (if they are ill). But
              according to feedback, they are very reluctant to go because they're
              worried about their (taxi) rental and their loss of income."
              <br> <br>"Now, with this package to help them to cushion" the loss, he said
              more will be considerate enough to go and see a doctor if they are ill.

              <p><strong>S'pore to stop temperature screening at border checkpoints from July 11</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: From Saturday, Singapore will stop temperature screenings at all border checkpoints.
              <br> <br> The Health and Home Affairs Ministries said in a joint statement on
              Friday that temperature screening at the borders is now less useful as
              the H1N1 flu virus has become endemic among global communities, and
              with localised community spread in Singapore.
              <br> <br>In the initial phase of the H1N1 outbreak, temperature screening
              was implemented at the border checkpoints to contain the spread of the
              virus into the community.
              <br> <br> Latest figures show that there are currently 60 confirmed H1N1 cases in public hospitals.
              <br> <br> This includes a 51-year-old man, with diabetes and hypertension, who is in Changi General Hospital's Intensive Care Unit.
              <br> <br> The greatest number of cases - 29 - is currently warded at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.

              <p><strong>Health Minister says S'pore is in last leg of battle against H1N1</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan on Saturday
              said the nation is in the final leg of its battle against the H1N1 flu
              virus.
              <br> <br> He said Singaporeans have fought off the virus well by being well-informed and complying with precautionary measures.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said studies have shown that the virus seems to be getting weaker as time goes by.
              <br> <br> However, he stressed that there is still a chance it may mutate and get deadlier.
              <br> <br> The Minister also said there are bound to be complicated cases, with some possibly resulting in death.
              <br> <br> Speaking at a health event, Mr Khaw highlighted the priorities his Ministry is now focusing on, besides high risk groups.
              <br> <br>Said Minister Khaw: "We're taking a pause and reflecting on what
              have we learnt in the last three months, what are the lessons. So we're
              doing a post mortem on how we have reacted to this first wave, to learn
              from it, where can we do better? (Another priority) is to prepare for
              the next wave. Of course we hope there's no next wave, but we can't
              tell." <br> <br> As of Friday, there were 60 H1N1 flu cases in hospital, including one in intensive care.

              <p><strong>Schools to resume CCA programmes next week with H1N1 precautions</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education said schools will resume co-curricular activities (CCAs) next week.
              <br> <br> It said schools will also take precautions such as temperature-taking
              and visual screening for flu-like symptoms at the start of sessions.
              <br> <br>The ministry said some schools have already resumed CCAs to allow
              students to train for sports meets or to prepare for the upcoming
              Singapore Youth Festival.
              <br> <br>Life is almost back to normal at Rulang Primary, except that
              students still have to go through mandatory temperature checks. All
              co-curricular activities have resumed after being suspended for the
              last two weeks as an H1N1 precaution.
              <br> <br>Low Min Chye, vice principal, Rulang Primary School, said: "CCAs
              are an important part of our school curriculum. So this is the reason
              why we decided to resume, but measures are taken such as CCA groups are
              kept to a small group and very importantly the pupils are kept together
              for a maximum of 45 minutes."
              <br> <br>Besides this, Channel NewsAsia understands that ministry guidelines
              also state that where possible, students should avoid close contact and
              be at least two metres apart.
              <br> <br>As a precaution, at least one secondary school is known to have
              stopped one-on-one counselling sessions to minimise close contact.
              <br> <br>Over at Republic Polytechnic, a rule restricting students to
              certain canteens has left some students disgruntled. So the school has
              decided to ease up a little on that ruling, but said it is in a unique
              situation where being over-cautious is important.
              <br> <br>Ang Keng Loo, senior director, Student Affairs, said: "We don't
              have a lecture theatre system where everybody sits there and listens.
              We have groups of students discussing actively throughout the whole day
              and the amount of interaction they go through, should there be a person
              who is infected in that group, the transmission is almost like 100 per
              cent."
              <br> <br>One of the reasons for Republic Polytechnic's stricter rules is
              because of the initial rapid spread of the H1N1 virus among students.
              105 students have been infected so far. 97 have recovered.
              <br> <br>Latest figures from the Health Ministry show that there are
              currently 49 H1N1 patients in Singapore hospitals, including a
              51-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension in intensive care. </span></p>

              <p>The World Health Organization says a fully licensed H1N1 flu vaccine will not be available until the end of the year.</p>
              <p>And this will impact many countries' vaccination plans.</p>
              <p>A fully licensed vaccine requires thorough and conclusive testing.</p>
              <p>H1N1 flu vaccines are expected to be available for clinical trials in the next couple of months.</p>
              <p>But this will take even more time, as each country's regulatory authority must vet them for safety issues.</p>
              <p>However, Ms Kieny says countries can use emergency provisions to get
              the vaccines out faster, if they decide their populations need them.</p>
              <p>This could mean using preliminary information to determine whether a vaccine is safe to use.</p>
              <p>But she warned that in this scenario, it will be key to increase post-marketing surveillance to detect potential side effects.</p>

              <br> <br> The first is a 45-year-old woman with multiple health problems such as
              diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. She was also on
              immunosuppressants due to a kidney transplant in 2006.
              <br> <br>She had sought treatment at the Singapore General Hospital's
              emergency department on July 4 after two days of vomiting and
              diarrhoea, and is now in critical condition.
              <br> <br>The second patient is a 22-year-old woman who is 24 weeks pregnant.
              She was admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital on Monday after
              she developed pneumonia and was tested positive for H1N1 at a private
              hospital.
              <br> <br>On Tuesday, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
              for closer monitoring as her requirement for oxygen had increased. She
              has no underlying medical conditions.
              <br> <br>There are 48 other H1N1 patients warded at various public
              hospitals, including a 51-year-old patient with diabetes and

              <p><strong>Singapore confirms first H1N1-related death </strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A 49-year-old H1N1 patient, with multiple health
              problems, died on Saturday afternoon. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said
              in a statement that he died of a heart attack, contributed by severe
              pneumonia and H1N1 infection.
              <br> <br>The victim, who had diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol,
              was admitted to Changi General Hospital on July 16 after four days of
              flu-like symptoms.
              <br> <br>MOH added that a 55-year-old man, also with multiple health
              problems, is the latest H1N1 patient to be admitted to intensive care.
              <br> <br> He was tested positive for H1N1 after being admitted into Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) intensive care unit.
              <br> <br>He went to SGH on July 17, complaining of shortness of breath and
              fever, and was admitted after investigations showed that he had
              suffered an acute heart attack. The patient is currently in stable
              condition.
              <br> <br>MOH said while the majority of H1N1 cases remains mild, the virus
              can cause complications and even death in high-risk individuals with
              underlying medical conditions.
              <br> <br>Individuals in the high-risk group are advised to seek prompt
              medical attention if they suffer flu-like symptoms such as fever,
              cough, sore throat and runny nose.
              <br> <br>Members of the public who develop influenza-like illness can visit
              their nearest Pandemic Preparedness Clinic or their GP clinics for
              initial assessment and treatment.
              <br> <br>If symptoms are severe, such as breathlessness and chest pains,
              members of the public are advised to call 995 immediately for an
              emergency ambulance. <br> <br> - CNA/so </span></p>

              <p><strong>Bodies of H1N1 victims to be buried or cremated within 7 days</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry has called on all approved
              undertakers to handle with care the bodies of those who died from the
              H1N1 virus. <br> <br> Funeral wakes can only be held within seven days for embalmed bodies.
              Non-embalmed ones have to buried or cremated within three days. <br> <br> Loved ones are also not to touch the bodies, even though the chances of contracting the virus that way is low.
              <br> <br> Undertakers have also been told to avoid all direct contact with blood or other fluids from the bodies. 
              <br> <br> Undertakers who have open wounds or skin infections are not to handle the body.
              <br> <br> Families have to wear masks when claiming the bodies and performing religious rites. 
              <br> <br> Coffins of embalmed bodies have to be sealed at all times. 
              <br> <br> Families and friends must also wash their hands with soap after viewing.
              <br> <br> Funeral service providers said these measures are relatively milder
              compared to those who died from SARS, when their bodies had to be
              cremated almost immediately. <br> <br> - CNA/yb</span></p>
