              <div>
              <p>Japan said 13 more high school students have
              tested positive for H1N1 flu, bringing the total number of cases here
              to 25 amid fears the virus has a foothold in the west of the country.</p>
              <p>The latest confirmed flu sufferers are all students in Osaka
              prefecture or in the city of Kobe in neighbouring Hyogo prefecture,
              where eight students were already ill from the virus.</p>
              <p>Four other Japanese -- a school teacher and three students who flew
              to Tokyo from Canada via Detroit -- contracted the virus overseas
              earlier this month and have since recovered.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Taro Aso has called on the country to remain calm.<br> <br> The WHO said it is closely monitoring the flu situation in Japan after
              officials shut down schools and cancelled public events in Kobe.</p>
              <p>About 100 more high school students in Osaka and seven people in
              Hyogo prefecture who had displayed suspicious symptoms are to be tested.</p>

              <p>The number of confirmed H1N1 flu cases in Japan has reportedly reached almost 130.</p>
              <p>The figure includes four cases the country confirmed earlier this month among people that returned from abroad.</p>
              <p>The batch of new cases was confirmed in the western city of Kobe.</p>
              <p>It was earlier reported that many cases have been since in high
              school students in western Japan, many of whom have not travelled
              abroad.</p>
              <p>The health ministry has not received information on anyone being critically ill from the flu.</p>
              <p>But it has called for the suspension of classes at all middle and high schools in the Hyogo and Osaka prefectures.</p>
              <p>The World Health Organization said last week it is closely
              monitoring the situation in Japan, after 3 students from the same high
              school who have not travelled abroad came down with the flu.</p>
              <p>More than 35 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, and some 60 people have died in Mexico.</p>

              <p>The World Health Organization has said the new H1N1 flu poses a particular threat to chronically ill people and pregnant women.</p>
              <p>Most people will underlying chronic conditions such as heart disease
              or diabetes already show to be the most vulnerable to the new H1N1
              virus.</p>
              <p>And a majority of such cases live in the developing world.</p>
              <p>WHO chief Margaret Chan also expressed concerns the virus could take
              on new momentum if it starts to spread through human waste or to
              combine with other viruses.</p>
              <p>The bird flu virus H5N1 is firmly entrenched in poultry in several countries, mainly in Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>Dr Chan said there is no saying how the avian virus will behave when
              pressured by large numbers of people infected with the new H1N1 strain.</p>
              <p>And if the H1N1 virus is shown to be shed in faeces, it would
              introduce an additional route of transmission, especially in developing
              countries.</p>

              <p>Hong Kong has been placed on a new flu alert after a mainland
              Chinese man suspected of carrying the H1N1 flu virus was found to have
              stayed in a hotel in the city for two nights.</p>
              <p>A government spokesman said the 59-year-old man is a resident of China's Guangdong province.</p>
              <p>He arrived in Hong Kong from South Korea on Wednesday after traveling to the US and Canada.</p>
              <p>The man stayed two nights at a hotel in the city's Mong Kok district, before boarding a train to Guangzhou on Friday.</p>
              <p>He was detained at the customs checkpoint in Guangzhou after developing a fever while on board the train.</p>
              <p>The man was then diagnosed with the flu following a preliminary test.</p>
              <p>The city's health authorities have started tracing people who might have been in contact with the patient.</p>
              <p>Flu experts are concerned that the latest case could trigger a community outbreak in Hong Kong.</p>

              <div>
              <p>Four Singaporeans have been quarantined at the
              Nepal-Tibetan border after an Italian woman who was part of their tour
              group was found to be having a high fever.</p>
              <p>This, after border checks for the H1N1 Flu Virus.</p>
              <p><em>Melissa Tan</em>, with more.</p>
              <p>2 men and 2 women from Singapore had planned a graduation trip, trekking around Nepal and Tibet.</p>
              <p>But last Saturday, as they were making their way across the Nepal-Tibetan border, their tour group of 24 was quarantined.</p>
              <p>An Italian woman who was part of the tour group was found to be having a temperature of 38.5 degrees celsius.</p>
              <p>She was immediately sent to the hospital, and the rest shuttled to a hotel.</p>
              <p>The tour group, which is also made up of other nationalities
              including Americans, Japanese, Germans and Ukrainians, are currently
              being held quarantine at the Cai Yuan Bin Guan Hotel.</p>
              <p>The group was hoping to be released from quarantine today when the suspected patient's blood test results were out.</p>
              <p>But the test had proved inconclusive and the blood samples are now being sent to Beijing for further testing.</p>
              <p>One of the Singaporeans who only wanted to be known as Mr Lim, said
              that they were not told how long this process is going to take.</p>
              <p>"I don't know. But the maximum they can hold us here is for a week,
              cos that's when the incubation period for the flu virus will be over.
              So once 7 days is up, and none of us are found to be showing any
              symptoms of the flu, then we are free to go."</p>
              <p>No one else has shown any signs or symptoms of the virus.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said that the hotel facilities are comfortable and they are being served Chinese food on metal trays.</p>
              <p>But there is no Internet connection and their only form of contact is via their mobile phones.</p>
              <p>"The four of us, who can understand Mandarin, we switch on the TV
              and try to watch some Chinese TV programme, the rest are basically
              bumming around. A Chinese official just came by and he wanted to move
              us to a new hotel, but over the past few days, they keep feeding us
              with the wrong information, either that or they don't give us any
              information. So all of us didn't want to move away from this hotel."</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said that they have contacted their local tour agency and the Singapore embassy.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told 938LIVE that they have been in
              touch with the Singaporeans, and have been rendering the necessary
              consular assistance.</p>
              <p>The group's original plan was to be back in Singapore next
              Wednesday, but Mr Lim says, they have no idea where they will be headed
              when they are allowed to leave.</p>
              <p>"Actually within this tour group, different people have different
              plans. Some people just want to go into China, some people want to fly
              back from Lhasa to Kathmandu. We are fine, because I think, even after
              7 days, we have enough time to go back to Kathmandu to catch our flight
              back to Singapore".</p>

              <p><strong>Four S'poreans among tourists freed in Tibet after H1N1 flu ruled out</strong></p>
              <p><span>BEIJING - Over 20 foreign tourists including four Singaporeans -
              held in Tibet over fears an Italian woman with them had Influenza A
              (H1N1) - were freed after tests showed she was suffering from common
              influenza, Chinese officials said. </span></p>
              <p><span>The 42-year-old Italian was quarantined in a hospital in Zhangmu
              town, near the border with Nepal, after crossing the border into China
              on Saturday with 23 other members of her tour group while suffering
              from a fever.
              <br> <br>"A(H1N1) flu was excluded for the Italian tourist on the morning of
              May 20, she was diagnosed with seasonal flu, and the 23 other tourists
              have been released from quarantine," the health ministry said in a
              statement.
              <br> <br>Members of the tour group were held for four days in a hotel in
              Zhangmu, delaying their trip, but they said they would still push on to
              Lhasa, the capital of Tibet and their destination. </span></p>
              <p><span>"I have never appreciated my freedom more," Virginie De Araujo, part of the tour, told AFP.
              <br> <br> "But we are still having to wait for an official ceremony when we would just like to continue our trip."
              <br> <br> Anna Husarska, another traveller, said they still did not know if the
              Italian tourist had been released from hospital, and the health
              ministry made no mention in its statement of whether she had been let
              out.
              <br> <br>More than 9,800 H1N1 flu cases have been confirmed in 40 countries
              and 79 people have died, according to the World Health Organization.
              China has reported four confirmed cases, but none of them has been
              fatal.

              <p>Japan's confirmed H1N1 flu tally has risen to nearly 230, according to officials quoted by AFA news agency.</p>
              <p>Most of the cases have been reported in Osaka and Hyogo prefectures.</p>
              <p>The western commercial hub of Kobe in Hyogo remains the worst affected.</p>
              <p>Among more than 30 new cases confirmed this morning, over 20 were reported in Kobe city.</p>
              <p>But there's now one confirmed case outside Osaka and Hyogo.</p>
              <p>Japanese authorities say a 23-year-old man from nearby Shiga
              Prefecture who visited Kobe city from Friday to Sunday, contracted the
              H1N1 virus.</p>
              <p>They say he presented symptoms such as a fever and cough on Sunday evening, but he's recovering.</p>
              <p>More than 4,400 schools, colleges and kindergartens in Osaka and
              Hyogo have been closed for the rest of the week to slow the spread of
              the virus.</p>
              <p>Some neighbouring prefectures have also closed some schools.</p>
              <p>The Japanese government has urged calm and reminded people that no
              one in the country has so far died of the disease and that most
              infections are mild.</p>

              <p>Officials say the country's confirmed cases have toped 250.</p>
              <p>The girl, who lives in the western suburb of Hachioji, returned home

              <p>Tokyo has almost 36 million people and is the world's most populous urban area.</p>
              <p>Experts had predicted it was only a matter of time before the flu hit the capital area.<br> <br> Authorities have closed more than 4,400 schools, colleges and
              kindergartens for the rest of the week to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
              <p>The government has urged calm, reminding people that no one in Japan
              has so far died of the disease and that most infections are mild.</p>

              <p>The World Health Organisation has reported that the number of H1N1 flu cases has surpassed the 11,000 mark.</p>
              <p>In its latest update, the WHO said there has been a rise of almost 800 in H1N1 flu infections and five new deaths.</p>
              <p>The majority of the new cases recognised by the global body come from the four countries worst hit by the virus.</p>
              <p>They are Mexico, the United States, Canada and Japan.</p>
              <p>41 countries now have confirmed H1N1 flu cases.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,</p>
              <p>WHO chief Margaret Chan has listed criteria that might prompt her to
              declare a flu pandemic, including the spread of H1N1 flu in the
              southern hemisphere.</p>
              <p>Ms Chan said she would not hesitate to move to the top phase six of the pandemic alert system if it was appropriate.</p>
              <p>But during a committee meeting of the WHO's annual assembly she also
              gave member states several key reasons why there was no reason to do so
              at the moment with the flu outbreak.</p>
              <p>She said one of the things we're not seeing is the same spread in
              the southern hemisphere that had been seen in the first three countries.</p>
              <p>The southern hemisphere is currently entering its standard influenza
              season, and health experts fear that the new H1N1 virus could mix with
              seasonal strains.</p>
              <p>Ms Chan also pointed to the relative lack of severity of the virus,
              which so far has only matched seasonal flu in terms of its symptoms
              according to experts.</p>

              <p>MANILA, Philippines – The condition of the 10-year-old Filipino girl
              who was found positive for Influenza A(H1N1) – the country’s first case
              of the dreaded disease — is improving, an official of the Department of
              Health (DOH) said today.</p>

              <p>The girl arrived in the country last May
              18, and eventually developed fever, cough and sore throat the next day.
              She is reportedly currently confined in an “undisclosed health

              <p>World Health Organisation chief Margaret Chan has issued a warning
              that countries should be ready for more serious H1N1 flu infections and
              more deaths from the newly discovered virus.</p>
              <p>However, she added WHO does not expect a dramatic jump in severe illness and deaths.</p>
              <p>According to the WHO's latest tally, the strain has infected more than 11,000 people in 42 countries.</p>
              <p>86 people have died of the virus.</p>
              <p>In her closing remarks to the WHO's annual congress in Geneva, Dr
              Chan said countries in the developing world need to act quickly to
              improve their monitoring for the virus.</p>
              <p>The virus has so far caused mainly mild symptoms in most patients so far but could cause more serious effects as it spreads.</p>
              <p>Dr Chan stressed that in terms of preparedness, there is little real
              difference between the WHO's current pandemic alert level of 5 and the
              highest of 6.</p>
              <p>She added she would consult experts before opting to raise the level again.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed its first case of Influenza A (H1N1). <br><br>The patient is currently being treated at the Communicable Disease Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and is in stable condition. <br><br>The patient is a 22-year-old Singaporean woman who was in New York from May 14-24. She arrived back in Singapore from New York on SQ25 on 26 May at 6.30am. She was seated at Row 55. <br><br>She began to develop a cough while onboard. She passed the thermal scanner uneventfully as she did not have fever then. <br><br>Later in the morning, she consulted a GP who decided to send her to TTSH via a 993 ambulance, given her travel history. <br><br>She was immediately admitted for testing. Laboratory confirmation of her infection was made by midnight of 26 May. <br><br>The patient has been vigilant in monitoring her own condition and had sought immediate medical attention once she realized that she was unwell. <br><br>Her attending GP, through his quick response in activating the 993 ambulance for the patient, had also helped to minimize the spread of infection from this case. <br><br>The Health Ministry says it has initiated contact tracing of her close contacts. They will be quarantined and provided with antiviral prophylaxis. <br><br>Passengers who had travelled in the same flight and were seated in rows 52 to 58 are urged to call the hotline at 1800-333 9999 to enable the MOH to check on their health condition. <br><br>The MOH adds that all medical practitioners and healthcare institutions should continue to be vigilant to suspect cases. <br><br>Singapore will continue with temperature screening for passengers entering Singapore at all checkpoints (land, sea and air). <br><br>All passengers passing through or entering Singapore are given Health Alert Notices on board their flights, advising them to monitor their own health if they have been to affected areas and to seek medical attention immediately if they are not well. <br><br>Singaporeans are reminded to maintain high standards of personal hygiene. This means covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough, and washing your hand frequently with soap and water, especially after contact with respiratory secretions, for example, after sneezing and coughing. <br><br>Everyone also needs to be socially responsible. This means staying home and avoiding crowded places (including trains, buses, offices), putting on a surgical mask and seeing a doctor if you have flu symptoms. <br><br>MOH advises those who travelled to affected areas to closely monitor their health and seek treatment as soon as possible should they develop symptoms. <br><br>Members of the public are also advised to exercise caution over travel to affected areas. <br><br>In the event that travel is unavoidable, the public is advised to take precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded areas and maintaining high standards of personal hygiene at all times. <br><br>However, if you are unwell with fever and cough but have no travel history to affected areas, you are also advised to see a doctor and stay at home. <br><br>MOH is monitoring the situation closely and will update the public should there be any new developments. <br><br>For more information on Influenza A (H1N1-2009), you can access MOH's website at www.moh.gov.sg, call MOH's hotline at 1800-333 9999, or visit www.flu.gov.sg. <br><br>- CNA/ir</span></p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">No need to panic with first H1N1 case: Khaw</span></strong></p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan says the public should not panic after finding out about Singapore's first confirmed H1N1 case.</p>
              <p>In addition, he said there was no need to raise the current alert
              level from Yellow to Orange, as the virus continues to be mild.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw was speaking to reporters at Parliament House earlier this afternoon.</p>
              <p><em>Joanne Chan</em> reports.</p>
              <p>Singapore's first H1N1 case is a third year Business Management student from the Singapore Management University.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old was in New York with 19 other students and a faculty member for a school study trip.</p>
              <p>On route home from New York to Singapore, the undergraduate
              developed a cough but no fever, and thus, passed through the thermal
              scanners at Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Later that morning, she consulted a GP who decided to send her to Tan Tock Seng Hospital via a 993 ambulance.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr Khaw provided an update on the students.</p>
              <p>"Coming back was herself, another classmate, and the professor, so
              three of them. Of course all three of them are now either in hospitals
              or being quarantined. The other 18 or so students are still in New
              York, so through SMU we are contacting them and give them the proper
              advisory which is to look after yourself and if you are unwell, don't
              board the plane and when you come back, similar advisory as well. "</p>
              <p>In a statement, SMU said the faculty member and other student are both fine.</p>
              <p>They are currently on home quarantine for a week and will monitor their health and conduct temperature checks twice a day.</p>
              <p>The patient's maid was issued a home quarantine order, and is currently at Aloha Chalet.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw said the patient's family members are currently away and were not affected.</p>
              <p>But the patient's boyfriend has also been warded at the Communicable Disease Centre as he picked her up at the airport.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw said the likelihood of the virus spreading in the community
              is small, as the patient didn't come into much contact with the public.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the ministry is trying to contact the passengers who were sitting near the patient onboard SQ 25.</p>
              <p>It's tracing about 60 passengers sitting three rows in front and behind the affected student.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw said those who landed in Singapore will be issued a home quarantine order.</p>
              <p>For passengers who were in transit, the relevant airports will be alerted.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw added that there's no cause for alarm as Singapore has had time to prepare for this eventuality.</p>
              <p>"We've been lucky in having these 5 weeks of no cases and the 5
              weeks have been very useful. Because from public health point of view,
              to help us to gear up our systems. It certainly help those GPs who
              forgot to stock up their N95s. And more importantly, prepare the ground
              so I don't think Singaporeans should be alarmed or panicked now that we
              have the first case because I've been warning of this for some weeks
              now."</p>

              <p>After throwing trillions $ to salvage the US economy, the last thing Obama needs is a flu bug. If America shut down, all his effort will be wasted. That's what I think.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
