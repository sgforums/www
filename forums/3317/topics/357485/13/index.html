              <p><strong>Worst of first H1N1 wave in S'pore could be over</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore may be past the worst of its first H1N1 wave. 
              <br> <br> According to head of the Communicable Diseases Centre at Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital (TTSH), Dr Leo Yee Sin, it appears “to be (on) a downward
              trend”.
              <br> <br>This seems to reaffirm Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan’s outlook in
              late July that H1N1 infections here would peak over the subsequent two
              weeks before starting to decline. <br> <br> But Dr Leo added: “I think we need to wait one or two more weeks for things to become clearer.”
              <br> <br> Speaking on Friday at the 43rd Singapore-Malaysia Congress of Medicine,
              she pointed out that Singapore’s experience with H1N1 has been the
              “mirror image” of the experience of the United States.
              <br> <br>That being so, the good news is this virus could, in fact, be “a
              milder one” than the seasonal flu bug. There are fewer H1N1- related
              deaths in the US, than deaths from the normal flu.
              <br> <br>At TTSH, while there was an increase in patients with pneumonia
              admitted during the earlier surge in H1N1 cases, there was no increase
              in pneumonia deaths due specifically to H1N1, said Dr Leo.
              <br> <br> Still, she cautioned: “We’re possibly still in the middle of the H1N1 pandemic. There is a lot to learn and watch closely.”
              <br> <br>On influenza in general, speakers at the congress touched on the
              disease’s impact on, among other things, the economy and employers. And
              in Dr Leo’s view, flu “treatments and vaccines are grossly
              underutilised in our population”.
              <br> <br>When TTSH started testing patients with flu-like illnesses — before
              Singapore had its first H1N1 case — only six per cent had a history of
              flu vaccinations.
              <br> <br>She also called for more structured programmes to monitor and
              manage flu. “With our biomedical research capability, we can be a
              leading centre for influenza research in the tropics.”

              <p><strong>MOH says Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 patient is an isolated case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry (MOH) said the case of a Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 patient is an isolated case. 
              <br> <br> The ministry was responding on Friday to comments made by a World
              Health Organisation (WHO) scientist about a Tamiflu-resistant case in
              Singapore.
              <br> <br> MOH said the patient had fallen sick towards the end of May and was admitted to hospital for isolation and treatment. 
              <br> <br>The patient was treated with Tamiflu and the resistant strain of
              the virus emerged during treatment and was detected through laboratory
              testing, by which point the patient had already improved clinically.
              <br> <br>The ministry said patients can recover from their illness even if
              they are infected with a Tamiflu-resistant influenza strain. This is
              because the immune system plays an important part in clearing the body
              of the virus. <br> <br> So far, no other cases of antiviral resistance have been detected, but
              the ministry said it would continue to conduct surveillance.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: An 80-year-old man is Singapore's latest H1N1-related victim – the 11th in the country.
              <br> <br> The patient was sent to National University Hospital (NUH) on August 6
              with a week's history of fever and cough, and sudden onset of

              <br> <br> The Health Ministry (MOH) said the number of patients seeking help at polyclinics for acute respiratory infection has decreased.
              <br> <br>The ministry, which tracks the cases on a weekly basis, noted that
              the number of cases dropped from some 24,477 in the week starting from
              July 26 to 20,435 during the week starting from August 2.
              <br> <br>It added that data from the influenza biosurveillance programme
              showed that the proportion of H1N1 cases detected among patients with
              influenza-like illness seen at polyclinics, GP clinics and hospitals in

              <p>The World Health Organisation or WHO has warned of possible shortages of H1N1 vaccines.</p>
              <p>The UN agency says that as the cold season approaches in the
              northern hemisphere, countries there have ordered more than one billion
              doses of H1N1 vaccines so far.</p>
              <p>This intense demand coupled with production delays could create shortages.</p>
              <p>Experts say this could force governments that are preparing for a
              second, possibly more deadly, wave of flu to make hard choices about
              who to vaccinate first.</p>
              <p>Clinical tests have not yet confirmed whether new H1N1 flu strains under development will produce higher yields.</p>
              <p>But the WHO says its reviews show that initial results are not encouraging.</p>
              <p>There also remains a big question mark on whether one or two doses will be needed for effective vaccination.</p>
              <p>US health officials say they expect a large shortfall in H1N1 vaccines.</p>
              <p>Only 45 million doses are expected to be ready in time for the start of a vaccination programme in mid-October.</p>
              <p>This is sharply down from the previous estimate of 120 million doses.</p>
              <p>Virtually all international and national health authorities agree
              that health sector professionals should be vaccinated first, but beyond
              that, there are no universal guidelines.</p>

              <p><strong>WHO predicts 'explosion' of swine flu cases</strong></p>
              <p class="first">BEIJING - The global spread of swine flu will endanger
              more lives as it speeds up in the coming months and governments must
              boost preparations for a swift response to a coming "explosion" of
              cases, the World Health Organization said Friday.</p>
              <p>Many countries could see swine flu cases double every three to four
              days for several months until peak transmission is reached, once cold
              weather returns to the northern hemisphere, said WHO's Western Pacific
              director, Shin Young-soo.</p>
              <p>"At a certain point, there will seem to be an explosion in case
              numbers," Shin told a symposium of health officials and experts in
              Beijing. "It is certain there will be more cases and more deaths."</p>
              <p>The WHO says the swine flu virus _ also known as H1N1 _ has killed almost 1,800 people worldwide, and has declared a pandemic.</p>
              <p>International
              attention has focused on how the pandemic is progressing in southern
              hemisphere countries such as Australia where winter _ and the flu
              season _ has started.</p>
              <p>But it is in developing countries that the
              accelerated spread of swine flu poses the greatest threat as it places
              underequipped and underfunded health systems under severe strain, Shin
              said.</p>
              <p>WHO earlier estimated that as many as 2 billion people
              could become infected over the next two years _ nearly one-third of the
              world's population.</p>
              <p>Others said Shin's cautionary comments were needed but that they were optimistic the spread would not be that serious.</p>
              <p>Ann
              Moen, an influenza expert with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
              Prevention, said that if current trends continue it is possible that
              the swine flu pandemic will not be worse than a severe flu season.</p>
              <p>"I
              think the world was preparing for an H5N1 (bird flu) pandemic and we
              didn't get that. So maybe this is our supreme tabletop exercise, a
              global sort of practice for something bigger," Moen told The Associated
              Press.</p>
              <p>Health officials and drug makers are considering how to
              speed up production of a vaccine before the northern hemisphere enters
              its flu season in coming months. Estimates for when a vaccine will be
              available range from September to December.</p>
              <p>Delegates from
              Bangladesh and Myanmar appealed for help in procuring vaccines or
              making them more affordable for poorer countries, saying they were left
              vulnerable while rich nations pre-ordered most of the available stock.</p>
              <p>"Developing
              countries like us, we have to fight this war without vaccines," said
              Mya Oo, deputy health minister of Myanmar. He urged pharmaceutical
              companies to consider selling the vaccines to developing countries at
              just above cost.</p>
              <p>WHO's flu chief, Keiji Fukuda, said the agency
              was working hard on the issue, and noted that two drugmakers had
              pledged to donate 150 million doses of vaccine to poorer countries by
              the end of October. He said more research was needed to determine how
              vaccines will be priced.</p>
              <p>"Among the many pandemic response
              issues, this is probably the most critical issue: how we mobilize the
              vaccines, how we get them to developing countries," Fukuda said.</p>
              <p>WHO
              has stressed that most cases of swine flu are mild and require no
              treatment, but the fear is that a rash of new infections could
              overwhelm hospitals and health authorities, especially in poorer
              countries.</p>
              <p>Shin said governments must quickly educate the public,
              prepare their health systems to care for severe cases and protect those
              deemed more vulnerable to prevent unnecessary deaths.</p>
              <p>"We only
              have a short time period to reach the state of preparedness deemed
              necessary," Shin said. "Communities must be aware before a pandemic
              strikes as to what they can do to reduce the spread of the virus, and
              how to obtain early treatment of severe cases."</p>
              <p>Pregnant women
              face a higher risk of complications, and the virus also has more severe
              effects on people with underlying medical conditions such as asthma,
              cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and diabetes,
              WHO chief Margaret Chan said in a video address.</p>
              <p>The last
              pandemic _ the Hong Kong flu of 1968 _ killed about 1 million people.
              Ordinary flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people each year.</p>
              <p>Swine
              flu is also continuing to spread during summer in the northern
              hemisphere. Normally, flu viruses disappear with warm weather, but
              swine flu is proving to be resilient.</p>

              <p>At least 2,185 people have died in the H1N1 flu pandemic since the new virus was uncovered in April.</p>
              <p>The World Health Organisation said the latest toll posted on the its

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">H1N1 virus now most prevalent strain of flu: WHO</span></strong></p>
              <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that Influenza A H1N1 has
              overtaken other viruses to become the most prevalent flu strain in most
              parts of the world.</p>
              <p>In a statement, the organisation warned that "the pandemic will
              persist in the coming months as the virus continues to move through
              susceptible populations".</p>
              <p>The WHO also pointed out that, unlike seasonal flu, most of those who die from H1N1 are under the age of 50.</p>
              <p>Analysts are surprised that the WHO has declared the H1N1 virus a dominant strain "so soon."</p>
              <p>Nigel Dimmock, a professor at the University of Warwick's biological
              sciences department, says this development could have implications on
              vaccines.</p>
              <p>He noted that if H1N1 has replaced other flu strains, old vaccines will be unnecessary.</p>
              <p>But if they continue to co-circulate, even if it is dominant, both old and new vaccines will be needed.</p>
              <p>The WHO says nearly 2,200 people around the world have died from the virus since it was uncovered in April.</p>
              <p>Some tropical countries are already reporting "moderate strains" on their healthcare systems amid surges in infections.</p>
              <p>In Japan, WHO says H1N1 flu has become an epidemic, signalling that the annual flu season could be a long one.</p>
              <p>It also appears to suggest that the disease spread is worsening in tropical regions.</p>
              <p>There's some good news though, as the WHO says that H1N1 circulation
              may have passed its peak in much of the southern hemisphere.</p>

              <p><strong>H1N1 virus tapering off but doctors still advise vigilance</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: With the latest figures showing a decrease in the
              proportion of patients at polyclinics, GP clinics and hospitals
              detected with the H1N1 virus, to 42% from about 50% previously, the
              H1N1 virus infection seems to be tapering off. </span></p>
              <p><span> But doctors caution the need to remain vigilant as the virus is still killing people. </span></p>
              <p><span> Two more H1N1-related deaths have been reported - bringing the virus' death toll to 15 in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span> The latest victims of H1N1 infections are a 53-year-old man, who died
              on Saturday, 29 August and a 70-year-old woman, who died on Sunday, 30
              August - both of whom had underlying medical conditions including
              diabetes and high blood pressure. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Singapore Medical Association, which represents a majority of
              medical practitioners in both the private and public sector, says that
              going forward, the challenge for its members remains identifying
              patients whose condition will become worse, so they can be treated
              earlier. </span></p>
              <p><span> "Most of the cases so far are mild as you know but there are some cases
              that have turned bad and who need to be hospitalised and who need to be
              in intensive care," said Dr Chong Yeh Woei, president of Singapore
              Medical Association. </span></p>
              <p><span> Drug companies say a vaccine should be available by October. </span></p>
              <p><span> "The paramount thing that we want to be sure about is the safety and
              the other thing is that if we have decided that it's safe, then who
              will get it first. I believe the thinking now is that the children will
              be the first to benefit from the vaccine if it's found to be safe," he
              added. </span></p>
              <p><span> So far there have been no reports of the virus mutating to a more virulent form, although it has been found in birds recently. </span></p>
              <p><span> But whether mutation of the virus may render the vaccine ineffective, remains uncertain. </span></p>
              <p><span> With community transmission happening for some time, experts say that
              there should already be some kind of herd immunity among the people.
              But despite that, the Ministry of Health says that it will order enough
              vaccine for the entire population. </span></p>
              <p><span> Dr Chong expressed another concern - fatigue among the doctors and
              nurses in dealing with the virus, especially with reports that a second
              wave of infections would happen soon. </span></p>
              <p><span> "Going ahead, it's been quite some time since the pandemic has started
              and we are concerned about fatigue that has set in and the stress level
              that has gone up, having to be in full PPE and having to deal with the
              pandemic. We learnt this lesson from SARS. We remembered that we were
              very stressed, in particular during SARS and only when we stood down,
              the stress hit all of us and we felt the post-traumatic stress; and
              that is one of the challenges going ahead. So we are very very
              concerned for our members and their staff," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Ministry of Health is monitoring the flu situation in Singapore,
              under the influenza biosurveillance programme, to identify the strains
              of flu virus circulating in the community. Latest data shows that the
              proportion of Influenza A (H1N1-2009) detected among patients with
              influenza-like illness seen at polyclinics, GP clinics and hospitals,
              in E-week 33 (16 - 22 August), is 42%. </span></p>

              <p>i briefly scanned thru the age group of H1N1 fatal victims in Singapore realized most of them are 40 yr and above. This is rather different from that of the US. <br>As in the US there are more children get fatal victim.</p>
              <p> I wonder is it because in the states older folks take flu shot while in Singapore it is not commonly practice.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">H1N1 detected in live pigs imported into Singapore: AVA</span></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority or AVA has detected
              the pandemic A - H1N1 Virus, in some of the pigs imported into
              Singapore from Indonesia's Pulau Bulan.</p>
              <p>But the AVA stresses that the pork available here is safe for consumption.</p>
              <p>That's because the H1N1 virus is NOT transmitted through the
              handling and consumption of pork and pork products including ham,
              bacon, sausages and canned pork.</p>
              <p>AVA's Director General Dr Chew Siang Thai gave this assurance.</p>
              <p>"There's no need to worry about H1N1 being transmitted to pork, in
              fact we're only ensuring clinically healthy animals are slaughtered, so
              clinically healthy animals will not have H1N1 in the meat."</p>
              <p>AVA added it will step up its monitoring and inspection to ensure food safety.</p>
              <p>It said it will take part in a comprehensive disease surveillance programme on the Pulau Bulan farm.</p>
              <p>This would be led by the Indonesian authority.</p>
              <p>The aim is to identify and isolate affected pig houses.</p>
              <p>Restricted animal movement will be imposed to ensure only healthy pigs are exported to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Dr Chew again.</p>
              <p>"It's not only just to see the general condition of the pigs but
              also to check especially the house that's going to export pigs to us,
              we will have to take samples and also check, and these samples will be
              tested in our labs. Confirmed that it's free (from H1N1), then we'll
              allow it to come in."</p>
              <p>AVA added Singapore has adequate sources of pork supplies from 25 countries.</p>
              <p>Singapore's import of 1000 pigs daily from Pulau Bulan constitutes some 20 per cent of the total pork consumption here.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE is finalising a deal to obtain vaccines against the H1N1
              virus causing the current pandemic. Details will be out later this
              week, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan told Parliament on Monday.</p>
              <p>Vaccines are 'the most important measure' to cut deaths from H1N1,
              he said in reply to Ang Mo Kio GRC MP, Dr Lam Pin Min, who asked for an
              update on the situation here.</p>
              <p>Once a safe vaccine is available, it will be made 'widely
              available' to people. The ministry will recommend it first to front
              line staff and people at high risk of developing complications from the
              flu.</p>
              <p>So far, 18 people have died from this new strain of flu, including some with no underlying medical problems.</p>
              <p>'This continues to baffle the doctors and scientists and we do not
              have good answers as yet,' said Mr Khaw. 'This is why the country is
              still in alert code yellow, and not back to green, which signals that
              things are back to normal.'</p>
              <p>Madam Halimah Yacob, MP for Jurong GRC, asked if the coming northern winter is cause for greater concern.</p>
              <p>Replying, Mr Khaw said the fear is if that the virus mutates to a
              more dangerous form, but close monitoring has not shown such a change.</p>
              <p>In fact, illness from the new H1N1 is falling. From a high of about
              40 per cent of all flu-like illness, it now accounts for single-digit
              percentage in Canada and is in the teens in the United States.</p>
