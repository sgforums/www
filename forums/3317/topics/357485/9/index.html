              <p>Nanyang Polytechnic has confirmed its first case of H1N1 patient.</p>
              <p>She is a year one student who contracted the flu outside campus from her boyfriend who works at the nightspot, Butter Factory.</p>
              <p>She was in contact with nine other students.</p>
              <p>The polytechnic says to date, all are reported to be well.</p>
              <p>They've been instructed to take a Leave of Absence from campus.</p>
              <p>The infected student meanwhile was discharged from the Communicable
              Disease Centre yesterday and will be on home quarantine until next
              Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Nanyang Polytechnic had earlier planned for students to attend online lessons when the new term starts next Monday.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson said the decision then was a precautionary measure and not a direct response to any confirmed cases.</p>

              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Obviously the escalating number of H1N1 cases are barely scratching the thick "membrane" surrounding MOH's conscience. In my tuition centre (The Learning Lab locating in United Square) there has been a case of H1N1 infection WITHOUT any of the symptoms which are supposed to be observed preceding a case. The student had not even been overseas. And our dear Minister of Health Khaw Boon Wan happily sends the average student like me back to school, which is a highly-populated environment; a hotbed for the virus to spread.Â </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The blistering fact that the H1N1 virus can no longer be detected by a fever and therefore is, ipso facto, undetectable beforehand by the "two temperature checks a day" guidelines laid forth for schools.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I'm sure you, assumably a grown adult with a certain amount of life experience, will snobbishly dismiss this as an elaborate ploy to escape schooling. However, contrary to that, this is meant as a genuine expression of concern for the welfare of the student community with H1N1 lurching and threatening to break out in full scale.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I sincerely hope you understand and feel sympathy for the plight of us students, the future of this nation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">As for the reply on my thread which was closed, adults are the backbone of the economy and they have to work. Students however, can still learn by online means on their respective school websites and play no such integral part in the economy at the moment.</p>

              <p>i think the public has been misinformed right from day 1. bcos of the SARs experience, everyone is panicking like a mofo. this virus is here to stay regardless. but if you actually do your research, it is just like a normal flu, with a mortality rate lower than the normal flu. no practical reason for schools to close down. the only reason why its closing down is because to mitigate the kpkb of gancheong spiders parents.</p>
              <p>they are the one who created this whole panicky situation, now they trying to tell us to continue living normal lives. haha bcos they know this flu is gonna spread like normal flu and if everyone panics as if it is SARs spreading around, economy will shut down big time.</p>

              <p><strong>H1N1 cases rise to 701 in Singapore </strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore has confirmed 72 new H1N1 flu cases, bringing the tally to 701 so far.
              <br> <br> The Health Ministry says most cases are mild and to date, 281 patients have fully recovered and the rest are recuperating. 
              <br> <br> Singaporeans should carry on with their usual activities whilst
              observing good personal hygiene at all times. If unwell, they should
              see a doctor, stay away from work, school or crowded places, and rest
              at home. <br> <br> Investigations are on-going for the 72 new cases. Of the 64 cases
              investigated on Tuesday, there were 42 local cases and 22 imported
              ones.
              <br> <br>Of the latest cases investigated, the largest number of new cases
              were linked to the Republic Polytechnic, bringing the total number of
              cases there to 77.
              <br> <br>Over 1,900 second- and third-year students have signed an online
              petition calling on the polytechnic to suspend classes, not just for
              first-year students but for them as well.
              <br> <br>The polytechnic said it understands the students' concerns and has
              also received feedback from them through internal channels although it
              has not received any petition formally.
              <br> <br>The school added that it is monitoring the situation closely and is
              prepared to take additional measures if required to safeguard the
              well-being of staff and students.
              <br> <br>Another three new H1N1 cases were found linked to an orientation
              camp at the National University of Singapore, bringing the number of
              cases in that cluster to seven.
              <br> <br>Clementi Camp had two new cases raising the total there to 55,
              while there was one new case each from the Raffles Institution Boarding
              School, Butter Factory, Maju Camp and Pulau Tekong Camp clusters.

              <p>I'm sorry if some of you guys misunderstand me.. I don't think I would disregard the risk of this virus and I know it is highly infectious.. But really, do people need to panic as such? I'm just tickled as to see why people are gancheonging as though its T-Virus spreading.. Perhaps it is highly infectious, sure, but to close down schools for another week and for some people in the public to gancheong so much is really a bit too drama mama.. If everyone just practise personal hygiene then, there should not be any problem really.. even if they shut down schools, not as though the kids will quarantine themselves at home.. That was my main point lah that I think some people in the public are just over-dramatizing and exagerrating the extent of this virus.. Its alright if you disagree, I welcome any points..</p>
