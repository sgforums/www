              <p>well if it is effective than its fine but i am not sure is going to be effective since its already in part of asia and Europe.</p>
              <p>What is interesting is that this modern time we can actually map the spread and the timeline from both Sars and H1N1.  Contrast of earlier reporting certainly help to slow down and a big ocean divide certainly help.</p>

              <p>The World Health Organisation will consult scientists over the
              coming weeks to clear up the criteria needed to declare a pandemic with
              the new H1N1 flu virus.</p>
              <p>The move follows appeals by several countries last week for more
              caution before moving up a step from the current phase five alert to
              declaring a pandemic.</p>
              <p>Under the current rulebook, phase six would involve a purely
              geographical step with sustained community spread in at least two
              regions.</p>
              <p>But officials said last week they are also taking into account issues such as the severity of the virus.</p>
              <p>Most of the cases of the flu have been relatively mild.</p>
              <p>The virus has so far infected some 13 thousand people in at least 48 countries, causing 95 deaths.</p>
              <p>What about the spread of the virus in the Asia Pacific region?</p>
              <p>938LIVE asks this question to Peter Cordingley, Public Information

              <p><strong>71 close contacts on same flight as Singapore's 1st H1N1 confirmed case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health has identified 71 close
              contacts among the passengers on the same flight as the country's first
              confirmed H1N1 patient.
              <br> <br> Flight SQ25 was flying from New York to Singapore via Frankfurt. Twenty-three passengers disembarked at Frankfurt.   
              <br> <br>Of the remaining 48 passengers, eight Singaporeans and 14
              foreigners are in Singapore and will be quarantined at home and given
              anti-viral drugs.
              <br> <br>Another 23 passengers who were foreigners were apparently on
              transit at Changi Airport as there were no records of them entering
              Singapore. Another three entered Singapore, but have left for Malaysia.
              <br> <br> Singapore authorities have informed the World Health Organisation of the situation.
              <br> <br> Singapore's first confirmed case was on a study trip to New York as a student of the Singapore Management University. 
              <br> <br> A student and a lecturer who came back with her had also turned up at
              Tan Tock Seng hospital because of non-specific symptoms. The remaining
              18 students on the same study trip are still in North America.
              <br> <br>The boyfriend and maid of the confirmed case have been identified
              as close contacts. Her boyfriend has been warded at Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital because of non-specific symptoms. He will be quarantined upon
              discharge. Her maid has already been sent to a quarantine centre.
              <br> <br>The patient's seven family members have not been quarantined
              because they are either overseas or have not been in sustained contact
              with her. <br> <br> Hospital and ambulance staff who served the case will also not be
              quarantined because they were in full protective gear when managing the
              case.
              <br> <br>This applies to the doctor and the staff who treated her at a
              clinic as well. The doctor was in full protective gear and the clinic
              staff who served her had only brief contact with her.
              <br> <br>Other staff members were sitting more than two metres away. There
              was one other patient in the clinic, but was seated more than two
              metres away from the patient. <br> <br> Singapore's immigration authorities are now on the look out for all other close contacts who are currently not in Singapore.
              <br> <br> In the event they enter Singapore before the end of the quarantine
              period on June 2, they will be quarantined for the remaining period. <br> <br> Authorities will also keep tabs on those who are serving their
              quarantine orders in case they leave Singapore during that period. </span></p>

              <p>The patients are currently being treated at the Communicable Disease Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</p>
              <p>In a statement, the Health Ministry said their symptoms are relatively mild and all the patients are in stable condition.</p>
              <p>Contact tracing of their close contacts, including passengers on the same flights, is ongoing.</p>
              <p>They will be quarantined and provided with antiviral prophylaxis.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry says that passengers within three rows in front
              and behind the cases who have not been contacted by MOH yet should call
              the MOH hotline at 1800-333 9999.</p>
              <p>The affected rows for SQ 917 are 30-36 ; for UA 803, the affected rows are 30-36 and for UA 895, the affected rows are 52-58.<br> <br> The Health Ministry reminds those who have travelled in the preceding 7
              days to affected countries to seek immediate medical attention once
              they develop influenza-like symptoms.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Ministry has also reminded all medical practitioners
              and healthcare institutions to continue to be vigilant for suspect
              cases.</p>

              <p>MOH has contacted 18 of them and will place them under home quarantine.</p>
              <p>Passengers who've not yet been contacted by MOH should call the hotline at 1800-333-99-99.</p>
              <p>These are passengers travelling three rows in front of and behind the affected rows of cases.</p>
              <p>The affected rows are 30 to 36 onboard SQ 917 and UA 803, both of which arrived in Singapore on Tuesday this week.</p>
              <p>For UA 895 which arrived on Monday, the affected rows are 52 to 58.</p>
              <p>In an update on the four flu patients, MOH says the first case - a 22-year-old female SMU student is now in stable condition.</p>
              <p>Her fever has subsided and she's now into her third day of Tamiflu treatment.</p>
              <p>Her boyfriend meanwhile, has been cleared of the infection and was discharged last night and placed on home quarantine.</p>
              <p>All 71 people in close contact with her have been accounted for.</p>
              <p>25 who're in Singapore are now under home quarantine, 10 of them are Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>For the 28-year-old Singaporean male who arrived here Monday from
              Chicago via Hong Kong, it took two visits to the G-P before he was
              diagnosed to have the H1N1 flu.</p>
              <p>Feeling unwell the day he arrived, he visited a GP, but was given an MC to stay home the next day.</p>
              <p>Still feeling ill, he consulted the GP again on Wednesday and was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</p>
              <p>But apart from the two visits to the GP, MOH says he stayed at home the rest of the time.</p>
              <p>His wife is also under home quarantine and is currently well.</p>
              <p>The third case - a 28-year-old American female expatriate, was
              referred by her company doctor to TTSH on Wednesday, the day after she
              landed from Honolulu via Tokyo.</p>
              <p>She had become unwell while still onboard her United Airlines flight.</p>
              <p>Home quarantine orders have also been served on her two local close contacts - her friend and maid.</p>
              <p>As for the last case - a 43-year-old female Singapore PR who also
              arrived on Wednesday, from San Francisco via Manila, she was referred
              to TTSH by her GP the day after.</p>
              <p>Her friend and two office colleagues have been placed on home quarantine.</p>

              <br> <br>Meanwhile, Singapore's first case - the 22-year-old Singapore

              treatment at the CDC.
              <br> <br> The Health Ministry said she is well and in stable condition.
              <br> <br> As of Sunday, the Ministry has served 82 Home Quarantine Orders (HQOs) to close contacts of the five confirmed cases.
              <br> <br> 68 others who have been in close contact with the affected patients are already out of the country.
              <br> <br>The Ministry is currently tracing the contacts of the fifth case, a

              <p><strong>Khaw says communal spread of H1N1 likely to happen soon</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore has confirmed its fifth case of the Influenza A (H1N1) flu virus.
              <br> <br> The patient is a 22-year-old Singaporean woman who had travelled to the US from May 13 to 28.
              <br> <br> Some 20 contacts, including five family members and 15 flight
              passengers, have been identified for home quarantine via contact
              tracing.
              <br> <br> But the Health Ministry has so far managed to contact only four of the 15 passengers.
              <br> <br>The Ministry has alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO) on all
              the close contacts who are out of the country. In addition, all
              available information on connecting flights has been given to WHO's
              relevant authority for follow up action. Contact particulars have also
              been provided to Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to
              notify the Ministry should they turn up at the border checkpoints.
              <br> <br> Five other passengers are known to be outside Singapore.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said that while the
              H1N1 strain remains relatively mild, the communal spread of the virus
              is likely to happen soon.
              <br> <br>Expect more H1N1 cases, says Mr Khaw. It is just a matter of time
              before the communal spread of the virus will take place, as patients
              would have had contact with numerous people in the community.
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw said: "As some experts in WHO put it, one-third of mankind
              will be infected over the next two years. One-third of mankind in
              Singapore means one million people will be down with it."
              <br> <br> But authorities said this is not a numbers game and the bigger worry is if the strain becomes more virulent.
              <br> <br> H1N1 carriers without symptoms are also a worry.
              <br> <br>At the moment, Singapore scientists are keeping tabs on the virus
              to check if it evolves and mutates into something more dangerous.
              <br> <br> Another concern is the availability of hospital beds.
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw said: "If every H1N1 patient is to be hospitalised as a
              rule when it is not necessary, then you will be (taking) up a lot of
              hospital beds, when I have to look after cancer patients, heart
              patients...and so on.
              <br> <br>"At the moment, when the numbers are small we can afford to go all
              out and hunt every contact, but it is a matter of time when there are
              many more cases, then we no longer can play this, the way we have been
              doing the last few days.
              <br> <br>"So, the important part of health care becomes looking for people
              who are high risk - pregnant, those who have asthma and other
              illnesses."
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw added that the alert level will not be raised to Orange
              based on the number of cases alone, but on factors such as changes to
              the virulence and evolution of the virus.
              <br> <br>As of Sunday, the Ministry has served 82 Home Quarantine Orders
              (HQOs) to close contacts of the five confirmed cases. 68 others who
              have been in close contact with the affected patients are already out
              of the country. The Ministry has also lined up other facilities for
              quarantine purposes, if needed.
              <br> <br>And as the school holidays have already started, many would be
              planning vacations overseas. Mr Khaw said Singaporeans should really
              try and avoid going to North America, if they can do so.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, all five H1N1 patients remain stable. Three have been
              discharged but the first H1N1 case is still undergoing treatment in
              hospital. </span></p>

              <div>
              <p>The Health Ministry has confirmed the sixth and seventh case of H-1-N-1 flu in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But both men suffer relatively mild symptoms and are in stable condition.</p>
              <p>M-O-H says the sixth case is a 36-year-old Singaporena male who was
              in Manila on a business trip from the 18th to the 29th of May.</p>
              <p>He arrived in Singapore last Friday on Singapore Airlines S-Q 917 at nearly 6pm.</p>
              <p>It appears that he was well during the flight and only showed symptoms in the evening, the following day.</p>
              <p>That same day, he had gone out briefly in the morning before returning home in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>The man told the Health Ministry that a passenger seated next to him
              in row 17 appeared unwell and was coughing during the flight.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry is trying to identify the ill passenger to assess his health condition.</p>
              <p>The 7th case is a 30-year-old Australian male tourist who had travelled to Chicago, Detriot and New York last month.</p>
              <p>He developed symptoms on May 26th while in New York.</p>
              <p>He arrived in Singapore early this morning via Frankfurt, on SQ 25
              in row 54, and on arrival, went straight to Raffles Medical clinic at
              the Changi Airport transit area.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the government has spelt out the roles of the new National Scientific Committee on H1N1 flu.</p>
              <p>To be chaired by Professor K Satku, Director of Medical Services at
              MOH, the committee is to study in detail the local H1N1 flu cases and
              propose treatment guidelines and control measures on how to handle the
              situation.</p>
              <p>It is also to conduct genomic analysis of the virus, compare the
              results with international data and track any changes over time.</p>
              <p>This will enable the committee to know if the virus has mutated, or
              remains mild, not unlike the seasonal flu in terms of public health
              impact.</p>
              <p>Singapore can then adapt its containment measures to focus on treatement of the at-risk groups and seriously ill cases.</p>
              <p>The 11-member committee comprises healthcare professionals from the clinical, scientific and public health areas.</p>

              <p><strong>TTSH opens up temp facility for H1N1 screening</strong></p>
              <p>Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which carries out all screenings for
              influenza A H1N1, has created a temporary facility to process all
              suspected patients.</p>
              <p>This is in anticipation of an increase in the number of H1N1 cases.</p>
              <p>The facility at the Communicable Disease Centre 2 or CDC2 was originally set up to screen Sars patients.</p>
              <p>All patients who come for screening will be separated according to their recent travel history.</p>
              <p>Those who've just returned from Canada, the United States and
              Mexico, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom, will be screened at the
              temporary facility.</p>
              <p>Those who've not been to these six countries, and have flu-like
              symptoms, will be screened at Tan Tock Seng's Emergency Department
              decontamination unit.</p>
              <p>The whole testing process at the new facility will take about 12 hours.</p>
              <p>Those who test positive will be admitted to CDC2.</p>
              <p>The building can admit up to 50 patients, but more space can be made available, if needed.</p>
