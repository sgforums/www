              <p><strong>MOH secures 1m doses of H1N1 vaccine</strong></p>
              <p>The Ministry of Health says it has secured one million doses of
              Influenza A H1N1 vaccine from British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmith
              Kline. <br> <br> They will be delivered by the end of the year. <br> <br> Part of the supply will be reserved for essential personnel such as those in the healthcare sector. <br> <br> MOH says large scale vaccination on a voluntary basis, will start once
              it's satisfied of the vaccine's safety and efficacy, currently being
              undertaken internationally. <br> <br> Costs will be comparable to a seasonal flu vaccination. <br> <br> The Ministry says the supply should meet Singapore's immediate needs. <br> <br> If demand exceeed initial supply, GPs should prioritise vaccinations to
              people who have a higher risk of developing complications from H1N1. <br> <br> MOH says it also has an existing contract with Australia's Serum Laboratories for further supplies.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore to get H1N1 vaccine</strong></p>
              <p>The Health Ministry has secured one million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine from drug maker GlaxoSmithKline. <br> <br> This is on top of its existing contract with Australian drug manufacturer Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. <br> <br> Speaking at the sidelines of the launch of HPB's mobile health
              screening programme, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan says the one million
              doses will be delivered in batches before the end of the year. <br> <br> While details as to how many doses will be sent in the first batch are
              unavailable, he says the first batch will arrive within the next few
              weeks. <br> <br> Mr Khaw elaborates.<strong> <br> <br> "I wanted some batches of vaccines which we can bring in early during
              this year so that, I think there's demand out there and of course we
              all worry about a second wave and if there's a second wave, demand
              would shoot up, so I felt safer if we supplement the ongoing contract."</strong> <br> <br> Mr Khaw adds that more than 80 per cent of the doses will be sold to General Practitioners at cost price according to demand. <br> <br> The rest, he says, will be given to essential personnel including frontline and healthcare staff. <br> <br> If there's a rush for the vaccine, Mr Khaw says GPs are advised to give
              priority to those at higher risk of developing complications from the
              virus. <br> <br> These include pregnant women and those with underlying medical conditions. <br> <br> On the cost of the H1N1 vaccine, Mr Khaw says it's comparable to that of normal seasonal flu. <br> <br> While he leaves it to the GPs to determine the pricing, Mr Khaw
              highlights that the ministry will make sure the vaccines remain
              affordable.<br> <strong> <br> "We have an interest to make sure that vaccines go to the right people
              and affordable. We are the supplier, while I do not see a need at this
              time to control retail pricing, but I've an interest to make sure
              prices are affordable so we will watch over this and in any case, we
              have our own public hospitals and polyclinics, so that will also
              provide a floor price."</strong> <br> <br> Large-scale vaccination here will be done on a voluntary basis and this
              will start once the ministry feels the vaccine is safe for use. <br> <br> Mr Khaw points out that as with all drugs, there may be side effects. <br> <br> So he says the ministry will closely monitor countries like China and
              Australia that have launched or announced plans to conduct mass
              vaccination.<br> <br> Mr Khaw also says Muslims going for the Haj pilgrimage in November and
              wish to vaccinate themselves against HIN1 may give an indication to the
              Islamic Religious Council of Singapore or MUIS.</p>

              <p><strong>Swine flu virus has not mutated: WHO chief</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>HONG KONG (AFP) - – The head of the World
              Health Organization said Monday that the swine flu virus had apparently
              not yet mutated into a more serious disease and that the development of
              vaccines was proceeding on track.</p>
              <p>The vaccines for (A)H1N1
              influenza produced so far have been very effective, WHO
              Director-General Margaret Chan said at the opening ceremony for the
              organisation's annual Western Pacific meeting in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>"The
              virus can mutate any time. But from April to now, we can see from the
              data given to us by laboratories worldwide that the virus is still very
              similar (to the previous state)," Chan told reporters.</p>
              <p>Ideally,
              three billion doses of vaccines could be produced worldwide annually,
              she added, noting that China had already begun to vaccinate people.</p>
              <p>She
              also said the Hong Kong government could relax its measures against a
              swine flu outbreak "step-by-step", advising them in the long-run to
              focus resources on saving patients and reducing the number of serious
              cases.</p>
              <p>Chan said that only high-risk patients such as the
              elderly, the obese and those with underlying illnesses would be
              severely affected by the disease.</p>
              <p>Swine flu in Hong Kong has
              raised fears of a repeat of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
              (SARS) outbreak, when almost 300 people died and concern about the
              mysterious disease turned the metropolis into a virtual ghost town.</p>
              <p>Chan managed Hong Kong's response to avian influenza and SARS during her nine-year stint as Hong Kong's director of health.</p>
              <p>Top of the agenda for the WHO's meeting this week will be how to combat the swine flu pandemic in developing nations.</p>
              <p>While
              the Americas still has the highest death toll from the virus, cases are
              expected to increase in the region as the northern hemisphere enters
              winter.</p>
              <p>There are fears that poorer countries will not get
              enough vaccines, despite a pledge last week by the United States and
              eight other nations to make 10 percent of their swine flu vaccine
              supply available to others in need.</p>
              <p>Developing countries are
              not only unable to produce the vaccine for the A(H1N1) flu virus but
              their people are more vulnerable to infection because of poverty,
              crowded living conditions and lack of healthcare, according to the WHO.</p>
              <p>In
              the Western Pacific there are about a million people living in poor
              conditions without access to healthcare, WHO regional director Shin
              Young-soo told reporters Sunday.</p>

              <p><strong>WHO warns against use of anti-viral drugs to prevent H1N1</strong></p>
              <p>The World Health Organisation has said that anti-viral drugs should not
              be used to prevent H1N1 flu, noting that  almost half of drug
              resistance cases were linked to use of the medication  before
              infection. <br> <br> The UN agency said that 12 out of 28 cases of drug resistance to Tamiflu  has been linked to preventative use. <br>  <br> Six other resistance cases occurred in patients with severe
              immunosuppression and four occurred in those who were using Tamiflu as
              a treatment. <br> <br> Overall, the number of drug-resistance cases were sporadic and  infrequent. <br>  <br> The WHO said, for people who have had exposure to an infected person
              and are at higher risk  of developing severe or complicated illness, an
              alternative option is close  monitoring for symptoms. <br> <br> This should be followed by prompt early anti-viral treatment should  symptoms develop.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The first batch of H1N1 vaccines should arrive in

              <p><span> But Mr Khaw said there is no confirmed date yet because there is strong

              <p><span> So the Ministry of Health is currently planning how to roll-out the vaccinations. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Khaw explained: "We are just gearing up the logistics because it is
              not so straightforward; when the vaccine comes, there will be a lot of

              <h1>Cuba reports swine flu deaths: 3 pregnant women</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HAVANA – Cuba has acknowledged its first deaths from swine flu,
              saying three pregnant women succumbed to the virus and many more have
              been treated for symptoms.</p>
              <p>Deputy Health Minister Jose Angel
              Portal said a total of 2,100 pregnant women were treated for symptoms
              of the disease, with 110 of them seriously ill, in comments reported by
              the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, on Saturday.</p>
              <p>He said three pregnant women died of the disease, according to Granma.</p>
              <p>The
              report does not say how many women remain hospitalized, nor make clear
              whether all of the 2,100 cases were confirmed to be H1N1.</p>
              <p>The
              communist government has said it will use everything at its disposal to
              fight swine flu _ including calling in the armed forces _ but it has
              expressed deep reservations about global plans to use a vaccine, which
              is currently being rolled.</p>
              <p>Cuban health officials have said
              that that program will be costly and could also be ineffective, since
              the virus could easily mutate and make any vaccine obsolete.</p>
              <p>The article said there are now 621 confirmed cases _ including 177 children _ in the country of more than 11 million people.</p>
              <p>Most
              of the early cases of swine flu were among visitors to the island, but
              Granma said the number of Cubans coming down with the virus was rising.</p>
              <p>Swine
              flu, first identified in April, is a global epidemic. The World Health
              Organization says there have been more than 375,000 loboratory
              confirmed cases and over 4,500 deaths linked to the illness. But many
              countries have stopped counting individual cases.</p>

              <p><strong>Researchers say H1N1 virus no different from seasonal flu</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Researchers have uncovered more insights into the behaviour of the H1N1 strain of influenza. </span></p>
              <p><span>On comparing the H1N1 strain of influenza and the seasonal flu,
              researchers said that the two flu strains affect patients with the same
              symptoms and body temperature at presentation. <br> <br> These findings, from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, are based on studies on its first 70 H1N1 patients.
              <br> <br> "One of the things we also realised is that for those individuals who
              present early, and get treatment early, they can shorten the duration
              of virals recovered from the nose and the throat," said Associate
              Professor Leo Yee Sin, clinical director, Communicable Disease Centre,
              Tan Tock Seng Hospital. <br> <br> The research team also found that some patients infected with the H1N1
              strain continue to shed the infectious virus for 10 or more days after
              the start of infection. And they said these findings imply that it
              would be difficult to implement a strict containment policy for H1N1
              patients.
              <br> <br>In response to the findings, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said its
              strategy of fighting the virus will depend on whether it stays mild or
              changes to become more virulent.
              <br> <br>The ministry also said that the proportion of patients with
              influenza-like illness infected with the H1N1 virus at polyclinics, GP
              clinics and hospitals from October 4 to 10 was 16 per cent.
              <br> <br>Professor Leo is also working with teams from Changi General
              Hospital, National University Hospital and Singapore General Hospital
              on research that could change the way doctors treat patients suffering
              from the H1N1 virus. The collective team is called the "Adult
              Infectious Diseases Network".
              <br> <br> One study will look at dosages of oseltamivir - the generic name for the drug Tamiflu.
              <br> <br>"If a higher dose of Oseltamivir can give better clinical outcome,
              then that approach will become standard of care, which we will provide
              to our patients," said Professor Leo.
              <br> <br>The study is expected to take one to two years to complete and
              researchers hope to recruit 90-120 adult patients suffering from severe
              cases of H1N1 for the study.
              <br> <br>And there is good news for those who have recovered from H1N1
              infection. Professor Leo said these patients do not need to be
              vaccinated against the virus because they would have built up a natural
              immunity to it.
              <br> <br>The Adult Infectious Diseases Network will conduct another study
              that will focus on whether platelet transfusion is necessary to treat
              dengue fever patients.
              <br> <br> Professor Leo will be presenting more of her findings at the Annual Science Congress on Friday.

              <p><strong>H1N1 flu vaccine to arrive within 3 weeks</strong></p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan says Singapore will be receiving the
              first batch of the H1N1 flu vaccine within the next three weeks. <br> <br> He expects about tens of thousands of doses to be delivered in the
              first batch and this will kick start a mass vaccination programme here.<strong> <br> <br> </strong>"For us, the main activity is to get people vaccinated as soon
              as the vaccine arrives. So we've been working out the logistics, where
              to do it. And essentially it'd be through GPs, through clinics and
              we'll get our supplies in batches." <br> <br> As for some 4,000 Muslims making the annual Muslim haj pilgrimage, Mr
              Khaw said there would be enough doses for them to be vaccinated. <br> <br> He was speaking on the sidelines of a multi-racial Deepavali floor party in Woodlands. <br> <br> Mr Khaw noted that with the availability of the H1N1 vaccine, the second wave of the flu is now less scary.<strong> <br> <br> </strong>"I think the second wave is less scary because vaccines are
              available so we will get our vaccines and if everybody gets vaccinated,
              or most people get vaccinated, and so long as the virus does not mutate
              to become deadly, then there's nothing to worry about."</p>

              <p><strong>S'pore to receive first batch of H1N1 flu vaccine in two week's time</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore will receive one million doses of the H1N1 flu vaccine before Christmas.<br> <br> And the first batch will arrive in two weeks time.<br> <br> Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan gave this update today when he spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a community event.<br> <br> He also reassured Singaporeans that the supply will satisfy Singapore's immediate needs.<br> <br> "I think one million is a lot of doses because judging from previous
              experience with seasonal flu, we've never exceeded 400,000 doses, so
              this is more than double. In any case, if there's a huge response for
              it, we can always order some more."<br> <br> Mr Khaw also urged those who want to get vaccinated before Christmas to notify their general practitioners as soon as possible.<br> <br> That's because the Health Ministry is currently asking the GPs to submit their orders for the vaccine.<br> <br> "I'll keep about 20 percent for my frontline staff, and the rest will
              be distributed to the GPs, that's why we need to get from them what are

              <p><strong>H1N1 vaccine only registered for use on those 18 and above</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The H1N1 vaccine will arrive in Singapore in about two
              weeks. But parents should take note that the drug, which is produced by
              GlaxoSmithKline, has not yet been cleared for use on those below 18
              years old. </span></p>
              <p><span>Doctors said it is best to play it safe because children are
              likely to experience different side effects from adults, due to their
              developing immune systems.
              <br> <br>Dr Terence Tan, a paediatrician, said: "Furthermore, children need
              different doses from adults. Just because you give an adult-vaccine to
              a child, accepting the side effects, you may not get the benefit you
              want because it could very well be that the child needs more, or less,
              and may not get enough protection."
              <br> <br> But the lack of a vaccine has raised concerns because children between six months and 5 years old are in the high-risk group.
              <br> <br>While parents cannot immunise their young children against the H1N1
              virus yet, what they can do is protect them against more dangerous
              complications, including bacterial pneumonia.
              <br> <br> In fact, drugs such as the pneumococcal vaccine are currently widely available for young kids.
              <br> <br>Singapore's Health Ministry has said that priority for the H1N1
              vaccine will be given to the elderly and those with chronic diseases.
              Concerns have been raised that some may not be able to afford the jab.
              <br> <br>Lam Pin Min, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for
              Health, said: "For some families from the low-income group who may have
              financial difficulty in paying for the cost of the vaccine, I believe
              the government will step in, using Medifund to pay for such cases."
              <br> <br> Each dose of the H1N1 vaccine is expected to cost between S$20 and S$40, comparable to the seasonal flu jab.

              <p>H1N1 vaccines are set to cost 29 dollars at polyclinics, says the CEO of Singhealth Polyclinics Dr Tan Chee Beng. <br> <br> Writing on the Health's Ministry's weblog, Dr Tan said this puts the cost of the vaccination at a price lower than Tamiflu. <br> <br> Dr Tan also said the vaccination is a cost effective shield against
              H1N1 and added that the Ministry is already seeing increasing public
              interest in the vaccinations. <br> <br> He said dedicated phone lines are in place to handle queries and requests to be put on the waitlist. <br> <br> Dr Tan says that appointments will be set up for those on the waitlist when the clinics finally receive the vaccine. <br> <br> He added that many Singaporeans are likely to travel, especially with the upcoming December holidays. <br> <br> And he cautioned that influenza activity is likely to persist or increase with the onset of cold weather in the coming months.</p>

              <br> <br>The vaccines came in a container designed for cold chain
              transportation. The unpacking was done in a warehouse, where the
              temperature was kept between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. <br> <br> Mr Chua said the vaccines will be released once they are certified to have undergone the proper handling standards.
              <br> <br> The ministry expects to receive the certification from the Australian

              <p><span>The Health Ministry, in an update on its blog, says the batch of
              100,000 doses from pharmaceutical company CSL will be available at
              clinics as early as 18 Nov, once the certification of cold chain
              assurance is obtained from the drug manufacturer.
              <br> <br> Each dose is contained in a pre-filled syringe, which makes it easier for GPs to administer the drug.
              <br> <br> The ministry received its first batch of 250,000 doses of the vaccine last month.
              <br> <br> With the latest delivery, all 277,000 pre-orders from clinics will be met.
              <br> <br>The ministry says that as of Friday, the order for pre-filled
              syringes is around 95,000 doses, of which around 40,000 doses are from
              clinics which are not designated as Pandemic Preparedness Clinics or
              flu clinics.
              <br> <br>The ministry will also release 50,000 doses from pharmaceutical
              company GlaxoSmithKline which it had repackaged into smaller quantities
              of 10 doses per box to make it easier for clinics to place orders.
              <br> <br>Another batch of vaccines is expected from Melbourne over the next
              few days. This will be followed by weekly deliveries until all one
              million doses are received by mid-December.
