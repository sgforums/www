              <p>Singapore will be able to meet its
              water requirements independently ahead of the 2061 expiration of
              a century-long supply agreement with Malaysia “if need be,”
              the head of the city-state’s water utility said.</p>
              <p>Desalination and recycling plants produce 40 percent of the
              380 million British gallons (456 million U.S. gallons) of water
              companies in Singapore and its 5.2 million population use daily,
              Chew Men Leong, chief executive of PUB, said in an interview on
              July 27. A downtown dam adds a further 10 percent, with the
              remaining coming from its reservoirs and imports from Malaysia.</p>
              <p>“We have made progress to the point that we are now much
              more confident in terms of water security and sustainability,”
              said Chew, 44, a former naval chief who joined the utility about
              a year ago. “If you’re asking me this question about when will
              we ever get self-sufficiency, I will put it this way that we can
              be self-sufficient if need be.”</p>
              <p>Singapore, which relied on Malaysia for its water needs,
              spent S$600 million ($481 million) to S$800 million a year since
              2006 on new technologies to boost its supply. The push to
              develop the industry has drawn businesses including General
              Electric Co. and Siemens AG (SIE) to invest, and created local water
              companies such as Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) that have expanded overseas.</p>
              <p>“What they are looking to do is create a virtual market
              for the water business which is much larger than Singapore,”
              said Glen Daigger, chief technology officer of CH2M Hill Cos.,
              an Englewood, Colorado-based industry consulting firm. “By
              becoming a thought leader for water in Asia, then they really
              create a market which is orders of magnitude bigger than
              Singapore itself.”</p>
              <h2>Rising Demand</h2>
              <p>The island that’s almost half the size of the city of Los
              Angeles is developing its water industry to meet the country’s
              requirement, which Chew expects will exceed 700 million gallons
              a day in 50 years. That’s equivalent to more than 1,000 Olympic-
              sized swimming pools, based on data from the U.S. Environment
              Protection Agency.</p>
              <p>Singapore has relied on Malaysia for its water supply, with
              the first of four contracts signed in 1927, according to data
              compiled by the city’s National Library. An agreement in 1961
              expired last year while the remaining 1962 accord, which ends in
              49 years, gives Singapore 250 million gallons of raw water daily.</p>
              <p>Arguments over the water contracts had overshadowed
              relations between the two countries, which were briefly united
              in a federation from 1963 to 1965.</p>
              <p>The water strategy “goes back to Lee Kuan Yew with respect
              to making sure that Singapore, which initially was reliant upon
              imported water from Malaysia, that it not be put in a position
              where it was not able to depend on that source as a reliable
              supply,” said Paul Brown, executive vice president of CDM Smith
              Inc., referring to city-state’s first prime minister.</p>
              <h2>Downtown Dam</h2>
              <p>CDM Smith, a Cambridge, Massachusetts infrastructure
              consulting company, designed the Marina Barrage, the dam in the
              island-state’s business district that was completed in 2010 and
              holds water from the Singapore River and the Marina Bay.</p>
              <p>Water from rainfall and drawn through a 7,000-kilometer
              (4,350-mile) drainage network into more than a dozen reservoirs
              across Singapore will be supplemented by desalination, which
              treats seawater, and recycling systems, Chew said.</p>
              <p>“Water is a priority area for Singapore, and this has set
              the tone and direction for water management in the country,”
              Olivia Lum, chief executive officer of Hyflux, the city’s
              biggest water company, said in an e-mailed response to queries.</p>
              <p>Hyflux, whose sales quadrupled to S$534.1 million in the
              past year from 2006, developed the city’s first desalination
              plant and is building similar projects in China and Algeria.</p>
              <h2>Sustainable Costs</h2>
              <p>Desalination plants produce 10 percent of water in
              Singapore, Chew said, which will increase to 30 percent in 50
              years. The use of recycled water, known as NEWater, is mainly
              for industrial purposes such as cooling machines and factory
              processes, and will make up 50 percent of supply by 2061.</p>
              <p>“We have essentially moved from a position of
              vulnerability to better security,” Chew said, adding that the
              goal is to make the supply “sustainable in terms of costs.”</p>
              <p>Singapore has achieved more than half of its target of
              adding 11,000 jobs to the water industry by 2015 as the number
              of companies in the city doubled to 100 since 2006, PUB said.
              The city-state also hosted the Water Week conference and two
              related expositions earlier this month, drawing a record 19,200
              participants. The events will be held every two years.</p>
              <p>“Over the next five to six years, we are committed to
              increasing our technology and engineering presence leveraging
              the greater opportunities we have here in Singapore,” said
              Michael Roeder, regional commercial leader of engineered systems
              at <span class="ticker_wrap">General Electric (GE) (<span class="ticker">GE</span>)</span>’s water unit in the city-state.</p>
              <h2>Flushers, Faucets</h2>
              <p>Chew said his main worry is climate change and how that
              lowers water levels at reservoirs. Changing weather patterns
              also led to heavy rainfalls and flash floods that added stress
              to its drainage systems, where parts of the Orchard Road
              shopping belt were affected over the past two years.</p>
              <p>PUB is also working on reducing water consumption, he said,
              with measures ranging from mandatory dual-flushing systems for
              toilets and automatic faucets in all public restrooms.</p>
              <p>The average usage per person is now 153.4 liters (40 U.S.
              gallons) a day, down from 165 liters nine years ago, he said.
              That’s expected to fall to 147 liters by the end of the decade
              and 140 liters in the following 10 years, he said.</p>
              <p>“Here, water is an issue of life and death,” Chew said.
              “That’s always been the message.”</p>

              <p>The global warming weather changes has been to our favour with plenty of rainfall.</p>
              <p>But if it is the other way round and there is prolonged drought, would there be sufficient water?</p>
              <p>Indonesia and Malaysia are racing to clear their tropical rain forest, and when that happens there would be less forest and less rain clouds.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The global warming is not a long term favour to sg, as sg will be submerged under water if the sea level rises cos ice berg melting. Both msia and sg have to work together on leveraging raw water of msia and water processing in sg. if msia raw water having problem, and there is no water processing in msia, influx of msia to sg is inadvertable and necessary in the name of humanitarian nature. The damage of eco-system will cause natural habitat to suffer and directly inflict upon human. Let hope the world is never insufficient of water supply.</p></div>
