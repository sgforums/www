              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Some 400 businessmen and marketing professionals 
              learnt what makes Singaporean youths tick at MediaCorp's inaugural Youth
               Shout Day.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The findings of a survey of more than 1,000 youths between the ages of 12 and 29 were presented. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The survey was commissioned by MediaCorp and conducted by TNS, a market insights and consultancy firm.<br><br>39 per cent of those surveyed said they conform to societal norms. <br><br>Many in this group aspire to own a property and car and get a good job that pays well.<br><br>Another
               28 per cent surveyed say they believe in the freedom of expression, 
              rights of others and are open to learning about and working with other 
              cultures and races.<br><br>The majority of youths surveyed are frequent 
              users of online media, with 81 per cent of them saying they feel that 
              they are always connected to the internet.<br><br>Participants also 
              heard from students from polytechnics and junior colleges, who shared 
              their views on topics close to their hearts, such as volunteerism and 
              online gaming.<br><br>"We want to be deeply engaged with the youths, to 
              understand them better, to give them a forum to express their views, and
               ultimately) we want to create content that's relevant to the youths 
              today," said Moses Lye, the head of youth engagement in MediaCorp. <br><br>"In
               the near future, MediaCorp (will be) developing digital initiatives, 
              that would create content in the digital space, around the areas of 
              music, games and social engagement."<br><br>One of the participants, 
              Canon Singapore's director of marketing, Mr Edwin Teoh, 43, felt that 
              the event took a "dramatic and different approach" to reach out to 
              youths.  <br><br>He said: "I think for the youths of today, they are a 
              bit more sophisticated. From a marketing perspective, it is no longer 
              good for us to just push our advertising messages to them, but we need 
              to engage them in a more subtle way. It's really about the brand 
              experience that they have with us. I think that's how we will look at 
              crafting our messages for them in future."<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
