              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans are under significant environmental and psychological pressure, say sociologists. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Stress from 
              competitive workplaces and dense living conditions is just one reason 
              people are showing more signs of intolerance and ungraciousness towards 
              one another. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>As the population 
              gets older and more diverse, Singapore will continue to grapple with its
               social consciousness in the year ahead.<br><br>Over the course of 2012,
               in Woodlands, Bishan, Toh Yi Drive, and Jalan Batu, residents have 
              spoken up strongly against new nursing homes, day care centres, and even
               studio apartments for the elderly in their neighbourhoods. <br><br>The concerns cited included fear of lower property prices, or the belief that old people are "unlucky". <br><br>"There
               is a gap between what we aspire to be and what we really are. We aspire
               to be a compassionate, a considerate society, we want to make sure 
              people who are disadvantaged or need a leg up are included, like the 
              elderly, the disabled, and the poor," commented Denise Phua, deputy 
              chair of the government parliamentary committee for family and social 
              development. <br><br>"But at the same time when it comes to difficult 
              decisions as to whether I should locate that elderly centre right in my 
              block or near my block or near where I live, that is another story 
              altogether."<br><br>"We've seen the population of Singapore increase 
              quite dramatically over the last five to eight years. We are also in the
               middle of very rapid population ageing," explained Asst Prof Angelique 
              Chan from the National University of Singapore (NUS). <br><br>"Therefore
               people are feeling the population density. Singapore is the second 
              densest population as a country in the world, so people are worried 
              about their space and they're also trying to get used to having more 
              older people in the environment."<br> <br>Anti-foreigner sentiments also
               took a more strident tone on the Internet, in the wake of a horrific 
              car crash where a Chinese national slammed his Ferrari into a taxi, 
              killing himself and two others. <br><br>Online forums and websites were swamped with posts attacking the Chinese driver. <br><br>Other foreigners living and working in Singapore were also blamed for adding to the competition for jobs and space.<br><br>"This
               is something society has to find ways to avoid. Which means the 
              Singaporean dream has to be kept alive," said Dr Reuben Wong, associate 
              professor of political science at NUS.  <br><br>"There must be this 
              sense that if I work hard in my society, meritocracy still works so that
               I can get a better life than my parents. And if I can't find a better 
              life in Singapore, then I have opportunities to go abroad to work, to 
              get my degree, to get my job, and possibly even to raise my family, and 
              then there will always be a Singapore I can come home to later on. <br><br>"This
               is something which, not just Singaporeans but the government has to get
               used to, that in an increasingly inter-connected world, Singaporeans 
              will move and may even have to move in, some cases."<br><br>Observers 
              say louder voices from the ground, even negative ones against foreigners
               or the elderly, are part of the country's political liberalisation. <br><br>"What
               tends to happen, if you look at the US for example, the baby boomers 
              moved a lot of the major policy changes that occurred for employment of 
              older adults, for placement of long term care services," said Asst Prof 
              Chan.<br><br>"And in Singapore I think baby boomers will actually be a 
              real changing force. Because they will form 30 per cent of the 
              population, they will be the ones who'll be vocal, more vocal than the 
              current generation of elderly, they may actually induce significant 
              changes in how we view our work lives, retirement, and health care."<br><br>"People
               are more comfortable with writing online, writing to newspapers, 
              writing to MPs or ministers directly, criticising them, giving feedback,
               telling them what they're doing that's wrong," said Dr Wong.<br><br>"This is a good thing because it means we have a system where people don't just get up and leave."<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>
