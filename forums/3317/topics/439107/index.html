              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>UNITED NATIONS: 
              Russia and China on Tuesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution 
              threatening action if Syria's leader pursues a deadly crackdown on 
              opposition protests, sparking US and European outrage.<br><br>US 
              ambassador Susan Rice said the draft drawn up by France, Britain, 
              Germany and Portugal -- all angered by the double veto -- had been 
              opposed by countries who "would rather sell arms to the Syrian regime."<br><br>Rice
               led a protest walkout from the council chamber as Syria's envoy 
              launched a bitter condemnation of countries seeking action against 
              President Bashar al-Assad.<br><br>Nine countries voted for the text 
              which had called for "targeted measures" if Assad did not call off his 
              assault on demonstrators, which the UN says has left at least 2,700 
              dead.<br><br>Russia and China voted against, killing the resolution 
              because of their veto power as permanent council members. South Africa, 
              India, Brazil and Lebanon abstained, reaffirming a divide in the 
              15-member body since NATO launched air strikes in Libya using UN 
              resolutions to justify the action.<br><br>It is the first Russian-China 
              veto since the pair blocked UN sanctions against Zimbabwe's President 
              Robert Mugabe in July 2008. Russia alone blocked the renewal of a UN 
              mission in Georgia in June 2009.<br><br>The European nations have been pressing for nearly six months for a resolution on the Syria crisis.<br><br>In
               recent weeks, European negotiators had withdrawn a threat of immediate 
              sanctions and then any mention of sanctions, instead using the phrase 
              "targeted measures" to warn of action.<br><br>But Russia, which has a 
              naval base in Syria, and China have both repeatedly threatened to veto 
              any resolution which threatens sanctions.<br><br>Russia has drawn up a 
              rival text which calls for dialogue and condemns opposition as well as 
              government violence. France's UN ambassador Gerard Araud said however 
              the veto meant that no resolution could now be passed by the Security 
              Council.<br><br>The veto was an "expression of disdain for the 
              legitimate aspirations that are being fought for in Syria," declared 
              Araud, who stressed the "numerous concessions" made to Russia, China and
               the abstaining countries to get backing.<br><br>Russia's UN envoy, 
              Vitaly Churkin, said the European resolution was "based on a philosophy 
              of confrontation." The threat of sanctions, which the resolution called 
              "targeted measures," was "unacceptable," he added.<br><br>Churkin said 
              more emphasis must be put on the opposition violence and launched a 
              strong attack on the NATO campaign in Libya, raising new fears that it 
              could be repeated in Syria, despite denials by Western governments that 
              military action was envisaged.<br><br>China's ambassador Li Baodong spoke in favour of the Russian draft and said the Syria crisis must be ended through dialogue.<br><br>So far the council has only agreed two statements on the violence and Rice expressed her country's "outrage" at the result.<br><br>"Let
               there be no doubt: this is not about military intervention. This is not
               about Libya. That is a cheap ruse by those who would rather sell arms 
              to the Syrian regime than stand with the Syrian people," Rice told the 
              council.<br><br>"The United States is outraged that this council has 
              utterly failed to address an urgent moral challenge and a growing threat
               to regional peace and security," said Rice.<br><br>"Let me be clear the
               United States believes it is past time that this council assumed its 
              responsibilities and imposed tough targeted sanctions and an arms 
              embargo on the Assad regime."<br><br>The United States and European Union have passed their own sanctions.<br><br>Syrian
               Ambassador Bashar Jaafari condemned what he called the "unprecedently 
              aggressive" language used by western envoys in the chamber.<br><br>He said those seeking action against Syria were "our enemies" and had no "humanitarian motive".<br><br>Rice
               and her delegation walked out in protest as Jaafari accused western 
              countries of "inciting" violence in Syria, causing millions of deaths in
               World War II and turned against western action in the Palestinian 
              territories.<br><br>The British ambassador soon followed, leaving one of his deputies to listen.<br><br>- AFP/cc</span></span></p>
