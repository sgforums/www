              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has urged Singaporeans to contribute back to society.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said the 
              country's success cannot be measured just by GDP growth, but also the 
              growth of values such as compassion, altruism and empathy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking at the Singapore Children's Society (SCS) 60th anniversary charity gala dinner on Friday evening.<br><br>Since it was established in 1952, the SCS has reached out to more than 67,000 children, youth and families in need.<br><br>Today,
               the SCS operates nine centres islandwide, offering services in 
              caregiving, preventing delinquency, abuse or neglect, all-rounded 
              development, rehabilitation, child welfare and public education.<br><br>Noting
               the society's good work, the Prime Minister said Singapore is better - 
              for what the Children's Society and other voluntary welfare 
              organisations have done.<br><br>He said: "It is most difficult to bestir
               ourselves, sacrifice our own time and energies, roll up sleeves, do the
               heavy lifting day after day, organising, fundraising, volunteering, and
               doing things which make a real difference to the lives of others. And 
              this is what SCS and many other VWOs have done, and Singapore is the 
              better for it."<br><br>Mr Lee noted that more Singaporeans are also giving back to society.<br><br>He said volunteerism is on the rise, while donations reached at least S$900 million last year - the highest in 10 years.<br><br>He said there is also greater passion and awareness of social causes, especially among youth.<br><br>But
               as the income gap widens and the sense of community changes with social
               media and the internet, it is important for more to give back.<br><br>But it does not mean the government will step aside.<br><br>"The
               government will always do its part to help the less fortunate 
              especially through education, through housing, through financial 
              assistance schemes but also through upholding meritocracy and keeping 
              paths up open," said Mr Lee.<br><br>He added: "Whatever your family 
              background, however difficult your family circumstances, if you are 
              working hard, if you have the talent, you can make it and the doors are 
              open and you can go all the way up to the top.<br><br>But Mr Lee stressed that the government is not able to do everything for the less fortunate.<br><br>He
               said: "The government cannot, and should not do, try to do everything. 
              It is too impersonal. It can be bureaucratic and help then becomes a 
              matter of social administration, not of care and compassion. And 
              eventually, this fosters an entitlement mentality, instead of a sense of
               mutual obligation of and of gratitude between the helpers and the 
              helped.<br><br>"Ultimately, it is not the incentives which make the 
              difference. We hope Singaporeans will participate and will support such 
              good works because this is the sort of people we are, and because this 
              is the kind of society which we want Singapore to be."<br><br>Mr Lee 
              said Singapore "cannot just measure our success by GDP growth, as 
              important as it is, but also by the growth of our values - compassion, 
              empathy, altruism, love for our fellow citizens."<br><br>Mr Lee added he is glad that many Singaporeans feel the same.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said the government will continue to encourage Singaporeans to give
               back to society, such as tax deductions or matching grants. It will 
              also promote volunteerism, especially among the young.<br><br>The 
              Singapore Children's Society aims to raise S$1 million through the gala 
              dinner, through the support of close to 100 sponsors, donors and 
              well-wishers. <br><br>Fourteen partners were honoured during the dinner. <br><br>- CNA/xq/fa</span></span></p>
