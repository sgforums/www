              <p><strong>Youths rank demographic trends as key issue that would impact Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore youths have ranked the ageing population as a key issue that would impact the country.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>More than 500 
              students at this year's pre-university seminar were asked to participate
               in a poll and were given four options: the economic rise of asia, 
              climate change, urbanisation, and demographic trends.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A majority went for the last option.<br><br>This was one of many quick polls conducted during a keynote speech, given by Minister in Prime Minister's Office S Iswaran.<br><br>He
               sought their views on issues ranging from the economy to new media. The
               students were then invited to respond by answering the multiple choice 
              questions on a mobile keypad.<br><br>The opening event, which lasted 
              some two hours, also saw students asking a wide spectrum of questions to
               the minister during the dialogue, with topics ranging from 
              entrepreneurship to politics.<br><br>And Mr Iswaran, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade &amp; Industry, said he was impressed.<br><br>"I
               think the students were very engaged, the questions were very 
              thoughtful. Clearly they were seized with trying to find out what is 
              important from their point of view for Singapore and what are the 
              broader issues they need to understand."<br><br>The seminar was started in the 1970s with the aim of creating awareness among students on issues important to Singapore. <br><br>The 500 participants hail from the polytechnics, integrated programme schools, junior colleges and the centralised institute.<br><br>17-year-old Nickolas Teo from Temasek Junior College found the polls to be a good effort to engage his peers.<br><br>He
               said: "I think it's an innovative move in order to engage the audience 
              because we are very receptive to technology; it'd be good for us to 
              interact with the keynote speaker."<br><br>The dialogue session had students asking a wide spectrum of questions, with topics ranging from entrepreneurship to politics.<br><br>"You
               discussed the necessity of change in response to challenges that arise.
               What happens however, when change meets resistance from the people? For
               example, the opening of the casinos in the IRs was not well-received by
               a significant portion of Singaporeans," questioned Joanna Lee, a 
              student at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). <br><br>Mr Iswaran said the government is aware of the concerns.<br><br>"Some
               people have objections to it from a conscience point of view, others 
              have objections to it from a social consequences point of view, and the 
              government is keenly aware of it. We also had a very extensive process 
              of consultation with the ground, various constituencies and religious 
              groups before coming to this decision. So it was not just something that
               was decided impetuously," said Mr Iswaran. <br><br>Mr Iswaran explained that there were clear economic objectives, with social safeguards in place.<br><br>- CNA/ac/ls</span></span></p>
