              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said 
              Singapore's economic growth will be weak in the short-term mainly 
              because of the gloomy world economy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>And the challenge for Singapore, he said, is to restructure its economy to ensure sustained growth over the long-term.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Tharman, who's also Finance Minister, was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a community event in his Jurong GRC.<br><br>Many countries in the world are now bracing themselves for the possibility of a "fiscal cliff" in the US.<br><br>This
               means a huge economic crisis may be looming for the US - if its deeply 
              divided Congress is not able to come to an agreement.<br><br>Congress, 
              which is made up of the House of Representatives and Senate, will still 
              be controlled by two parties in the new Obama administration.<br><br>The Republicans regained control of the House, while the Senate is dominated by the Democrats.<br><br>Mr
               Tharman pointed out that even if the US gets past this hurdle, the 
              bigger challenge is to put its mid-term budget on a more sustainable 
              path for the years ahead in order to restore investor confidence.<br><br>He
               said: "That's what's necessary to really get the economy to restart. 
              And it requires common ground to be found on both taxes and spending on 
              the parts of the Democrats and the Republicans. <br><br>"The experience 
              of the first term was one of intense partisanship. Hopefully in the 
              second term, there will be a willingness to find common ground. The 
              initial signs are positive but it's too early to say."<br><br>The 
              effects of sluggish growth in the US and Eurozone are likely to cascade 
              to Singapore, even though Mr Tharman said Asia continues to do 
              reasonably well.<br><br>"Demand will be weak, but our real challenge in 
              Singapore is in restructuring our economy. We've got to persevere in 
              restructuring our economy so that we can get sustained growth over the 
              long term, over the next five to 10 years based on productivity growth. 
              That's the big challenge. Demand will be weak in the short term but it's
               not a fundamental problem for us because our unemployment rate is low, 
              and that's the bottom line of the short-term. Unemployment rate is low, 
              jobs are available and training places are available. Our real challenge
               therefore is to focus on restructuring our economy so that we can move 
              one whole level higher - productivity, skills, expertise," Mr Tharman 
              shared.<br><br>He said this means using management methods and 
              technology to improve efficiency and productivity so that workers can 
              get paid more.<br><br>"They can have more satisfying jobs and we can 
              grow our economy without growing employment year after year, especially 
              foreign employment. So we got to find the right balance. It's something 
              that affects every sector of the economy. And, we look at the most 
              developed countries and we can see how it's done. They too went through 
              that transition. In some cases not very long ago, they went through the 
              same transition. They ramp up on labour and they have to upgrade, do 
              with less labour, but using technology and everyone playing that part, 
              including customers, everyone playing that part. You can move up to a 
              higher level. That way, our workers can get good wages, get good jobs," 
              he said.<br><br>Mr Tharman added that the government will provide every 
              form of support to help companies, especially small and medium 
              enterprises, to make this transition.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
