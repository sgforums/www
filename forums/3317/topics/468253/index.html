              <p>SINGAPORE: The central procurement entity set up in 
              the headquarters of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) would carry out 
              all procurements exceeding $70,000, which includes all tenders, for the 
              Home Team Departments (HTDs).</p>
              <p>This was revealed in the second report of the Public Accounts Committee which released its report on Friday.</p>
              <p>The
               Committee had requested for an update from MHA on the actions taken to 
              address the lapses reported in the Report of the Auditor-General for FY 
              2010/11.</p>
              <p>The Auditor-General had observed irregularities at 
              every stage of the management of two projects undertaken by the Police 
              Coast Guard which resulted in the Singapore Police Force being grossly 
              overcharged.</p>
              <p>MHA said the central entity would subsequently 
              work with the user departments on the management of the contract, 
              including monitoring contract performance and handling contract 
              variations.</p>
              <p>The Committee had also asked for an explanation 
              for lapses in the procurement carried by some of MHA's HTDs as 
              highlighted in the AGO's report for FY 2011/12.</p>
              <p>The HTDs are 
              the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, two divisions of the 
              Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Prison Service and the Police 
              Logistics Base.</p>
              <p>MHA said the main causes for the 
              irregularities in procurement and project management included a lack of 
              specialist procurement knowledge and skills, and failure of the project 
              management company in discharging its responsibilities under the 
              contract.</p>
              <p>With regard to MHA's projects managed by external 
              project managers, the Committee was informed that MHA has tightened its 
              control over the project management company and stepped up its 
              monitoring of the company's performance .</p>
              <p>MHA is also 
              conducting a review of its overall requirements across all its 
              departments for the provision of project management and facility 
              management services.</p>
              <p>It said it would examine how best to structure a new contract for the provision of such services.</p>
              <p>MHA
               said it had recovered most of the overpayments and amounts overcharged 
              from the term contractors and related project management fees from the 
              project management company.</p>
              <p>MHA is working on raising the 
              competency level of procurement officers. It is developing a 
              competencies and training framework for procurement officers and a 
              procurement manual.</p>
