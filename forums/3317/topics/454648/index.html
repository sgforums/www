              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A policyholder has sued AIA Singapore Pte Ltd for 
              breach of contract, claiming that the insurance company did not fulfil 
              the terms of payment as stated in a policy quotation document provided 
              to her.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>AIA is, however, 
              disputing that the policy quotation document does not have a contractual
               effect and the figures cited were for illustration and were not 
              guaranteed.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The High Court heard
               on June 25 that Madam Zhu Yong Zhen had bought a Singapore Financial 
              Guardian policy from AIA in 1993 after being given a policy quotation by
               her insurance agent.<br><br>From the policy quotation, which had an 
              assured sum of S$100,000 and policy premium of S$2,091.50, she had to 
              pay premiums for the first 16 years.<br><br>The policy premiums for the subsequent years will be paid from cash dividends accumulated over the years.<br><br>Mdm Zhu, 49, eventually decided to buy the policy with an assured sum of S$200,000.<br><br>She did not ask to see the policy quotation during the purchase.<br><br>In
               her opening statement on June 25, Mdm Zhu, who holds a Masters in 
              Computer Science from Wuhan University, said she believed the policy 
              values for S$200,000 would be doubled from the quotation of S$100,000.<br><br>During cross-examination, Mdm Zhu insisted that the policy quotation had a contractual effect. <br><br>She
               asserted she was "a lay person" who was merely following what her agent
               had told her and did not ask further questions because she trusted 
              AIA's reputation.<br><br>Mdm Zhu's policy has been suspended since 2009 and she commenced legal action against AIA Singapore in the same year.<br><br>The High Court dismissed her lawsuit a year later, but her case was later reinstated by the Court of Appeal.<br><br>AIA has counter-claimed for defamation, alleging Mdm Zhu wrote on her blog about the dispute with the insurance company.<br><br>Mdm Zhu denies the claim. <br><br>The hearing is set to continue on June 27.<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
