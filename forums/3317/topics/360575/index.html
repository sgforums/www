              <p><strong>Mum confused by grading of plastic containers</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://tnp.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2009-05-16/NP_NEWS_1_CURRENT_ECBOTTLE-Y1X.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="279"><br><em>WORRIED: (Above) Mrs Serene Tan, with son Adriel, holding the free
              plastic water bottle from John Little, which has a plastic
              identification code grading of '1' at the bottom (below). --TNP
              Pictures<br><br></em></p>
              <p>IT WAS free, but on hindsight, the gift was one that housewife
              Serene Tan, 39, would rather not have taken the trouble to collect.</p>
              <p>She was offered a free plastic water bottle worth $12.90 by John
              Little after renewing her ValuePlus membership with the store last
              Sunday .</p>
              <p>When she got home, she realised that the free water bottle was made of polyethylene terephthalate (Pete).</p>
              <p>Alarm bells went off in her head: She had recently read in a
              magazine article that Pete is normally used for mineral water bottles
              and cooking oil bottles. It has a plastic identification code of 'one',
              which means that it is not suitable for repeated, long-term use.</p>
              <p><strong>The article also warned that long-term use of such plastic
              bottles may lead to the release of cancer-causing chemicals such as
              bisphenol-A (BPA), she said.</strong></p>
              <p>Mrs Tan said: 'I thought it was made of good quality plastic, and  intended to let my 8-year-old son useit.'</p>
              <p>She first started being more cautious about the types of plastic
              bottles she uses since her son's school advised parents not to let
              their children use Pete bottles.</p>
              <p>Recently, said Mrs Tan, her
              sister had also reminded her to be careful about the types of water
              bottles that her children, aged 14, 13 and 8, use.</p>
              <p>When The New
              Paper did a random check, we found that water bottles with the code one
              identification were being sold in some supermarkets and HDB shops.</p>
              <p><strong>No complaints</strong></p>
              <p>The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) said that it has not
              received any complaints about water bottles with the code one
              identification so far.</p>
              <p>AVA spokesman Goh Shih Yong confirmed
              that Pete bottles that are commonly used for commercial bottling of
              drinking-water are manufactured for one-time use only.</p>
              <p>However, he added that Pete bottles can also be manufactured with a quality suitable for repeated use.</p>
              <p><strong>He
              said: 'Plastic containers that are made of the same plastic polymer can
              be manufactured with different qualities that suit different
              applications. Hence, the code number or the type of plastic polymer
              used to manufacture a food-contact container does not give any
              indication on whether the container is for a single-use only or
              suitable for repeated use.'</strong></p>
              <p>Reusable water bottles that
              are made of Pete plastic, he added, are allowed for sale (and can be
              offered) as a gift in Singapore, 'as long as they are manufactured for
              the intended purpose and are safe for use'.</p>
              <p>However, this has left Mrs Tan very confused.</p>
              <p>She said: 'As consumers, sometimes, we may not necessarily buy from the
              big shopping centres where water bottles are classified under different
              sections. How will I know whether a bottle made of Pete is meant for
              one-time use or not then?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>'I think they should come up with a proper grading system. For now,
              I will just play it safe and not use bottles made of Pete.'</p>

              <ul>
              <li>Plastic packaging that has been used for storing non-food items (eg.
              detergent) should never be reused as food containers. They have not
              been tested safe for food storage and may contain non-food residue that
              can contaminatefood.<br><br></li>
              <li>Takeaway plastic food containers are disposable items designed for
              one-time usage and are not intended for repeated storage of food. They
              are safe for their immediate intended purpose but not beyond what they
              are designedfor.<br><br></li>
              <li>Use only takeaway food containers that are labelled microwave-safe for reheating food in the microwave oven.<br><br></li>
              <li>Plastic packaging for microwaveable convenience meals are designed for
              one-time usage with the type of food that's packed in it and should not
              be reused for storing or microwave-heating of other food.<br><br></li>
              <li>Reusable plastic food containers are subject to wear and tear after a
              period of use. They should be replaced when they have turned cloudy or
              discoloured, or if cracks or heavy abrasions start to appear.</li>

              <p>look at the bottom of the bottle u can see the grade. i compare the better one all with grade 7. AVA statement :</p>
              <p>Reusable water bottles that are made of Pete plastic, he added, are allowed for sale (and can be offered) as a gift in Singapore, 'as long as they are manufactured for the intended purpose and are safe for use'.</p>
              <p>If the grade 1Pete plastic is manufactured as water bottle ( John Little letter written as Sport Water Bottle), will it come to everybody that it is a useable one ?</p>
              <p>AVA set the standard, but not clear. Even the report also dont konw about the grade.</p>
              <p>AVA should inform manufacter to state in the product it is reuseable or not.</p>
              <p>School had issue warning to children not to reuse the drinking bottle so should AVA.</p>
