              <p>AFP <span class="datetime">On Wednesday 25 August 2010, 10:49 SGT</span><br><br>Flash floods along posh Orchard Road. Packed subway trains. Traffic 
              gridlock in the morning and evening rush hours. Intensifying competition
               for public flats.</p>
              <p>What happened to squeaky-clean, smooth-flowing Singapore?</p>
              <p>Widely
               acclaimed as one of the world's most "liveable" cities, Singapore is 
              now experiencing urban growth woes as it moves to expand its population 
              to 6.5 million in 20 years, up 30 percent from the current level of five
               million.</p>
              <p>The target was first cited in 2007 as an optimal 
              population size for long-term economic competitiveness, but strains are 
              already beginning to show as more immigrants and guest workers jostle 
              for space with the locals.</p>
              <p>Not to mention an invasion of tourists,
               with arrivals surpassing the one million mark in a single month for the
               first time in July, thanks to two new massive casino resorts that 
              opened a few months ago.</p>
              <p>Singapore, one of the world's richest 
              cities, has a land area of just 710 square kilometres (274 square miles)
               but until recent years, it had avoided the congested feeling of places 
              like Hong Kong and Tokyo.</p>
              <p>"It's crowded, very crowded," commuter 
              Anthony Chua, a 47-year-old accountant, said after getting off a train 
              near the banking district.</p>
              <p>Despite increased train frequency during peak demand periods, Chua felt trains were more cramped than before.</p>
              <p>"There's a certain level of frustration but I suppose we learn to accept it," he added.</p>
              <p>The
               government was left red-faced in June and July after an unprecedented 
              three flash floods inundated houses, drowned cars and damaged shops, 
              with insurers estimating 23 million Singapore dollars (17 million US) in
               claims.</p>
              <p>The Public Utilities Board attributed the freak floods to
               regional squalls and clogged drainage, but questions remained over 
              whether Singapore was equipped to handle the side effects of rapid 
              urbanization.</p>
              <p>The city-state's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, 
              shocked many when he said occasional floods were inevitable in 
              constantly rain-drenched Singapore because it could not afford to 
              convert roads into canals.</p>
              <p>Insurance companies subsequently said 
              premiums might be raised in flood-prone areas including the shopping 
              belt around Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>But the floods formed just part of Singaporeans' urban gripes.</p>
              <p>Traffic
               has slowed amid an explosion in car ownership even though Singapore is 
              one of the costliest places in the world to own a vehicle due to high 
              taxes and quotas.</p>
              <p>As of July, there were 936,311 vehicles plying 
              the roads of Singapore, with cars accounting for 61.5 percent of the 
              total, compared to 755,000 vehicles just five years ago.</p>
              <p>The Land 
              Transport Authority said daily journeys on private vehicles and public 
              transport were expected to increase by 60 percent from the current 8.9 
              million to 14.3 million by 2020.</p>
              <p>Demand for homes in Singapore's public housing blocks, where 80 percent of the population reside, is also straining supply.</p>
              <p>National
               Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said there was an "imbalance" in 
              supply and demand in July, with many first-time flat-buyers such as 
              newlywed couples unable to find affordable homes.</p>
              <p>Resale prices of
               four- and five-room flats, the most popular among Singaporeans, ranged 
              from 331,500 to 682,500 Singapore dollars (243,190 to 500,773 US) in the
               second quarter.</p>
              <p>Foreigners who enjoy permanent residency and are 
              eligible to purchase public housing totalled 533,000 in 2009, a 37.8 
              percent increase from 2005.</p>
              <p>Singapore's total population numbered 
              4.99 million last year, a 17 percent increase from 2005, according to 
              the latest government data.</p>
              <p>Urban expert Seetharam Kallidaikurichi
               said Singaporeans should be prepared to pay more for public services if
               they expect the government to meet their expectations.</p>
              <p>"It's like
               you live in a five-star hotel. What happens? You just check in, you get
               your bed ready, new linen given to you, you come down, breakfast is 
              served for you... (but) you pay for it," said the professor at the Lee 
              Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.</p>
              <p>The Urban Redevelopment 
              Authority, the agency in charge of city planning, said it was devising 
              new methods of maximising Singapore's land space.</p>
              <p>They include utilising underground space, building new commercial hubs away from the city centre and doubling the train network.</p>
              <p>"As
               Singapore is a small city-state with limited land resources, the 
              scarcity of land has been and will continue to be a challenge we face," 
              it said in reply to queries from AFP.</p>
              <p>"The challenge of balancing 
              growth with liveability is not an easy one, but we are confident that 
              this can be done for Singapore." it said.</p>
              <p>Kallidaikurichi said 
              Singapore was still leagues ahead of many other cities in terms of 
              living conditions, and particularly praised the emphasis on greening the
               dense landscape.</p>
              <p>"Many other cities including the big cities in 
              the US and others, they have ended up as concrete jungles because they 
              put so much roads and buildings and so on that they forgot about real 
              life in terms of living," he said.<br><a title="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Model-city-Singapore-shows-afpsg-4043611794.html?x=0" href="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Model-city-Singapore-shows-afpsg-4043611794.html?x=0"><br>http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Model-city-Singapore-shows-afpsg-4043611794.html?x=0</a></p>

              <p>All these numbers are just short term. Just because a person hold Red passport doesn't mean it will have a sense of belonging.  Most of you "Citizen" would agree that it  takes about 2 generations to cultivate a sense of belonging. That is at least 20 yrs in the making.    </p>
              <p>whats going to happen is that the surge of population are newly arrived chances are they hold 2 passports in other words they will leave if there is a better place.....you will find the population might just drop as far as it comes.</p>

              <p>On the SMRT or Circle line train as well. In my work place too. Sometimes, I always ask myself this question: "Where have all the Singaporeans gone"?</p>

              <p>And so those who stay behind need to cluster with FTs, in my words.</p>
