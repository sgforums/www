              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: In land-strapped Singapore, underground space has 
              been named a strategic resource by the high-level Economic Strategies 
              Committee.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A masterplan is in 
              the works to map out possible uses and the Ministry of National 
              Development said details will be released this year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Underneath the bustling Chinatown lies a vast labyrinth of interconnected tunnels snaking across Singapore. <br><br>The
               Downtown railway line, which is being built entirely underground, is 
              part of a decades-long push to go down under in search of space.<br><br>The result is a subterranean world teeming with activity.<br><br>At the basement level, there's a complex network of utility pipes, electrical grids and pedestrian linkways.<br><br>The
               Common Services Tunnel, which is located five to 10 metres deep, is a 
              system of tunnels designed to house utility services in the Marina Bay 
              area. Built in 2006, the facility allows for the maintenance and repair 
              of utility, sewage and electrical pipes through specially-constructed 
              access points, without having to disrupt traffic above ground.<br><br>And 15 to 20 metres deep are the MRT lines and the Marina Coastal Expressway.<br><br>Just
               below that, at the 20 metres to 60 metres level, the Deep Tunnel 
              Sewerage System delivers waste water to an underground treatment plant 
              in Changi.<br><br>Across at Jurong Island, the Jurong Rock Cavern is being built at about 150 metres below the island.<br><br>And somewhere in the deeper, darker depths, is the Ministry of Defence's ammunition facility located under Mandai quarry.<br><br>But not all of Singapore has rock that is solid enough for cavern developments.<br><br>Most of it is in the west and central parts of the island lying about 100 metres deep.<br><br>In the west, there is sedimentary rock while hard granite is found in the central Bukit Timah region.<br><br>Thus, the first step is to create a geology office to know where the good rock is located in Singapore.<br><br>The
               Singapore Geology Office, which is located within the Building and 
              Construction Authority, was set up in April 2010. Its aim is to create a
               database of information on Singapore's geology, to facilitate future 
              underground developments.<br><br>Most information on Singapore's geology
               derives from a national survey done in 1976 although the information 
              was updated in 2009. Government agencies and developers looking to build
               underground either referred to these sources, or commissioned their own
               studies.<br><br>Building and Construction Authority's Geological Office
               assistant director, Kiefer Chiam, said: "The existing information is 
              quite shallow because it's mainly targeted at infrastructure works like 
              MRT, services or building basements. There isn't much information at 
              deeper levels like 100 metres or more.<br><br>"In order to support the underground masterplan, we need to know where the good rocks are."<br><br>In the immediate term, the focus is on adding more basement-level services like shopping malls and linkways.<br><br>But
               as underground construction incurs huge costs, a masterplan is needed 
              to coordinate future uses and integrate them with structures above 
              ground.<br><br>Adele Tan, Deputy Director of Planning Policies at Urban 
              Redevelopment Authority (URA), said: "Those are things we have to sort 
              out amongst the agencies. We work closely with each other on it. And 
              where there are conflicts, we have to talk it through and see what are 
              the most optimal alignment and the most cost-effective alignment.<br><br>"As
               we build more things underground, there will be more competing uses and
               more conflicts of space. Some of these uses that come later may find 
              that they have to go even deeper to avoid some of the uses that are 
              already there in the shallower surfaces."<br><br>The challenge of 
              building undergound is not just a technical one. There is also the issue
               of land rights to consider. In cities like Helsinki for example, 
              private ownership of subterranean land is limited to a certain depth. 
              But in Singapore, the law gives private owners rights to the land 
              stretching all the way down.<br><br>It is not a problem currently 
              because the Rapid Transit Systems Act gives rail authorities the right 
              to go through private land. But this may have to be reassessed along 
              with other regulations such as safety codes and utility plans. <br>Ms Tan said URA is studying other cities for models it can adapt. <br><br>URA
               is also studying how other cities pay for underground developments. In 
              Japan for instance, the government shares the cost with private 
              developers. Unlike places like Hong Kong, Norway and Japan, Singapore's 
              good rock is buried deep underground, and are much more expensive to 
              access.<br><br>Ms Tan said: "As we have a better understanding of our 
              space underground, we can then develop this underground space plan 
              progressively. We can identify suitable uses to put underground and put 
              them in the right places as well, so that we can save land." <br><br>Singapore's subterranean expansion is still in its early stages.<br><br>Urban planners are laying the ground for future development, a process that will take years.<br><br>And if they succeed, it will open up many more possibilities on how Singaporeans use the space above to live, work and play.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Govt studies possibility of underground science city</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A study of an unprecedented scale is taking place 
              beneath the Singapore Science Park, in the western part of the country. 
              It is for a science complex, about 30 storeys below the surface at the 
              80 to 100 metre layer, to house research labs, offices and a data 
              centre.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The area being 
              studied lies between Science Parks 1 and 2, and the objective is to link
               the underground science city to facilities above. The feasibility study
               is expected to be completed by April 2012.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Developer JTC 
              Corporation describes the project as an expensive experiment, but one 
              that is perhaps inevitable, as land here becomes increasingly scarce.<br><br>David
               Tan, Assistant CEO of JTC Corporation, said: "By putting an underground
               science city between Science Parks 1 and 2, we could actually have two 
              plots of land for development - one at the bottom, underground; the 
              other one on top. The key is really to see how we can use a piece of 
              land twice."<br><br>There are benefits to building underground. For 
              instance, the stable climate allows for greater efficiency of facilities
               such as data centres. The enclosed environment also ensures a higher 
              degree of safety for storing risky chemicals.<br><br>But such advantages
               come with a price. Mr Tan estimates that building underground will cost
               50 per cent more than a similar facility above ground.<br><br>Lessons 
              can be learnt from JTC Corporation's Jurong Rock Cavern, which is an 
              underground oil bunker at Jurong Island. For instance, evacuation plans 
              and ventilation points need to be mapped out in detail, as there are 
              limited access points at such depths. There is also a smaller margin for
               error as space is constrained by the availability of solid rock.<br><br>Construction
               challenges are also more complex. When building underground, the size 
              and the shape of the cavern are dependent on site conditions and the 
              quality of rock, which may cause some inflexibility in the size of the 
              facilities created within the space. For the Jurong Rock Caverns, each 
              cavern is about 20 metres wide and 25 metres high.<br><br>In addition, engineers have to work around the problem of fault lines, and water seeping into the caverns.<br><br>Associate
               Professor (adjunct) Zhou Yingxin, from the School of Civil and 
              Environmental Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, is a 
              mining engineer who has worked on the Jurong Rock Cavern as well as the 
              Defence Ministry's ammunition bunker.<br><br>He said: "The risks 
              associated with underground construction is not so much that we don't 
              know what to do with the problem, it's that very often we don't know 
              what to expect."<br><br>"You have to build with the ground that's there,
               whether it's good rock or bad rock. Of course you can try to choose a 
              good site. But even a good site, you wouldn't know the rock until you 
              see it.<br><br>"So you must have a plan to deal with such 
              uncertainties... That's why you must have very experienced people on 
              site. When they see it, they know what's going to happen, and they know 
              what to do."<br><br>While most people are used to going underground to 
              get to carparks and shopping malls, there are various issues that 
              architects and engineers have to consider to make underground 
              developments truly liveable. For example, the kind of anxieties people 
              might have with spending so many hours deep underground.<br><br>Natural 
              light, greenery and fresh air are some of the things that make cities 
              liveable, and will be as important in an underground space.<br><br>Andres
               Sevtsuki, Associate Professor of Architecture and Sustainable Design at
               the Singapore University of Technology and Design, said: "We're 
              biological creatures. We like sunlight, we like environments, we like 
              trees and nature, and we like seeing other people.<br><br>"When we build
               cities, when we build urban environments, I think we usually think 
              beyond necessity, we think of ideal environments, because this is where 
              we spend our lives."<br><br>Creating underground cities is still, in 
              many ways, a theoretical fancy. But over the years, authorities have 
              built increasingly taller buildings and added over a fifth of the 
              country's land mass through reclamation alone. Going underground is 
              simply the next frontier, in Singapore's never-ending search for space.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
