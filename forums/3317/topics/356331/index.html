              <p><strong>CRA is prepared to combat crime in IRs </strong></p>
              <p>The Casino Regulatory Authority, or CRA, is ready to combat crime
              and other social problems when the two Integrated Resorts open their
              doors in the near future.</p>
              <p>It has been working with the other local agencies, especially the
              Home Team to meet possible challenges in such areas, said its Chairman,
              Richard Magnus,</p>
              <p>CRA has also tied up with its more experienced international
              counterparts from countries such as the United States and Australia to
              develop its mastery in regulating gaming centres.</p>
              <p>Singapore's first Integrated Resort, the Marina Bay Sands will be opening its doors later this year.</p>
              <p>And in 2010, the republic will witness the launch of its second IR, Resorts World at Sentosa.</p>
              <p>Speaking at CRA's inaugural workplan seminar, Mr Magnus said, to
              shape the policies and regulations that the two attractions have to
              adhere to, the authority will set up a new Casino Licensing Application
              System.</p>
              <p>This technology, the first of its kind to be used by a casino regulator, will be ready by the first half of this year.</p>
              <p>"Technology is used to minimise the hassle and tedium of filling out
              the voluminous Personal History Declaration Form to achieve the
              efficiency for both the regulator and the operator, a pro-business
              initiative without compromising on security."</p>
              <p>Mr Magnus added, over the past three years, CRA has been building a
              core team of officers with the required skills to regulate the casinos
              well.</p>
              <p>They'll import their knowledge to their newer colleagues to hasten the steep learning process.</p>
              <p>"A comprehensive and intensive training preparation plan has also
              been specially developed to train and prepare our officers over the
              next six months to regulate the two casinos."</p>
              <p>CRA also finalised the Technical Standards for Electronic Gaming Machines or EGMs earlier this year.</p>
              <p>"EGMs deployed in our casinos must be fair, secure, reliable and
              auditable. In the casino industry, IT uses and application are a core
              nerve of the operations. Over the next few months, there will be many
              more regulations and standards which we will be publishing."</p>
              <p>Mr Magnus said, the authority has ramped up its recruitment efforts and already employs more than 70 people.</p>
              <p>This is well past the halfway mark of the full staff strength it aims to achieve before the opening of the casinos.</p>
