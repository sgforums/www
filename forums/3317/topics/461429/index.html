              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Non-government organisations (NGO), stakeholders and 
              observers have raised concerns over the government's projection for more
               foreign manpower by 2030.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They wonder if the 
              demand for labour in certain sectors can be met. Others said it is not 
              just about the numbers but also whether Singapore can bring in the best 
              quality of foreign manpower.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>On November 12, the 
              National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) estimated that by 2030, 
              Singapore may need about 150,000 more foreign workers in health care, 
              construction and as maids.<br><br>As Singapore's population ages, demand for health care services, and home-based care will increase.<br><br>Demand for health-care workers could go up to 91,000 in 2030. Of this, 28,000 are projected to be foreign health-care workers.<br><br>Last
               year, there were 13,000 foreign workers out of a total of 50,000. In 
              addition, the demand for foreign domestic workers is expected to 
              increase to a total of 300,000 by 2030, up from the 198,000 maids here 
              last year.<br><br>The construction sector will also require more manpower as the government ramps up infrastructure development.<br><br>The
               NPTD said demand for these workers on low-skilled work permits could 
              range from last year's level of 250,000 to a high of 300,000 by 2030.<br><br>Economist
               from SIM Global Education, Dr Tan Khay Boon, said meeting the demand 
              for foreign labour in some sectors may be a challenge.<br><br>Dr Tan 
              said: "Among all the three areas, the construction sector is more likely
               easier to meet the demand. This is because a large number of foreign 
              workers have been allocated to this sector to meet the infrastructure 
              development requirements.<br><br>"But for the health care sector and the
               foreign domestic workers sector, this is more difficult to meet the 
              demand. Mainly because these type of jobs locals find it less attractive
               and on top of that the supply of the domestic workers is limited 
              probably due to the high economic growth rate in Indonesia and 
              Philippines."<br><br>NGOs are also concerned about the quality of 
              foreign manpower coming into Singapore as the country grapples with the 
              issue of raising productivity.<br><br>Bridget Tan, president and founder
               of the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME), said: 
              "We know there are other locations like Hong Kong that seems to attract 
              the better quality migrant workers that are going out of the country 
              because conditions of work in Hong Kong is much better than conditions 
              of work in Singapore.<br><br>"This is the truth especially when we come 
              to talk about the laws that protect migrant workers. Will we be 
              attracting the right kind that will be coming in? We have to address 
              those - the right skills and right quality of manpower that will also be
               productive in Singapore."<br><br>Sue Nurses Agency's director Susan Ng shared the same concern.<br><br>"Our
               main concern is to train a better pool to see what kind of health care 
              workers should we recruit and what sort of training we should give and 
              how much can they (provide) benefit to our people or elderly who needs 
              these sort of care," said Ms Ng.<br><br>As the number of foreign workers increases, Ms Tan hopes there will be sufficient infrastructure to support them.<br><br>Ms
               Tan said: "For example, if they have a day off, what kind of amenities 
              do we have in place to welcome these people without creating concerns 
              and alarm among Singaporeans. Do we have enough space for housing of 
              these foreign workers coming in here recreational space for them and 
              other facilities to make their lives in Singapore a place where they can
               also call a second home."<br><br>The government has said that the estimated increases in foreign manpower are not targets.<br><br>They reflect changes in the demand for workers based on demographic trends.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>cannt help already lah. one two generation ago we already died in the hands of the f-stop2 2 f-stop, stop at 2 policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but its no gimicks, in low light photography, using even f1.0 lens you will still need a full frame monster DSLR with superb ISO noise handling capability in order to light the image up. keeping fstop big will have the shortfall of a soft image that's why most pro-photogs badae about their artistic photos are like that- its not like that - its boh bian the best course of action hhahahhaheheheheh</p>

              <p>The current favoured foreigners from India ,,,,,   many of the workers from this country have proven they have bad skills and bad attitude in the building and construction industry.     the MIW govt cannot be bothered to try their best to get good quality workers.</p>
