              <p>It was supposed to be a graduation trip to Singapore for a group of 
              Malaysian primary school students, but now, their teachers and principal
               are accused of abandoning them to visit the casino.</p>
              <p>According to a Kuala Lumpur-based newspaper report, a student’s 
              parent had complained about the teachers and principal’s ‘irresponsible 
              behaviour’ during the trip.</p>
              <p>The irate mother of the student said she paid more than S$340 for her
               daughter’s four day school graduation trip to Singapore. The 140 
              students were accompanied by 14 teachers and their principal.</p>
              <p>It is believed that a majority of the teachers and principal 
              allegedly left the hotel at about 11pm to visit the casino on the first 
              night. However, it was not stated which hotel they stayed in or the 
              casino they visited.</p>
              <p>An angry parent revealed that a teacher was supposed to share a room 
              with her daughter who had a fever but the teacher could not be located. 
              Her daughter was left to wait in her own room with her friend till past 
              11pm.</p>
              <p>The girls were then told by the tour guide that the group of teachers
               and principal had visited the casino, and only a few teachers were in 
              the hotel. The teachers and principal are reported to have returned to 
              the hotel at 1am.</p>
              <p>However, besides visiting the casino, the same group of teachers and 
              principal are also accused of leaving the kids with the tour guide and a
               few other teachers at the Singapore Science Centre to go shopping.</p>
              <p>The same parent told the paper that she was unhappy with the 
              behaviour of the teachers who were supposed to be in charge of the 
              students, but acted without a sense of responsibility.</p>
              <p>“During an overseas trip like this, teachers should ensure the safety
               of the kids as a top priority and not leave them as and when they feel 
              like it. Leaving the kids to go to the casino is atrocious.</p>
              <p>“What if something had happened to them? Who will take responsibility?”</p>
              <p>A teacher from the group, who later admitted that they visited the 
              casino during the trip, apologised to the parent for the distress caused
               by their actions and said, “as teachers, we should not have abandoned 
              our students to go to the casino.”</p>
              <p>Some parents Yahoo! Singapore spoke to were shocked to hear about the incident.</p>
              <p>Said events manger Erik Ng, 36, “It was really irresponsible of the 
              teachers and the principal to do such a thing. I certainly can relate to
               how the parent was feeling for her daughter who was ill.”</p>
              <p>Mohd Azhar, 32, who has two kids, agreed. He said, “Action should be 
              taken against the group for leaving the kids to visit the casino. I hope
               our local schools here have strict guidelines for teachers when it 
              comes to excursions and overseas trips.”</p>

              <p>I guess the problem here is about them going to the casino.
              If they had, say, gone for supper, then it would have sounded better.
              That said, the teacher who was supposed to look after the sick kid was extremely irresponsible. She should have at least asked a colleague to take over.</p>
