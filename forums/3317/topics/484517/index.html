              <p>SINGAPORE: A new maritime simulation centre was launched on Friday, as part of a plan to attract more Singaporeans to join the industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The centre, which costs some S$4 million, boasts state-of-the-art facilities -- including engine room and liquid cargo handling simulators, the latest 240-degree full mission bridge simulator, as well as an electronic chart display and information system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Called the Wavelink Maritime Simulation Centre, it is one of the first few maritime institutes in Singapore to house four simulation systems in one location.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will allow maritime officers to get more effective hands-on training in various aspects such as ship manoeuvring and resource management, and prepare themselves for extreme conditions and emergencies without being put through real risks and danger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They can also learn to use shipboard equipment such as electronic charts, automatic identification systems and radar plotting aids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The centre, which is housed at the Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability Institute in Jurong, is owned by the Singapore Maritime Officers' Union (SMOU).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By enhancing the training of maritime cadets and officers, the union hopes more Singaporeans will consider seafaring as a career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMOU General Secretary Mary Liew said: "Traditionally, seafaring skills are very much time-based learning, that is the longer you work onboard a ship, the better skills you have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But now with simulation training, the cadets and officers' skills are accelerated with real-time feedback in a risk-free environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Thus, they become better officers, have better jobs and better lives. It is a win-win situation for them as well as the shipping companies."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a small country that is highly dependent on international trade, the maritime industry is a core pillar of Singapore's economic development.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It contributes seven per cent of Singapore's GDP and provides 170,000 jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But out of some 20,000 officers in more than 4,200 Singapore-flagged ships, only 1,605 are Singaporeans. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Liew added: "With this new set-up, the Wavelink Maritime Simulation Centre, we can actually train a thousand (officers) per year, and we look forward to training more of our seafarers, and to give them a hands-on experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Hopefully, we attract more Singaporeans, for them to be more aware of such a career."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress, Mr Lim Swee Say, was also at the launch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He assured the audience that the government and unions will help as many Singaporeans as possible to move into the sector, which offers good career prospects and good salaries. </p>
