              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The government will put in place more safeguards to protect Singaporeans from problem gambling.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Ministry of 
              Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) intends to expand its 
              list of third-party exclusion orders beyond those who are bankrupt and 
              on public assistance allowance.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Acting Minister Chan
               Chun Sing said these may include those who are receiving some form of 
              government social assistance, such as a select group receiving 
              assistance from the Community Care Endowment Fund (ComCare).<br><br>The ministry is also studying what it calls "circuit breakers", which are used by casinos in Holland, Australia and Austria.<br><br>They
               work by placing limits on betting machines and getting casinos to form 
              dedicated teams of in-house experts on problem gambling.<br><br>Mr Chan said these new safeguards may be implemented over the next few months, in consultation with stakeholders.<br><br>He
               outlined these plans on the back of findings released on Thursday, 
              showing that more low-income gamblers are betting large amounts while 
              frequent gamblers and those with poor self-control are gambling more 
              often.<br><br>These observations came from a 2011 Survey On Gambling 
              Participation among Singapore residents, conducted by the National 
              Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG).<br><br>The survey found that the proportion of low-income gamblers increased from 0.8 per cent in 2008 to 6 per cent in 2011.<br><br>These gamblers have an average monthly betting amount of more than S$1,000.<br><br>The survey said the overall median monthly betting amount fell from S$100 in 2008 to S$40 in 2011.<br><br>But the average amount rose from S$176 to S$212 over the same period, especially for low-income gamblers.<br><br>While the majority gambled with lower amounts, there was an increase in the number who betted large amounts.<br><br>This is especially so for the low-income gamblers.<br><br>The survey found that probable pathological gamblers (PPGs) betted more frequently.<br><br>A pathological gambler is someone who cannot resist impulses to gamble.<br><br>It said 68 per cent of PPGs gambled at least once a week, compared with 43 per cent for all gamblers.<br><br>PPGs are much more likely than non-PPG gamblers to have poor self-control in gambling.<br><br>They are likely to bet larger amounts, gamble more frequently and spend more time gambling.<br><br>These apply to horse racing, online and casino gamblers.<br><br>Overall, there has been a decline in gambling.<br><br>Forty-seven
               per cent of Singapore residents aged 18 years and above have 
              participated in some form of gambling activity over a one-year period, 
              lower than the 54 per cent in the 2008 survey. <br><br>Problem gambling 
              rates are stable and have not changed significantly from 2008, based on 
              the probable pathological and problem gambling rates for Singapore 
              residents.<br><br>The pathological gambling rate for 2011 is 1.4 per cent, compared with 1.2 per cent in 2008. <br><br>The rate for probable gambling for 2011 is 1.2 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent in 2008. <br><br>Chairman of NCPG, Mr Lim Hock San, said the survey highlighted several focal areas to work on.<br><br>He said the council must continue to help problem-gamblers overcome their problem.<br><br>It
               must also continue to educate the public on the dangers of problem 
              gambling, as well as ensure that there are adequate services in the 
              community to help those who are addicted to gambling.<br><br>About 
              200,000 Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) visited the two local
               casinos in 2011 but the novelty appears to be wearing off.<br><br>Marina
               Bay Sands (MBS) said 150,691 Singaporeans and PRs visited its casino 
              from the opening date on 27 April 2010 to 31 December 2010.<br><br>In the year that ended on 31 December 2011, the number was 137,259.<br><br>The
               other gaming operator, Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), said its entry-levy
               records show that the number of Singaporean and PR visitors at its 
              casino fell from 199,783 in 2010 to 136,434 in 2011.<br><br>MBS said it is committed to working closely with MCYS and NCPG to promote responsible gaming on its premises.<br><br>A
               spokesperson said MBS is committed to providing information and 
              guidance to its guests on the rules and regulations that govern the 
              casino environment in Singapore.<br><br>In addition to the social safeguards already in place, MBS has an in-house training programme to educate all team members.<br><br>It
               also has highly visible signages and educational posters in its 
              Back-of-House areas as well as Responsible Gaming literature on its 
              premises with phone numbers and  information for patrons who need 
              assistance. <br><br>MBS said it has noted the additional social 
              safeguard measures being implemented by the Singapore government and 
              will continue to work in a cooperative and collaborative manner with 
              regulatory authorities.<br><br>RWS said it strongly supports the 
              government's initiative to protect Singaporeans from pathological 
              gambling. It also welcomed the measures to exclude recipients on social 
              assistance from gambling in the casinos. <br><br>RWS said that as good 
              corporate citizen and long-term establishment employing 14,000 workers 
              in Singapore, it  believes in improving the community it operates in.<br><br>It added that this philosophy underpins its advocacy for responsible gambling.  <br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p><br>as much as i want to agree with you, but it won't solve the problems. it may reduce the problems significantly, yes, but it won't solve the problems.</p>
              <p>where there's money to be made, illegal operators will step in because they want to make the money. and where there's the illegal operators, there will also be customers.</p>
