              <p>Lianhe Wanbao reports that the Everitt Road dispute has re-kindled.</p>
              <p>The saga between the Joo Chiat neighbours once grabbed headlines as seven families engaged in a vicious cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation, drawing in the police, lawyers and an MP.</p>
              <p>The Loh family has lodged a new police report against Ms Chan Soo Yin, 45, who allegedly attacked their daughter's car with a bag of cat faeces.</p>
              <p>Madam Loh, 68, told Wanbao that Miss Chan has been harassing her daughter almost everyday for about a month now.
                  
                  In a video filmed by the Lohs, Ms Chan hit her daughter's car door a bag of what she claimed was cat faeces as she drove out of their house.</p>
              <p>She also waved her hand in front of her nose to show that the contents of the bag were foul and smelly.
                  
                  The Lohs has handed the footage to the police as evidence and Ms Loh has since moved out to stay with her brother.
                  
                  Miss Chan, a 45-year-old teacher, and her father were fined four times between 2004 and 2007 for harrassing their neighbours.</p>
              <p>According to earlier reports in The Straits Times, the Chan family's disputes with their neighbours started as early as 15 years ago over parking space and has involved chains, locks, video cameras and allegations of abuse on both sides.</p>
              <p>Miss Chan was even told off by a judge in 2006 when she appealed against a fine of $2,000 for behaving in an insulting manner to a neighbour.
                  
                  Justice Tay Yong Kwang described her behaviour as "deplorably infantile", and said "I think a person of her high educational standing should not have to descend so low".</p>
              <p>Ms Chan had uttered the words "masturbation expert" within earshot of Madam Teo Suan Moy in July 2004. Her father, Mr Chan Cheng Khoon, was also fined after a court found him guilty of insulting the two women by simulating masturbation in front of them.</p>
              <p>According to Lianhe Wanbao, after her 2006 appeal failed, she filed magistrates complaints against eight neighbours for harassing her. She claims that she is willing to settle if they will apologise.
                  
                  She also claims that relations among the neighbours have improved since she took legal action against them.</p>
              <p>Chan Soo Yin was formerly a junior college teacher; she now teaches part-time at a private school.</p>
