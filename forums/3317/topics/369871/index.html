              <p>Despite this tough economic climate, many job seekers are still picky about the kind of jobs they are willing to take on.</p>
              <p>Unveiling its report card at its annual meeting today, the South
              West Community Development Council or CDC found that 40% of job seekers
              still have unrealistic expectations.</p>
              <p>The District received some 6400 job applications from April 2008 to March this year.</p>
              <p>Nearly half of those seeking employment assistance through the South
              West CDC are unreceptive to different work environments and have
              overblown pay expectations.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the South West CDC District meeting, Finance Minister
              and Adviser to Jurong GRC Grassroots Organisation, Tharman
              Shanmugaratnam says strengthening and improving the attitudes of these
              workers is a challenge.</p>
              <p>Typical job requests include regular working hours, proximity of
              workplace to home, an air-conditioned workplace, and unrealistic
              salaries.</p>
              <p>"But these are adjustments that all of us have to make, and frankly
              if you look at the adjustments being made by people in Korea, Taiwan,
              Hong Kong, they are very ready to take on any job. No job is beneath a
              person. If it is an honest job, involves hard work, nothing is beneath
              us."</p>
              <p>Mayor for South West CDC Amy Khor believes that time is needed to help these residents change their employment attitudes.</p>
              <p>She doesn't think it's due to complacency, but it's useful to understand their situation.</p>
              <p>"I think to a certain extend it is understandable for people who
              have been so used to a particular job, particular environment, it is
              understandable that once you get used to such an environment it is
              difficult to try and adapt and change into a different sector and take
              up a different job. So, time is really needed to help them to adapt and
              change their expectations and mindset."</p>
              <p>Dr Khor adds that to help this group, the CDC is taking extra effort
              and time to counsel, put them through mindset training workshops, and
              encourage them to be more receptive.</p>
              <p>Reflecting the weakening economic climate and jobs market, the CDC
              says the number of employment assistance applications it has received
              rose by 48% to about 6400 compared to the previous fiscal year.</p>
              <p>Of these, the CDC placed more than 2700 job seekers.</p>
              <p>However, the average number of job applications for May and June has shown a decline of about 29%.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Typical job requests include regular working hours, proximity of workplace to home, an air-conditioned workplace, and unrealistic salaries.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Would they care to elaborate what kind of jobs that have people unwilling to adjust? Because if its retail, hotel, security, cleaning jobs, i believe there is a certain standard range of salaries offered though there may be some fluctuations depending on firms. So generally those in the industry would know what is the market rate for such jobs.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Are the jobs offered to these people based on the Mkt Rates or is it a clear-cut exploitation by companies on the predicament &amp; the environmnet of these people? Adjustments are definately necessary, the question is to what degree? The purpose of working is to bring food on the table for oneself/ family &amp; cover all household/home expenses.<br>If the salary of the job is unable to accomplsh this, then how does taking a job solve this problem? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Its certainly easy to say people are picky, rather than look at the kind of jobs that SG creates. We have gone into a knowledge based industry, &amp; the those industries remaining in SG are generic industries, which cannot pay well, due to our high operating cost including Singaporean salaries.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">That is why we have some foreigners helping out in these industries. They can accept lower salaries bcause the money is remitted back to their own countries where the standard of living is cheaper. How much does it take to raise &amp; feed a family in Singapore? (Excluding retirement &amp; children's education?)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Do your numbers &amp; perhaps it might explain why some ppl are picky abt jobs, at the end of the day, it takes to 2 hands to clap. let's us never forget that.         </p>
