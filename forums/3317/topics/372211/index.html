              <div>
              <p>Upgrade your skills or be left behind.</p>
              <p>That's advice from 58 year old Gunalan Chelliah, the proud grandfather of two young children.</p>
              <p>And to prove that he himself walks the talk, he's got himself something not many other grand-dads have.</p>
              <p>Mr Chelliah graduated today from Temasek Polytechnic with a Diploma in Police Studies and Security Management.</p>
              <p>He explains why he took up the course.</p>
              <p>"You either have to go and study to acquire skills and knowledge or
              otherwise I don't think there's any other way. Because being old,
              nobody will accept us to go work in a factory or somewhere. This is the
              only avenue I feel will help us to acquire knowledge."</p>
              <p>Mr Chelliah was the oldest person taking centre stage at the Graduation Ceremony of five part time courses today.</p>
              <p>The road to the diploma wasn't easy.</p>
              <p>He says the main challenge was competing with students who were about half his age.</p>
              <p>"I left school in 1969, now it's already a very different concept
              compared to 36 years ago. For about 6 months I had difficulty in
              understanding and coping with the course. And apart from that, you have
              to keep pace with the younger students. Their way of doing things is
              very fast! But I put in extra effort and I managed to cope with it."</p>
              <p>As for now, he is already on the way to his next education milestone.</p>
              <p>He is pursuing a degree in Security Management at Singapore Manufacturing Federation's School of Management or SMa.</p>
              <p>And though Mr Chelliah says the old have to be the ones picking up the pace, another party also needs to play a part.</p>
              <p>"The government has to give a helping hand for the old people to
              continue their studies. I'm also having financial constraints. You
              know, doing a degree is not cheap. So I'm also looking forward to see
              any avenues where I can get help."</p>
