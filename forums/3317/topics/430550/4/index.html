              <h1 class="storyheadline">PUB warning on water tank security</h1>
              <p>THE national water agency has reminded town councils and building 
              owners to be more vigilant about allowing access to water storage tanks,
               after the body of an Indonesian maid was found in an HDB rooftop water 
              storage tank on Monday.</p>
              <p>In a statement on Thursday evening, PUB said it takes a 'serious 
              view' of the security of water storage tanks, and has in the past fined 
              town councils, Management Committee Strata Titles (MCSTs), and building 
              owners for offences such as leaving doors to tanks and covers unlocked.</p>
              <p>Annually, the PUB carries out regular spot checks on about 30 per 
              cent of the 14,000 buildings in Singapore with water storage tanks, in 
              addition to regular reminders about proper maintenance and security of 
              rooftop water tanks.</p>
              <p>Between 2007 and last month, the PUB issued 12 summonses - 
              ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 - to building owners, MCSTs, and town 
              councils for not ensuring the security of water tanks.</p>
              <p>PUB declined to comment on whether Sembawang Town Council 
              would be censured in the light of Monday's incident, citing ongoing 
              police investigations.</p>
              <p>The grisly find atop a Woodlands block has, however, raised 
              questions among residents over how strict the town council is about 
              access to potentially sensitive areas like HDB block rooftops, which 
              house water tanks.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Woodlands water tank could be closed down</h1>
              <p>A ROOFTOP water storage tank in which the body of an Indonesian maid 
              was found on Monday could end up being taken out of use, MP for 
              Sembawang GRC Vikram Nair said on Friday.</p>
              <p>Spooked residents in Block 686B, Woodlands Drive 73, which has 149 units, remain queasy about drinking water from the tank.</p>
              <p>'While the tank has been completely cleansed, some residents are not comfortable psychologically,' Mr Nair added.</p>
              <p>He has been in discussion with Sembawang Town Council and 
              national water agency PUB on how viable it would be to depend on the 
              remaining seven water tanks to supply water to the entire block.</p>
              <p>'It is being discussed and we are looking to see what we can
               do about it,' he said, adding that the discussions were still in the 
              preliminary stages.</p>
              <p>Currently, one set of four water tanks, including the one in
               which 30-year-old Ruliyawati's body was found, is still not in use. 
              Bangladeshi cleaner Md Repon Mostafa, 27, was charged on Wednesday with 
              her murder. Her body was flown home to Semarang in Java on Friday.</p>

              <p>The most the block has to lose is a lower supply should the mains get cut off, because blocks have the capacity of at least half a day's worth of water should the mains get cut, and maybe a lower water pressure to the higher floor units.</p>
              <p>What the town council can do might be to tender out a contract to remove and reinstall a new one. But to contract out just to remove and replace one tank is seriously a waste of good money. It makes more economical sense to get a contract to replace the whole set.The sub contractor in this case has to remove the old one, bring in the new one, install it, and commission it, just one tank, seriously not worth the money.</p>

              <p><strong>Town councils looking to step up supervision of rooftop work</strong></p>
              <p>TOWN councils may soon step up supervision for work carried out on 
              HDB rooftops, as a way to tighten the security of water storage tanks, 
              said Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP Town Councils.</p>
              <p>'We have to be more alert and vigilant, and I will discuss this with 
              the town council general managers, as well as get advice from the 
              police,' he told The Straits Times yesterday.</p>
              <p>He made the comments in light of Monday's incident, where a 
              Bangladeshi cleaner is alleged to have gained access to a rooftop water 
              storage tank in Woodlands before dumping the body of an Indonesian maid 
              there. The cleaner, who is believed to have had keys to the roof, has 
              been charged with her murder.</p>
              <p>It has raised questions about how strict town councils are about 
              access to potentially sensitive areas like HDB block rooftops, which 
              house water tanks.</p>
              <p>Dr Teo said town councils will reassess if there is a need for 
              property managers and supervisors to maintain greater on-site presence 
              when work is carried out on the rooftop. Any work that is carried out on
               the roof is supervised. But there is no rule stipulating how long 
              supervisors must remain on-site, as the duration of the work can vary.</p>
              <p>Dr Teo described what happened on Monday as a 'remote incident', and 
              said that in his 20 years of managing town councils, he had come across 
              only one rooftop breach. That was in 1994, when a group of teenagers cut
               the lock on the roof access door and went up to 'enjoy the scenery'.</p>
              <p>Dr Teo had on Thursday assured Singapore's HDB residents that town 
              councils require doors to roofs and individual water tanks to be 
              padlocked. An added security measure has been put in place since the 
              incident - only town council staff and emergency units, such as lift 
              rescue crew, will have roof access.</p>
              <p>Newly elected MP for Sembawang GRC Vikram Nair said it is still 
              unclear how the Bangladeshi cleaner, who is hired by a town 
              council-appointed subcontractor, had gained access to the water tanks. 
              According to Mr Nair, the subcontractor who oversaw the cleaner was not 
              supposed to have a key to the roof.</p>
              <p>'So something went wrong here, and we don't know whose fault it is. 
              The police are investigating and we will have to wait for it to come out
               in court before we know exactly what happened,' he said.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Woodlands residents voice anger</h1>
              <p>ABOUT 150 angry Woodlands Drive residents took their town council to 
              task on Saturday for its lack of transparency and failure to keep its 
              water tanks safe.</p>
              <p>They had showed up at a dialogue session at the void deck of Block 
              686B in Woodlands Drive 75 - the block where an Indonesian maid was 
              allegedly murdered and thrown into a water tank last week.</p>
              <p>All wanted to know one thing: Why didn't the town council tell them to stop consuming the water immediately?</p>
              <p>The police received a call at about 10am last Monday about a
               body found in the tank. Water supply to the block was cut off an hour 
              later, after which residents were handed notices that said maintenance 
              work was being done. But many said they still consumed the water from 
              the affected tank, the residual amount left in the pipes, till as late 
              as 5pm that day.</p>
              <p>'The town council should have told us more. I was still 
              using the water to bathe and rinse my mouth,' said resident Edwin Hong, 
              40, at the dialogue attended by representatives from the town council, 
              the Public Utilities Board and Sembawang GRC MP Vikram Nair.</p>
              <p>'Maybe they could not tell us exactly what happened. But at 
              the very least, they should have told us not to consume the water due to
               suspected contamination.'</p>

              <p><strong>Woodlands residents want new water tank</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Residents of Woodlands block 686B are pressing for a 
              new water tank to replace the one where an Indonesian maid's body was 
              found on Monday. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This was the top 
              issue raised at a dialogue session held on Saturday afternoon with 
              member of parliament (MP) Vikram Nair and Town Council members. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The residents made a
               collective call for a new water tank, CCTV surveillance of the rooftop,
               and even a change in the Town Council management.<br><br>Residents expressed anger and concern during the two-hour dialogue. <br><br>MP
               for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Vikram Nair said:
               "I understand where they're coming from. If I had a dead body (in my 
              water tank),I would be just as upset; I'd want to know what went wrong".<br><br>Responding to some residents' requests, eight religious leaders held a blessing ceremony at the lift landing and rooftop. <br><br>Town
               Council general manager Soon Min Sin apologised to residents for not 
              alerting them as soon as it was discovered that water may be 
              contaminated. <br><br>On Monday, the Town Council had issued a written 
              notice to residents informing them that the water supply will be shut 
              off for maintenance purposes, without explaining that the water may be 
              contaminated.<br><br>As for a new water tank, no fixed answers were given on Saturday, but Mr Nair said he will look into every request.<br><br>"In
               the meantime, changing the locks and restricting the keys to only Town 
              Council staff will prevent this situation from happening again," Mr Nair
               said. <br><br>"But obviously, there's never enough security; you can 
              always put in more at higher cost so the question is, at what point do 
              you say it's enough?"<br><br>Although Mr Nair said he sensed that money 
              was often not the issue, he said residents could approach him or the 
              Town Council to reimburse medical bills for any related illnesses. <br><br>A
               S$10 utilities rebate is also offered as compensation for the 
              authorities' request for residents to run their taps for five minutes 
              before initial use.<br><br>Resident Samantha Guo said they have gathered more than 61 signatures from residents, and they may be filing a petition. <br><br>"There
               are people who're affected by this -- (we) can't sleep, (we) don't 
              drink (water from our tap, and we) go to (our) parents' place to 
              shower," she said, adding that she would be satisfied if the affected 
              tank was replaced.<br><br>Resident Eric Khoo said: "There's some 
              sincerity from the MP to help us with some clarification. But overall, 
              there're still a lot of unanswered questions and a lot more queries 
              among the residents".<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>i think the rsidence did the right thing. no longer should we singaorens have to sunk so low and eat the humble pie.</p>
              <p>they should take the town council to court, force them to review their SOPs, and see if indeed there is a rule for securing the water tank but they never practise it. who is the lightning mp for this one? what he / she doing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and down to the sweeper we should review the kind of foreign trash we let into the country! what a married maid doing probaly hanky panky with the bangla. and the bangla single or married? we should hire only married ones, who got family back home. they will know they cum here work, not hanky panky.</p>
              <p>this is very serious. not oinly water tank. the water already flow through the pipes! the whole water supply system's already contaminated! so what cange water tanks aslo must change the whole building pipes, and this is going to be more complicated and troublesome - to the residences!</p>
              <h1>what is town council, mp doing?! worse want to install CCTV? for what? another patent PAPPY one size fits all solution! what the MOM doing? letting this type of trash into the country! we should have more citizen patrol, the more the merrier and do night patrols also, lots of bangls liggering in groups late at night, drinking and peeing all over the place like stray dogs. we had controled the strays now we have bigger sized ones, let in by our very own mom !</h1>
