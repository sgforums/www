              <p><strong>Any health risk? It depends on the facts</strong></p>
              <p>A DOCTOR specialising in infectious diseases advised residents of the
               Woodlands block where a body was found in a water tank to stay calm as 
              the full facts were not yet known.</p>
              <p>Two critical issues were: how long the body was in the tank and the extent of decomposition.</p>
              <p>The doctor said that if a body was submerged for more than 24 hours, 
              there could be bacterial contamination caused by decomposition and the 
              water would smell too.</p>
              <p>But information pieced together from residents of Block 686B, 
              Woodlands Drive 73 yesterday suggests that the body might have been in 
              the tank for only a few hours.</p>
              <p>Some said they heard screams at 7am, and the police were informed 
              about the body at 10am. Water supply from the rooftop tanks was cut off 
              at 11am.</p>
              <p>The doctor who spoke to The Straits Times said: 'If there is 
              bacterial contamination of the water, those who drink the water may 
              experience symptoms such as stomach ache, diarrhoea and vomiting.'</p>
              <p>None of the residents interviewed had such symptoms. While some 
              noticed that the water was discoloured or 'bubbly', nobody complained of
               smell.</p>

              <p>All water tanks MUST be locked. It they are locked, the padlocks are usually rusty and cannot be opened. Therefore they are broken, and not replaced.</p>
              <p>Tanks are to be cleaned once a year on notice from the PUB, most of the keys are useless or can't be found. And access to roof top not locked.</p>
              <p> I believe after this, all town councils and building managing agents will be made to secure their water tanks.</p>
              <p>Presently the licensed plumbers only advises, must lock ah, or PUB fine, but no action taken.</p>

              <p>You sound like you live at Blk 686B Woodlands  Drive 73 and drank some water direct from the tap.</p>
              <p>If checked, most of the roof top access and water tank would be locked. Some would be not locked, why? I have given the reasons.</p>
              <p>The locked ones present no problems, it is the unlocked or vandalised roof top access that give rise to problems. Like I say people go up there to play cards, to have sex, to hide dead maids. Some smash the locks to go to the roof tops, some find the locks already broken.</p>
              <p>These are always mended asap. Only the water tanks pad locks, if they are damaged will take time to replace, because have to look for master key type, reasonably priced, outdoor type, HOD approval etc.</p>
              <p>But the fact that this Bangla, carried a body up to the roof top, up the water tank, and dump the body inside the tank give rise to concern because this is one incident too many.</p>
              <p>Definitely sterner action will be taken because of this incident.</p>
