              <p><strong>Body found in rooftop water tank</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A 30-year-old Indonesian woman was found dead in a 
              water tank on the rooftop of Blk 686B Woodlands Drive 73. Police has 
              classified the case as murder.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Police were alerted to the to the body of the woman in the water tank, said to be about 1.5 metres wide, at about 10am.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It is understood that blood stains were found in the water tank.<br><br>Water supplies for those living at Block 686B came to a halt at about 11am.<br><br>Notices were put up by the town council, informing residents about the disruption.<br><br>Residents of the 15-storey block had to lug buckets of water from the washing area at the void deck.<br><br>PUB
               said it received a report of the incident at Blk 686B, which is under 
              the purview of Sembawang Town Council, at 3.30pm on Monday.<br><br>PUB 
              said the Sembawang town council immediately isolated all the tanks 
              serving the block once it was informed of the incident. There are eight 
              water tanks servicing the block.<br><br>Washing, flushing and sterilising works of tanks and distribution pipes began immediately.<br><br>PUB said officers were also on site to assist the town council, and also provided water bags and a water tanker.<br><br>The national water agency, PUB, said water supply is expected to be restored by midnight.<br><br>A
               resident said she felt like vomiting after she got word of the murder. 
              She said she will take precautions for fear that the water had been 
              contaminated.<br><br>"This morning, I used the water for cooking, But 
              now I have to go home and throw it all away. I asked if we could bathe, 
              the people in charge said better not. When I found out, I thought it was
               horrific."<br><br>Another resident was resigned to what has happened. She said: "I'm not scared, I already cooked with it, I'm not scared."<br><br>The deceased had long hair and was found in a T-shirt and bermudas. She was pronounced dead at 1pm.<br><br>It is believed that she works with a family living in the block where she was found.<br><br>One of the lifts at the block was also out of order, with some residents saying that they saw blood stains in the lift.<br><br>A 27-year-old Bangladeshi has been arrested in connection to the case.<br><br>A resident living in the opposite block said he saw the suspect being arrested at about the same time.<br><br>He
               said: "I saw an Indian man, wearing light green colour shirt caught by 
              the police officers. Don't know what happened, did not hear any kind of 
              loud noise or anything like this."<br><br>Some residents living on the highest floor said they heard loud voices of people quarrelling early in the morning.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>Hi, i know you have a good heart. What do you want us to say? My condolences to the family of the foreign worker?</p>
              <p>Yes. Her death is tragic and shocking. The thing is the aftermath of her death has brought lots of issues and inconvenience</p>
              <p>This foreign worker is ruthless and he has no considerations for anybody. He should be prosecuted and sentenced to death.</p>

              <p>He probably had access to the roof, he was damn patient with squeezing the body thru the tank manhole, he must have help, its near impossible for one to traverse the access ladder up the fibreglass tank carrying a body, break open the lock, and slide the body thru the manhole.</p>
