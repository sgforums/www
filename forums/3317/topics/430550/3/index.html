              <p>THE water at a Woodlands block where a dead body was found in a 
              rooftop water tank on Monday has been deemed safe for consumption.</p>
              <p>This, after the affected tank and three others were shut off, while 
              flushing, washing and sterilisation of an unaffected set of four water 
              tanks also serving the block were carried out.</p>
              <p>In a statement on Tuesday, national water agency PUB said it had 
              confirmed that the water was 'safe for consumption before the supply was
               restored at 2am this morning'.</p>
              <p>It added that the Sembawang Town Council had also flushed the pipes of the tanks.</p>
              <p>The statement also added that the four affected tanks are 
              being cleaned and sterilised and will be put back into use only after 
              water samples from the tanks have passed laboratory tests.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, the town council and PUB officers went door to 
              door to reassure residents the water was safe for drinking and advised 
              them to run their taps for five minutes as a precaution.</p>

              <p>A BANGLADESHI maintenance worker was charged with the murder of an 
              Indonesian domestic worker at the rooftop of a block of flats in 
              Woodlands.</p>
              <p>Md Bepon Mostafa, 27, is alleged to have caused the death of Ms

              9.54am on Monday.</p>

              <p>Ms Ruliyawati, married with a child, had been working for an employer on the sixth floor of the block.</p>
              <p>Mostafa was remanded for investigation at Central police division lock-up for a week.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Maid's death: Curb on access to tanks</h1>
              <p>THE Sembawang Town Council (STC) is restricting access to rooftop 
              water tanks so that only town council staff have access, in the light of
               the murder of an Indonesian maid on Monday.</p>
              <p>The body of Ms Ruliyawati, 30, was discovered in a water tank serving
               the residents of Block 686B, Woodlands Drive 73. On Wednesday, 
              Bangladeshi cleaner Repon Mostafa, 27, was charged with murdering her 
              between 7.10am and 9.54am on Monday.</p>
              <p>The grisly circumstances of the incident has raised questions among 
              residents about how strict the town council is about access to 
              potentially sensitive areas like HDB block rooftops, which house water 
              tanks.</p>
              <p>STC general manager Soon Min Sin told The Straits Times that
               as of Wednesday, keys to the water tanks would be given only to town 
              council staff.</p>
              <p>He added that the locks on all eight tanks in Block 686B have also been replaced.</p>
              <p>While the lift repair crew has keys to the roof, they will not have access to the water tanks.</p>
