              <p>THE Sembawang Town Council has agreed to replace the water tank at a 
              Woodlands Housing Board block in which an Indonesian maid's body was 
              found last Monday.</p>
              <p>Its general manager Soon Min Sin said that the town council had met up with engineers and contractors over the past few days.</p>
              <p>'A plan has been drawn up to replace the existing tank with a new 
              one. Work will start once the relevant authorities have given their 
              approval, he said, adding that the submissions will be handed to them 
              soon.</p>
              <p>'We studied the residents' suggestions and found that this was feasible, so we decided to act quickly and replace it.'</p>
              <p>The town council is in the midst of informing residents of its decision.</p>
              <p>So far, 84 residents at the affected Block 686B in Woodlands
               Drive 73 have signed a petition for the tank to be replaced. About 150 
              attended a dialogue last Saturday to air their grievances.</p>

              <p>isnt it common sense to replace the tank immediately instead of coming up with half baked solutions?  its amazing they need people to give them suggestions.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Hougang SMC explains its water tank guidelines</h1>
              <p>LAST week saw an uproar among residents of Block 686B Woodlands Drive
               73 about security following the discovery of a dead maid's body in one 
              of the water tanks on the rooftop.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Hougang SMC (Single Member Constituency) posted the 
              following note at 2.09pm on its Facebook page (carried exactly as posted
               below):</p>
              <p>'In view of the recent unfortunate 'body in water tank' incident, 
              there were concerns raised about water tanks' security &amp; safety 
              issues across the island. To help residents better understand the 
              processes Hougang Town Council (HGTC) put in place, below are HGTC's 
              water tanks' safety guidelines enforced throughout the years.</p>
              <p>'All water tanks in the HDB blocks of Hougang SMC (Single 
              Member Constituency) Estate are locked. Cleaners do not have access but 
              if they are required to access the roof to do any cleaning works, a HGTC
               officer is required to be present to monitor and check the works.</p>
              <p>'The access door to the roof is also locked and the keys to 
              access the locks are securitised in that these cannot be duplicated at 
              any shop except by the manufacturer who can only do so with the 
              authorisation by HGTC. The locks to the access door to the roof are 
              different from that used to lock the water tanks. Any personnel given 
              access to the roof must first be authorised by the company that has a 
              contract with HGTC or statutory boards.</p>
              <p>'Existing at the roof tops of HDB blocks are various 
              services which various authorities either directly or through their 
              assigns may want access to at one time or another. To accommodate this, 
              HGTC endeavors to maintain the current system of using only securitised 
              padlocks accompanied by very stringent enforcement actions...'</p>

              <p>WATER tanks in Singapore will come under new and stricter security 
              requirements from July 1 2011, said the national water agency PUB on 
              Friday.</p>
              <p>These include more restrictive access to the tanks and mandatory supervision of any maintenance work.</p>
              <p>The agency will also check all 14,000 buildings with water tanks here
               after July 1, to make sure the new measures have been followed.</p>
              <p>It said it will monitor the situation and take further action if needed.</p>
              <p>The new measures are in response to the dumping of a body in a Woodlands water storage tank on May 16.</p>
              <p>The incident was the first since 2002, when five boys gained
               access to a water storage tank in Paya Lebar and dumped 1kg of washing 
              powder into the tank.</p>

              <p>The measures are there all the time.</p>
              <p>Access to roof top must be locked. The locks are there.</p>
              <p>Water tank manhole cover must be locked. There are locks.</p>
              <p>Some locks are vandalised, broken, and rusty. They have are not repaired. Majority of the roof access and water tanks are locked but not 100%.</p>
              <p>Now the PUB wants it to be100%.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Water tank to be replaced by end-June</h1>
              <p>THE rooftop water tank in which the body of a maid was discovered 
              last month is scheduled to be replaced by the end of this month.</p>
              <p>Member of Parliament for Sembawang Vikram Nair told The Straits Times
               yesterday that the council is still in talks with contractors. However,
               it hopes to begin work to remove the old water tank as soon as possible
               so that it can be replaced by June 23.</p>
              <p>'This is a response to residents' feedback,' said Mr Nair. 'They felt strongly about this, so we acted on it.'</p>
              <p>Residents have lobbied to get the tank at Block 686B, 
              Woodlands Drive 73, replaced after Indonesian maid Ruliyawati, 30, was 
              allegedly murdered and thrown into it. Bangladeshi cleaner Md Repon 
              Mostafa, 27, has been charged with murdering the maid, who went by only 
              one name.</p>
              <p>Many residents remained spooked even after the tanks were cleaned and the water deemed safe for consumption.</p>
              <p>Mr Nair said that he expects the tank to cost about $40,000 
              to replace. Only four of the eight tanks in the block are now in use. 
              The other four, including the tank in which the maid's body was found, 
              have been isolated.</p>

              <p>THE rooftop water tank in which the body of a maid was found last month was removed yesterday as work to replace it begins.</p>
              <p>Contractors engaged by Sembawang-Nee Soon Town Council took away the 
              tank from the block in Woodlands yesterday. A new one is expected to be 
              ready on June 23.</p>
              <p>The body of 30-year-old Indonesian Ruliyawati was found in the tank -
               one of eight on the roof - after she was allegedly murdered by a 
              Bangladeshi cleaner.</p>
              <p>The council decided to spend $40,000 to replace it after residents raised concerns.</p>
              <p>Its general manager Soon Min Sin said that after the new 
              tank is installed, it will be cleaned, flushed and sterilised. A water 
              sample from the tank will be submitted for testing.</p>
              <p>Access to rooftop water tanks has been restricted in all 
              Housing Board estates under the management of Sembawang-Nee Soon Town 
              Council following the death at Block 686B Woodlands Drive 73. Only town 
              council staff and emergency repairmen are allowed access, and all water 
              tank locks have been replaced.</p>
