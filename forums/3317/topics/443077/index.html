              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              government has imposed an Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) for 
              private property of between 3 per cent and 10 per cent for Singaporeans,
               Permanent Residents and foreigners to moderate investment demand for 
              private residential property and promote a more stable and sustainable 
              market. <br><br>The changes take effect on December 8.<br><br>Foreigners will pay 10 per cent Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) for any residential property.<br><br>Permanent Residents owning one and buying second and subsequent properties will pay 3 per cent ABSD.<br><br>Singaporeans
               owning two and buying a third and subsequent residential properties 
              will pay 3 per cent Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty.<br><br>The ABSD will 
              be imposed over and above the current Buyer's Stamp Duty, which are 1 
              per cent on the first $180,000 of purchase consideration or market value
               of the property (whichever is higher), 2 per cent on the next $180,000 
              and 3 per cent for the remainder.<br><br>In a joint statement on 
              Wednesday, the Finance and National Development ministries say the 
              government's objective is to promote a sustainable residential property 
              market where prices move in line with economic fundamentals. <br><br>They said prices of private residential properties have continued to rise, albeit more slowly in the last two quarters.<br><br>Prices
               are now 13 per cent above the peak in the second quarter of 1996, and 
              16 per cent above the more recent peak in the second quarter of 2008. <br><br>They said that even with the current economic uncertainties, the demand for private residential property remains firm. <br><br>Given
               the uncertainty in stock markets and with interest rates remaining low,
               private property in Singapore continues to attract local and foreign 
              investors.<br><br>They added that excessive investment demand will make 
              the property cycle more volatile, and thus increase the risks to 
              Singapore's economy and banking system.  <br><br>The government said the
               higher ABSD rate for foreign buyers in particular is necessary, in view
               of the large pool of external liquidity and strong buying interest from
               abroad, and the relatively small size of the Singapore market. <br><br>The
               government said foreign purchases account for 19 per cent of all 
              private residential property purchases in the second half of 2011, up 
              from 7 per cent in the first half of 2009.<br><br>For purchases made 
              jointly by two or more parties (eg a Singaporean with a PR, or a PR with
               a foreigner), the higher applicable ABSD rate will be imposed.<br><br>For example, if a citizen purchases a property with a foreigner, the ABSD of 10 per cent will apply.<br><br>In
               the case of a joint purchase by Singaporeans, who each already owns 
              properties, the ABSD of 3 per cent will apply as long as one of the 
              purchasers already owns two properties.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister and
               Minister for Finance Tharman Shanmugaratnam, said: "We have always had 
              open markets and must keep them that way. However, the reality is that 
              investment flows into our property market are now larger than before, 
              and unlikely to recede as long as interest rates remain low. <br><br>"The
               additional buyer's stamp duty should help cool investment demand, and 
              avoid the prospect of a major, destabilising correction further down the
               road."<br><br>Nicholas Mak, Executive Director of Research and 
              Consultancy at SLP International, said: "It will curb investment demand 
              for private residential properties quite drastically, especially demand 
              from non-resident foreigners. And I think in the next one to two months 
              or so, demand from non-resident foreigners will almost dry-up."<br><br>Home buyers are mixed in their views.<br><br>One
               Indian foreigner said: "I know there is a stamp duty, but any increase 
              in that will probably take it out of my level where I want to buy." <br><br>An
               Indian who is a Permanent Resident said: "Nowadays, HDB properties are 
              also difficult to buy, because of more conditions. So they have to buy 
              property here. Definitely they'll keep buying more irrespective of 
              whether the stamp duty is increased or not."<br><br>One Singaporean 
              said: "It probably wouldn't have an effect in the short-term, because 
              the property market prices are still rising, people are still 
              speculating."<br><br>Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan 
              said: "We are ramping up the supply of new Executive Condominium units 
              through the Government Land Sales Programme. <br><br>"This will help 
              higher-income Singaporeans own private condominium units in an 
              affordable way, as the sale of new EC units is restricted to Singaporean
               households only."  <br><br>Singaporean first-time buyers and upgraders, and buyers of HDB flats will not be affected by the new measure.<br><br>Certain reliefs will be provided so that the measure will not impact home occupation demand by residents. <br><br>For example, relief will be provided for Singaporean-foreigner/PR married couples buying their homes. <br><br>Reliefs
               will also be provided for qualifying developers and for purchases 
              falling within the scope of Singapore's international trade agreements. <br><br>The government will continue to ensure an adequate supply of private housing to meet-medium term demand. <br><br>There are 41,000 unsold private housing units in the pipeline. <br><br>The
               government will inject sites that can potentially yield a total of 
              14,100 units in the 1H2012 Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme, 
              similar to the supply in previous GLS programmes. <br><br>Of these, about 7,000 units will be from sites on the Confirmed List. <br><br>These numbers take into account the ample pipeline supply and the dampening effect of the ABSD.    <br><br>The
               government will also expand the supply of executive condominiums (ECs) 
              in 2012 and is prepared to release sites that can potentially yield 
              5,000 EC units for the entire year.<br><br>Sites for 3,500 EC units will be made available in 1H2012, including 3,000 EC units on the Confirmed List. <br><br>The
               Confirmed List quantum is comparable to the 3,000 EC units from five 
              sites sold for the whole of 2011. More details will be provided in the 
              press release for the 1H2012 GLS Programme on MND's website. <br><br>The
               Government will continue to monitor the property market and adjust its 
              property policies in step with changes in the market and the economy.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>
