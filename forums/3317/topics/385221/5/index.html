              <p><strong>Singapore's Foreign Ministry summons Romanian Ambassador to Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Foreign Ministry has summoned the Romanian 
              Ambassador to Singapore, Aurelian Neagu, to a meeting next week in the 
              city-state to discuss the charges preferred by the Attorney-General's 
              Chambers against Dr Silviu Ionescu. </span></p>
              <p><span>The state coroner had ruled that Dr Ionescu, Romania's former 
              Charge d'Affaires, was the driver of the car that hit three pedestrians 
              on December 15 last year.
              <br> <br> Responding to media queries, the Ministry provided a summary of the 
              charges.  
              <br> <br> They include:
              <br> <br> - Causing the death of Mr Tong Kok Wai by reckless driving, or 
              alternatively, by a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide
              <br> <br> - Causing grievous hurt to Mr Bong Hwee Hwa by a rash act
              <br> <br> - Reckless driving, resulting in a collision into Mr Muhammad Haris Abu 
              Talib 
              <br> <br> - Failing to stop after an accident 
              <br> <br> - Failing to lodge a report after an accident 
              <br> <br> - Failing to render assistance after an accident
              <br> <br> - Removing vehicle without police authority 
              <br> <br> - Giving false information to a police officer
              <br> <br> The ministry added that Dr Silviu Ionescu's comments carried in the 
              media are outrageous and cast aspersions on the integrity of Singapore's
               judicial system, which are entirely without basis.
              <br> <br> The Singapore legal system is widely known for its transparency, 
              integrity and high standards, and has consistently scored highly in 
              international rankings on the administration of justice and judicial 
              independence. 
              <br> <br> In the Institute for Management Development World Competitiveness 
              Yearbook 2009, Singapore placed 13th in the area of the fair 
              administration of justice, while Romania ranked 37th. 
              <br> <br> In the Global Competitiveness Report 2009-2010, Singapore was 19th for 
              judicial independence, compared to Romania's 84th placing.
              <br> <br> The ministry said that as Dr Ionescu continues to maintain his 
              innocence, the best way to resolve this is for him to return to 
              Singapore to give his side of the story.  
              <br> <br> It added that Dr Ionescu remains an employee of the Romanian Foreign 
              Ministry. While he has been suspended from his duties, he has not been 
              dismissed.
              <br> <br> It also said that at the meeting next week, it trusts that the 
              ambassador will unambiguously and categorically disassociate the 
              Romanian government from Dr Ionescu's views.
              <br> <br> Furthermore, MFA said it is puzzled by the comments reportedly made by 
              Ambassador Neagu in Thursday's Straits Times that Romania had yet to 
              receive evidence related to the case from the Singapore authorities. 
              <br> <br> The ministry said this is untrue, pointing out that copies of the 
              documents that were tendered at the Coroner's Inquiry were extended to 
              Mr Alex Coseru of the Romanian Embassy during the course of the Inquiry 
              from 3 March 2010 to 10 March 2010. 
              <br> <br> These consisted of two document folders and eight volumes of 
              photographs. 
              <br> <br> On the last day of the Inquiry on 10 March 2010, Mr Alex Coseru 
              requested from the State Counsel a copy of the Investigation Report. 
              This was extended to him and he left thereafter, leaving behind the two 
              document folders and the eight volumes of photographs which were earlier
               given to him.
              <br> <br> The Singapore authorities have seen to the due process of the law in 
              Singapore. 
              <br> <br> Singapore will cooperate to the fullest extent possible under its law 
              with the Romanian authorities to ensure that justice is served.

              <p><strong>Ionescu charges prepared</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE has taken the first steps towards criminal proceedings 
              against former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu, a day after the State 
              Coroner found him responsible for two hit-and-run accidents in Bukit 
              Panjang last December.</p>
              <p>The Attorney-General's Chambers has prepared a set of 13 
              charges it wants to bring against Dr Ionescu, a statement from the 
              Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Thursday night said.</p>
              <p>The charges include causing death by reckless driving, 
              causing grievous hurt through a rash act, and failing to stop, help or 
              lodge a police report after the accidents. In its statement, MFA said it
               had summoned Mr Aurelian Neagu, the Romanian Ambassador to Singapore, 
              who is based in Tokyo, to a meeting next week to discuss the charges.</p>
              <p>What comes next, however, is unclear, said lawyers 
              contacted.</p>
              <p>They said that Dr Ionescu has to be in Singapore to answer 
              the charges. He also enjoys diplomatic immunity, and Romania has given 
              no indication that it will waive this.</p>
              <p>In the unlikely event that Bucharest does so, Dr Ionescu 
              cannot be compelled to return as Singapore and Romania do not have an 
              extradition treaty.</p>

              <p>Initially, CeauÅŸescu became a popular figure in Romania and also in the 
              Western World, due to his independent foreign policy, challenging the 
              authority of the <a title="Soviet Union" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>. In the 1960s, he ended Romania's 
              active participation in the <a title="Warsaw Pact" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact">Warsaw
               Pact</a> (though Romania formally remained a member); he refused to 
              take part in the <a title="Prague Spring" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring">1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia</a> by Warsaw Pact
               forces, and actively and openly condemned that action. Although the 
              Soviet Union largely tolerated CeauÅŸescu's recalcitrance, his seeming 
              independence from Moscow earned Romania maverick status within the <a title="Eastern Bloc" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc">Eastern
