              <p><strong>Romania detains Ionescu</strong></p>
              <p>BUCHAREST - THE Romanian diplomat involved in a fatal hit-and-run 
              case in Singapore was detained for questioning on Friday, Romanian 
              prosecutors said.</p>
              <p>Silviu Ionescu, who was Bucharest's charge d'affaires in Singapore at
               the time, is alleged to have hit three pedestrians in two incidents in 
              December while driving a car belonging to the Romanian mission.</p>
              <p>One of the victims, a 30-year-old Malaysian national, 
              suffered brain damage and died on Christmas Day, while the two others 
              suffered injuries. The diplomat, who flew back to Romania days after the
               accident, 'has tried to influence witnesses' depositions and asked an 
              employee to ... erase data in his computer,' prosecutors said.</p>
              <p>Ionescu was taking in for questioning for six hours on 
              Friday by prosecutors who are seeking a 29-day detention warrant against
               him. Judges have 24 hours to approve the diplomat's detention or 
              release him. Ionescu has publicly denied he was the driver, claiming the
               car was stolen.</p>
              <p>In interviews to Romanian media, he alleged he was 'a victim
               of a conspiracy by Singapore authorities.' Last month, Singapore issued
               an arrest warrant after a coroner's court ruled that Ionescu was 
              driving the car involved in the accident.</p>
              <p>Singapore's foreign ministry said the Romanian government 
              had the moral obligation to persuade Ionescu to return to face the 
              charges. There is no extradition treaty between Singapore and Romania.

              <p><strong>Romania jails Ionescu</strong></p>
              <p>BUCHAREST - A ROMANIAN court jailed for 29 days on Saturday a 
              diplomat allegedly involved in a hit-and-run crash in Singapore in 
              December that killed a Malaysian, media reported.</p>
              <p>Silviu Ionescu, a former charge d'affaires in Singapore, was detained
               for questioning on Friday and the court later ordered him to be 
              arrested for 29 days pending his trial.</p>
              <p>Ionescu's lawyer filed an appeal to the court's decision, 
              news agency Mediafax reported. Ionescu is alleged to have hit three 
              pedestrians in two incidents in December while driving a car belonging 
              to the Romanian mission.</p>
              <p>One of the victims, a 30-year-old Malaysian national,

              There is no extradition treaty between the two countries.</p>
              <p>'The Romanian government must in its own interests ensure 
              that justice was served and seen to be served,' a spokesman said in a 
              statement. 'Otherwise, there would inevitably be consequences for 
              bilateral relations.' -- AFP</p>

              <p> Must I rant again about how Singapore's use of  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A39">Article 39.2</a> is premature, wrong, offensive and harming our 'diplomatic relations'?</p>
              <p>Even Ionescu has the smarts to use the Interpol notice as an excuse to 'complain', so don't U sense that we are doing something wrong here?</p>
              <p>The 'woman scorned' story is on my blog, as are all other articles and commentaries I find relevant.</p>
              <p>Like U wouldn't rant to the police about the neighbor's toddler son 
                                      beating your pet cat, U wouldn't notify Interpol about what is 
                                      essentially a 'domestic' problem between two sovereigns.</p>
              <p>So wake up, this world isn't run by some organization that U can rant to every time U get upset over essentially private matters, ones entered into mutually and governed based upon terms enshrined in the VCDR . What is needed is that one upholds one's ethics and integrity and resolve the said problem according to the existing mutual agreement- the '<a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations'</a>. I can only surmise that under populist pressures to 'perform' SG MFA misread the spirit of the VCDR and jumped into invoking A39.2 whilst overlooking 31.1 and 31.4- which common sense would tell, are far superior articles for consideration as they are numerically precedent. Who ever reads a book back to front but the devious or the lunatic; like wise, if Singapore is as prim and proper as it claims to be, then our Honorable Minister ought to start reading the VCDR from FRONT TO BACK and not vice versa nor cherry pick articles of his liking, ultimately putting all his audience on an emotional 'roller-coaster' ride and a spanner into negotiations.</p>
              <p> I do hope we see our own faults and in so doing, return both sovereigns back to the drawing board.</p>
              <p>Minister G Yeo himself has already spoken in Parliament that:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Quote:<a href="http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mfa/transcript/T-20100426-1.html"> 'TRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS GEORGE YEO'S REPLIES TO

                                      speaking, there is no higher authority we can appeal to (regarding the

              <p>So please if U could do some of your own homework and not swallow everything U hear 'lock stock and barrel' n let the 2 sovereigns resolve our problems internally- i.e. mutually.</p>
              <p>May Ionescu be brought to Justice and may we apologize for our indiscretions.</p>

              <p>Eh, hello, 'Singapore acting like a woman scorned?' is my article, U gota problem w that; n I though U read my previous post and understood?:</p>
              <p> Must I rant again about how Singapore's use of  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A39">Article 39.2</a> is premature, wrong, offensive and harming our 'diplomatic relations'?</p>
              <p>Even Ionescu has the smarts to use the Interpol notice as an excuse to 'complain', so don't U sense that we are doing something wrong here?</p>
              <p>The 'woman scorned' story is on my blog, as are all other articles and commentaries I find relevant.</p>
              <p>Like U wouldn't rant to the police about the neighbor's toddler son beating your pet cat, U wouldn't notify Interpol about what is essentially a 'domestic' problem between two sovereigns.</p>
              <p>So wake up, this world isn't run by some organization that U can rant to every time U get upset over essentially private matters, ones entered into mutually and governed based upon terms enshrined in the VCDR . What is needed is that one upholds one's ethics and integrity and resolve the said problem according to the existing mutual agreement- the '<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations'</a>. I can only surmise that under populist pressures to 'perform' SG MFA misread the spirit of the VCDR and jumped into invoking A39.2 whilst overlooking 31.1 and 31.4- which common sense would tell, are far superior articles for consideration as they are numerically precedent. Who ever reads a book back to front but the devious or the lunatic; like wise, if Singapore is as prim and proper as it claims to be, then our Honorable Minister ought to start reading the VCDR from FRONT TO BACK and not vice versa nor cherry pick articles of his liking, ultimately putting all his audience on an emotional 'roller-coaster' ride and a spanner into negotiations.</p>
              <p> I do hope we see our own faults and in so doing, return both sovereigns back to the drawing board.</p>
              <p>Minister G Yeo himself has already spoken in Parliament that:</p>
              <p>So please if U could do some of your own homework and not swallow everything U hear 'lock stock and barrel' n let the 2 sovereigns resolve our problems internally- i.e. mutually.</p>
              <p>May Ionescu be brought to Justice and may we apologize for our indiscretions.</p>

              <p>Hi StoryWolf,</p>
              <p>I apologize if the analogy used might have inadvertently caused offense.<br><br>The key point of my opinion being the fact that the current issue at hand is mutual and linked directly to the incompetencies of both states in the handling of what is essentially a problem with their interpretations of the <em> </em><a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</a></p>
              <p>It is also my an expression of my displeasure as to what I believe is SG's shockingly inappropriate application of the VCDR.</p>
              <p>On part of Singapore, the Interpol notice based upon a 'cherry picked' <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A39">article 39.2 of the VCDR </a>, WITHOUT regard to <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Article31.4</a>, remains purely moot- and thus liable to cause offense to Romania, a partner so essential to bringing Ionescu to justice. The unprecedented, unreasonable and thus inappropriate application of A39.2 without reference to A31.4 is in discordance with the spirit of the VCDR, and as such, a major impediment to the entire negotiatory process- i.e. a spanner in the works of currently good relations/ negotiations thus far.</p>
              <p>For the avoidance of doubt, I believe A39.2 (as SG MFA premises it's Interpol notice by) to be merely moot at present. This is because by virtue of its <strong>numerical precedence</strong> and relevance to the issue at hand, a reference to A31.4 (and by precedence A31.1) is a mandatory consideration prior to any valid execution of A39.2 (which our current SG case sorely lacks).</p>
              <p>Article31.4 states: <em>"The immunity of a diplomatic agent from the  jurisdiction   of the 
                                                  receiving State <span style="color: red;">does not exempt  him from the   
                                                  jurisdiction of the sending State</span>."</em><br>Singapore's 'cherry picked'  and unjustified application of A39.2 (without due respect for Romania's wisk to comply with A31.4) is thus inappropriate, and as such, SG currently owes the Romanian MFA EITHER<br>a) an apology (and immediate retraction of the Interpol notice) for her unqualified application of A39.2 of the VCDR, OR <br>b) a qualification to justify  use of A39.2.  </p>
              <p>Romania on the other hand, seems woefully unfamiliar with the roles and responsibilities befitting of a Soveriegn 'sending state'- as to the discipline and management and of a wayward diplomat, one who has killed by negligence and then lied; who should have from much early on been silenced from making any further disparaging remarks which might compromise Romanian reputation and by extension, mutual relations- which paradoxically, was the original purpose he (Ionescu) was meant to serve. A severe warning and/ or arrest would have been warranted to limit his misleading and aggravating comments to the press (both Singapore and Romanian)- given the fact that he was still enjoying 'diplomatic status' (having been only issued a 'suspension' and thus still under Romanian MFA 'employ')- and thus protected for persecution under SG law/ A39.2; would thus be professionally obligated to continue serving the diplomatic interest of the sovereign (Romania) he so represents the SG accident investigations notwithstanding.</p>
              <p> That said, this current 'saga' also reflects poorly on the system by which Interpol is run and the appreciation by Interpol for Diplomatic Laws. Rather than being merely portrayed as a 'rubber-stamp' organisation, Interpol should have queried the basis upon which Singapore's request for the red notice was made for a 'diplomat'- specifically the evidence that A31.4 (or other applicable articles) had been adequately considered in precedence to A39.2 being executed.</p>
              <p>I have thus far found myself disappointed  with the overall handling of the Ionescu case by the various parties mentioned, wherein their interpretation of the VCDR seems rather lacking if not self-serving.</p>
              <p> I thus hope that Justice would be served in its true spirit without corruption by either incompetencies or ulterior motives of parties involved.</p>
              <p>The book of law should be read in spirit, from front to back and not vice versa.<br>Please do not pervert the word of law.</p>
              <p> 'Story wolf', whist I do not wish to demean the misfortune and suffering of the victims concerned, I also do not wish to see further injustice arising form the misinterpretation of important legal and mutual agreements.</p>
              <p>I wish U all the best in your appreciation of the current legal conundrum and hope for your support of the rightful spirit in which justice is served.</p>
              <p> Regards and God Bless</p>

              <p><strong>Ionescu a risk to public order</strong></p>
              <p>A judge in a Romanian court holds the view that former charge d'affaires
               to Singapore, Silviu Ionescu, constitutes a risk to public order if he 
              remains free.</p>
              <p>Romanian media Nine O'clock reported today that the court acknowledged 
              the fact that Dr Ionescu had tried to influence the woman accompanying 
              him before the accidents into changing her testimony. <br> <br> Dr Ionescu had also asked his driver to modify the log of the Embassy 
              car. <br> <br> The judge presiding over the case said there were clues suggesting Dr 
              Ionescu had committed the acts he's accused of. <br> <br> The 50-year-old former diplomat is currently under investigation in 
              Romania for manslaughter, leaving the scene of an accident and making 
              false statements. <br> <br> Last month, a coroner's inquiry in Singapore indicated that Dr Ionescu 
              was the driver of the car that hit three pedestrians in a fatal 
              hit-and-run accident last December. <br>   <br> Dr Ionescu had filed an appeal against the 29 days preventive detention 
              against him last Friday. <br> <br> A decision on the appeal will be made on Thursday.</p>

              <p><strong>Romanian High Court rejects Ionescu appeal</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Former Romanian charge d' affaires to Singapore, Silviu
               Ionescu, has failed in his appeal to have his international arrest 
              warrant annulled. </span></p>
              <p><span>Romanian media, Nine O" Clock, said the appeal was rejected after 
              the Romanian High Court "realised that it cannot rule on documents or 
              requests issued by states with which Romania does not have judiciary 
              collaboration agreements."
              <br> <br> The ruling by the High Court of Cassation and Justice is final.
              <br> <br> This means the international arrest warrant issued by Singapore against 
              Dr Ionescu remains valid.
              <br> <br> His lawyer, Maria Vasi, told the court that she did not rule out that 
              the accident was staged by the Singapore authorities so that they could 
              subsequently force the Romanian diplomat to reveal intelligence.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu was found by a Coroner's Inquiry in Singapore to be the 
              driver behind the wheel of a Black Audi which was involved in two 
              hit-and-run accidents in December last year.
              <br> <br> One person subsequently died of his injuries.

              <p>I hope Romania side really look inot this claim. The conspiracy claim. I am sure our officials and witness will not hesitate to make a trip there to testify against this black sheep's claim. How can an accident be staged, our side at the cost a one dead and two possibly crippled for life? If the guy had not hit and run and possibly drove dangerously all the way how would anyone not willingly testify against him? Worse its adiplomat somemore.</p>

              <p>Hi lazy bum aka 'troublemaker(vintage)2005', the traffic to my blog is the least of my concerns, it serves only as a repository and is highlighted only for version updates and also against unfounded accusatories/ 'troublemaker'(s) such as yourself. Such repository is also helpful in the light of some otherrforums which censor posts which they view as 'sensitive'.</p>
              <p>Your statement, " in the guise of the
                      wish for justice tobe (sic) served" I find unfounded and thus libelous; still, in the mutual spirit of "freedom of speech" do I respond by continuing to describe what I feel is the right way forward.</p>
              <p>You are however always welcomed to dispute my analysis upon material fact, though noting your many dalliances in these forums and short attention span thus far, I anticipate such possibility to be abysmal and limited to wild accusations and name calling.</p>
              <p>Shame on you.</p>
