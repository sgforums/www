              <p><br> BUCHAREST - Former Romanian Charge d'Affaires Silviu Ionescu has 
              suffered a setback in his bid to be released from jail as he stands 
              trial for manslaughter.<br> The presiding judge has rejected his request to be released on judicial supervision.<br> The ruling was read out in court yesterday in a public session, but not 
              in the presence of either Ionescu or his attorney. Their presence was 
              not mandatory under Romanian law.<br> Ionescu's lawyer, Mr Nelu Tasca, has already appealed against the ruling.<br> The appeal will be referred to a higher court today and a decision will have to be made no later than Monday.<br> Last night, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affais (MFA) stressed that 
              the trial of former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu is not about the 
              Singapore system or its government. It said this in response to queries 
              about the allegations by Dr Ionescu that there was a political 
              conspiracy.<br> "The trial is about what happened on 15 December 2009 which resulted in 
              death and serious injuries, and the evidence found has pointed to 
              Ionescu," an MFA spokesman said.<br> "His responsibility will have to be addressed through the Romanian legal
               process for justice to be served, and this is where the focus should 
              be," the spokesman said.<br> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100729-0000129/Judge-rejects-Ionescu-request">http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore...onescu-request</a></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I think that the main 
                  reason why Ionescu cannot be released is because the Romanians are 
                  unable to keep him away from the press/ the press away from him/ he 
                  might be a flight risk, I dunno why this story is so convoluted, no 
                  thanks to both side's initial 'one-upmanship' stemming from 
                  unfamiliarity with the handling of such 'diplomatic'  issues, the 
                  involvement of Interpol et al- i.e. the failure of abidance to the 
                  mutually pre-set terms of the VCDR [<a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">link</a>]- on how such issues ought to be resolved 'diplomatically'.<br> That said, I do think its good from the [TDY 29July2010] statement "'His
                   responsibility will have to be addressed through the Romanian legal   
                  process for justice to be served, and this is where the focus should   
                  be,' the spokesman said " that SG has at least tacitly admitted that 
                  Romania has the first duty and honour of persecuting Ionescu (with the 
                  assistance of the SG MFA)- i.e. the original involvement of Interpol big
                   brouhaha was quite uncalled for and 'indiplomatic'.<br> <br> Hiya, <br> Moral of story, if U drink, dun drive, regardless of who U are. <br> <br> Poor Ionescu' s (meaning the Ionescu family), the wife has gone berserk, or is she just faking it? <br> <br> And look out before U cross the road, even if the 'green man' is 
                  showing, cos U never know which drunken diplomat is speeding down the 
                  same lane, spent after a rancorous night of drunken livery at any one of
                   SG's 2 spanking new integrated resorts/ casinos.<br> <br> That said, for purely practical and cost reasons, i hope that both the 
                  SPF and Singapore Coroner's Court have recorded adequate footage of the 
                  relevant trials/ witness testimonials/ investigations etc to be 
                  submitted to the Romanian prosecutors etc. This would be most 
                  facilitative and save much delay etc should the slippery Ionescu wish to
                   dispute some of the witness statements in the courts there. Otherwise, 
                  SG would then have no choice but to spend $$$ transporting all relevant 
                  witness to Romania whilst safeguarding their safe return- should the 
                  Romanian prosecutors request witness presence in court. Better still, a 
                  cheaper alternative of course would be for both countries to set up a 
                  court teleconferencing service so that the physical presence of SG 
                  witnesses in Romania wouldn't be required and I'm sure that SG should be
                   proud to show case her technological talents in this regard.<br> <br> Hope all ends well and Ionescu can spend enough of his days in 
                  isolation,  reminding himself of the evils of succumbing under the 
                  influence one drink too many and replaying in his now un-inebriated mind
                   the sad events of that fateful mid December night- thanks to the 
                  hospitality of the Romanian Penitentiary system and the combined efforts
                   of both governments.<br> <br> N I hope our 2 govts continue to work well on this case tog.<br> <br> References:<br> - <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR)</a><br> - [SGforums, 11 May2010]: 'The book of law should be read in spirit, from front to back and not vice versa' [<a href="/forums/3317/topics/385221?page=8#post_9779656">link</a>]<br> - [TDY 29July2010]: 'Judge rejects Ionescu request': "'His

              <p><strong>Wait-and-see for Ionescu in appeal for release under judicial supervision</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It's wait-and-see for former Romanian diplomat Silviu 
              Ionescu, who's on trial for two hit-and run accidents in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span> He appeared for the second time in a Romanian court on Thursday seeking to be released while he's on trial. </span></p>
              <p><span> He wants to be released under judicial supervision which means he can be freed from detention but has to report to the police. </span></p>
              <p><span>The decision from the Tribunal's judges is expected later on Thursday.
              <br> <br> Ionescu entered the courtroom, looking calm, holding a bottle of water and trying to find a familiar face in the room.
              <br> <br> This time, no member of his family was present.
              <br> <br> For the 2.5 hours Ionescu waited his turn before the judge, he was 
              seated in the defendant's box amid convicts and defendants on trial for 
              crimes like rape, murder and theft. 
              <br> <br> When he was finally heard, Ionescu repeated the same arguments but with some twists of words.  
              <br> <br> He said: "If I were to read the indictment against me, I would probably 
              give myself not 7, but 25 years behind bars. I understand the 
              Singaporeans' outrage. I would be just as outraged having heard of such a
               case having happened in my own country. But all this outrage and all 
              these accusations rely on false witnesses, on false or circumstantial 
              evidence". 
              <br> <br> This was the core of Ionescu's statement, whose defence now is focused 
              on proving that the prosecutors are trying to force a confession out of 
              him by keeping him under arrest. 
              <br> <br> Under Romanian law, a case can rarely be won on circumstantial evidence alone and without a confession from the defendant.
              <br> <br> Last Tuesday, Ionescu asked the lower court handling his case to release him under judicial supervision.
              <br> <br> His main argument was that, after three months behind bars, none of the accusation witnesses showed up to testify.
              <br> Ionescu's lawyer Nelu Tasca had argued that it was pointless for his 
              client to wait in jail for some witnesses who will probably never show 
              up.
              <br> <br> That request was rejected almost immediately. 
              <br> <br> Ionescu's arrest warrant is up for re-examination again on August 17, in
               case this second attempt for release fails and would be his other 
              available chance of freedom. </span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu has failed 
              again in his appeal to be released from detention while he's on trial 
              for two hit-and-run accidents in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span> The panel of three women judges from the Bucharest Tribunal that heard 
              on Thursday Ionescu's plea for release under judicial supervision 
              decided to keep him behind bars and to reject his bid for freedom. </span></p>
              <p><span> The court has yet to announce its motivation behind the ruling that was 
              announced earlier on Friday in a public court session, where neither 
              Ionescu, nor his lawyer were present. </span></p>
              <p><span> On the other hand, Ionescu still has another chance at freedom on August
               17, when he is expected to appear before the judge, who will review his
               arrest warrant. </span></p>
              <p><span> His attorney said that he will appeal to an even higher court, the 
              Bucharest Appeal Court, but only if on August 17, the judge decides to 
              extend his warrant. </span></p>
              <p><span> The next important date on the trial's schedule is October 6. </span></p>
              <p><span> That is when his actual trial continues, on four counts of manslaughter,
               causing injury, fleeing the scene of an accident and false statement. </span></p>
              <p><span>For these, under Romanian law, he faces a term of maximum seven years in prison. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Ionescu in another bid for release from detention in Romania</strong></p>
              <p><span>Bucharest, ROMANIA : The Romanian Court is expected to decide on 
              Wednesday whether former diplomat Silviu Ionescu can be released from 
              detention, even as he faces trial. </span></p>
              <p><span> Ionescu appeared in a Romanian court on Tuesday morning for a brief 
              session in another attempt to seek his release from detention. </span></p>
              <p><span> Tuesday's hearing was to review Ionescu's arrest warrant. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ionescu's lawyer, Nelu Tasca, argued that the prosecutor does not 
              have any evidence that can place the former diplomat at the scene of the
               crime when it allegedly happened in Singapore last December.
              <br> <br> He argued that the prosecutor's indictment document had not named the 
              key witness who had identified Ionescu as the driver during the 
              coroner's inquiry in Singapore.
              <br> <br> However, he did not expect a spectacular outcome from Tuesday's hearing.
               He plans to take the case to the Romanian Appeals Court if the 
              diplomat's case for release is rejected by the court.
              <br> <br> Ionescu had failed on August 6 in his appeal to be released from 
              detention while he is on trial for two hit-and-run accidents in 
              Singapore in December last year which claimed the life of a pedestrian.
              <br> <br> He will be in court again on October 6, when his trial proceeds with 
              four counts of manslaughter, causing injury, fleeing the scene of an 
              accident and giving false statement.

              <p><strong>Victim to testify</strong></p>
              <p>ONE of the victims in the hit-and-run accident involving former 
              Romanian charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu, 50, has flown to Romania to 
              testify against the ex-diplomat.</p>
              <p>Mr Bong Hwee Haw, 24, is understood to have left on Monday night with his mother for the trial, which starts today in Bucharest.</p>
              <p>Contacted before he left, he declined to comment on his role
               in the trial, but sounded coherent and energetic over the phone. When 
              he gave evidence at a coroner's inquiry in Singapore in March, he had 
              shuffled unsteadily to the stand, looked lost and struggled to answer 
              questions.</p>
              <p>He had sustained head injuries so severe in the accident on 
              Dec 15 last year that a doctor who testified in court said half of the 
              patients who sustain such wounds die.</p>
              <p>Mr Bong told The Straits Times on Monday: 'I'm still 
              undergoing physiotherapy and feel better now. But I still feel pain in 
              my bones when the weather is cold. I'm confident of starting my croupier
               job, but we'll see. It's hard to say.'</p>
              <p>At the inquiry, he had initially said he remembered nothing 
              of the accident that took the life of his close friend, Mr Tong Kok Wai,
               30.</p>

              <p><strong>Ionescu's trial starts</strong></p>
              <p>BUCHAREST - THE trial of a Romanian diplomat charged with 
              manslaughter following a hit-and-run car crash in Singapore last year 
              opened in Bucharest on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Silviu Ionescu, a former charge d'affaires in Singapore, denies the 
              charge and has been in detention since May, pending his trial. The 
              diplomat is alleged to have hit three pedestrians in December while 
              driving a car belonging to the Romanian mission.</p>
              <p>One of them, a 30-year-old Malaysian national, suffered brain damage 
              and died on Christmas Day. One of the victim's friends, Bonghwee Haw, a 
              Malaysian who was also severely injured in the crash, was in court and 
              is due to testify later Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'He came here today to make sure that justice is delivered,' his lawyer, Namasivayan Sririvasan, told AFP.</p>
              <p>Ionescu has been charged with manslaughter, causing physical
               injuries and making false statements, the general prosecutor's office 
              said. He has denied he was the driver and says the car was stolen. But 
              prosecutors said his story 'does not conform to reality.'</p>
              <p>The former diplomat claimed the accusations were an attempt 
              by Singapore authorities to 'disparage' him, following his public 
              remarks 'criticising some of their decisions.' Singapore's foreign 
              ministry has repeatedly called on the Romanian government to 'ensure 
              that justice is served' in Ionescu's case. -- AFP</p>

              <p><strong>Ionescu maintains innocence</strong></p>
              <p>BUCHAREST - THE trial of former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu, who
               is accused of being involved in a fatal hit-and-run accident in 
              Singapore last year, began yesterday with lawyers arguing over 
              translations for a key witness.</p>
              <p>Mr Bong Hwee Haw, 24, one of the three men knocked down, had turned 
              up to seek justice for his friend Tong Kok Wai, 30, who died after an 
              Audi A6 ploughed into them on Dec 15.</p>
              <p>His lawyer had to translate his words from Mandarin to English, after which court interpreters translated them into Romanian.</p>
              <p>Ionescu's defence objected, noting that translators and 
              lawyers were usually independent, but the court allowed Mr Bong's 
              attorney N. Srinivasan to continue.</p>
              <p>The defence also argued that Mr Srinivasan was not 
              recognised as a lawyer under Romanian law, but the judge also allowed 
              him to continue.</p>
              <p>The former charge d'affaires has repeatedly denied being 
              behind the wheel and insisted that the Romanian Embassy's car was 
              stolen.</p>

              Singapore in 2009 is scheduled to restart on Wednesday.</p>

              decision to allow Dr Silviu Ionescu to travel out of Bucharest had been 
              rejected.</p>
              <p>However, Dr Ionescu is not allowed to leave Romania, not permitted to
               change his residence without the prior approval of the court and, among
               other things, cannot drive any vehicle.</p>
              <p>He is also prohibited from approaching and communicating with the injured person, members of his family, witnesses or experts.</p>
              <p>The MFA trusts the Romanian authorities to ensure Dr Ionescu
               complies strictly with the supplementary obligations imposed by the 
              Court.</p>
              <p>The next hearing is scheduled for Mar 9 2011.</p>
              <p>The MFA added in its statement that it will continue to 
              monitor the proceedings closely and 'expects the Romanian authorities to
               honour its assurances given to the Singapore Government that justice 
              will be done.</p>

              <p>A WITNESS told a Romanian court via videolink that he would be able 
              to recognise the driver of the car that ploughed into his friend between
               2am and 3am on Dec 15, 2009. Mr Ricarno Izaan Lachica said it was a 
              Caucasian man at the wheel.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old full-time National Serviceman was not asked to 
              identify the culprit but Judge Raluca Andras asked to return next Friday
               as the court may have more questions.</p>
              <p>The former Romanian charge d'affaires in Singapore, Silviu Ionescu, 
              is presently on trial in a Bucharest court for manslaughter, causing 
              physical injuries and making false statements. The ex-diplomat, 51, is 
              alleged to have hit three pedestrians while driving a car belonging to 
              the Romanian mission, and to have fled the scene.</p>
              <p>He denies he was the driver at the time and says that the 
              black Audi A6 had been stolen while he was working at the embassy at 
              about the time of the accident.</p>
              <p>In the first hit-and-rum along Bukit Panjang Road, hotel 
              assistant manager Tong Kok Wai, 30, a Malaysian, suffered brain damage 
              and died on Christmas Day. His friend, Mr Bong Hwee Haw, 24, also a 
              Malaysian, was severely injured in the crash but has recovered. A few 
              hundred metres down the road, Mr Muhammad Haris Abu Talib, 19, was run 
              down.</p>
              <p>His elder brother Muhammad Zahari, 24, a second-year 
              undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University, said the group had 
              waited at the junction with Bangkit Road until the 'green man' came on. 
              Midway Bukit Panjang Road, he became aware of a car speeding at them and
               jumped out of its way.</p>
              <p>More witnesses are expected to testify via videolink next Thursday.</p>
