              Hi Ms Cheong, my reply is as follows (the relevant references/ 
              links/  'articles' of the VCDR are appended below for your convenience):<br> The 'immunity' which you mention is not as 'infinite' as you seem to 
              assume. Whilst the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> (VCDR) 
              does indeed provide in accordance with Article 31.1, "immunity from the 
              criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State", Article 31.4 elaborates 
              further, the same article by stating that "The immunity of a diplomatic 
              agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving State <strong>does not exempt 
              him</strong> from the jurisdiction of the sending State." Your definition of 
              'immunity form persecution' thus seem quite lacking if not mistaken.<br> <br>

              <tr>
              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">A good example is Dr Silviu Ionescu a Romanian diplomat who have 
              killed Mr Tong Kok Wai and injured 2 others.He managed to leave

              In accordance to A29: "The person of a diplomatic agent shall be 
              inviolable", Ionescu was 'entitled'  to leave Singapore 'at will', his

              About Romanian neglect in curbing Ionescu's public criticisms of 
              Singapore, my response is in the article <a href="385221?page=8#post_9779656">'The book of law should be read in spirit, from front

              I believe your worry to be that of 'state sponsored terrorism', 
              whilst I find your worries not unreasonable, I must add that 'diplomacy'
               is a 2 edged sword. Not unlike the various notorious portrayals of the 
              Christian Bible which can both be applied in good and bad ways (the 
              Catholic Church once on basis of heretical Biblical interpretations, 
              promulgated the collection of  'indulgences' to enrich none but their 
              own brimming pockets), the VCDR likewise, when portrayed by less then 
              well meaning folk, would likewise yield have 'less then well meaning' 
              results.<br> <br> The VCDR is written with the lofty ambition of achieving high standards 
              of diplomatic relations, standards requiring an almost religious, if not
               continuous bilateral abidance to its contained articles, 1- 53, every 
              hour and every day for which the agreement stands.<br> <br> I however, remain optimistic about the ultimate intentions and outcomes 
              of both the original references.<br> <br>

              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">So what i like to comment is that when a diplomat is suspected in 
              being involved in any crimes either in Singapore or any other countries,
               he or she can be detained to help investigate instead of allowing hm or
               her to leave the country and wait till the government which sends him 
              or her to punish them for the crimes committed.</td>

              As mentioned, there are already existing provisions for such 
              within the VCDR viz A31.4, A9.1 another foremost precursor also states 
              that the receiving state may at will and without requirement for 
              explanation, "notify the sending State that the head of the mission or 
              any member of  the diplomatic staff of the mission is persona non grata 
              ".<br> <br> Mother Teresa once said, "To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep 
              putting oil  in it." I guess effort, energy and commitment, not to 
              mention a sense of propriety is necessary to keep diplomatic relations 
              strong; the 'misdemeanors' of the opposite party must be nipped in the 
              bud, if overlooked and allowed to fester, these indiscretions will only 
              snowball into larger tragedies which make public to the world what 
              flimsy foundations our relations are premised upon. <br> Mind you, the VCDR in its 'maiden glory' is available at source online 
              at <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf">http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/ins...s/9_1_1961.pdf</a> - 16pages, medium font, cover page and preamble inclusive.<br> Substandard interpretations of the VCDR and wild assumptions of the same
               thus defeat the inceptive premise of the diplomacy. We must be careful 
              in all our relations and unless we're truly prepared, not 'flirt' with 
              all and sundry. And when problems arise, may our spirits not deviate 
              from that of the Law.<br> <br> Face it, one cannot have one's cake and eat it too.<br> <br> As our source article 'TODAYonline'-May 14, 2010: '<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100514-0000055/The-principle-of-diplomatic-immunity-is-sound">The  principle of diplomatic immunity is sound</a>' 
              clearly states: "While ignoring immunity sometimes might seem preferable
               at first glance,  it's a two-way street that needs to be respected all 
              the time to  protect Singapore's diplomats overseas. Only by following 
              the principles  of the Vienna Convention at home can one country expect 
              others to do  the same for its diplomats abroad. "<br> <br> Too much wine maketh a decision maker tipsy.<br> <br> May Singapore rise to the occasion, with the cooperation of the Romanian
               Government, and under the existing mutual terms of the VCDR, resolve 
              this issue with dignity and grace.<br> <br> The book of law should be read in spirit, from front  to back and not 
              vice versa.<br> <br> Thank you for your concern and interest over this issue.<br> Regards and God bless,<br> B.C.<br> - - - - - - <br> Ps: It is my opinion that some additional clarifications need to be 
              added to the VCDR- such as the compliance with local traffic regulations
               etc. Whilst A31.2 goes so far as to state: "A diplomatic agent is not 
              obliged to give evidence as a                witness", that should the 
              receiving state, by way of its ordinary local procedures, find a 
              'diplomatic agent', to be of immediate hazard to human life and limb of 
              the local community, intervene to minimize such risk in the least 
              disruptive manner whilst upholding the safety of the community and 
              keeping the sending state informed of such interventions at the soonest 
              possible time. -etc-<br> Application example:<br> A 'diplomatic agent' is stopped for suspected drunk driving. He is given
               the choice of either passing the on-site breathalyzer test, or making 
              alternative arrangements to continue his passage of travel without 
              himself being driver of a motorized vehicle. (the receiving country MFA 
              would of course be accordingly informed of this incident).<br> = = = = = = <br> <strong>Quotes and references:</strong><br> - Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (UN site): <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf">http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/ins...s/9_1_1961.pdf</a><br> - 'TODAYonline'-May 14, 2010: '<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100514-0000055/The-principle-of-diplomatic-immunity-is-sound">The  principle of diplomatic immunity is sound</a>': <br> - 11May2010: <a href="385221?page=8#post_9779656">'The book of law should be read in spirit, from front

              <p>Hi Mr Cheong, my apologies for the 'title prefix' mistake.<br> <br> Whilst I'd not rather declare myself an expert in all such matters, just
               concerned, I will agree with you from my own readings, that diplomats 
              are indeed held with high esteem, perhaps for good reason as they ought 
              to serve the high and lofty ambitions such as article 3.1a, g: 
              "representing the sending State in the receiving State", "promoting 
              friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, 
              and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations", 
              respectively.<br> <br> I believe however, that like original 'holy matrimony' which indeed 
              agonizes ill-prepared/ suited individuals, likewise the 'unadulterated' 
              application <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a>, in its undiluted original form isn't for the 
              'fainthearted'- it should be therefore be only applied premised upon 
              already good relations OR a mutually pronounced commitment towards 
              achieving good relations. For those 'ill-prepared' for a marriage of 
              such intensity, then abridged versions akin to 'engagement', 
              'cohabitation' or more preliminary proxies of such relations are perhaps
               better advised. (pls see Israeli policy on diplomatic bags checks for 
              an example of some 'exceptions':<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity"> "Most important are the reservation by most Arab nations concerning the
                immunity of diplomatic bags and non-recognition of Israel"</a>)<br> <br> In regard to your question about "not state sponsored" crimes, which I 
              believe the Ionescu case is similarly categorized, then I would conclude
               <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">A31.4</a> to be the most efficacious and equitable 
              means for resolution, not forgetting the preferably good relations 
              between the 2 sovereigns to start with- that is in so far as the said 
              'sending state' displays preference towards <br> discipline of the said diplomat in accordance to A31.4, to which it 
              should rightfully be given allowance for.<br> But if by unfortunate circumstance a failure of negotiations result, 
              with the receiving state remaining ill satisfied with the extent to 
              which justice has been served in accordance to A31.4, then the receiving
               state may choose, by application, the express waiver of the sending 
              state via: A32.1 and  .2: "The immunity from jurisdiction of diplomatic 
              agents and of  persons  enjoying immunity under Article <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A37">37</a> may  be waived by the sending State. Waiver  
              must always be express".<br> <br> Should both A31.4 and A32.1-2 both fail, then the least 'diplomatic' 
              possibility would be to apply A39.2 only after having satisfied the 
              requirements of:<br> - A9.1: "The receiving State may at any time and without having to  
              explain its decision, notify the sending State that the  head of  the 
              mission or any member of the diplomatic staff of the  mission  is 
              persona non grata or that any other member of the staff  of the mission 
              is not acceptable. "<br> <br> A39.2 which states: "When the functions of a person enjoying privileges 
               and immunities have come to an end, such privileges and  immunities  
              shall normally cease at the moment when he leaves the  country, or on  
              expiry of a reasonable period in which to do so,..."<br> <br> And as U see, A39.2 is a rather antagonistic article to use, one for 
              which I question the purpose how such 'diplomatic-relations' could have 
              really existed at all in the first place.<br> <br> Hope this helps, just my 2c.<br> <br> Rgds<br> B.C.<br> <br> Ref:<br> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">Diplomatic immunity[wiki]</a>:  'Exceptions  to the

              <p><strong>Romania welcomes envoy</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIA has welcomed a special envoy from Singapore, and said it 
              would support him during his upcoming visit to Bucharest to help 
              Romanian officials with their investigations into its former charge 
              d'affaires to Singapore, Silviu Ionescu.</p>
              <p>A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Sunday said
               Minister George Yeo had written twice to his Romanian counterpart 
              Teodor Baconschi to inform him of the appointment of Singapore's 
              ambassador in Brussels as special envoy, and of the envoy's impending 
              visit.</p>
              <p>Mr Baconschi, in addition to welcoming Mr Anil Kumar Nayar, assured 
              Singapore of Romania's strong commitment to due process in the case 
              concerning Ionescu, and its determination to enforce the law to its 
              utmost extent.</p>
              <p>The former diplomat was found by a coroner's court to have run over 
              three pedestrians along Bukit Panjang Road after a night of drinking on 
              Dec 15 last year. He later abandoned the embassy vehicle and reported it
               stolen.</p>
              <p>Singapore invited Romanian investigators to the republic to review 
              the evidence against Ionescu over a month ago.</p>
              <p>It appointed Mr Nayar to go to Romania when the European country was 
              unable to finalise dates for the visit.</p>

              <p>QX179R, thanksfor the article, no clue why it ends with "It appointed Mr Nayar to go to Romania when the European country
                                          was unable to finalise dates for the visit."</p>
              <p>Anyway, here's the other:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Title: Romania reassures S'pore on Ionescu's case<br>By:    Low Mei Mei<br>Date: 16 May 2010 1851 hrs (SST)<br>URL: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1057031/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1057031/1/.html</a><br>SINGAPORE: Romania's foreign minister has given the assurance that the authorities in his country have a strong commitment to fully observe the legal procedures in the hit-and-run case involving Dr Silviu Ionescu. <br>Mr Teodor Baconschi also underscored their determination to enforce the law to its utmost extent. <br>These reassurances were given in letters between Mr Baconschi and Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo. <br>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement on Sunday that there had been an exchange of letters between Mr Yeo and Mr Baconschi on the case of Dr Ionescu. <br>In two separate letters, Mr Yeo informed Mr Baconschi of the appointment of Singapore's Ambassador in Brussels as Singapore's Special Envoy to Romania. <br>Mr Yeo also informed Mr Baconschi of the forthcoming visit to Bucharest by the Special Envoy. <br>MFA said Mr Baconschi, in his two replies, welcomed the visit of Singapore's Special Envoy. It also expressed readiness to extend full support for the Envoy's mission. <br>Singapore's MFA said it welcomes these assurances from the Romanian foreign minister himself. It added that it will extend the fullest possible cooperation to the Romanian authorities to ensure that justice is served. <br>- CNA/ir</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I guess from the start, the best way forward would have been for mutual envoys in this regard to have been identified at the soonest possible occasion whence any significant 'incursions' by a 'diplomatic agent' had occurred, themselves kept informed and colaborating-  since diplomatic relations, by virtue of their mutual nature, and being created in the spirit of the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> (VCDR), ought ultimately be resolved through provisions of the same listed in the VCDR.</p>
              <p>Thus a 'visit' this day, 5months after the said 'incursion' dated 15Dec2009, is indeed a very late appointment.  Unfair to the chosen envoy Mr Nayar and very late in the process of mutual reconciliation.</p>
              <p>Even the eventual negotiations amongst prosecutors are ought to be conducted through diplomatic channels.</p>
              <p>Singapore must thus quickly establish diplomatic channels via its chosen envoy so that Romanian prosecutors can be clear and agreeable with the evidence at hand. Whilst it might be understandable that Romanian prosecutors might be uncomfortable with a Singaporean prosecutor taking their place in the Romanian courts, this would be a good opportunity for a Singaporean investigator &amp;/or prosecutor to be sent to Romania to respond to whatever queries the Romanians should have in their investigations- if Romania is agreeable that is. If necessary, core personnel and witness should be facilitated in traveling &amp;/or video conferencing facilities amply harnessed both during Romanian investigations as well as in court, so that Justice to be properly served, modern technology facilitating, distance notwithstanding.</p>
              <p>'Love letters' to and fro are today the parlance of a lover's duet. May modern technology be harnessed, may Justice prevail.</p>

              I believe that in making this comment, Mr Terrence Lim omits the 
                      vital fact that the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Article 31.4</a> states: <em>"The immunity of a 
                      diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving State does not 
                      exempt him from the jurisdiction of the sending State."</em><br> The fault with Mr Lim's article thus lies in his severely lacking, if 
                      not misleading definition of 'diplomatic-immunity'. <br> The omission of this vital fact thus throws Mr Lim's entire argument off
                       kilter since the existing clause within the agreement does indeed 
                      provide for the prosecution of crimes, committed under the 'guise' of 
                      'diplomatic-duty', so effectively there should not be any 'immunity'.<br> <br> The VCDR, as I understand, was written in the spirit of improving 
                      relations between Sovereigns. Why else would there be clauses defending 
                      the privileges regarding the acceptance and rejection of diplomats by 
                      the receiving state, not to mention emphasis upon the mutuality of 
                      diplomatic relations?<br> <br> In all fairness, adherence to the original terms of the VCDR (just 16 
                      pages long (normal font size) as the internet version may be), requires a
                       high degree of mutual commitment for adherence- and thus is perhaps ill
                       suited for all and sundry.<br> WHY ELSE would the persecution for crimes committed within the territory
                       of the 'receiving state' be persecuted by the 'sending state', but for 
                      the presence of a deep sense of trust and cooperation that exists, with 
                      certainty that justice would eventually be served.<br> <br> Singapore and Romania are poor examples in this regard, where despite 
                      after almost 43 years of mutual relations, there is yet nothing much to 
                      show for in this regard as the contracting state(s)'s infantile 
                      interpretations of the VCDR deliver embarrassing public results, and 
                      that with the flip-flop involvement of the 'Interpol' no less.<br> <br> Unless prepared for the high and lofty points of agreements contained 
                      within the VCDR, young and 'less developed' states are perhaps best 
                      suited to mutually accept 'abridged' versions of the  VCDR- e.g. 
                      excluding certain unfulfillable articles earlier on, with a view to 
                      further additions later on as the relationship improves.<br> What's left for now remains the judicious adherence to the mutual terms 
                      of lofty VCDR agreement between the contracting sovereigns themselves- 
                      that would ultimately "push diplomats to also fulfil their duty of 
                      reciprocating respect".<br> <br> Your assumptions are in keeping with the typical misguided citizenry.<br> <br> In the spirit of public edification and thus active participation in the
                       process of establishing good relations, may I invite your interest with

              <p><strong>Wheels of justice are grinding forward - George Yeo on Ionescu case</strong></p>
              <p>Foreign Minister George Yeo says it is wrong to conclude that no 
              progress has been made on the case of former Romanian diplomat Silviu 
              Ionescu.</p>
              <p>Giving an update in Parliament, Mr Yeo assured the house that the 
              Romanian legal process has " moved into a new phase" and that the wheels
               of justice are "grinding forward ". <br> <br> However Singapore should allow the Romanian authorities " reasonable 
              time " to go through their own legal processes. <br> <br> Ionescu, who was allegedly involved in a hit and run accident in 
              Singapore, was recently detained by the Romanian authorities for 29 
              days. <br> <br> Mr Yeo says he understands that it is possible for the prosecutor to 
              seek an extention of the detention when the 29 days are up. <br> <br> Meanwhile, Mr Yeo adds the Singapores foreign affairs ministry has also 
              been giving periodic updates to the EU ambassador to Singapore. <br> <br> Romania is member state of the European Union. <br> <br>" At a cocktail I could sense the embarassment and awkardness 
              felt by the European Union diplomats and they have a rule in all their 
              foreign missions, the national flag fly side by side with the EU flag. 
              So even though this is strictly a bilateral matter, there is not doubt 
              that EU diplomats and EU governments feel that they have an interest in 
              seeing this case satisfactorily resolved and justice properly served."</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE'S special envoy to Romania has ended his visit to the 
              country, and is convinced that its officials are doing their bit to 
              ensure that suspended diplomat Silviu Ionescu is brought to book.</p>
              <p>Mr Anil Kumar Nayar, Singapore's Ambassador to the European Union, 
              arrived in Romania with other officials from the Republic's 
              Attorney-General's Chambers on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Over the past four days, the team met key people in Romania 
              handling the case, including prosecutors and officials from the Foreign 
              and Justice ministries. It also expressed Singapore's serious intent to 
              see justice served in the case.</p>
              <p>Mr Nayar was sent to the country to help speed up Romania's 
              investigations into Ionescu, the country's former charge d'affaires in 
              Singapore who was found by a court here to be responsible for a 
              hit-and-run accident that killed one and injured two along Bukit Panjang
               Road on Dec 15.</p>
              <p>Speaking by phone from Romania, he told The Straits Times

               with this case are indeed trying their best to move the case forward

              - As I also later responded to [TDYonline19May2010]: 'Progress

               thus no excuse for the flagrantly 'undiplomatic' use of A39.2 by SG- 
              the remnants of which (a 'suspended' Interpol notice) remain a spanner 
              in the works of cementing mutual relations, not to mention the currently
               important Ionescu saga at hand.<br>

              worldwide respect and admire Singapore's proven system'?- If U are proud
               to be SGporean, den please stop comparing yourself to your neighbors. 
              If U have a mind of your own, you'd study the problem and suggest viable
               solutions and not just support PAP 'lock-stock-barrel'. Then again, it 
              is perhaps your job around these forums to defend PAP at all cost, by 
              'fair or foul', U have my sympathies.<br>

              special envoy to Romania has ended his visit to the country, and is 
              convinced that its officials are doing their bit to ensure that

              have to consider breaking of diplomatic relation if all else failed"-

              <p>TWO Romanian officials flew into Singapore yesterday afternoon to 
              build their case against suspended diplomat Silviu Ionescu, who is 
              denying his role in a hit-and-run accident here on Dec15.</p>
              <p>The senior level prosecutor and police officer were met at Changi 
              Airport's Terminal2 at about 4pm by Romania's acting charge d'affaires 
              here, Mr Alex Coseru.</p>
              <p>Neither man spoke to The Straits Times as they walked from the 
              arrival hall to the embassy car waiting outside.</p>
              <p>The visit by the officials, who will link up with their counterparts 
              from Singapore to form a working group, is expected to deepen Romania's 
              investigations into the involvement of Ionescu in the double hit-and-run
               case.</p>
              <p>This is important because the former charge d'affaires has refused to
               return to Singapore to face charges, after a Coroner's Court found him 
              responsible for hitting three pedestrians in Bukit Panjang Road on 
              Dec15. One of them later died, while the other two were injured.</p>
              <p>As neither country has an extradition treaty with the other, the 
              Romanian government could not compel Ionescu, 50, to return.</p>

              <p><strong>Ionescu trial in Romania</strong></p>
              <p>BUCHAREST - ROMANIAN diplomat Silviu Ionescu, will be tried in his 
              native country over a hit-and-run crash in Singapore in December that 
              killed a Malaysian national, prosecutors said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>A former charge d'affaires in Singapore, he has been indicted for 
              homicide, causing physical injuries and false statements, a press 
              release from the general prosecutor's office said.</p>
              <p>The date of his trial has not been set yet and he will 
              remain in custody until then, the statement said. He was arrested by 
              Romanian authorities in May.</p>
              <p>Ionescu is alleged to have hit three pedestrians in two 
              incidents in December while driving a car belonging to the Romanian 
              mission. One of the victims, a 30-year-old Malaysian national, suffered 
              brain damage and died on Christmas Day, while the two others, aged 24 
              and 18, suffered injuries.</p>
              <p>The diplomat, who flew back to Romania days after the 
              accident, 'did not stop to let pedestrians cross like they were allowed 
              to do by a green light', prosecutors said. 'He left the scene of the 
              first crash and drove on to the following crossroad where he again did 
              not stop by a pedestrian crossing and caused another accident', they 
              added.</p>
              <p>Ionescu has publicly denied he was the driver, claiming the 
              car was stolen. According to prosecutors, the claim 'does not conform to

              <p><strong>FM Yeo urges patience in Ionescu's case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Foreign Minister George Yeo has urged patience in the 
              case of a former Romanian diplomat allegedly involved in two hit-and-run
               accidents here. </span></p>
              <p><span>Dr Silviu Ionescu has been formally charged with homicide by 
              Romanian courts.
              <br> <br> He will also be tried for giving false information and causing physical 
              injuries.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu will be tried in his own country, according to Romanian 
              authorities who said this on Thursday. The date of his trial has yet to 
              be fixed.
              <br> <br> At a community event on Sunday, Mr Yeo told reporters that the Singapore
               government's lawyer in Romania has been kept informed by Romanian 
              authorities. 
              <br> <br> He added that Singapore will render assistance if required to do so.
              <br> <br> "It's very important for us to be patient, because if we're impatient, 
              and we're offside, then we lose. So observing due process is absolutely 
              important, both in Singapore and in Romania. It means going through what
               is required step by step, and sometimes holding back our desire to make
               comments or do things which we may regret later," said Mr Yeo.
              <br> <br> In the early hours of December 15 last year, a black Audi belonging to 
              the Romanian embassy ran down three pedestrians in two separate 
              accidents at Bukit Panjang.
              <br> <br> One man, Malaysian Tong Kok Wai, soon died from his injuries. Another, 
              Singaporean Bong Hwee Haw, has filed a civil suit against Dr Ionescu for
               compensation.
              <br> <br> A coroner's inquiry in May had established that the former charge 
              d'affaires was behind the wheel at the time.

              <p><strong>Ionescu trial in Romania to start on July 27</strong></p>
              <p><span> SINGAPORE: Singapore says the trial of former Chargé d'Affaires Dr 
              Silviu Ionescu in Romania, which begins on Tuesday, is an important step
               forward in ensuring that justice is served. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement on Monday that
               its Special Envoy to Romania, Ambassador Anil Kumar Nayar will attend 
              the start of the trial. </span></p>
              <p><span> Dr Ionescu has been indicted by Romania's General Prosecutor's Office 
              for homicide, and is also accused of causing physical injuries and 
              making false statements. </span></p>
              <p><span> He was arrested by Romanian authorities in May, for allegedly hitting 
              three pedestrians while driving a car belonging to the Romanian Embassy 
              in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span> One of the victims died. </span></p>
              <p><span> Dr Ionescu has publicly denied he was the driver, claiming the car was stolen. </span></p>
              <p><span> Singapore's foreign ministry has repeatedly called on the Romanian 
              government to "ensure that justice is served and seen to be served" in 
              the case. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Ex-Romanian diplomat Ionescu asks to be released on judicial supervision</strong></p>
              <p><span>BUCHAREST, Romania : Former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu has 
              asked to be released on judicial supervision on the first day of his 
              manslaughter trial in Romania. </span></p>
              <p><span> Ionescu is wanted in Singapore for his involvement in two hit-and-run 
              accidents along Bukit Panjang on December 15 last year in which one 
              person was killed and two others injured. </span></p>
              <p><span> Ionescu has been in custody in Romania since May and was brought to the courtroom wearing handcuffs. </span></p>
              <p><span> During the hearing, he claimed the evidence against him was not sufficient and, moreover, falsified. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said that he did not write the very first report to the police, 
              detailing exactly what happened in December last year, but that he only 
              wrote the second report. </span></p>
              <p><span> Even that report, he said, was rewritten by someone else and contained mistakes. </span></p>
              <p><span> The court hearing is still continuing, but if the judge decides to 
              release Ionescu under judicial supervision, he would have to remain in 
              Romania and report to police on his whereabouts. </span></p>
              <p><span>Neither of the victims of the accident nor their representatives 
              is present at the hearing, but they are likely to be invited to the 
              trial later on, in accordance with Romania's laws. 
              <br> <br> One person died and two were injured in two separate hit-and-run accidents in Singapore on December 15. 
              <br> <br> Ionescu, a Romanian charge d'affaires in Singapore at that time and who 
              was allegedly the driver, is now indicted for homicide, causing physical
               injuries, and giving false statements. 
              <br> <br> One of the victims is claiming over $630,000 in compensation. 
              <br> <br> The diplomat flew back to Romania days after the accident and claimed 
              that he was not the driver of the car, and that the car was stolen.

              <p><strong>MFA says Ionescu trial not about S'pore system or govt</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has 
              stressed that the trial of former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu is 
              not about the Singapore system or its government. </span></p>
              <p><span> It said this in response to queries about the allegations by Dr Ionescu that there was a political conspiracy. </span></p>
              <p><span> "The trial is about what happened on 15 December 2009 which resulted in 
              death and serious injuries, and the evidence found has pointed to 
              Ionescu," an MFA spokesman said in a statement on Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span> "His responsibility will have to be addressed through the Romanian legal
               process for justice to be served, and this is where the focus should 
              be," the spokesman added. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore's Special Envoy, Anil Kumar Nayar, also stressed this 
              point when he spoke to the media after the first day of the hearing in 
              Bucharest on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> He said: "Yes, we are pleased that the case has come to court, we are 
              pleased that the process is going on. This is the commitment that has 
              been given to us by the Romanian foreign minister, the Romanian 
              government, that they also, like us, want to see that justice is done. 
              That is our main priority.
              <br> <br> "So I want to make it very clear here, that what is on trial here is not our legal system or Singapore as a whole."
              <br> <br> Mr Nayar also made it clear that what's on trial are the facts of the case which Dr Ionescu has to answer for.
              <br> <br> "I think what Romania and Singapore both want is to see that justice is done," he said.
              <br> <br> Mr Nayar said significant progress has been made because investigations 
              have been completed on the Romanian side, and the case has come to 
              court.
              <br> <br> He said the important thing is not to prejudge outcomes and make 
              hypothetical predictions or assumptions but to "make sure that the 
              process moves forward to the conclusion that it should reach and make 
              sure that justice is done".
              <br> <br> "I remain cautiously optimistic, but a little bit more optimistic than I
               was during the last visit, at least in the sense that there has been 
              movement from the last time," he added.
