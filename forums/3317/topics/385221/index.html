              <p><strong>Diplomat a suspect</strong></p>
              <p>THE Romanian diplomat who claimed that his embassy car was stolen at
              the time it was involved in a hit-and-run accident a fortnight ago is
              now a suspect in the case.</p>
              <p>Dr Silviu Ionescu, the
              charge d'affaires of the Romanian Embassy in Singapore, has not been
              ruled out as the person behind the wheel of the Audi car in the early
              morning hit-and-run.</p>
              <p>One of the three men who was hit in the Bukit Panjang accident has died.</p>
              <p>In
              response to queries on Dr Ionescu on Tuesday, the police would only say
              they had 'not ruled out any suspect surfaced in the course of our
              investigations'.</p>
              <p>Investigations were still
              under way with officers 'following up on all available leads'. The
              police had earlier written to the embassy asking for more details on
              the accident.</p>
              <p>Checks by The Straits Times
              revealed that Dr Ionescu left the country sometime last week. Attempts
              to reach him on his Singapore mobile have been unsuccessful.</p>

              <p><strong>New evidence surfaces</strong></p>
              <p>FRESH evidence has surfaced to put the Romanian embassy's charge
              d'affaires in the Sungei Kadut area where the embassy's car - which was
              involved in a fatal hit-and-run accident - was found abandoned later
              that morning.</p>
              <p>A cabby yesterday told The Straits
              Times that he had picked up Dr Silviu Ionescu, the highest ranking
              Romanian embassy official in Singapore, at 3am-3.30am on Dec 15 in the
              Sungei Kadut area, after Dr Ionescu had flagged him down.</p>
              <p>The
              industrial area is about 5km from Bukit Panjang, where the embassy's
              Audi A6 car hit three pedestrians at about 3.10am. One victim, who
              suffered severe brain damage, has since died.</p>
              <p>The
              taxi driver who picked up Dr Ionescu told The Straits Times he had seen
              a Caucasian man wearing a jacket at the junction of Sungei Kadut Avenue
              and Woodlands Road and had slowed to a halt. He later told the police
              that his passenger was Dr Ionescu.</p>
              <p>Upon entering
              the cab, Dr Ionescu told the driver to head to Bukit Timah. But when
              they reached Bukit Timah, the cabby was told to head to Cluny Park Road.</p>
              <p>About
              10 minutes into the cab ride, Dr Ionescu asked the cabby how he could
              contact the police. The cabby said he told him to call 999.</p>
              <p>The
              cabby, who wanted to be known only as Mr Neo, said Dr Ionescu then
              called the police and said his car had gone missing. He then made
              another call, which Mr Neo said was in a foreign language. Mr Neo said
              he was unable to smell any alcohol on Dr Ionescu's breath.</p>

              <p><strong>Romanian diplomat to return Singapore? </strong></p>
              <p>The Romanian embassy's charge d'affaires, suspected to be involved in a
              tragic hit-and-run accident, could be back to his post in Singapore in
              late January. <br> <br> Dr Silviu Ionescu told a Romanian news website that he returned to
              Bucharest after the incident for some medical examinations which had
              been scheduled in advance. <br> <br> The 49-year-old diplomat also stressed he had no connection with the
              accident, and hopes the perpetrator is found as soon as possible. <br> <br> On 15th December, the embassy's car -- a black Audi A6, hit three pedestrians at about 3.10 am. <br> <br> One victim, who suffered severe brain damage, has since died on Christmas day. <br> <br> Dr Ionescu had reported to the police that his vehicle was stolen. <br> <br> Police said investigations are still on-going and would not rule out any suspect in the course of its investigations.</p>

              <p><strong>George Yeo stresses due process in resolving hit-and-run case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo has stressed the
              need for due process in resolving the hit-and-run accident at Bukit
              Panjang last year, where Romanian diplomat Dr Silviu Ionescu remains a
              suspect. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Yeo is the first Singapore minister to speak on the issue.
              <br> <br> He said the Romanian embassy is helping the police, and investigations are ongoing.
              <br> <br> On December 15, the embassy's car - a black Audi A6 - hit three pedestrians at about 3.10am.
              <br> <br> One of the victims, 30-year-old Tong Kok Wai, suffered brain damage and
              died on Christmas day, while the other two suffered injuries.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu had reported to the police that his vehicle was stolen.
              <br> <br> The diplomat is currently in Romania.
              <br> <br>"What happened was very bad, a man was killed, people were
              injured," said Mr Yeo. "The police are pursuing the matter very
              thoroughly but investigations are still ongoing and I should not be
              commenting on them. Let's take this one step at a time, there must be
              due process in such matters."

              <p><strong>Romanian Prosecutor's Office to investigate hit-and-run case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Romania's Foreign Ministry has asked its country's
              Prosecutor's Office to investigate the Bukit Panjang hit-and-run
              accident, which has alleged links to Dr Silviu Ionescu, the charge
              d'affaires of its embassy in Singapore. It has also recalled the
              Romanian diplomat from his post. </span></p>
              <p><span>A statement posted on the ministry's website on Wednesday said
              this is to allow for a "full and fair investigation of the case". The
              ministry added it has roped in its Prosecutor's Office following an
              "internal investigation".
              <br> <br>The investigation led to the conclusion that "from the point of
              view of legal procedures and international regulations, the MFA has
              neither the competences nor the means to identify the author, the cause
              and the circumstances of the accident, all such aspects pertaining to
              penal procedure".
              <br> <br> It added the ministry has also provided the Prosecutor's Office with all the information gathered on the case.
              <br> <br>"The MFA is committed to a rapid clarification of, and gives its
              entire support to, solving this case, keeping a permanent contact with
              the Romanian Prosecutor's Office and the authorities of Singapore," the
              statement said.
              <br> <br> Both Romania and Singapore are parties of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.
              <br> <br>The Convention states that "a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity
              from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state... the immunity
              of a diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving state does
              not exempt him from the jurisdiction of the sending state". <br> <br> This means the penal investigation of a case in which a diplomat is
              involved in the receiving state, takes place in the state where he
              holds citizenship.
              <br> <br> On December 15, a car belonging to the Romanian embassy in Singapore – a black Audi A6 – hit three pedestrians at about 3.10am.
              <br> <br> One victim, 30-year-old Tong Kok Wai, suffered brain damage and died on Christmas Day. The other two suffered injuries.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu, who is currently in Romania, had reported to the police that his vehicle was stolen.

              <p><strong>MFA summons envoy</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE on Thursday summoned the Romanian ambassador to the
              Republic to demand a series of actions in the wake of a hit-and-run
              accident last December involving an embassy staffer.</p>
              <p>Responding
              to media queries, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said MFA is
              seeking the return of Dr Silvio Ionescu for the coroner's inquiry on
              March 10 into the death of Mr Tong Kok Wai, one of the two victims of
              the Dec 15 accident. Dr Ionescu, who had earlier claimed the car
              involved in the accident was stolen, has been identified as a suspect
              in the case.</p>
              <p>Romanian Ambassador Aurelian Neagu,
              who is based in Tokyo, was told by the Singapore MFA that the accident
              'is of the highest concern to the Singapore Government. MFA also
              reiterated that it was most important that the Romanian Embassy
              cooperate fully with the Singapore authorities' on this.</p>
              <p>MFA
              explained to Mr Neagu that the coroner's inquiry is not a trial, but a
              fact-finding inquiry to establish the facts where there has been an
              unnatural death. 'MFA handed Ambassador Neagu a diplomatic note seeking
              the Romanian Embassy's assistance in requesting Dr Ionescu to return to
              Singapore to attend the Coroner's Inquiry,' said the spokesman.</p>
              <p>Referring
              to Romanian media reports that Dr Ionescu was still maintaining that
              the car had been stolen and that he was not the driver at the time of
              the two accidents, MFA pointed out that if Dr Ionescu was maintaining
              that he was not responsible, it was all the more reason why he should
              come back to Singapore to give his version at the Coroner's Inquiry.
              This will help the State Coroner to ascertain the facts relating to the
              two accidents.</p>
              <p>MFA also pointed out to Mr Neagu
              that Dr Ionescu was welcome to engage a local lawyer to examine the
              witnesses and put forth his version of the events at the Inquiry.
              Alternatively, the Romanian Embassy could engage a local lawyer on Dr
              Ionescu's behalf.</p>
              <p>Noting media reports of Dr
              Ionescu's claim in a recent Romanian television interview that there
              was a witness who could exonerate him, MFA asked the Romanian Embassy
              to request Dr Ionescu to give the Singapore authorities details
              concerning the identity of this witness. The witness can then be
              required to give evidence at the coroner's inquiry, said the MFA
              spokesman.</p>
