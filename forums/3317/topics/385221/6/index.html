              <p><strong>Odd silence in Romania</strong></p>
              <p>LONDON - THE media in Romania had reported extensively throughout 
              last week on the conclusions of the Singapore Coroner's Court regarding 
              the two hit-and-run accidents committed by Dr Silviu Ionescu, the 
              country's former envoy.</p>
              <p>But there was no attempt to analyse the legal consequences of this 
              case, and no debate about the damage Dr Ionescu's conduct may have 
              caused to Romania's international reputation.</p>
              <p>And not one of the country's politicians or diplomats 
              offered any comments.</p>
              <p>All of Romania's five national TV channels included in their
               evening news bulletins a report on the Singapore Coroner's findings on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>However, the reports were brief and factual, either 
              accompanied by just a still photograph of the envoy, or a video clip 
              showing Dr Ionescu emerging from a preliminary hearing at Romania's 
              public prosecutor's office.</p>
              <p>The printed media did better. Adevarul ('The Truth') - one 
              of Romania's top daily newspapers - published on Wednesday a large 
              article retelling the story of the car accident in Singapore, with the 
              aid of a detailed map showing the place of the incident, the location 
              where Dr Ionescu's car was subsequently found, pictures of the Romanian 
              Embassy, and an extensive chronology of the events since last December.</p>

              <p><strong>MFA provides same documents and photographs to Alex Coseru</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Foreign Ministry on Monday provided the 
              Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Romanian Embassy in Singapore with 
              two document folders and eight volumes of photographs. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Alex Coseru had left behind a similar set of documents and 
              photographs which were given to him during the Coroner's Inquiry.
              <br> <br> The Coroner had ruled that Dr Silviu Ionescu, Romania's former Charge 
              d'Affaires was the driver of the car that hit three pedestrians on 15 
              December 2009.
              <br> <br> Mr Coseru had told MFA on April 2 that he had done so because he did not
               know that they were for his retention.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Foreign Ministry said it's making clear to Mr Coseru that as
               he is the Romanian government's official representative in Singapore, 
              these were given to  him for his government's use and this was why he 
              had been given the documents during the Coroner's Inquiry in the first 
              place.
              <br> <br> The MFA spokesman pointed out that as he had said in his comments on 
              April 1, on the last day of the Coroner's Inquiry Mr Coseru had asked 
              the State Counsel for a copy of the Investigation Report.  
              <br> <br> This had been given to Mr Coseru who took it away with him at that time 
              without any misunderstanding.
              <br> <br> The MFA spokesman also noted that the media had reported that the 
              Romanian  MFA had disavowed the allegations made by Dr Silviu Ionescu 
              about the  Coroner's Inquiry and Singapore's judicial system and had 
              clarified that they did not represent the position of the Romanian 
              authorities.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that Singapore expected 
              the full co-operation of the Romanian authorities to ensure that justice
               would be served and that Singapore would cooperate to the fullest 
              extent possible under its law with the Romanian authorities.
              <br> <br> He added that the Romanian Ambassador to Singapore who is resident in 
              Tokyo, Mr Aurelian Neagu had not yet provided a firm date for his visit 
              to Singapore  to discuss the case but that the ministry expects to hear 
              from him shortly.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Foreign Ministry had summoned Mr Neagu, to a meeting this 
              week in Singapore to discuss the charges preferred by the 
              Attorney-General's Chambers against Dr Silviu Ionescu.  - CNA/vm

              <p><strong>Romanian envoy to meet MFA</strong></p>
              <p>TOKYO-BASED Romanian Ambassador to Singapore will meet Ministry of 
              Foreign officials here on Friday to discuss the case of suspended 
              diplomat Silviu Ionescu, said MFA on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Mr Aurelian Neagu was summoned to Singapore by MFA last week for a 
              meeting to discuss criminal charges which the Republic wants to bring 
              against Dr Ionescu.</p>
              <p>Singapore has taken the first steps towards criminal 
              proceedings against Dr Ionescu after the State Coroner found him 
              responsible for two hit-and-run accidents in Bukit Panjang last 
              December.</p>
              <p>The Attorney-General's Chambers has prepared a set of 13 
              charges it wants to bring against Dr Ionescu. The charges include 
              causing death by reckless driving, causing grievous hurt through a rash 
              act, and failing to stop, help or lodge a police report after the 
              accidents.</p>
              <p>In a statement on Monday night, the MFA said it noted that 
              Romania's Foreign Affairs Ministry has disavowed allegations hurled by 
              Dr Ionescu against the judiciary here. It was referring to media reports
               that said Dr Ionescu's remarks did not represent the position of the 
              Romanian authorities.</p>
              <p>Dr Ionescu had slammed the Coroner's Court last Wednesday 
              which blamed him for causing the death of Mr Tong Kok Wai, one of three 
              pedestrians hit by the Romanian Embassy's Audi A6 car along Bukit 
              Panjang Road on Dec 15.</p>

              to Singapore Aurelian Neagu, who is based in Tokyo.</p>
              <p>This notice means those manning entry and exit points in

              <p><strong>Joint group to probe envoy's case</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE and Romania have agreed to set up a Joint Technical Working
               Group to investigate the Dec 15 hit-and-run accident involving former 
              Romanian charge d?affaires Silviu Ionescue, said the Ministry of Foreign
               Affairs on Friday.</p>
              <p>The working group, proposed by the Romanian side in February, is 
              expected to start work by May.</p>
              <p>'If the Romanian side was ready to begin work earlier, 
              Singapore was ready to do so as we had already appointed our 
              representatives to the Joint Technical Working Group,' said an MFA 
              spokesman on Friday, after it met Romanian Ambassador to Singapore 
              Aurelian Neagu to discuss the criminal charges which Singapore wants to 
              bring against Dr Ionescu, 49.</p>
              <p>Mr Neagu, who flew from Tokyo where he is based, told MFA 
              officials at Friday's meeting that Romania was ready to send a 
              prosecutor to Singapore to meet officials here 'at anytime.' In 
              response, MFA said it hopes the Romanian authorities would propose 
              specific dates for the visit without delay.</p>
              <p>At the meeting, MFA also lodged a strong protest to the 
              Ambassador on the inappropriate comments made by Dr Ionescu to the media
               on the integrity of Singapore's judicial system and the victims.</p>
              <p>'Dr Ionescu's comments were without basis, callous in the 
              extreme and showed an utter lack of remorse. MFA pointed out that the 
              Singapore legal system was widely known for its transparency, integrity 
              and high standards and that Dr Ionescu's callous comments on the victims
               had only further inflamed public feelings against Dr Ionescu and 
              Romania,' the MFA spokesman said.</p>
              <p>'MFA welcomed the Romanian MFA's disavowal of the 
              allegations made by Dr Ionescu about the Coroner's Inquiry and 
              Singapore's judicial system and its clarification that they did not 
              represent the position of the Romanian Government.'</p>
              <p>MFA, however, stressed to the Ambassador that it was 
              puzzling that its Foreign Ministry continued to allow Dr Ionescu, who is
               still an employee of the ministry although he has been suspended from 
              his duties, to make such inappropriate remarks.</p>
              <p>It told Mr Neagu that 'so long as Dr Ionescu remained 
              formally in the employment of the Romanian government, the Romanian MFA 
              could not disavow responsibility for him and had a strong obligation to 
              ensure that Dr Ionescu refrained from making outrageous and 
              inappropriate statements. Such statements damaged Romania's reputation 
              and were not in Dr Ionescu's own interests either.'</p>
              <p>'MFA cautioned Ambassador Neagu that Romania should not 
              underestimate the depth of feelings that had been aroused in Singapore 
              over the case. Questions had been asked in Parliament. The Romanian 
              Government must in its own interests ensure that justice was served and 
              seen to be served. Otherwise, there would inevitably be consequences for
               bilateral relations,' added the MFA spokesman.</p>

              <p><strong>Romania to send reps here</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIA will send representatives to Singapore to study the evidence 
              that has come up against former charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu, who is
               under criminal probe in his home country. The representatives will work
               with officials from the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) here as a 
              Joint Technical Working Group.</p>
              <p>These details were released by the Foreign Affairs Ministry (MFA) 
              after it met Romanian ambassador Aurelian Neagu on Friday. The MFA said 
              it hoped the work group can start work by next month.</p>
              <p>Dr Ionescu is under investigation in Romania for homicide by
               negligence, leaving the scene of an accident and making false 
              statements. In Singapore, the AGC wants to charge him for 13 offences 
              over the hit-and-run accident on Dec 15. Mr Tong Kok Wai, 30, died in 
              the accident.</p>
              <p>During Friday's meeting, the MFA told Mr Neagu that 
              Singapore's preference was 'nevertheless for Dr Ionescu to return to 
              Singapore to face the charges', though there is no extradition treaty 
              between the two countries. Interpol has issued a red notice against Dr 
              Ionescu after the Singapore police issued a warrant of arrest.</p>
              <p>At the meeting, the MFA also lodged a strong protest with Mr
               Neagu over comments Dr Ionescu had made to the media. He had insulted 
              the Singapore judiciary following the Coroner's verdict, which blamed 
              him for Mr Tong's death.</p>
              <p>The Romanian government has delinked itself from Dr 
              Ionescu's comments. However, the MFA said that Dr Ionescu, while 
              suspended, remained a Romanian government employee. So it had a 'strong 
              obligation' to ensure he stopped making such 'outrageous' statements, 
              which damaged Romania' reputation.</p>

              <p><strong>Arrest warrant issued, Interpol on red alert against Silviu Ionescu</strong></p>
              <p><em>Channel NewsAsia - <abbr class="timedate" title="Saturday, April 10">Saturday, April 10</abbr></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://d.yimg.com/hb/ng/co/cna/20100409/18/1816337074-arrest-warrant-issued-interpol-on-red-alert-against-silviu-ionescu.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government has issued a Warrant of Arrest against Dr Silviu Ionescu over a deadly hit—and—run accident, while Interpol issued a Red Notice against the former Romanian charge d’affaires.</p>
              <p>Last month, the Coroner’s Inquiry held in Singapore ruled that Dr Ionescu was the driver of the car that hit three pedestrians on December 15 last year. One person died.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Friday met Mr Aurelian Neagu, the Romanian Ambassador to Singapore, who is based in Tokyo.</p>
              <p>MFA said Mr Neagu was officially informed of the findings of the Coroner’s Inquiry and the charges preferred by the Singapore Attorney—General’s Chambers (AGC) against Dr Silviu Ionescu.</p>
              <p>He was also officially informed that a Warrant of Arrest had been issued against Dr Ionescu and that Interpol had issued a Red Notice against him.</p>
              <p>A Red Notice means the warrant can be circulated in member countries, with the request that the wanted person be arrested with a view to extradition.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s Foreign Ministry told Mr Neagu that Singapore understood Romania cannot compel Dr Ionescu to return to the Republic as there was no Extradition Treaty between the two countries.</p>
              <p>Still, the ministry stressed that the Romanian government had a clear moral obligation to persuade Dr Ionescu to come back to Singapore to stand trial.</p>
              <p>It said this was in Romania’s own interests as Dr Ionescu had seriously damaged Romania’s international reputation.</p>
              <p>Mr Neagu informed MFA that the Romanian Prosecutor’s Office had started criminal investigations against Dr Ionescu on February 2 on "homicide by negligence, leaving the scene of an accident and false statements".</p>
              <p>These are similar to the charges which the ACG had prepared against Dr Ionescu.</p>
              <p>Ambassador Neagu stressed that Romania was committed to seeing justice done.</p>
              <p>The Ambassador explained that Romania would need to conduct its own investigations against Dr Ionescu in accordance with Romanian law.</p>
              <p>He assured MFA that Romania would continue to cooperate fully with Singapore on the matter, and abide by the law and international procedures in dealing with this case.</p>
              <p>MFA thanked Mr Neagu for his assurances of Romania’s commitment, and reiterated that Singapore would cooperate with Romania to the fullest extent possible under Singapore’s law to see that justice is served.</p>
              <p>Singapore told Mr Neagu that it has agreed to Romania’s request to set up a Joint Commission, which will comprise legal experts from both sides, who will share evidence.</p>
              <p>They could start work by May.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Foreign Ministry cautioned Mr Neagu that Romania should not underestimate the depth of feelings that had been aroused in Singapore over the case.</p>
              <p>It continued to say that the Romanian government must, in its own interests, ensure justice is served. Otherwise, there would inevitably be consequences for bilateral relations.</p>

              <p><strong>Romania says Ionescu's case won't affect bilateral ties with Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Romania said it's determined not to let former Romanian
               diplomat Dr Silviu Ionescu's case affect the bilateral relations with 
              Singapore and it said its stance of total respect of the Romanian law 
              and of the international procedures demonstrates this determination. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore has said it'll work with the Romanian authorities to 
              ensure that justice is served expeditiously. 
              <br> <br> Former Romanian diplomat, Dr Silviu Ionescu, was involved in two 
              hit-and-run traffic accidents here last December which left a Malaysian 
              dead and two people injured. 
              <br> <br> And it's a case which has caught the attention of many, particularly 
              after Dr Ionescu left the country and claimed he was set up. 
              <br> <br> In a statement posted on its website, Romania's Foreign Ministry said Dr
               Ionescu's statements are his own exclusive responsibility and that it 
              dissociates itself from his statements. 
              <br> <br> It added that once an employee is suspended from duties, his statements 
              carry the same weight as personal opinions expressed by any other 
              Romanian citizen. 
              <br> <br> Romania also said it has acted with utmost openness and pursued law 
              enforcement. 
              <br> <br> Singapore's Foreign Minister George Yeo, who was attending an 
              exhibition, was asked if ties between Singapore and Romania have been 
              affected by the incident. 
              <br> <br> Mr Yeo said: "We'll work together with them. I think they want to see 
              justice done too. It's in our interest, it's in their interest. We're 
              going to form this joint technical committee and work together to ensure
               that justice is done." 
              <br> The Singapore government has issued an arrest warrant against Dr 
              Ionescu. 
              <br> <br> At the same time, Interpol has also issued a 'Red Notice' against the 
              former diplomat. 
              <br> <br> This means that those manning entry and exit points in member countries 
              will be on extra alert for the wanted man, with a view to his arrest and
               extradition. 
              <br> <br> As for the likelihood of Dr Ionescu being brought back to Singapore? 
              <br> <br> Mr Yeo said: "Let's take this one step at a time and not be off side on 
              what must be due process." 
              <br> <br> Mr Yeo was at the launch of the "Arabs in Southeast Asia" exhibition at 
              the National Library. 
              <br> <br> The six-month long exhibition highlights the exchanges of trade, 
              cultural and religious practices between the Middle East and Southeast 
              Asia. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Empathy in Romania</strong></p>
              <p>BUCHAREST - ROMANIA is a quarter of the way round the world from 
              Singapore, and the two countries' historical encounters have been few.</p>
              <p>But the fatal hit-and-run accident in Bukit Panjang has 
              changed that.</p>
              <p>'The Romanian diplomat in Singapore? Yes, yes, I know about 
              this, it was on the news,' said the taxi driver as he wove through one 
              of the Romanian capital's legendary traffic jams. 'He was driving the 
              car, and maybe drinking, and then he ran away, yes?'</p>
              <p>During a visit to get a sense of what ordinary Romanians 
              made of the story that has Singapore buzzing, all 15 people asked about 
              the notorious traffic accident were aware of it.</p>
              <p>The cabby, Mr Cristian Chiran, did not know Dr Silviu 
              Ionescu by name. The former charge d'affaires does not have quite the 
              same notoriety here.</p>
              <p>But the 21 million citizens of this south-eastern European 
              nation are voracious consumers of news. There are more than 70 daily 
              newspapers, six public television stations and dozens of radio stations.
               Many have reported at least the story's basics.</p>

              <div>Perhaps Singapore could be a bit more respectful of international legal protocol, especially since Romania has thus far seemed quite cooperative for their part (already indicting him on 2nd Feb for negligent homicide). Think complying w International norms would be better for the image of Singapore rather then a 'high-handed' approach.<br>Also, given Romania's obvious preference to abide by international laws of diplomatic relations, perhaps Singapore should cooperate closely with Romania in persecuting Dr Ionescu for the moment as the practise of such 'one-upmanship'- bypassing the Romanian government in disciplining its diplomat against international diplomatic norms- might be viewed negatively by the Romanian people, God forbid it be view as 'brinkmanship' and regrettably backfire.<br>I might be wrong of course...<br>May we be at peace with the world.<br>(see highlighted parts for the Romanian response below)</div>

On January 6, 2010, the Prosecutor's Office set off the criminal prosecution against Ionescu, at the ministry's request.<br><br>On January 11, 2010, judicial authorities in Singapore were asked to provide all available accident-related data. The request was submitted via international police cooperation networks, namely, the Romanian Interpol Office and the Singapore Interpol Office, respectively, according to the press release.<br><br>On January 26, 2010, the Romanian Foreign Ministry provided information to Interpol Singapore on whether Romanian judicial authorities are entitled to probe, try and sentence Romanian citizens for crimes committed abroad, the press release also read.<br><br>On January 29, 2010, Interpol Singapore offered additional information to the Romanian General Prosecutor's Office and said more information would be provided only in keeping with the investigations that were to be unfolded by the Singapore Coroner's Court.<br><br>On February 2, 2010, the Romanian General Prosecutor's Office indicted Ionescu for negligent homicide, fleeing the scene of the accident and false statements. In consequence, Ionescu was suspended from his diplomatic duties within the Romanian Foreign Ministry, under the Romanian law, until the end of the investigation.

              <p><br> Yes Singapore is doing something no doubt, but just thought that they should act with some finesse. No need to blow case out of proportion, trespass international law- a considered approach would be better. One man's incursion doesn't mean we black list the whole community right? 
                  Les we forget, we won the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedra_Branca_dispute">Pedra Branca case against Malaysia via the ICJ</a>. So likewise with the international community, we should act with propriety. We are not the only ones inhabiting this planet.</p>
              <p>A firm  and decisive action by both sides according to mutual treaties and international agreements is needed here, not hues, cries and media propaganda.</p>
              <p>In short, it isn't worth it going overboard and then getting criticized as belligerent in our attempt to achieve justice. Remember, we are paying our ministers multi-million dollar salaries, they should be expected to handle this well:</p>

              <div id="post_message_398570" class="vb_postbit">Singapore application 
                  to Interpol hits brick wall. <br> Perhaps Singapore could be a bit more respectful of international legal 
                  protocol, especially since Romania has thus far seemed quite cooperative
                   for their part (already indicting Dr Ionescu on 2nd Feb for 'negligent 
                  homicide, fleeing the scene of the accident and false statements'; '... 
                  suspended from his diplomatic duties'). Think complying w International 
                  norms would achieve a better prosecution outcome, not to mention, 
                  improve the image of Singapore amongst the international community, 
                  rather then a 'high-handed' approach.<br> Also, given Romania's obvious preference to abide by the mutually 
                  ratified <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (esp Article  
                  31)</a>, perhaps Singapore should cooperate closely with Romania in 
                  persecuting Dr Ionescu along such mutual lines- as the practice of such 
                  'one-upmanship'- bypassing the Romanian government in disciplining its 
                  diplomat against international diplomatic norms- would be viewed 
                  negatively by the Romanian people, not to mention international 
                  community; God forbid it be view as 'brinkmanship' and ultimately 
                  backfire.<br> <br> I believe that by Treaty and international law, Romania's stand in <a href="http://www.mediafax.ro/english/romania-keeps-singapore-updated-on-steps-taken-in-criminal-case-of-fmr-envoy-ionescu-fm-5849023/">9April2010[MediaFax.ro]: 'Romania Keeps Singapore 
                  Updated On Steps Taken In Criminal Case Of Fmr Envoy Ionescu – FM' </a>is
                   legally correct and should be respected. After all, Romania seems 
                  rather enthusiastic thus far in taking responsibility for the actions of
                   it's rogue diplomat (Romanian gov has already declared Dr Ionescu's 
                  press comments as his personal opinions/ defense and NOT the govt's 
                  stand). <br> Even if Interpol Singapore received Dr Ionescu from another country, we 
                  would still need Romanian govt permission to detain him, since by 
                  treaty, without Romanian removal of his 'diplomat status', he remains 
                  still immune to Singapore law* (*but not to Romanian laws) [see article 
                  31: <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a>].<br> Would be very funny because Singapore Gov would then be totally at 
                  Romania's mercy to prevent further embarrassment at that point, and the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">ICJ</a> would support 
                  Romania totally in this respect.<br> Why shoot yourself in the foot when one doesn't have to?<br> <br> The current President of Interpol might now be <a href="http://www.interpol.int/Public/icpo/governance/ec/default.asp">Singaporean</a>, still, a little humility would serve us
                   well.<br> <br> In parting, let me suggest that the blatant disregard for the 'right of

                  Criminal Case Of Fmr Envoy Ionescu – FM</a><br> 9April2010<br> Romania’s ambassador to Singapore Aurelian Neagu informed Singapore’s 
                  Foreign Ministry of the steps taken by the Romanian authorities for a 
                  lawful investigation of former Romanian envoy to Singapore Silviu 
                  Ionescu blamed for a hit-and-run accident in December, Romania’s Foreign
                   Ministry said Friday.<br> <br> Neagu reiterated Romania's commitment to uphold procedures needed to 
                  clear out all aspects related to the case and stressed that all the 
                  public statements made by Ionescu regarding this case were his personal 
                  standpoint and did not represent an official stance of the Romanian 
                  Foreign Ministry or the Romanian authorities, the ministry said in its 
                  press release Friday.<br> <br> Considering the criminal charges brought against Ionescu by the Romanian
                   General Prosecutor's Office, Ionescu was suspended from his diplomatic 
                  duties within the Romanian Foreign Ministry under the provisions of 
                  article 60 of Law 269/ 2003 regulating the Statute of Romania's 
                  Diplomatic and Consular Corps.<br> <br> Neagu also underscored that the Romanian authorities wanted to fully 
                  abide by the law and international procedures in dealing with this case.<br> <br> According to the press release, on January 5, 2010, the ministry 
                  submitted a request to the General Prosecutor's Office to investigate 
                  the accident on December 15, 2009 in which a vehicle of the Romanian 
                  diplomatic mission in Singapore was involved. On January 6, 2010, the 
                  Prosecutor's Office set off the criminal prosecution against Ionescu, at
                   the ministry's request.<br> <br> On January 11, 2010, judicial authorities in Singapore were asked to 
                  provide all available accident-related data. The request was submitted 
                  via international police cooperation networks, namely, the Romanian 
                  Interpol Office and the Singapore Interpol Office, respectively, 
                  according to the press release.<br> <br> On January 26, 2010, the Romanian Foreign Ministry provided information 
                  to Interpol Singapore on whether Romanian judicial authorities are 
                  entitled to probe, try and sentence Romanian citizens for crimes 
                  committed abroad, the press release also read.<br> <br> On January 29, 2010, Interpol Singapore offered additional information 
                  to the Romanian General Prosecutor's Office and said more information

                  be unfolded by the Singapore Coroner's Court.<br> <br> On February 2, 2010, the Romanian General Prosecutor's Office indicted 
                  Ionescu for negligent homicide, fleeing the scene of the accident and 
                  false statements. In consequence, Ionescu was suspended from his 
                  diplomatic duties within the Romanian Foreign Ministry, under the 
                  Romanian law, until the end of the investigation. Singapore' authorities

              <p><strong>'Desperate and cowardly'</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE'S Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday responded to the 
              latest comments made by suspended Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu in an
               interview with the Romanian media, calling them "wild babblings of a 
              desperate man".</p>
              <p>Dr Ionescu had claimed he had been set up by the Singapore government
               and had earlier requested for a change of posting - even to Moldova. 
              Pointing to how Dr Ionescu has now "dragged in Moldova, a neighbour of 
              Romania", an MFA spokesman said: 'He is only hurting himself and 
              embarrassing his own government and all Romanians. We cannot take the 
              wild babblings of a desperate man too cowardly to face up to his own 
              responsibilities seriously.</p>
              <p>"As you are aware, we have informed the Romanian authorities
               that they have an obligation to ensure that Dr Ionescu, who has only 
              been suspended but not dismissed from the Romanian Foreign Ministry, 
              refrains from making outrageous and inappropriate statements and that it
               is in their own interest that they do so.</p>
              <p>"The Romanian Foreign Ministry has told us that Dr Ionescu, 
              as a Romanian citizen, has the right to say what he pleases and that 
              they cannot stop him. We have to respect this position. And the Romanian
               government has quite properly disassociated itself from his comments. 
              Dr Ionescu is not hurting Singapore. If you follow what Romanian 
              netizens are saying, it is clear that even his own compatriots do not 
              believe him. He is only hurting himself and embarrassing his own 
              government and all Romanians."</p>
              <p>The spokesman noted that in his latest comments, Dr Ionescu 
              has dragged in Moldova, a neighbour of Romania, 'in a less than 
              flattering way '. In some of his previous comments, he has even 
              mentioned the EU," added the spokesman.</p>
              <p>On Dr Ionescu's comment that he would be hanged if he 
              returned to Singapore, the MFA spokesman said: "This is a complete red 
              herring. None of the charges against Dr Ionescu is a capital offence."</p>

              <p><strong>No immunity for Ionescu</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE has told Romania that its former charge d'affaires Silviu 
              Ionescu does not enjoy diplomatic immunity for his alleged offences on 
              Dec 15 last year. Based on Article 39.2 of Vienna Convention on 
              Diplomatic Relations, a diplomat loses immunity for non-official acts 
              when his posting ends and he leaves his host country.</p>
              <p>'Dr Ionescu was using the Embassy vehicle in his private capacity and
               for his private purposes', said the Foreign Affairs Ministry in a 
              statement on Thursday. 'As such, with effect from Dr Ionescu's recall, 
              he no longer enjoys diplomatic immunity for the acts in question.'</p>
              <p>The Coroner had found that Dr Ionescu, who turned 50 last 
              week, was behind the wheel when the Romanian embassy's Audi A6 hit three
               pedestrians on Dec 15, killing one of them. The evidence showed that 
              the Romanian had removed the state flag from the car before attending a 
              birthday party at a karaoke lounge off Selegie Road. After the accident,
               Dr Ionescu was removed from his position and returned to Romania.</p>
              <p>The MFA statement was in response to the Romanian 
              authorities, which said it cannot arrest Dr Ionescu as he enjoys 
              diplomatic immunity which Romania has not waived. Neither has Singapore 
              sought a waiver.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, Singapore issued a warrant of arrest 
              against Dr Ionescu, who is wanted for 13 criminal charges to do with the
               hit-and-run accident. This led to an Interpol red notice, which 
              requests member countries to arrest Dr Ionescu with a view to his 
              extradition.</p>
              <p>While Romania is a member of Interpol, the country's 
              Ministry of Justice said it could not arrest Dr Ionescu because there is
               no extradition treaty with Singapore.</p>

              <p><strong>Ionescu used embassy car in private capacity: MFA</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Foreign Ministry spokesman said it is clear
               from the findings of the Coroner's Inquiry that the acts for which Dr 
              Silviu Ionescu has been charged were not pursuant to his official 
              functions. </span></p>
              <p><span>Dr Ionescu was using his embassy car in his private capacity and 
              for his private purposes. As such, with effect from Dr Ionescu's recall,
               he no longer enjoys diplomatic immunity for the acts in question.
              <br> <br> The spokesman added that as Dr Ionescu was recalled by his government on
               January 5 this year and is no longer serving as a diplomat in 
              Singapore, his immunity for acts performed outside of his function as a 
              diplomat would have lapsed, as provided for by Article 39.2 of the 
              Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
              <br> <br> The spokesman also explained that as a result, there was no need for a 
              waiver of diplomatic immunity by Romania and no need for Singapore to 
              seek a waiver.
              <br> <br> He also referred to the Romanian Ambassador to Singapore Aurelian 
              Neagu's comments to Singapore's Foreign Ministry during a meeting on 
              February 11 that the events of December 15 last year were "the 
              responsibility of Ionescu as a person and not a Romanian diplomat".
              <br> <br> The Coroner had ruled that Dr Ionescu, Romania's former Charge 
              d'Affaires, was the driver of the car that hit three pedestrians on 
              December 15.
              <br> <br> Singapore has issued a warrant of arrest against the Dr Ionescu, and 
              Interpol has issued a Red Notice against him. The red notice allows the 
              warrant to be circulated worldwide for the wanted person to be arrested 
              with a view to extradition.
              <br> <br> The Romanian Justice Ministry had on April 9 issued a press statement 
              suggesting that Romania is unable to arrest Dr Ionescu and extradict him
               as he enjoys diplomatic immunity, which Romania has not waived and 
              Singapore has not sought such a waiver.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Foreign Ministry's spokesman said that the Romanian 
              government's position was that it could not compel Dr Ionescu to return 
              to Singapore not because he enjoyed diplomatic immunity, but because 
              there is no Extradition Treaty between Singapore and Romania.
              <br> <br> The spokesman added that Singapore has taken the Romanian government at 
              its word that it cannot compel Dr Ionescu to return to Singapore. 
              <br> <br> That is why Singapore has asked the Romanian government to do what it 
              can to persuade Dr Ionescu that it is in his own interest and in 
              Romania's interest, to return to Singapore to stand trial.
              <br> <br> The Romanian Ambassador had informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
              that relevant Romanian officials were prepared to visit Singapore at any
               time to begin its work with the Joint Technical Working Group. 
              <br> <br> Singapore is waiting for the Romanian government to propose dates for 
              the visit. Singapore will facilitate the visit of these Romanian 
              officials, and assist them to gather the necessary evidence. 
              <br> <br> Such evidence will, amongst other things, show that Dr Ionescu was 
              acting in his private capacity and for his private purposes when the 
              accidents took place.
              <br> <br> On April 12, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) had forwarded a copy 
              of the official records of the Coroner's Inquiry pursuant to the request
               for mutual legal assistance by the Romanian Ministry of Justice to the 
              Romanian Embassy in Singapore. These materials contain all the evidence 
              heard by the Coroner's Inquiry.
              <br> <br> The MFA spokesman added that the Romanian government has consistently 
              assured Singapore, most recently through its Ambassador on April 9 and 
              later that same day by the Secretary of State (Permanent Secretary) of 
              the Romanian Foreign Ministry himself, that the Romanian government is 
              committed to seeing that justice is served.
              <br> <br> Based on these assurances, Singapore understands the obligations of the 
               Romanian government to be: 
              <br> <br> Firstly, to do all it can to persuade Dr Ionescu to stand trial in 
              Singapore;
              <br> <br> Secondly, if it is not possible to persuade Dr Ionescu to return to 
              Singapore to stand trial, to investigate and prosecute Dr Ionescu under 
              Romanian law, as the Romanian authorities have repeatedly said they will
               do.
              <br> <br> When asked by the media on Dr Ionescu's latest interview with 
              Libertatea, the MFA spokesman said: "We cannot take the wild babblings 
              of a desperate man too cowardly to face up to his own responsibilities 
              seriously.
              <br> <br> "As you are aware, we have informed the Romanian authorities that they 
              have an obligation to ensure that Dr Ionescu, who has only been 
              suspended but not dismissed from the Romanian Foreign Ministry, refrains
               from making outrageous and inappropriate statements and that it is in 
              their own interest that they do so.
              <br> <br> "The Romanian Foreign Ministry has told us that Dr Ionescu, as a 
              Romanian  citizen, has the right to say what he pleases and that they 
              cannot stop him.  We have to respect this position. And the Romanian

              <br> <br> On Dr Ionescu's comment that he would be hanged if he returned to 
              Singapore, the MFA spokesman said: "This is a complete red herring. None
               of the charges against Dr Ionescu is a capital offence."

              <p><strong>MFA reiterates that Ionescu cannot now claim immunity for accident</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Romania's former Charge d'Affaires, Dr Silviu Ionescu, 
              does not now enjoy and cannot now claim immunity for last December's 
              accident. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore's Foreign Ministry (MFA) responded on Friday to media 
              queries as to why if Dr Ionescu does not enjoy diplomatic immunity as 
              the MFA spokesman had said on Thursday, he was not prevented from 
              leaving the country or arrested after the accident of 15 December 2009.
              <br> <br> The MFA spokesman replied: "We should not confuse the privileges and 
              immunities which diplomats enjoy during their posting in a country to 
              which they are accredited, with the privileges and immunities they enjoy
               after leaving the country of accreditation at the end of their 
              postings." 
              <br> <br> He added that they are different situations and the Vienna Convention on
               Diplomatic Relations clearly recognises these differences.
              <br> <br> Article 39.1 of the Vienna Convention states that a diplomat's 
              privileges and immunities begin from the moment he enters the receiving 
              state to take up his post. 
              <br> <br> These privileges and immunities include freedom from detention and 
              arrest (Article 29) and immunity from the jurisdiction of the criminal 
              courts of the receiving state (Article 31.1).
              <br> <br> "As long as a diplomat remains accredited to a receiving state, his 
              privileges and immunities in that state would apply to all his actions, 
              whether official or private," the spokesman said.
              <br> <br> The MFA spokesman added that even if Dr Ionescu did not leave Singapore 
              after the accident, as an accredited diplomat, Singapore cannot arrest 
              him unless the Romanian government waives his immunity. His immunity 
              then covered anything he did, whether official or private.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu left Singapore on December 18 last year, three days after the
               accident. The MFA spokesman pointed out that at that time, he was still
               a diplomat officially accredited to Singapore and therefore could not 
              be prevented from leaving.
              <br> <br> Furthermore, the police had, at that time, not completed their 
              investigations and it was not yet established that Dr Ionescu was the 
              driver of the vehicle that caused the accident on December 15.
              <br> <br> "The situation now is different and a different provision of the Vienna 
              Convention now applies," the spokesman said.
              <br> <br> "Article 39.2 of the Vienna Convention stipulates that, after a 
              diplomat's posting ends and he leaves his country of accreditation, some
               of his privileges and immunities would also end. 
              <br> <br> "To be more specific, while he would still enjoy immunity for official 
              acts, he would no longer enjoy immunity for private acts."
              <br> <br> The Romanian government has now officially withdrawn Dr Ionescu from 
              Singapore, thus ending his posting with effect from January 5 this year.
               
              <br> <br> "He is now no longer an accredited diplomat in Singapore," the spokesman
               added. 
              <br> <br> The Coroner's Inquiry has concluded that Dr Ionescu was the driver of 
              the vehicle that caused the accident and that he was acting in a private
               capacity and engaged in private and not official activity at that time.
              <br> <br> The ministry's spokesman explained that therefore, Dr Ionescu does not 
              now enjoy and cannot now claim immunity for the accident. Diplomatic 
              immunity is no longer a relevant issue.
              <br> <br> The spokesman said Singapore's high international reputation as a 
              country that respects the law is a precious asset and it must always 
              observe the law and due process.
              <br> <br> "We have stressed to the Romanian government many times that it should 
              persuade Dr Ionescu to return to Singapore to stand trial or, if this is
               not possible, to expeditiously investigate and prosecute him under 
              Romanian law," the spokesman said.
              <br> <br> Singapore is ready to assist the Romanian authorities to the fullest 
              extent under its law.
              <br> <br> The ministry's spokesman added that Singapore is waiting for the 
              Romanian authorities to propose specific dates for their relevant 
              officials to visit Singapore so that it can share the evidence it has 
              with them.
              <br> <br> The spokesman said the Romanian authorities have acted entirely properly
               so far and have repeatedly stressed that they share Singapore's 
              interest in seeing justice served. 
              <br> <br> "It is not in Romania's own interest to allow the actions of one 
              individual to continue to disgrace the entire country," he said.

              <p><strong>Recourse for victims?</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIAN prosecutors have seized Silviu Ionescu's apartment in 
              Bucharest as a hedge against potential compensation claims should the 
              former diplomat be charged and convicted.</p>
              <p>While it may still be early days, the Romanian legal system offers 
              the victims of the hit-and-run accident some recourse in the country's 
              criminal proceedings against Ionescu.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old diplomat is currently under investigation in
               Romania for manslaughter, leaving the scene of an accident and making 
              false statements.</p>

              ---<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">In my satire, the relationship between Romania MFA and Singapore MFA is described metaphorically as a marriage between 2 willing parties- Roma and Singa, the former the Husband and the latter the Wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">It is by mutual agreement and in accordance with the terms of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75;" href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that the marriage is solemnized- Romania being the sending state and Singapore the receiving as is currently the case.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">As in any typical matrimony, the marriage is consummated by an emissary, the 'Appendage of Love' (Ionescu) - Romania the sending, Singapore the receiving as is the current case.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">For many years was the marriage peaceful and productive, both parties enjoying the relationship, not to mention the Appendage rising to the occasion, much to the bedtime delight of both parties. However coming along in years and sinking under the pressure at work, Roma took to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75;" href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100304-0000135/Dr-Ionescu-had-drinks-at-3-different-locations">alcoholism</a>; as a result, the 'Appendage-of-love'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75;" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1033357/1/.html">practically malfunctioned</a>. Singa became enraged by the turn in events demanded 'justice'. To which she resolved would mean punishing the appendage. Roma, noticing her displeasure and accepting responsibility for the break down in relationship, apologizes profusely and ask how better he should make amends, keeping in mind the sanctity of their marriage. Singa unfortunately disagrees, persevering in her objective to rain justice on the 'appendage'. With the Ambassador cowing in fear and Roma totally confused, Singa calls in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75;" href="http://www.interpol.int/">police</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>who of course dutifully arrive to take down her statement of complaint. The police officer arrives and finds Singa, dressed in white Cheong Sum, waiting impatiently at the door, visibly upset and still bitterly complaining about the inability of her husband's appendage to perform. Roma dressed in rags, cowering timidly in his room, is in tears.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">Alas, the officer summons Roma from his room and notes that he is already well aware about Singa's dismay and demands. Speaking in Romanian accented English, Roma reveals that he is still shocked and confused about the whole episode over his appendage. With face buried in palms, Roma says that marriage to a Chinese girl has thus far proved stressful and it was sometimes difficult understanding Singa's demands and complying with them.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">Roma declares that whilst he is willing to uphold the marriage, he finds Singa's current demands cruel and unusual and thus feels totally confused. Roma pleads with Singa how else he can make recompense but Singa remains unyielding.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">The police chuckles to himself about Singa's cruel and unusual demands, not to mention the embarrassment it would cause him should Roma suddenly accede to her demands at this point of time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">Whilst sympathetic to the Singa's plight, he notes that no capital offense has been committed in this case by the appendage.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">Besides just a short word of advice, the officer puts no effort in enforcing Singa's requests and writes of the matter as a simple problem of domestic marital conflict amongst a rather immature couple. He is is soon called off, to to deal with more pressing issues.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">Whilst Roma remains willing to further compromise so as to defend the marriage, Singa remains adamant about her demands, the appendage being her target of scorn.Without any recourse in sight so far to reconciliation, both parties temporarily part ways to stay with their respective parents to avoid further conflict.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">Singa's mom listens to Singa's problem and senses something amiss to Singa's attitude to marriage. She tells Singa that marriage is more then about just the appendage and that it is through trust and commitment that a marriage remains strong. Only this way can one's bedtime problems be solved. Further counseling reveals some of Singa's deep seated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75;" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">emotional insecurities</a>, however, with her parents assistance, Singa soon makes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75;" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5qDQc5UpRg&amp;#t=1m24s">amends</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>in her attitude towards the marriage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">The couple return home with Singa now giving her perspective. Roma does the needful, compensating Singa for the episode of neglect promising more vigilance, Singa pledges her love to Roma. The couple reunite and continue on in marital bliss happily ever after.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">=========================<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px;">It is in the spirit of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75;" href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that international relationships are maintained to this day and age.
