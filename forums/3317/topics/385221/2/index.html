              <p><strong>Allegations 'entirely false'</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIAN Charge d'Affaires Silviu Ionescu, who has been identified
              as the driver of the car involved in a hit-and-run accident that left
              one person dead and two others injured last December, has made very
              serious allegations against the integrity of the Singapore Government,
              said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday.</p>
              <p>An
              MFA spokesman on Thursday said that Dr Ionescu had in a recent
              interview with a television station back in Romania, alleged that the
              case against him was a 'set-up' by the Singapore Government because he
              had been reporting on political activities here.</p>
              <p>'Dr
              Ionescu had alleged that there had been a similar case in 2007, when he
              was also accused of being the driver in a hit-and-run accident, but was
              eventually let off as he had an alibi at that time,' said the MFA
              spokesman.</p>
              <p>MFA, which summoned Mr Aurelian Neagu,
              Romanian Ambassador to Singapore, to the ministry on Thursday, told the
              envoy that Dr Ionescu 'had made very serious allegations against the
              integrity of the Singapore Government which MFA categorically rejected
              as lacking any basis in fact.'</p>
              <p>'These allegations
              were also a gross insult to the victims of the two accidents,' said the
              ministry's spokesman, who added that Dr Ionescu's claim that he had
              been accused of being the driver in a hit-and-run accident in 2007 is
              'entirely false.'</p>
              <p>The spokesman pointed out that
              records showed that the Romanian Embassy vehicle was involved in two
              traffic accidents in 2007. The first was a minor non-injury accident
              where the driver was not Dr Ionescu and the other driver did not wish
              to pursue the matter.</p>
              <p>In the second case, it was
              established then that Dr Ionescu, who was the driver, was not at fault
              and action was taken against the other driver involved in the accident.</p>
              <p>'These
              facts clearly show that Dr Ionescu's claims are fictitious and at no
              time was he ever accused by the Police of being the driver in a
              hit-and-run accident in 2007.'</p>
              <p>MFA also asked
              Ambassador Neagu for more information on the status of the criminal
              proceedings in Romania against Dr Ionescu, and on the Romanian system
              of investigations and prosecutions.</p>
              <p>'The next
              step will depend on the Romanian Government's response to our requests
              and the outcome of the Coroner's Inquiry,' said the spokesman.</p>

              <p><strong>S'pore wants diplomat back</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE has asked for the Romanian Embassy's charge d'affaires, Dr
              Silviu Ionescu, to be present when an inquiry into a fatal accident
              last year, in which he is suspected of involvement, begins here next
              month.</p>
              <p>In a strongly worded statement issued last
              night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it had summoned the
              Romanian Ambassador to the Republic and delivered a series of
              diplomatic notes.</p>
              <p>It also revealed that Dr Ionescu was involved in a 2007 accident, of which he was cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>In
              diplomatic-speak, a summons is a serious matter, and is issued when a
              country seeks information, clarification or documents from another.
              Such summonses cannot be ignored.</p>
              <p>The notes were
              delivered to Ambassador Aurelian Neagu, 50, who is based in Tokyo but
              flew to Singapore and accepted them yesterday.</p>
              <p>The
              first note sought the Romanian Embassy's cooperation in asking Dr
              Ionescu, 49, to return to Singapore to attend the coroner's inquiry
              into the death of Mr Tong Kok Wai. He died as a result of injuries
              sustained in the Dec 15 accident.</p>

              <p><strong>Envoy claims he was framed</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIAN diplomat Silviu Ionescu has said in media reports back home
              that the hit-and-run accident was staged by the Singapore authorities
              against him.</p>
              <p>The local police tried to stage a
              similar accident against him in 2007, he added in an interview with
              Antena 3, a privately owned television station, last Saturday. The
              interview was picked up by the RADOR national news agency and reported
              subsequently in major national newspapers like the Adevarul and
              Evenimentul Zilei.</p>
              <p>In the interview, Dr Ionescu
              said that during the past year, he had made frequent requests to
              Bucharest to recall him because of what he said was pressure on him
              arising from his reporting on Singapore's political scene.</p>
              <p>His
              investigation, which he said was done on orders from the Romanian
              Foreign Ministry, made him an 'inconvenient person' in a country which,
              he suggested, has a problem with human rights.</p>
              <p>'During
              the first two years, my activity was normal, confined to the normal
              duties of my post. In the last two years, I kept being criticised by
              our authorities at home for not reporting more on political activities,
              and in the last year I concentrated on political work,' he was quoted
              as saying.</p>
              <p>'The work of a diplomat... can
              inconvenience the Singaporean authorities a great deal. This fact, plus
              my weak health condition compelled me a number of times to ask for my
              recall from the post,' he said.</p>
              <p>As for the
              accident itself, he reiterated that at no time was he anywhere near the
              site. To this day, he said, he does not even know where this place is,
              or how the accident happened.</p>

              present when an inquiry to the fatal accident begins here next month,

              accident as an opportunity to set him up.<br><br>"How valuable exactly was his 'political reporting' that we would go through all these serious procedures, just to set him up?<br><br>"As a diplomat, he of all people should know that such a summons between countries is a serious matter and cannot be ignored.<br><br>"We

              all the more he should step forward and help in the case, instead of

              <p><strong>Romania lifts immunity</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIA responded swiftly yesterday to a request from Singapore,
              lifting immunity for an embassy staff member here and distancing itself
              from remarks made by its former charge d'affaires over a fatal car
              accident last year.</p>
              <p>It said that since former
              charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu has been suspended from his diplomatic
              job, it will be up to him to decide whether to return to Singapore for
              a coroner's inquiry next month.</p>
              <p>A Romanian
              Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romanian MFA) spokesman told The Straits
              Times on Friday that his country would do 'everything possible in order
              to maintain and enhance good relations between Romania and Singapore'.</p>
              <p>The
              spokesman, Mr Lucian Rosenfeld, also dismissed allegations by Dr
              Ionescu in a recent television interview that he had been 'set up' by
              the Singapore Government.</p>
              <p>Romania 'firmly disassociates itself' from those accusations, Mr Rosenfeld said.</p>
              <p>Dr Ionescu has been identified as a suspect in two hit-and-run accidents last Dec 15 involving a Romanian Embassy car.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore won't tolerate abuse of diplomatic immunity: Minister Yeo</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo says there are due
              processes of law in Singapore and Romania to deal with the hit-and-run
              accident linked to Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu. </span></p>
              <p><span>He told Parliament on Monday that Singaporeans should not speculate on the accident on December 15 last year.
              <br> <br> The accident claimed the life of 30-year-old Tong Kok Wai.
              <br> <br> "Some have criticised the Singapore government for not acting
              immediately to detain him (Dr Ionescu). I fully understand the outrage
              many Singaporeans feel over the hit-and-run accident and the tragic
              death of Mr Tong," said Mr Yeo.
              <br> <br>"However, we should never do anything that is not in keeping with
              due legal process, nor descend into trial by media. Otherwise, we will
              weaken our own case."
              <br> <br> Mr Yeo said when Dr Ionescu left Singapore in December, the Police had not yet completed investigations. 
              <br> <br>"In any case, we could not have prevented Dr Ionescu from leaving
              Singapore, because as a diplomat accredited to Singapore, he enjoyed
              diplomatic immunity and could not be detained," he said.
              <br> <br>Mr Yeo stressed that Singapore will not tolerate any abuse of
              diplomatic immunity and believes the Romanian authorities share this
              view.
              <br> <br>"MFA has zero tolerance for any abuse of diplomatic immunity by our
              own diplomats, even in such matters as parking fines," he said.
              <br> <br>"The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman was also quoted
              in the media as saying the Romanian MFA firmly demands and expects its
              diplomats to respect absolutely and with no equivocation the national
              laws of the country to which they are credited," he added.
              <br> <br> "This means that the Romanian government takes the position that diplomatic immunity is not a licence to flout the law."
              <br> <br> As for what happens after the coroner's inquiry from March 3-10, Mr Yeo said: "We will take one step at a time."

              <p><strong>Romanian Embassy responds to MFA</strong></p>
              <p>THE Romanian Embassy on Tuesday officially responded to requests by
              Singapore's Foreign Ministry over the hit-and-run case involving a car
              allegedly driven by the embassy's charge d'affaires in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The
              car hit three people in Bukit Panjang before speeding off on Dec 15,
              causing the death of 30-year-old Tong Kok Wai. The coroner's inquiry
              into his death starts next week, but Foreign Minister George Yeo said
              in Parliament on Monday that there has been no sign that the envoy at
              the centre of the case, Dr Silviu Ionescu, who flew home after the
              accident, will attend the hearing.</p>
              <p>In apparent
              response to Mr Yeo's comments in Parliament, the Romanian Embassy
              handed over three diplomatic notes - Third Party Notes (TPN) - to the
              Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The first note
              acceded to MFA's request that Mr Marius Trusca, an administrative
              officer at the Romanian Embassy, give evidence at the coroner's inquiry
              on the death of Mr Tong. The Embassy added that 'Mr Trusca will assist
              the State Coroner in establishing the true circumstances surrounding
              the death of Mr Tong.'</p>
              <p>The second note confirmed
              that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had informed Dr Ionescu,
              whom police investigations revealed was the driver of the Romanian
              Embassy car at the time of the accidents, that he attend the Coroner's
              Inquiry and give the Singapore authorities details of the identity of
              the witness whom the envoy had claimed could exonerate him.</p>
              <p>The
              note added that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has suspended
              its 'labour relationship' with Dr Ionescu 'during the period of
              criminal investigations undertaken by the Romanian authorities and
              cannot compel him to observe a certain line of conduct'.</p>
              <p>'The
              Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs firmly dissociates itself from Dr
              Silviu Ionescu's statements made after his employment contract was
              suspended and underlines that his statements do not represent
              theposition of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,' said the note.</p>
              <p>The
              Embassy also handed over a third note stating that the Romanian
              authorities would 'give due consideration' to MFA's request for more
              information on the status of the criminal proceedings in Romania
              against Dr Ionescu and on the Romanian system of investigations and
              prosecutions, and 'a detailed answer will be soon provided'.</p>

              <p><strong>MFA says Ionescu's comments that prosecutors are accusing him are "puzzling"</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's Foreign Affairs Ministry says it's puzzled by comments made
              to the media by Dr Silvio Ionescu, the former Romanian Chargé
              d'Affaires, who's linked to a hit-and-run case here. <br> <br> Dr Ionescu was quoted as saying that prosecutors here were accusing him long before they had the right to do so. <br> <br> And that there should be a preliminary inquiry first. <br> <br> He said this was clearly a sign that he shouldn't come back. <br> <br> In a statement today (Feb 26), MFA said no charges have been made and no judgement has been passed on Dr Ionescu. <br> <br> It said as Singapore has made clear, the Coroner's Inquiry to be held
              from 3 to 10 March 2010 into the death of Mr Tong Kok Wai is not a
              criminal trial. <br> <br> MFA says the Coroner's Inquiry is simply to ascertain the facts and circumstances of the death. <br> <br> It reiterated that Police investigations have revealed that the driver
              of the vehicle at the time of the two accidents was Dr Silviu Ionescu. <br> <br> It noted that Dr Ionescu has denied this. <br> <br> MFA said if Dr Ionescu was not the driver as he claims, he should take
              the opportunity to attend the Inquiry to give his account of the events
              and pose questions to the witnesses, in order that the true
              circumstances surrounding the accidents may be determined. <br> <br> The ministry added that Singapore's legal system is well-known internationally for its integrity and transparency. <br> <br> The Coroner will make a finding based on the evidence presented before him.<br> <br> MFA has sought the assistance of the Romanian Embassy to request Dr
              Ionescu to return to Singapore to attend the Coroner's Inquiry as an
              "interested person" and not as a potential defendant. <br> <br> It said that the Public Prosecutor has not decided whether it is appropriate to charge Dr Ionescu for any offences. <br> <br> It added that the decision will be taken only after all the facts have been clarified at the Coroner's Inquiry. <br> <br> MFA says if the Coroner rules that Dr Ionescu was not the driver, no charges against him will be made. <br> <br> For this reason, it said it's in Dr Ionescu's interest to return to
              Singapore to put his version before the Coroner or to appoint a lawyer
              in Singapore to do so on his behalf. <br> <br> The ministry also said it found another comment made by Dr Ionescu's "shocking". <br> <br> Dr Ionescu had reportedly said "Someone died. It's not something
              solitary, but happens all over the world. There are bigger stories out
              there". <br> <br> MFA said it trusts that the Romanian authorities do not share Dr Ionescu's irresponsible and callous attitude.<span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"> </span></p>

              <p><strong>Night out with singer</strong></p>
              <p>FORMER Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu, who is linked to the 
              hit-and-run accident at Bukit Panjang last December, invited a Korean 
              opera singer and voice teacher out 10 days after meeting her at a 
              concert.</p>
              <p>The 49-year-old then charge d'Affaires of the Romanian 
              Embassy here and Ms Jeong Ae Ree, 40, went to a few places including 
              Shangri--La Hotel where he had some white wine on Dec 14. The couple 
              then adjourned to Clarke Quay and a KTV lounge at Peace Centre, Selegie 
              Road, for a birthday party.</p>
              <p>Taking the stand on Wednesday as the first witness at a 
              coroner's inquiry into the death of Malaysian assistant manager Tong Kok
               Wai, 30, a hit-and-run victim, Ms Jeong said Dr Ionescu picked her up 
              from her Hillcrest Arcadia home in a black Audi, which was driven by his
               chauffeur. After a few glasses of white wine, Dr Ionescu invited her to
               a birthday party elsewhere. Ms Jeung said the driver took them to a 
              condominium where the diplomat told her he lived there. The driver 
              removed the State flag from the car before Dr Ionescu took over the 
              wheel.</p>
              <p>She said they next went to Clarke Quay where they watched 
              belly dancing outside a Turkish restaurant. Dr Ionescu had two shots of 
              tequila, she said. At about midnight, they left for Legend Palace KTV 
              and joined a group of people in a room. She said at the KTV, he had a 
              few glasses of a drink, probably a mixture of coke and alcohol spirits. 
              As she was not well, she told him repeatedly she wanted to go home. He 
              finally took her home at about 2am.</p>
              <p>Ms Jeong said at around 8am, she woke up to find two missed 
              calls from Dr Ionescu at 3.50am. She sent him a text message. He said he
               wanted to meet her the next day at about 1pm. They met at her 
              condominium lobby, where, for reasons unknown, he tried to explain he 
              was only drinking juices and coke the night before and nothing else.</p>
              <p>'He even showed me some medications to prove that he is 
              diabetic. i do not know the reason for his explanations,'' she added. 
              Footages from CCTV taken at Shangri-La Hotel and Legend Palace were 
              shown in court. The inquiry continues.</p>

              <p><strong>Embassy car not broken into</strong></p>
              <p>A MOTOR company manager cum assessor told a coroner's court on 
              Wednesday that there was no evidence that the Romanian Embassy's Audi A6
               car had been tampered with or broken into.</p>
              <p>Mr Boo Seng Yak of Premium Automobile Singapore, the Audi 
              dealer in Singapore, said the car has two remote ignition keys and an 
              emergency ignition key. 'The car can only be driven by any of the two 
              remote ignition keys or the emergency ignition key, as the car is 
              equipped with an immobiliser system,' he said in his statement.</p>
              <p>This means that if the car is broken into by a person who 
              does not have the authorised ignition key to the car, he cannot drive it
               away. He added that there was no record that the car keys were reported
               lost or stolen.</p>
              <p>His evidence flew in the face of a report lodged by 
              ex-Romanian diplomat Sliviu Ionescu that the embassy car had been stolen
               on the morning it was involved in two hit-and-run accidents at Bukit 
              Panjang on last Dec 15.</p>
              <p>The accident claimed the life of assistant manager Tong Kok 
              Wai, 30, a newly-wed, and injured two others, Malaysian Bong Hwee Haw, 
              24, Mr Tong's colleague, and Mr Muhammad Haris Abu Talib, 18. Mr Tong 
              died 10 days after the accident while the other two had been discharged.</p>
              <p>The court was hearing an inquiry into the death of Mr Tong. 
              The hearing continues.</p>

              <p><strong>Survivor can't recall</strong></p>
              <p>THE first injured pedestrian who was knocked down at a Bukit Panjang 
              traffic light junction by a Romanian Embassy car last December could not
               recall the accident nor how he landed up in hospital.</p>
              <p>Mr Bong Hwee Haw, 24, was crossing the pedestrian crossing 
              with his good friend Tong Kok Wai, 30, at the junction of Bukit Panjang 
              Road and Bangkit Road when a black Audi A6 ploughed into them at about 
              3.10am on Dec 15.</p>
              <p>The car sped off leaving the two casualties lying on the 
              road with serious injuries. It was later found abandoned at Sungi Kadut 
              area. Mr Tong was pronounced brain-dead three days later. On Christmas 
              Day, the Malaysian assistant manager was taken off life support.</p>
              <p>Walking slowly and speaking through a Mandarin interpreter, 
              the bespectacled Mr Bong, who was accompanied by his mother and elder 
              sister to court, said in a statement that he was still unable to work. 
              He was testifying on Day 2 of a coroner's inquiry into the death of Mr 
              Tong. Before the accident, he had completed his training to be a 
              croupier at Resorts World Sentosa.</p>
              <p>On Dec 14 evening, Mr Tong asked to meet him and his wife at
               Bukit Panjang as the couple were there to view some flats. Both men ate
               at a coffeeshop before heading to Mr Tong's place. They waited for an 
              hour at a nearby park before Mr Tong's wife joined them later. In the 
              early hours of Dec 15, all three left for Mr Tong's home.</p>
              <p>'The last thing that I remember that day was sitting and 
              chatting to Kok Wai at a staircase landing near his flat,' he said in 
              his statement.Normally, he said Mr Tong would always walk with him to 
              the main road of Bukit Panjang Road to help him get a taxi. 'I do not 
              recall the accident, where it took place, or how I got to the hospital. 
              As a result of the accident, I sustained severe injuries to my head and a
               fracture to my right leg.'</p>

              <p><strong>Witnesses identify Ionescu</strong></p>
              <p>THREE men, including two taxi drivers, identified Romanian charge 
              d'affaires Dr Silviu Ionescu hours after a hit-and-run accident in Bukit
               Panjang.</p>
              <p>Mr Neo Hock Beng, one of the cabbies who picked up the 
              49-year-old diplomat at Sungei Kadut Avenue in the early hours of Dec 
              15, decided to print and keep the taxi receipt as he had the feeling 
              that the passenger was having some trouble.</p>
              <p>The Trans-Cab driver told a coroner's inquiry into the Dec 
              25 death of Mr Tong Kok Wai, 10 days after he was hit by a diplomatic 
              car, that he was driving along Woodlands Road when he saw a big 
              Caucasian man wearing a suit at the T-junction of Sungei Kadut Avenue at
               around 3.15am.</p>
              <p>The man got into his cab and asked him to go to Bukit Timah 
              Road. While nearing Bukit Timah Road, he stopped and asked the man twice
               exactly where he wanted to go. The passenger said Cluny Park Road. 
              Along the way, the man asked him how to call the police and was told to 
              dial 999. 'I did not know why he wanted to call the police,'' said the 
              cabby.</p>
              <p>Mr Neo then overheard the man telling someone on the phone 
              that his car was missing. Then he made another call, speaking in a 
              foreign language this time. When they were at Cluny Park Road, Mr Neo 
              again asked where he wanted to go, and was told to drive to River Valley
               Road. Mr Neo eventually dropped the fare at Grange Heights condominium 
              at around 4am.</p>
              <p>'As I had the feeling that this passenger was having some 
              trouble, I decided to print an keep the taxi receipt,'' he said. 
              Sometime later, the Traffic Police contacted him and he gave a statement
               on Dec 24 (09). He also handed over the taxi receipt of $20.20. When 
              shown The New Paper report on Dec 17, he recognised the photograph of Dr
               Ionescu in dark suit as the same person he had picked up on Dec 15.</p>

              <p><strong>Victim's witnesses testify</strong></p>
              <p>THE elder brother and two friends of an 18-year-old injured 
              pedestrian in a double hit-and-run accident at Bukit Panjang took the 
              stand on Day 3 of a coroner's inquiry on Friday.</p>
              <p>Undergraduate Muhammad Zahari Abu Talib, 23, whose brother, 
              Haris, was hit by a black car at the junction of Bukit Panjang Ring Road
               and Bukit Panjang Road on Dec 15 last year, noted the registration 
              number of the car before running to check on his brother.</p>
              <p>Both Haris and Zahari were on their way home when the 
              accident happened at about 3.10am. Their friends - brothers Ihsan 
              Lachika Irfan, 24, and Ricarno Izaan Lachica, 21 - were heading to 
              Pending LRT Station. Mr Ihsan was also on a skateboard and Mr Ricarno, 
              on a bicycle.</p>
              <p>While crossing the road in a single file, a black car 
              travelling at a fast speed approached Mr Zahari, who leapt forward. 'I 
              noticed that the car swerved to the right, ran over my skateboard and 
              then hit my brother. The car then sped off without stopping,' said Mr 
              Zahari.</p>
              <p>Mr Ricarno and Mr Ihsan said upon impact, Haris was flung on
               top of the car and onto the middle of the traffic junction. Mr Ihsan, 
              who works at the Night Safari, said he noted the car registration number
               before it sped off.</p>
              <p>The trio were testifying at the inquiry into the death of Mr
               Tong Kok Wai, 30, an assistant manager, who was also hit by the same 
              car 140m away at another intersection. Mr Tong, who was together with 
              his friend, Mr Bong Hwee Haw, 24, died 10 days later.</p>

              <p><strong>Ionescu a KTV regular</strong></p>
              <p>A PERSONAL relations manager of a karaoke lounge told a coroner's 
              court on Friday that former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu was a 
              regular at the entertainment club.</p>
              <p>Ms Kanda Loh Kailing, 25, was testifying on Day 3 of a 
              coroner's inquest into the death of assistant manager Tong Kok Wai, 30, 
              on Dec 25 - 10 days after he was knocked down by a car in a hit-and-run 
              accident at Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p>Ms Loh, called 'mummy' or Joey by her customers and friends,
               said businessman Richard Lim Hsien Yeow, 33, introduced the then charge
               d'affaires to her last August at Legend Palace KTV at Peace Centre in 
              Sophia Road.</p>
              <p>She said both Mr Lim, a regular customer, and Dr Ionescu 
              would come to Legend with their friends at least two to three times a 
              month.</p>
              <p>Dr Ionescu sent her a phone message on Dec 5, inviting her 
              to the Romanian National Day celebrations at Marina Mandarin. In turn, 
              she invited him to her birthday party on Dec 14.</p>
              <p>She said Dr Ionescu came to the KTV with a woman companion, 
              who looked either Korean or Japanese, at about midnight. After ushering 
              them to a room, she left to attend to other customers.</p>
              <p>There was a bottle of Martell, a jug of Coke and green tea 
              on the table but she did not notice if Dr Ionescu drank.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said he was not sure if Dr Ionescu had any alcohol 
              that night but saw him having a drink poured from a jug. Dr Ionescu and 
              his companion left after 2am, he said.</p>
              <p>About 16 hours later, Ms Loh called him and said a few 
              police officers had been to Legend to inquire about a Caucasian man and 
              him.</p>
              <p>When he called Dr Ionescu, he said he was busy and did not 
              ask much. About 10 minutes later, Dr Ionescu called and told him that 
              there was 'some trouble with his Embassy car'.</p>
              <p>The inquiry continues on Monday.</p>

              <p><strong>Eyewitness identifies ex-Romanian diplomat as driver of black Audi</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: An eyewitness has identified former Romanian embassy 
              charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu as the driver of the car which hit 
              three pedestrians along Bukit Panjang Road. </span></p>
              <p><span>One of the pedestrians, Mr Tong Kok Wai, died on Christmas Day 
              last year, 10 days after the accident occurred.
              <br> <br> Testifying in the Coroner's Inquiry into Mr Tong's death this morning, 
              Mr Mohamed Noor Hussain said he was at a coffeeshop along Bukit Panjang 
              Road when he heard a loud revving sound of a car engine from the 
              direction of Bukit Panjang Road towards Choa Chu Kang Road.
              <br> <br> He turned towards that direction and saw a black Audi car travelling "at
               fast speed", which then hit two Chinese pedestrians who were crossing a
               traffic junction at Bukit Panjang Road.
              <br> <br> The "green man" signal was flashing in favour of the pedestrians, 
              according to Mr Mohamed Noor.
              <br> <br> Both pedestrians - Mr Tong and Mr Bong Hwee Haw - landed onto the car's 
              bonnet due to the collision. The driver applied his brakes and stopped 
              the car suddenly, causing both the pedestrians to be flung forward to 
              another pedestrian crossing.
              <br> <br> The car did not stop to render assistance to the two pedestrians, 
              according to Mr Mohamed Noor, who then got up "immediately" and dashed 
              towards the car with a stone in his hand. 
              <br> <br> He wanted to throw the stone at the car to stop it, but the car headed 
              towards him. As he jumped back onto the road divider, Mr Mohamed Noor 
              fell and injured his leg.
              <br> <br> The witness said the driver slowed down the car, wound down the window 
              and scolded him.
              <br> <br> Mr Mohamed Noor described the driver as a fair-complexioned male person.
               He was alone in the car. The car then drove off at a fast speed, but 
              hit another person, Mr Muhammad Haris Abu Talib, at the next traffic 
              junction.
              <br> <br> Mr Mohamed Noor said he did not notice the car's vehicle registration 
              number "because it happened too fast". 
              <br> <br> Lawyer Subhas Anandan, who is representing Mr Tong's family in the 
              inquiry, then asked Mr Mohamed Noor if he was able to identify the 
              driver if shown a photograph of the driver.
              <br> <br> The witness replied he would. Shown a photograph of Dr Ionescu, Mr 
              Mohamed Noor said the Romanian was the driver behind the black Audi. 
              <br> <br> The hearing continues.

              <p><strong>Envoy reported car stolen</strong></p>
              <p>WITHIN an hour of the hit-and-run accident in Bukit Panjang last Dec 
              15, former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu called his driver to tell 
              him the car had been 'stolen'.</p>
              <p>A while later, he called again to tell his driver not to 
              call the police as he had already informed the officers. The driver, Mr 
              Marius Trusca, took the calls between 3.30am and 4am.</p>
              <p>Mr Trusca, 43, was giving evidence on the fifth day of the 
              Coroner's Inquest into the death of Mr Tong Kok Wai on Tuesday morning.</p>
              <p>Mr Tong, 30, was hit by the embassy's black Audi A6 car 
              while crossing Bukit Panjang Road at about 3.10am. He later died in 
              hospital. Two others were injured in the Dec 15 accident.</p>
              <p>Mr Trusca was able to attend court as a witness after the 
              Romanian government lifted his diplomatic immunity.</p>
              <p>The night before the accident, Mr Trusca had driven Dr 
              Ionescu and a Korean soprano to the Shangri-La Hotel, where they 
              attended a function commemorating Kazakhstan's national day. After the 
              function ended after 9pm, Mr Trusca drove them to Dr Ionescu's 
              condominium in River Valley.</p>
              <p>'I removed the Romanian flag..and I kept the Romanian flag. I
               then handed the black Audi to Dr Ionescu,' he said.</p>
              <p>The driver then drove back to the embassy in a second 
              embassy car, a BMW, which he had earlier parked at the condominium.</p>
              <p>The driver, who lives at the embassy off Farrer Road, was 
              later woken up by the late night calls from his superior. The next 
              morning, Mr Trusca drove the BMW to the condominium, where he ferried Dr
               Ionescu to the embassy.</p>
              <p>Near the embassy premises, the former diplomat asked him to 
              'look around' for the missing car.</p>
              <p>'I felt puzzled as to why we had to look for the car here 
              when it had already been stolen,' said Mr Trusca.</p>
              <p>The hearing continues on Wednesday.</p>

              <p><strong>Romanian embassy driver testifies that Ionescu told him black Audi had 
              been stolen</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Romanian driver of former charge d'affaires Silviu 
              Ionescu gave his side of the story on Tuesday at the Coroner's Inquiry 
              into the death of a pedestrian linked to his embassy car last December. </span></p>
              <p><span>Romanian embassy driver, Marius Trusca, showed up on Day Five of 
              the Coroner's Inquiry.
              <br> <br> During his appearance in the morning, made possible after the Romanian 
              government lifted his diplomatic immunity, Mr Trusca recounted what had 
              happened on the morning of the accident on December 15.
              <br> <br> He said he was awakened by phone calls from Dr Ionescu from about 
              3.30am.
              <br> <br> In one call, the former diplomat claimed that his car, a black Audi, had
               been stolen and hung up.
              <br> <br> Shortly after that, he called Mr Trusca again, telling him not to call 
              the Police as he had already done so.
              <br> <br> Later that morning, Mr Trusca drove Dr Ionescu from his residence at 
              Grange Road to the embassy near Farrer Road so that he could prepare a 
              statement for the police.
              <br> <br> On the way there, Dr Ionescu asked Mr Trusca to look around for the 
              black Audi.
              <br> <br> The driver said he was puzzled.
              <br> <br> He later found out in a fax from the Traffic Police that the black Audi 
              had been involved in an accident.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, Romania's Ministry of Justice has indicated that it wants to 
              have access to the information presented at the inquiry.
              <br> <br> Alexandru Nicolae Coseru, Acting Charge d'Affaires, Romanian Embassy, 
              said: "You know that he was accused back home. So the Ministry of 
              Justice needs to have access to your evidences, your statements, your 
              declarations and things like that."
              <br> <br> He said this has been communicated to Singapore.
              <br> <br> He added: "They are asking politely and diplomatically to your Ministry
