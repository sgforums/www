              <p><strong>Ionescu's account flawed</strong></p>
              <p>FORMER Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu's account of what happened in
               the early hours of Dec 15 last year, when he said the embassy's Audi A6
               sedan was stolen, was presented in court yesterday.</p>
              <p>But it did not square with the evidence offered by the more 
              than 50 witnesses who have testified in the Coroner's Court in the last 
              six days.</p>
              <p>They were giving evidence for the inquiry into the death of 
              Mr Tong Kok Wai, 30, a victim of a hit-and-run accident on Dec 15 who 
              was so badly hurt that he had to be taken off life support 10 days 
              later.</p>
              <p>Dr Ionescu, 49, did not attend the hearing to which he had 
              been invited. He had claimed that he had to return to Romania for 
              medical treatment.</p>
              <p>Yesterday's final witness, Station Inspector Raimi Yusof, an
               investigation officer with the Traffic Police, read out a statement 
              made by Dr Ionescu to the police nine hours after the accident.</p>
              <p>In it, Dr Ionescu claimed he discovered the locked car 
              stolen from outside the Romanian embassy at about 3am on Dec 15, shortly
               before the accident.</p>

              <p><strong>Probe 'must be thorough'</strong></p>
              <p>LAW Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday he expects Romania to 
              'seriously consider' the evidence from a recently concluded coroner's 
              inquiry into a fatal road accident that allegedly involved former 
              Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu.</p>
              <p>He said the 'gravity' of the Dec 15 hit-and-run case last 
              year warranted a thorough investigation on the Romanian government's 
              part.</p>
              <p>The coroner's court heard last week that Malaysian Tong Kok 
              Wai died from severe head injuries after he was involved in the 
              accident.</p>
              <p>'The evidence laid out in the coroner's inquiry is there for
               all to see,' Mr Shanmugam, who is also Second Minister for Home 
              Affairs, told reporters yesterday at a grassroots event in Sembawang.</p>
              <p>'We expect that it is taken seriously and have asked the 
              Romanian authorities to take the appropriate steps.'</p>
              <p>Last Tuesday, the Romanian government, through its embassy's
               acting charge d'affaires here, Mr Alexandru Coseru, made a formal 
              request for access to court documents relating to the six- day inquiry, 
              which concluded last Wednesday.</p>

There are so many witness to the real side of how it happens.

Can't tahan that guy, he can even think of accusing Singapore goverment...you think Singapore govt has better than nothing to do and to accuse a certain diplomat of this and that? He really should cook up a better story man. </span></p>

              <p><strong>S'pore will co-operate with Romanian authorities on Silviu Ionescu: MFA</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore said it has informed Romanian authorities 
              that it will co-operate with them in their investigation on former 
              diplomat Dr Silviu Ionescu. </span></p>
              <p><span>In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Singapore 
              will work with them "to the fullest extent possible under our law".
              <br> <br> It said this in response to reports that Romanian authorities had 
              requested for assistance in their investigation on Dr Ionescu.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu, 49, is alleged to have been the driver of two hit-and-run 
              accidents last December, which claimed the life of a pedestrian, Mr Tong
               Kok Wai.
              <br> <br> He did not attend a coroner's inquiry that he had been invited to this 
              month.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu had claimed that he was not the driver of the embassy car 
              involved in the accidents and had to return to Romania for medical 
              treatment. - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p>Yes,I believe in Karma too but more important we need to see some justice served  in this hit and run story.Maybe in one of the past lives the deceased man rode a horse driven carriage over the Romanian ....who knows? But if there is no Karmic balance then the same thing could happen over and over again.SIANZ!</p>
