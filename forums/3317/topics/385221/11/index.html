              <h1 class="storyheadline">Cabby says ex-Romanian diplomat 'seemed suspicious'</h1>
              <p>A CABBY told a Romanian court via videolink on Thursday that the 
              Caucasian passenger he picked up along Woodlands Road at 3am two years 
              ago 'seemed suspicious'. Mr Neo Hock Beng, 52, said the man appeared 
              anxious and directed him to drive to several destinations.</p>
              <p>The taxi driver said he was told to drive to Bukit Timah Road, then 
              to Cluny Road and then to the Grange Heights condominium. As he found 
              this rather strange, he printed out the receipt and kept it.</p>
              <p>Silviu Ionescu, 51, the former Romanian charge d'affaires in 
              Singapore, is now on trial in a Bucharest court for manslaughter, 
              causing physical injuries and making false statements over his alleged 
              involvement in two hit-and-run accidents on Dec 15, 2009. One pedestrian
               died and two more hurt in the accidents near Bukit Panjang and Ionescu 
              left for Romania three days later.</p>
              <p>Cross-examined by Ionescu, Mr Neo denied suggestions that he
               went to the media before going to the authorities. Asked how the police
               knew it was him, the cabby said that his taxi could have been filmed by
               the closed-circuit television cameras at Grange Heights.</p>
              <p>Another taxi driver, Mr Mohd Salihen Wahab, 41, recognised 
              Ionescu in newspaper reports as the man he had seen walking away from a 
              damaged Audi car, with diplomatic 'CD' plates, at about 3am on the day 
              of the accidents. Mr Salihen said he had a good look at the man in a 
              black suit walking along the deserted Sungei Kadut Avenue.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Witness picks Ionescu out from line-up</h1>
              <p>A WITNESS in Singapore identified the driver of a hit-and-run car via
               videolink from a five-man line-up in a Romanian court on Friday.</p>
              <p>Mr Ricarno Izaan Lachica, 22, a full-time national serviceman, said 
              Silviu Ionescu - the country's former charge d'affairs here - was behind
               the wheel of the embassy car.</p>
              <p>The Singaporean, who witnessed the accident in the early hours of Dec
               15, 2009, testified that he had identified the driver a day after the 
              accident from a large number of photographs shown to him by two police 
              officers. He said that there was no one else present then but added that
               the proceedings had been videotaped. Under cross-examination by 
              Ionescu, Mr Lachica denied he had seen a picture of the Romanian in The 
              New Paper before he met the police.</p>
              <p>Ionescu, 51, has been on trial in a Bucharest court since 
              Oct 5, 2010 for manslaughter, causing physical injuries and making false
               statements. The former diplomat, who fled Singapore for home, is 
              alleged to have hit three pedestrians while driving a black Audi A6 
              belonging to the Romanian mission in 2009, and to have left the scene. 
              The accidents left one pedestrian dead and two more injured.</p>
              <p>Ionescu, who returned to Romania three days after the 
              accident, denies he was the driver and said the car had been stolen 
              while he was working at the embassy at about the time of the accident. 
              But Mr Chan Kian Ann, 44, the former workshop manager with Premium 
              Automobile Singapore - where the damaged car was sent to - said that he 
              had not heard of an Audi car being stolen here. His colleague Boo Seng 
              Yak, 56, an assessor, told the court that the car's locking system was 
              in working condition and appeared 'intact'.</p>
              <p>This is the last day of the videolink proceedings. Before 
              transmission ended, Judge Andras said that the judicial inquiry in 
              Romania would continue collecting other evidence and probably recall 
              some witnesses.</p>
