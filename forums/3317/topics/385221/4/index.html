              <p>my apologies, I did not. I was under the impression he was stripped of his diplomatic immunity or maybe that happened later, not sure. Also, if he is involved in a crime,and under investigations, y he is allowed to exit? Seems not right with the protocols. </p>

              <p><br>regarding on diplomatic immunity, as long as your country joins the UN, then the country's diplomats are under this protection.</p>
              <p>now on regarding on the romanian diplomat's case under investigations, when he was in singapore, the case that was being investigated is his car being stolen. when the police have leads that when he is a suspect, that guy fled back to romania.</p>
              <p>when the first day the reports came out, i couldn't buy that coward's story. but the police can't anyhow retain him unless they have some proper leads or evidence, and on base on their suspisions.</p>
              <p>these are my believes. feel free to correct me if i am wrong.=)</p>

               who died in hospital more than a week after the Dec 15 incident.</p>
              <p>Dr Ionescu, who is back in Romania, said: 'I don't think

              <p>FORMER Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu was defiant and dismissive of
               the Coroner's Court findings when told about them on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The 49-year-old former charge d'affaires at the Romanian

              <p>Dr Ionescu scoffed at the evidence given by some of the 54 
              witnesses who had appeared in the Coroner's Court during the six-day 
              hearing last month.</p>
              <p>He accused them of lying, and said the 'scenarios' they

              <p>THE man at the wheel of a car involved in two hit-and-run accidents

              <p><strong>Bring him to justice here</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPOREANS responded to the State Coroner's verdict on Wednesday by
               saying that the authorities here should do everything possible to bring
               former Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu to justice here.</p>
              <p>While conceding that this would be difficult, given that he has fled 
              to Romania, all 50 people polled on Wednesday said no effort should be 
              spared to bring him here.</p>
              <p>Mr Irwan Mahpoel, 42, a sound engineer, said that there 
              should not be double standards for diplomats.</p>
              <p>'We need to stand by our laws,' he said. 'Since there is 
              strong evidence that he was the culprit, he cannot just walk away.'</p>
              <p>Said Mr Kelvin Low, 40, an IT professional: 'Singapore's 
              Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to sort this out diplomatically with 
              their counterparts in Romania and bring him back to Singapore for a 
              trial.'</p>
              <p>Several felt the Romanian authorities should take action as 
              well. They said it did not matter where justice was done as long as Dr 
              Ionescu was made to account for his actions.</p>

              <p>Waiving diplomatic immunity for Dr Silviu Ionescu so that he can be 
              prosecuted in Singapore is unlikely, Romania's ambassador to the 
              Republic said yesterday.</p>
              <p>In a phone interview after the Coroner's
               Court delivered its verdict, Mr Aurelian Neagu, who is based in Japan, 
              said: 'I don't think you can. There's no extradition treaty between

              <p>Mr Neagu said it was still too early to tell if Dr Ionescu
               will eventually be charged in Romania.</p>

              country had yet to receive evidence related to the case from the 
              Singapore authorities.</p>

              <p><strong>He's a black sheep</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIAN Silviu Ionescu proved to be the black sheep of the 
              diplomatic community and behaved like a coward when he fled Singapore, 
              senior diplomats told The Straits Times on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>They were concerned about a backlash from the Coroner's finding that 
              the former Romanian charge d'affaires was responsible for last 
              December's hit-and-run accident which left a man dead.</p>
              <p>They feared that public anger against diplomats might 
              escalate if people perceive diplomats as those who can get away 
              scot-free after committing an offence because they have diplomatic 
              immunity.</p>
              <p>Polish Ambassador Waldemar Dubaniowski said on Wednesday 
              that diplomats were generally law-abiding, and added: 'Every group has a
               black sheep in its midst.'</p>

              <p>my apologies, I did not. I was under the impression he was

              not sure. Also, if he is involved in a crime,and under
              investigations, y he is allowed to exit? Seems not right with the
