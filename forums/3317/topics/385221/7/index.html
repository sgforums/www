              <p><strong>Possible consequences on Singapore-Romania relations: analysts</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Political analysts have floated measures like 
              downgrading diplomatic representation as some steps Singapore could take
               against Romania if it doesn't bring former diplomat Dr Silviu Ionescu 
              to justice. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore's Foreign Ministry has said there would inevitably be 
              consequences for bilateral relations if justice is not served.
              <br> <br> Since Singapore is an open economy dependent on trade, political 
              analysts said it's unlikely to impose economic sanctions on Romanian 
              goods.
              <br> <br> However, they pointed out that Singapore's move to remind Romania of the
               possible consequences on bilateral ties is a timely reminder.
              <br> <br> Associate Professor Simon Tay, chairman, Singapore Institute of 
              International Affairs, said: "I think the statement is important to 
              remind the Romanians that this is not just a government to government 
              issue. This is a people-to-people issue. I think that our attitude 
              should be one of trying to foster co-operation.
              <br> <br> “Quite honestly, Singapore is a small country and while economically 
              quite rich, there aren't that many sanctions or sticks that we can 
              really try to hit Romania with."
              <br> <br> There are more severe measures a government can take like breaking off 
              diplomatic relations.
              <br> <br> But political analysts said this is unlikely to happen.
              <br> <br> Still, Singapore could try to lobby support from the European Union of 
              which Romania is a member of.
              <br> <br> Associate Professor Alan Chong, S Rajaratnam School of International 
              Studies, said: "These little incidents do add up over time to establish 
              or to brand a country's diplomatic image even among friends like fellow 
              European Union members and so on. 
              <br> <br> “And certainly if Romania does hope to someday successfully attain the 
              chair of the presidency of the EU, it will have to demonstrate some 
              degree of impeccable credentials or at least be seen to follow the 
              letter of International Law. So I think there's something to be said 
              about Romania's internal calculations."
              <br> <br> Last month, the Coroner's Inquiry ruled that Dr Ionescu was the driver 
              of the car that hit three pedestrians on 15 December 2009.
              <br> <br> A Joint Commission Meeting between Singapore and Romanian prosecutors is
               expected to be held by next month. - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><strong>Foreign Ministers of Singapore &amp; Romania discuss Ionescu case</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo has had a
               discussion on the Silviu Ionescu case with his Romanian counterpart. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Foreign Affairs Ministry said the chance opportunity arose as 
              both Mr Yeo and Mr Teodor Baconschi were waiting for their audience with
               Pope Benedict at St Peter's Square on Wednesday.
              <br> <br> MFA in a statement said Mr Yeo expressed the anguish which Singaporeans 
              felt on the case and emphasised the importance of justice being done. 
              <br> <br> Mr Baconschi replied that he was sympathetic to the feelings of 
              Singaporeans and informed Mr Yeo that the matter was being given the 
              highest attention by the Romanian authorities.
              <br> <br> He added that Romania was pursuing the full legal course. 
              <br> <br> He assured Mr Yeo that justice would be done.
              <br> <br> MFA said both Ministers committed themselves to good bilateral 
              relations.
              <br> <br> Mr Baconschi then extended an invitation to Mr Yeo to visit Bucharest.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Court has ruled that former Romanian diplomat, Dr Silviu 
              Ionescu, was indeed the driver of a car involved in a hit-and-run 
              accident on 15th December last year.
              <br> <br> The accident resulted in the death of 30-year-old Singapore permanent 
              resident, Tong Kok Wai, and injured two others.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu left Singapore on 18 December 2009, three days after the 
              accident.

              <div style="font-style: italic;">I ask BicCherry with head buried

                      Vulcan Bombers, the Admirals in charge of the Nuclear Fleets, and the 
                      Generals in Russia in charge of locomotives housing Inter-Continental 
                      Ballistic Missiles, are below Ionescu, in a sense.<br> Yes I am being facetious (BicCherry will think that I, an obscure

                      start a war if I don't state that I am being facetious).<br> But as you are the expert on the VCDR, please enlighten me, BiccyBoy. Or

              <p>The red and enlarged font print, to which I highlight, the lack of
                       understanding of, is I believe, the source of all this misunderstanding
                       thus far; the suspicion of the other party notwithstanding.<br> Key facts I note so far:<br> 1) Romania hasn't withdrawn Ionescu's diplomatic immunity whilst 
                      emphasizing it's wishes to abide by convention (he's only 'suspended' 
                      apparently).<br> 2) Article 31(4) of the mutually acceded to <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a>, making the specific provision for cases such 
                      as this: "<span style="color: red;">The immunity of a diplomatic agent from the 
                      jurisdiction of  the receiving State does not exempt him from the  
                      jurisdiction of the sending State</span>." <br> <br> Regarding Ionescu's verbiage to the press, Singapore need only express 
                      dissatisfaction, as well as demand apologies from the Romanian 
                      government as, in so far that Romania maintains Ionescu's status as a 
                      Romanian Diplomat (for which Singapore respects the Romanian stance), 
                      then the Romanian government is diplomatically obliged to ensure his 
                      good behavior, as reflective of his status as a '<span style="color: red;">representative
                       of the Sovereign'</span>, his 'freedom' notwithstanding- perhaps a 
                      simple SG MFA reminder to the Romain MFA about this matter would simply 
                      resolve this problem, (Romania can always comply then to Singapore's use
                       of <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR </a>article39.2 if Ionescu proves recalcitrant). 
                      What for the reporting of Ionescu's comments in both newspapers but to 
                      drum up social discord? Not to mention the seeming <a href="http://just-my-observation.blogspot.com/2010/04/ionescu-gets-out-of-interpol-wanted.html">'backfire'</a> (~18April2010) of Singapore's Interpol 
                      request which has seeming passed without notice.<br> <br> <br> For writing about the <a href="http://just-my-observation.blogspot.com/2010/04/ionescu-gets-out-of-interpol-wanted.html">withdrawal of the Interpol notice</a> and my '<a href="http://just-my-observation.blogspot.com/2010/04/ionescu-saga-singapore-behaving-in_17.html">marriage satire</a>', I've already been banned and

              <p><strong>Ionescu still has 'immunity'</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIA sent Singapore a diplomatic note last Friday asserting that 
              former charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu continues to enjoy diplomatic 
              immunity for the hit-and-run case of Dec 15.</p>
              <p>This is puzzling, said Foreign Minister George Yeo, as 'it seems to 
              imply that Romania is now claiming that Dr Ionescu was engaged in 
              official duties at the time of the accident and we do not understand how
               this can possibly be the case'.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Romanian media reports suggest that the 
              Romanian police may be preparing to arrest the suspended diplomat. The 
              police there have told Interpol that they have the competence to 
              prosecute him and they have started criminal proceedings against him.</p>
              <p>'With these conflicting accounts, the sooner the Romanian 
              legal experts visit us to clarify the situation, exchange views and 
              review the evidence with our legal experts, the better,' said Mr Yeo.</p>
              <p>He was speaking in Parliament on Monday in response to a 
              question from MP Irene Ng (Tampines GRC) who asked for about the case.</p>
              <p>A Coroner's Court had found that Ionescu was behind the 
              wheel of a car that hit three pedestrians along Bukit Panjang Road on 
              Dec 15. One of them later died. Following this, Singapore issued an 
              arrest warrant for Ionescu, and Interpol issued a red notice against 
              him. The notice requests all Interpol member states to look out for him 
              and arrest him, with a view to his extradition.</p>
              <p>The Government had also said that based on the Vienna 
              Convention on Diplomatic Rights, Ionescu was not protected by diplomatic
               immunity for his deeds. Based on Article 39(2), a diplomat loses 
              immunity for private acts once he leaves his post in the host country.</p>
              <p>On Monday, Mr Yeo told Parliament that the red notice has 
              been suspended because of the disagreement over the intepretation of the
               article. In his speech, Mr Yeo also noted that other diplomats in 
              Singapore have told the Government that Dr Ionescu has disgraced the 
              entire diplomatic corps.</p>
              <p>'Romania is a member state of the European Union which 
              prides itself on its reputation as a community of values. Bucharest 
              understands that more than Romania's own reputation is at stake and that
               it must live up to the EU's high standards,' added Mr Yeo.</p>

              <p><strong>Interpol red notice of arrest against Silviu Ionescu suspended</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo said Monday 
              Interpol's Red Notice of arrest against Silviu Ionescu has been 
              suspended. </span></p>
              <p><span>This is due to disagreement between the two countries as to 
              whether the Romanian diplomat had immunity at the time of accident last 
              December.
              <br> <br> During question time, Mr Yeo revealed that the Romanian Foreign Ministry
               sent Singapore a Third Party Note on Friday, asserting that Dr 
              Ionescu's diplomatic immunity continues.
              <br> <br> "We are puzzled as it seems to imply that Romania is now claiming that 
              Dr Ionescu was engaged in official duties at the time of the accident 
              and we do not understand how this can possibly be the case," Mr Yeo 
              explained. 
              <br> <br> "On the other hand, reports in the Romanian media suggest that some of 
              Dr Ionescu's assets had been seized and the Romanian police may be 
              preparing to arrest him. We have not been unable to confirm these 
              reports. 
              <br> <br> "But the Romanian Police has informed Interpol that the competence to 
              prosecute Dr Ionescu remains with Romania and the criminal proceedings 
              against him have started in Romania for crimes committed in Singapore."
              <br> <br> Nonetheless, Mr Yeo, who met his Romanian counterpart at the Vatican a 
              few days ago, said the Romanian government has been acting properly in 
              Dr Silveo Ionescu's case.
              <br> <br> He said Singapore has to allow them time to go through their own 
              internal procedures.
              <br> <br> "I believe the Romanian Government understands this and would not see 
              the entire country's name tarnished by the actions of one rogue 
              diplomat," Mr Yeo said. "Romania is a member state of the EU, which 
              prides itself on its reputation as a community of values.
              <br> <br> "Despite the impatience that we feel, we must however be disciplined and
               carefully observe due process. We are a country that respects the law 
              and this reputation is an invaluable asset we must preserve by handling 
              the case calmly in accordance with our legal system and international 
              legal obligations. 
              <br> <br> "Now that the Romanian Authorities have begun their criminal 
              investigations aginst Dr Ionescu we must give them time to complete 
              these investigations and not prejudge the outcome."
              <br> <br> Mr Yeo said he hopes officials and legal experts from both sides could 
              meet soon, under a joint working group that has been formed for this 
              purpose.
              <br> <br> Singapore is also engaging a lawyer to hold a watching brief in Romania.

              I think that the key pt here is that Romania is arguing based upon
               <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Article 31(1) and (4)</a>, for which I believe that 
              they are amply correct at this point of time. <br> A31.1 states: "<span style="color: red;">A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity
               from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State.  ...</span>"<br> A31.4 states: "The immunity of a diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction 
              of the receiving State <span style="color: red;">does not exempt him from the 
              jurisdiction of the sending State</span>."<br> I must add however, that I think the key to solving this problem is in 
              the understanding the spirit in which the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR)</a> (please click on the link, the preamble is contained in the first few 
              sentences, sentence 2 and 3 being the most important). <br>

              So since Ionescu was indeed a 'diplomat' at time of the accident, 
              and with  <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Article 31.1</a> stating in clear English: "A 
              diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal  jurisdiction of
               the receiving State.  ...", why is our Minister accusing the Romanian 
              Gov of classifying Ionescu's drunken night out as "official duties"? As 
              far as I know, Ionescu, committing the offense whilst serving as a 
              diplomat is immune to SG laws by agreement, period. <br> <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Article 31.4</a> provides recourse to that, and 
              Romania, now salvaging its pride, should be rightfully be allowed to 
              uphold it's side of the bargain according to the prior agreement. <br> Hath our own Minister lapsed in his appreciation of the spirit of the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a> as mentioned in the short preamble paragraph: 
              ".... <em>the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United

               the maintenance of international peace and security, and the promotion 
              of friendly relations among nations,</em>..."?<br> So if in the first place, if Singapore indeed accepts Romania as a 
              "sovereign state", and through the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a> accepted the validity of Romanian laws and 
              persecution system as applicable to its diplomats, then in accordance to
                <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">VCDR Article 31.4</a>, shouldn't Singapore should allow
               Romania opportunity to perform its rightful part in solving this 
              problem?<br> Singapore's back peddling and insinuations about the credibility of the 
              Romanian Government are thus inappropriate and insulting.<br> <br>

              Yes, n Singapore too should start reading about <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna  Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> front to 
              back and not the reverse, so as to avoid 'putting the cart before the 
              horse', and thus offending others unwittingly. Calling upon the police 
              to solve a 'problem amongst neighbors', only to have the 'arrest 
              request' suspended; to think that this still happens after almost 
              43years of mutual relations is telling upon the finesse, or lack of, in 
              which Singapore deals with its foreign relations. <br> <br>

              <p><strong>Romanian envoy summoned</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE has summoned Romanian ambassador Aurelian Neagu to a 
              meeting here later this week to clarify comments by his government that 
              former charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu continues to enjoy diplomatic 
              immunity.</p>
              <p>The comments were made in a third party diplomatic note to the 
              Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) last Friday.</p>
              <p>Disclosing this in Parliament yesterday when updating Ms 
              Irene Ng (Tampines GRC) on the latest developments, Foreign Minister 
              George Yeo said: 'We are puzzled as it seems to imply that Romania is 
              now claiming that Dr Ionescu was engaged in official duties at the time 
              of the accident and we do not understand how this can possibly be the 
              case.'</p>
              <p>Romania cited Article 39(2) of the Vienna Convention on 
              Diplomatic Relations to back its contention.</p>
              <p>But Mr Yeo pointed out that the Vienna Convention recognises
               the difference in the privileges and immunity that diplomats have 
              during their posting to a country, and after they leave the country at 
              the end of their posting.</p>
              <p>Article 39(2) says immunity usually ends after a diplomat 
              leaves his posting, except for acts performed 'as a member of the 
              mission'.</p>

              <p><strong>Romanian envoy to meet MFA</strong></p>
              <p>ROMANIAN ambassador Aurelian Neagu is expected to turn up at the 
              Foreign Affairs Ministry here on Thursday to clarify his government's 
              comment that former charge d'affaires Silviu Ionescu continues to enjoy 
              diplomatic immunity.</p>
              <p>The confirmation of the meeting came in a statement from the MFA on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Singapore summoned Mr Neagu, who is based in Japan, earlier 
              this week after it received a diplomatic note from the Romanian Foreign 
              Ministry that the Dr Ionescu's diplomatic immunity 'continues to 
              subsist'.</p>
              <p>This differed from Singapore's interpretation of the Vienna 
              Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</p>
              <p>In Parliament on Monday, Foreign Minister George Yeo said he
               was 'puzzled' as Romania's message implied that Dr Ionescu was on 
              official duty at the time of the accident on Dec 15, when three 
              pedestrians were hit by the Romanian embassy's Audi A6 car along Bukit 
              Panjang Road.</p>
              <p>One of them died later from his injuries.</p>

              <p>Hi 'icemanV', whilst I'm inclined to agree with 'Noobcake'- that 
              "(SG) MFA is too pushy and bossy in their approach"- Romanian MFA isn't 
              without fault either. All in, I was just shocked and saddened that SG 
              actually decided to put Ionescu on the Interpol wanted list, which I 
              felt was just an unnecessary knee jerk reaction, apt to cause surprise 
              and offense to our other relations; and as I had earlier described in my
               last response- to me a confirmation that even after almost 43 years of 
              mutual Diplomatic relations, our mutual relations haven't much improved .
               Other then warning the world of Ionescu's misdeeds, I felt that we were
               simply using the wrong forum in our 'desperate' quest for Justice- one 
              that despite our 'connections', promptly 'backfired' as the case 
              currently turns out.<br> This is not to say that Singapore's use of Article 39.2 is without 
              recourse, however, I feel that this is certainly not yet the time for 
              it, and as is evidently the case currently, the use of A39.2 has made <span style="color: red;">clowns </span>out of both of us, with SG now 'taunting' 
              Romanian Ambassador Neagu with difficult and unnecessary questions, "...
               He was asked three times by Singapore if he or the Romanian government 
              would consider attending the birthday party of a hostess in a karaoke 
              lounge as being part of official diplomatic functions.", "The ambassador
               failed to answer the question".<br> <br> Needless to say, I accept A31.4 (as a/m appended) to be the mutually 
              agreed and pre-determined standing agreement by which such incursions 
              should be resolved; in other words, Ionescu's persecution for offenses 
              here ought be by the Romanian Justice system.<br> <br> Now everyone is watching the outcome of this case and how these 2 
              relatively 'young' countries resolve their 'problem', keeping in mind 
              the internationally accepted sanctity of diplomatic relations.<br> <br> To deviate from pre-agreed contract requires mutual consent and it is 
              this deviation by both parties that I view with suspicion and scorn.<br> <br> I apologize for any misunderstanding caused thus far if you were given 
              to thinking that I might be excessively biased towards Romanian MFA, 
              however, to list a diplomat through unilateral decision on the Interpol 
              wanted list is quite an outlandish and destabilizing motion don't you 
              think?<br> <br> To grant another sovereign's representatives diplomatic status under the
                <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna  Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> is a sign
               of respect for the diplomat and by proxy, the sovereign he represents- 
              that the diplomat's home rule of law be considered as acceptable, at 
              least for the regulation and thus 'convenience' of the host endorsed 
              diplomats- such is the privilege enjoyed by 'diplomats', historically an
               important profession integral in its contribution to the good relations
               between two countries- premised upon the ideal that negotiations and 
              dealings between sovereigns should be conducted on 'equal' terms. <br> Singapore having agreed to the 'lofty' terms of the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a> without overt exception, is thus now ill 
              advised to nit-pick over the terms of the VCDR but abide graciously with
               it in its full spirit and form, with Romania expected to respond in its
               part by charging Ionescu for his crimes. With <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">article 31(4)</a> predefining the jurisdiction under 
              which persecution should occur as that of the Romanian Justice System.<br> <br> Romania is our guest in this case, as honorable host, we are obliged to 
              commence our negotiations granting them some allowance, without undue 
              pressure, to perform their due response in abidance to a mutual 
              pre-agreed 'contract'- and I repeat, prosecute Ionescu for his crimes 
              under Romanian law. Disregard for such (like prematurely ratting to the 
              Interpol) is a definite deviation from a mutually pre-agreed 'contract' 
              and implies disrespect for the mutual ideals by which the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna  Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> was 
              acceded to; not to mention, Singapore's implicit/ explicit endorsement 
              of Ionescu's activities through failure by <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A9">Article 9(1)</a>, to at 'pleasure', expel Ionescu prior 
              to the accident occurring, thus implicitly 'permitting' his less then 
              honorable behaviors as described thus far.<br> A9(1) states: "The receiving State may at any time and <span style="color: red;">without
               having  to explain its decision</span>, notify the sending State that 
              the  head of the mission or any member of the diplomatic staff of the  
              mission  is persona non grata or that any other member of the staff  of 
              the mission is not acceptable. In any such case, the sending  State  
              shall, as appropriate, either recall the person concerned  or terminate 
              his functions with the mission. A person may be  declared non grata or 
              not acceptable before arriving in the  territory of the receiving 
              State." <br> <br> Given to the fact that Article 2, the first condition under the VCDR 
              states: "The establishment of diplomatic relations between States, and 
              of permanent diplomatic missions, takes place <span style="color: red;">by 
              mutual  consent</span>."<br> It is thus without doubt, that the resolution of the a/m said problem 
              ought be resolved by the pre-existing mutual agreement, and not by 
              unilateral dissent.</p>

              <p>My own opinion:</p>
              <p>No matter what shield or laws you have or it happened while on duty or not when you hit a person with a car you are driving, drink drunk and drive like an irresponsible person, failing to even stop and help a person on the verge of death who knows maybe rushing the people to hospitals ER instead can change the course of action and made you a hero.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans were also found commiting offences in other countries, so does people of other nationalities with gobalisation people move around and travel much often to trade and communicate.</p>
              <p>Singapore did our part with our side of the investigation. We are now pointing our facts to the driver and murderer being the diplomat. The diplomat or responsible party should in the right course of action send a representatiive group, investigators or lawyers over for investigation to prove that the diplomat was not the driver.</p>
              <p>Fcuk international law. If we don't do this what's there to stop the diplomats from other countries doing the same thing next time? Why then did the diplomats from other countries not do any hit and run? Why then did the current diplomats from Romanian not do any hit and run? Why then do you think those people who did not do any hit and run not do it? Think and the answer is quite clear.</p>
              <p>I believe Romanians and Singaporeans are civilized and well behaved people. Its not worth keeping any national pride just for one black sheep bad hat. To start with its more about humanity and doing what is right. Humanity God preaches and Law in the right hand covers.</p>

              <p>A SPECIAL envoy has been appointed to help speed up investigations by
               Romanian officials into its former charge d'affaires to Singapore, 
              Silviu Ionescu.</p>

              Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) yesterday.</p>
              <p>It issued a statement following a meeting with the Romanian 
              Ambassador, Mr Aurelian Neagu, during which the delay in a visit to 
              Singapore by Romanian officials was discussed.</p>
              <p>Three weeks ago, Singapore invited Romania to confirm dates 
              for when its investigators would arrive to study the evidence against 
              Ionescu.</p>
              <p>Romanian prosecutors had said they were investigating the

              Hi 'long2010':<br> <em><a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Article 31(4)</a> of the </em><a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a><em>A31.4 
                          states: "The immunity of a diplomatic agent from the  jurisdiction   of

                          jurisdiction of the sending State</span>."... ...</em><br> <br> Thus if what Ionescu did, if under Romanian law is considered a crime, 
                          den he should be penalized under the Romanian Justice system for that 
                          crime, dat is why I've been saying tt SG must cooperate with Romanian 
                          efforts to persecute ionescu and not practice brinkmanship, nit-pick 
                          VCDR and try to "do it ourselves". That just cannot be.<br> <br> Interpol notice gives Romania no choice but to 'protect' Ionescu because
                           by the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a> 'contract', Ionescu is first and foremost their
                           diplomat and by A31.1: "<span style="color: red;">A diplomatic agent shall 
                          enjoy immunity  from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State.  
                          ...</span>"<br> <br> The management of the Ionescu offense is based upon the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a> which bestows upon Romania the responsibility 
                          of persecution, so long as Ionescu committed the crimes whilst under 
                          'diplomatic status'; thus Singapore's utilization of utilization of <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A39">Article 39.2 </a>is premature to say the least, and 
                          this has caused unnecessary offense at this early point of time in the 
                          mutual effort of resolving the Ionescu problem.<br> <br> This is because whilst A39.2 might seem applicable, it remains 
                          subservient to A31.1. Both are appended for convenience as follows:<br> - <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Article31.1</a> states: <em>"A  diplomatic agent shall 
                          enjoy  immunity   from the criminal jurisdiction  of the receiving 
                          State.  ..."</em><br> - <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A39">Article  39.2</a>: <em>"When the functions of a person 
                          enjoying privileges and   immunities have come to an end, such 
                          privileges and  immunities shall normally cease at the moment when he 
                          leaves the  country..."</em><br> <br> I believe it to be the case that A31.1 takes precedence over A39.2. I.e.
                           A39.2 being only as a recourse to the failure of A31.4, itself being 
                          recourse to A31.1. The simple reason, one must appreciate the spirit of 
                          the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a> in essence contained within the 'preamble' 
                          (first paragraph) and for the simple reason that A31.1 precedes A31.4 
                          and then A39.2- sequentially. <br> Common sense dictates that one reads any document front to back and not 
                          vice versa.  <br> <br> So really, the premature use of A39.2 is an insult to the intelligence 
                          of the Romanian govt, insinuating their incompetence, its application 
                          clearly implying Singapore's distrust in the Romanian effort at 
                          upholding Justice- that Romania would not persecute Ionescu despite 
                          Romania's clear statements thus far that they DO wish to pursue the 
                          Ionescu case. So Romania will of course vehemently defend itself against
                           Singapore's brinkmanship maneuvers and, for better or worse, show that 
                          they too CAN and will handle case- so Interpol notice has since been 
                          suspended- more time wasted, not to mention Singapore being 'pwned' in 
                          this process. <br> Worse still is SG still trying desperately trying to 'prove its point' 
                          with insulting and stupid 'trick' qns to Romanian ambassador, like [see 
                          ref: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1053360/1/.html">CNA29April2010</a>] "...  He was asked three times by 
                          Singapore if he or the Romanian  government  would consider attending 
                          the birthday party of a hostess in a  karaoke  lounge as being part of 
                          official diplomatic functions."<br> I say, they should just mutually cooperate and bring Ionescu to justice 
                          in a quick, fast, efficient and transparent manner, but to invoke A39.2 
                          now is to put the 'cart before the horse' an unwise action that is ought
                           to rouse suspicion and refute, delaying the entire judicial process not
                           to mention derailing the entire resolution process into no more then a 
                           mutual circus act, much to gee of Ionescu but the detriment of 
                          Sovereign reputations with Ionescu possibly getting away scot free in 
                          this instance.<br> <br> Right now all I see is just obviously egoistical political posturing, 
                          Singapore being the aggressor, with both sides now just wasting time and
                           resource on ceremonies like 'summons' and plane rides when in this day 
                          and age of hand phones, emails and video conferencing, diplomats and the
                           MFAs should have been working together efficiently, quietly achieving 
                          much progress behind the scenes.<br> The only benefactor thus far seems to be Ionescu, his evil ideals and 
                          SPH et al which profits from the <a href="http://just-my-observation.blogspot.com/2010/04/immunity-for-ionescu-to-be-clarified.html">selling of newspapers reporting scandalous news</a>.<br> --------------------------<br> <br> About Ionescu's blabbering mouth, <br> SG papers should just STOP interviewing him ASAP, Romanian govt has 
                          already 'dissociated' itself from Ionescu's comments after clarification
                           and Singapore newspapers should be supportive of Singapore's diplomatic
                           efforts in this respect. <br> Indeed Singapore might be well placed to advise Romania given its 
                          expertise I'm sure- on the 'Laws on sedition', which Romania might have 
                          overlooked, that it would be in Romania's (not to forget mutual) benefit
                           that Romania silence that weasel diplomat of theirs that so long as he 
                          holds 'diplomatic position', then he ought to behave the part and obey 
                          Romanian MFA instructions not to make any further unofficial comments/ 
                          press interviews related to the accident, his work as a diplomat or any 
                          other matter that might impede SG-Romanian discussions and relations. 
                          Should Ionescu fail to comply, Romania can then consider its 
                          anti-sedition laws to further prosecute Ionescu for his blatant 
                          dereliction of his commitment to uphold mutual good relations between 
                          the sovereigns as a serving Romanian Diplomat, via contravening of 
                          instruction not to rouse animosities between Romania and its relations 
                          through unsanctioned interviews with newspapers, notwithstanding the 
                          fact that Ionescu would have been offered ample opportunity to state his
                           case/ defend himself in both the SG Coroners court as well as the 
                          Romanian criminal courts respectively- the authorized forums on 
                          occasion.<br> Worse come worse, Romania can prosecute Ionescu under "internal security
                           act", and hold him without trial 'indefinitely' for blatantly 
                          subverting the interest of his Country and Government.<br> <br> Only with proof of blatant Romanian Govt subversion of Justice can 
                          Singapore invoke Article 39.2 and as such, only with proof that 1) 
                          Ionescu is no longer a diplomat by either Romanian MFA assent, or 2) 
                          Singapore has informed Romania that Ionescu is a ' persona non grata' 
                          (in accordance with <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A9">Article 9.1</a>) and that the outcome of negotiations 
                          between Romania and SG have met abject and total failure, should 
                          Interpol reconsider publishing Singapore's notice of arrest for Ionescu.<br> <br> In this regard, with the close cooperation between Singapore and 
                          Romania, as is the expected outcome of our mutually close relations

              <p>Hi 'TM2005', thanks for your response,</p>
              <p>In accordance to the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> (VCDR), which both countries quote and abide by,</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A9">Article 9(1)</a>,states as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>"The receiving State may <span style="color:#ff0000">at any time and without having to 
                                                explain its decision</span>, notify the sending State that the

                                  mission 
                                                is persona non grata or that any other member of the staff
                                   of the 
                                                mission is not acceptable. In any such case, the sending 
                                  State 
                                                shall, as appropriate, either recall the person concerned 
                                  or 
                                                terminate his functions with the mission. A person may be

                                  territory of 
                                                the receiving State."</blockquote>
              <p>Thus U can see that the VCDR which is a mutual agreement, allows the 'receiving' state a significant if not absolute control over who is acceptable and granted 'diplomatic immunity' and who isn't.</p>
              <p>Singapore must thus be careful in the first place about whom if accepts as 'diplomats' and under what conditions they should operate. In our current instance, Singapore DOES NOT seem to have a reciprocal embassy in Romania and this could be why SG is so eager to hurl Ionescu back under A39.2 which is evidently inappropriate as at present.</p>
              <p>Thus given the mutual troubles with resolution that we are currently going through at present, Singapore would be well placed to better screen and monitor both existing as well as diplomats it agrees to receive. A reciprocal arrangement in evfery case would be good. Otherwise, my suggestion would be to just allow them to operate an admin office here without diplomatic status- whatevers appropriate- and trade shouldn't be the principle consideration in the establishment of diplomatic relations.</p>
              <p>BUT as for the current case, Singapore having earlier issued the 'blank check' on immunity locally, shouldn't now renege, by improperly cherry picking VCDR A39.2 (instead of the proper sequence of A31.1- A31.4- A39.2 in my opinion as my last post esplained) much to the dismay of the Romanian Authorities, and thus behaving like a 'woman scorned' as I'd alluded to before (pg 6 this thread or updated <a href="http://just-my-observation.blogspot.com/2010/04/ionescu-saga-singapore-behaving-in_17.html">here</a>)- how then do U then expect Romania to respond!!!???.</p>
              <p>That said, I'm happy thus far that NTUC Income, being the<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100415-0000114/Ionescu-property-seized"> designated insurer for the embassy car</a>, will be able to cover for all damages payable to the victims as a result of the accident caused. (Ionescu later negotiating whatever liability should NTUC later argue the case to be).</p>
              <p>I really do hope that the both countries can continue to cooperate willingly and efficiently in the true spirit of the VCDR and bring Ionescu to Justice as he deserves. The brinkmanship I see thus far brings no favors to the rest of us, as all this confusion only serves to create more conflict and confusion amongst us all, much to the gee of Ionescu and the likes of him.</p>

              <p><strong>Romanian court rejects Ionescu request to cancel arrest warrant</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Former Romanian Charge d'Affaires to Singapore, Silviu 
              Ionescu, has failed in his attempt to get the arrest warrant issued 
              against him cancelled. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Bucharest Court of Appeal rejected the request on Thursday 
              saying it was "out of the question, Romanian media Nine O'clock reported
               on its website.
              <br> <br> Prosecutors had earlier called on the courts to reject the request 
              describing it as unacceptable.
              <br> <br> However, the ruling may be appealed at the High Court.
              <br> <br> Dr Ionescu had claimed that his rights were impaired, as the warrant 
              prevented him from leaving the country.
              <br> <br> He's wanted in connection with two hit-and-run accidents in Singapore 
              last December that left one person dead.
              <br> <br> A coroner's inquiry in Singapore revealed that Dr Ionescu was the driver
               of the car involved in the accidents.
              <br> <br> Singapore issued an arrest warrant against him on April 1. </span></p>

              at the Bucharest Court of Appeals, a criminal lawsuit against the state 
              of Singapore, seeking the cancellation of the international arrest 
              warrant issued against him in Singapore, in the case of the accident 
              that led to the death of a Singaporean in December 2009, Mediafax 
              reports.<br> According to Silviu Ionescu, the authorities of the Asian state knew the
               warrant is illegal to begin with, and this is why they sent to Romanian
               authorities the result of the investigation they conducted in 
              Singapore, which demonstrates that they acknowledge the competence of 
              Romanian Justice to issue a verdict in this case.<br> He added that the existence of the arrest warrant, though rejected by 
              Romanian authorities on legal grounds, puts him under stress and damages
               his image in Romania and abroad, and it was both unnecessary and 
              illegal to issue the warrant at this moment.</td>

              <p>Yes, sorry to say this, but by my current reading of the <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm">VCDR</a>,  I believe the Singapore issued Interpol 
              Arrest request for Ionescu is premature, contentious and without further
               review, risk derailing the entire negotiatory process with Romania. <br> Ionescu of course, with his cunning, has verily manipulated this 
              unfortunate 'situation of suspense' to his personal advantage, stymieing
               the entire diplomatic-legal process with his incessant verbiage and 
              antics both in print and in court.<br> <br> To start, I believe Singapore's use of <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A39">Article 39.2</a> (appended forth):</p>
              <div style="margin: 5px 20px 20px;">
              <div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Quote:</div>

              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">A39.2: <em>"When the functions of a person enjoying privileges and 
              immunities have come to an end, such privileges and immunities shall 
              normally cease at the moment when he leaves the country..."</em></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>

              </div>
              <p>to be premature and inappropriate. <br> <br> The most important part of the VCDR, the preamble is contained in the 
              document's very first paragraph. Likewise, I accept the validity of 
              every subsequent article, only as hinging upon the consideration of 
              those aforementioned (in the spirit of the law of course- there is an 
              order to every written law). <br> <br> For example, Article 2, the very first and a 'foundational' article 
              states:</p>
              <div style="margin: 5px 20px 20px;">
              <div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Quote:</div>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" width="100%">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">A2: "<em>The establishment of diplomatic relations between States, 
              and of permanent diplomatic missions, takes place by mutual consent</em>."</td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </div>
              <p>Likewise, without the satisfaction of A2, little if any recourse,
               nor reference, to the terms of agreement via the VCDR can be 
              established (pre-determined mutual agreements of the contrary excepted).<br> <br> Given the following ('all encompassing') articles of precedence- <a href="http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/treaties/diplomatic_relations.htm#A31">Articles 31.1 and 31.4</a> (appended as follows):</p>
              <div style="margin: 5px 20px 20px;">
              <div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Quote:</div>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" width="100%">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">- A31.1 states: <em>"<span style="color: red;">A diplomatic agent shall enjoy
               immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State</span>. 
              ..."</em><br> - A31.4 states<em>: "<span style="color: red;">The immunity of a diplomatic agent
               from the jurisdiction of the receiving State does not exempt him from 
              the jurisdiction of the sending State</span>."</em></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </div>
              <p>(A31.4 itself being recourse to A31.1)<br> I consider A39.2 to be applicable only as a recourse, conditional upon 
              the failure of the sending state, to perform its side of the deal in 
              upholding justice as defined in the mutual agreements in accordance to 
              the spirit of the VCDR A31.4.<br> <br> The application of A39.2 is thus only appropriate with adequate evidence
               to the contrary of A31.4 being fulfilled and Singapore in its haste, 
              has failed in this respect.<br> <br> The ill-conceived and premature raising of the Interpol warrant of 
              arrest is presumptuous and thus accusatory of Romanian refusal to 
              perform its responsibilities in accordance to A31.4, a suggestion much 
              liable to cause offense and confusion at diplomatic levels of discourse.<br> <br> That said, Singapore should put forward the following requests to 
              Romania whilst retracting the Interpol warrant of arrest AND ensure the 
              following:<br> 1)  Romania distance itself from all ionescu press comments thus far.<br> 2) That Romania WARN Ionescu that in so far as he maintains his status 
              as a Romanian diplomat (as thus protection from extradition to Singapore
               in accordance to Article39.2), he should 'behave the part' becoming of a
               'diplomat' i.e. NOT doing anything to harm the mutual relations between
               2 countries and abiding by the interests and instructions of the 
              Sovereign whom you are representing NOR interfere in any way, in person 
              or proxy with the accident investigations. Any aggravated exceptions to 
              this instruction may be tantamount to a grave dereliction of diplomatic 
              duties/ even sedition and would be taken into consideration during 
              prosecution for a strong deterrent sentences the crimes a fore 
              committed.<br> 3) That Romania take adequate measures to ensure the custody of Ionescu 
              prior to his sentencing and make adequate measures to ensure that 
              justice is served.<br> <br> May the Interpol warrant of arrest NOT remain a hindrance to our mutual 
              relations. May Ionescu see the Justice he so deserves.<br> May God help us all.<br> <br> Your queries and comments are welcomed.<br> May God bless and do have a nice day.<br> <img class="inlineimg" title="Smile" src="http://forums.asiaone.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.</p>
