              <p>do not leave just because of that slight increase or any flashy titles which may be too good to be true....for those who may not know...AVPs are aplenty and in fact is considered as the lowest rank in the corporate management level esp. in the banking industry....just another runner....thats all..</p>
              <p>know what fits your career objectives before you move....thats the most important and yet disregarded by most in their job hunts....work-life balance is the in-thing...</p>
