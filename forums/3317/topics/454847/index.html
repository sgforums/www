              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has 
              emphasised that at the national level, the government looks after all 
              Singaporeans, regardless of ethnic groups.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking in both 
              Malay and English at Muslim community organisation Jamiyah's 80th 
              anniversary celebrations, Mr Lee said this is done through the provision
               of high quality social services, such as housing, healthcare and 
              education, to develop Singaporeans' potential and to prepare 
              Singaporeans for good jobs.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee said the government has been managing social challenges across the board, regardless of race, language or religion.<br><br>"This
               national approach has worked well for us. All communities have 
              progressed with Singapore including the Malay/Muslim community. People 
              have made achievements based on merit and fair competition, so that 
              every Singaporean can take pride in their accomplishments and progress 
              and we have strengthened the Singaporean identity as we have improved 
              our lives together," said Mr Lee. <br><br>"But at the same time, while 
              the government works at the national level, we recognise that each 
              different community has its unique needs espacially in the social 
              cultural fields," he added.<br><br>Turning to Jamiyah's contributions to
               Singapore, Mr Lee said it has made a valuable contribution to the 
              progress of the Malay/Muslim community. <br><br>It focuses on education as a foundation for social mobility and set up the Jamiyah Kindergarten and the Jamiyah Business School.<br><br>It
               also operates homes for the less fortunate, like orphans and 
              disadvantaged children, substance abusers and destitute seniors, besides
               providing free services such as medical care, marriage counselling and 
              legal aid. <br><br>The prime minister also added that while Jamiyah's 
              focus remained on the Malay/Muslim community, its programmes are open to
               all, regardless of race, language or religion.<br><br>It has had long 
              cooperation with the Buddhist Lodge, and also many joint initiatives 
              with Catholic Archdiocese, The Hindu Endowments Board, Central Sikh 
              Gurdwara, and the Taoist Federation of Singapore.<br><br>Mr Lee said 
              this reflected the emphasis on inter-religious harmony, as this 
              strengthened racial and religious harmony, which are important in 
              Singapore's multi-ethnic society.<br><br>Mr Lee added that Malay/Muslim 
              organisations like Jamiyah will continue to evolve and he has urged the 
              organisation to stay abreast of changes, and review its programmes to 
              stay relevant to the community.<br><br>He said with more Malay/Muslims 
              succeeding in their careers and becoming PMETs, Jamiyah should craft 
              programmes to take advantage of their skills and energies  and involve 
              them more, tap their time and expertise to do the projects and guide the
               younger leaders of the community.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><br>i wonder why he bother to make such a speech ?one side it says the government.....and the other side he seems like he dont really have full control of the government and shun it if anything goes awry.if he is confident he would say' i and the government"  or "we" and not solely the government as a term and object of reference distancing himself if anything goes wrong with the government..</p>
              <p>he is making a speech only Puyi would make.</p>

              Agree with the issue with the garden, I had work/stay in couple of different countries.  And over there, it is quite common that as a foreigner (even I pay taxes and in someplace as foreigner the tax rates is higher than the local there), I need to pay the fee to enter most of the garden whereas it is free for their local.  Guess when he mention that govt take care of singaporean.  He miss out the point that there will be better treatment for elites and FTs.
