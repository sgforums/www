              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The growing number of doctors switching over to 
              private practice - with some not even serving out their bonds - has 
              raised some concern.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The government is now exploring a more sustainable framework to involve them in public sector healthcare. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Deputy Prime 
              Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said this at a dinner to celebrate the 
              anniversary of private healthcare provider Raffles Medical Group.<br><br>40 percent of specialists in Singapore are now in private practice, but most Singaporeans still rely on public sector care.<br><br>And
               the concern is that given the ageing population, there will not be 
              enough doctors in the public sector to meet the healthcare needs. <br><br>Mr
               Tharman, who is also the Finance and Manpower Minister, said solutions 
              have to be found to avoid the situation from being a "zero-sum game".<br><br>He said private doctors could conduct medical training or treat subsidised patients.<br><br>But he said the public sector will remain the anchor of the healthcare system in Singapore.<br><br>The
               Health Ministry is also reviewing its financing, incentives, regulation
               frameworks and clinical programmes to better integrate private and 
              public healthcare services.<br><br>Mr Tharman said costs will remain affordable for both patients and tax payers, especially those in the middle-income groups.<br><br>"Improving
               healthcare for Singaporeans must involve both the public and private 
              sectors. They both comprise our national healthcare system. This means a
               shared responsibility to meet the needs of our people and ensure the 
              sustainability of the healthcare system as a whole. We need all hands on
               deck to manage the healthcare challenges of the future," he said. <br> <br>Integration could involve the sharing of electronic medical records. <br><br>The
               next phase of the National Electronic Health Record system will involve
               community hospitals, general practitioners and eventually nursing 
              homes, and Mr Tharman said it is worth exploring how private hospitals 
              could be roped in too.<br><br>Mr Tharman also called on practitioners to
               sustain the values of the medical profession, and said that patients' 
              interests and safety must always come first.<br><br>"It is therefore 
              critical, even with business playing a legitimate role in medical 
              practice, that we guard against any drift from the time-honoured values 
              and ethics of the profession. Singapore's reputation for medical 
              excellence is a collective honour and responsibility, and I hope to see 
              the medical leadership across the country coming together to sustain 
              this," he said. <br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
