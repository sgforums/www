              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Private investor Li Siu Lun, 54, who had an 
              additional procedure performed on him during a surgery without his 
              consent in 2006, was finally vindicated on Wednesday after the High 
              Court entered a judgement against Gleneagles Hospital.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Li, a Hong Kong 
              resident, had consulted hand surgeon Dr Looi Kok Poh from Gleneagles 
              Hospital for a tenolysis operation on his right wrist. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It was meant to separate fused tendons to improve mobility of the fingers. <br><br>Mr
               Li had signed a consent form for the surgery for "Tenolysis Right 
              Wrist" but not an "Ulnar Neurolysis and Repair" - a surgical procedure 
              of re-attaching severed nerves - which was performed on him. <br><br>This
               only came to light after the condition of Mr Li's right hand 
              deteriorated and he sought the second opinion of a specialist in London,
               who told him that two surgeries had been performed on his right hand.<br><br>He
               subsequently requested from the hospital his medical records and saw 
              the addition of "ulnar neurolysis and repair" on his patient consent 
              form.<br><br>Realising the form had been altered, he asked to see the 
              original consent form but was unable to get an appointment to see Dr 
              Looi.<br><br>According to court documents, the hospital had already 
              known, through its internal inquiry in August 2007, that the consent 
              form was doctored, but supplied Mr Li with a copy any way.<br><br>On 
              Wednesday, the court entered a judgement against Gleneagles Hospital and
               deemed it liable to Mr Li for supplying the altered form to him on 
              September 12, 2007.<br><br>Mr Li sued Dr Looi and Gleneagles Hospital 
              for negligence and personal injury in 2009 and judgement was entered 
              against Dr Looi in June last year, after the doctor admitted liability. <br><br>Mr Li's damages and costs awarded to him by both the doctor and the hospital are being assessed.<br><br>Outside the courtroom, Mr Li told the media he was relieved. Speaking in Cantonese, he said: "Justice has at last been served."<br><br>The hospital's CEO, Dr Kok Mun Foong, apologised for the episode in a statement.<br><br>He said: "We regret that the actions of one of our nurses and the patient's surgeon have caused Mr Li distress. <br><br>"On
               behalf of Gleneagles Hospital, we apologise to Mr Li for what he has 
              gone through. We are happy that the court has concluded the case. We can
               now focus our energies on caring for our patients."<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
