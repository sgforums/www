              <p><strong>More rides ahead for commuters</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew has said adding 
              significant capacity to the transport system will be very high on his 
              to-do list.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking to 
              reporters on Wednesday at the start of tunnelling works for the Downtown
               Line 2, Mr Lui said he intends to focus on improving the bus system 
              first as increasing capacity for trains has a longer gestation period.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He added that the 
              government would also be working more closely with transport operators 
              to address bottlenecks in the transportation network and inject capacity
               in a more timely manner.<br><br>Tunnelling works for Downtown Line 2 (DTL2), which runs along the Bukit Timah corridor towards the city, have officially begun.<br><br>It
               will take about 18 months for 19 tunnel boring machines to complete the
               16.6-kilometre stretch of DTL2 that will have 12 stations and one 
              depot.<br><br>Since taking on the transport minister portfolio less than three weeks ago, Mr Lui has been taking bus and train rides.<br><br>He
               said: "My feel is that if you compare, for example, aviation and 
              maritime, we tend to add capacity ahead of demand. ... For land 
              transportation - trains and buses - we probably are adding capacity not 
              ahead of demand, maybe not even in tandem with demand.<br><br>"If left 
              to the operators alone, I think they will take a relatively cautious and
               gradual process ... so it is necessary for the government to work 
              together with the operators so that we can inject this capacity in a 
              very timely fashion, and particularly over the next three to four years 
              before we see the materialisation of the Downtown Lines 2 and 3 and 
              future projects."<br><br>Mr Lui said there could be social costs if capacity is not given a boost.<br><br>DTL2
               is expected to be completed by 2015. Mr Lui noted that rail projects to
               increase capacity have long gestation periods, given the complexities 
              involved.<br><br>He said: "Getting a train in can take three to four 
              years, getting a new line in place can really be seven to eight years, 
              simply because of the complexities involved."<br><br>So a faster measure
               to alleviate transportation woes would be to boost the capacity of bus 
              services. This may include introducing empty buses mid-stream on certain
               routes.<br><br>He recalled his own experience taking public transport. <br><br>Mr
               Lui said: "This was two Fridays ago - I was trying to take a bus during
               the evening peak hour from PSA building and my usual bus is Number 30. 
              And this was a Friday evening, so it may not be applicable to all 
              evenings.<br><br>"First bus (that) came, a double-decker, did not stop. 
              And you can see why - it's very, very crowded. Waited for the next one -
               it came quickly enough, to be fair, but it was a single decker - also 
              very crowded. (I) could not get on board.<br><br>"Then I decided, maybe,
               the better thing was to go to HarbourFront, take the North East Line, 
              go to Dhoby Ghaut, take the Circle Line and end up in Dakota where I 
              wanted to go. Having experienced it, I think maybe the train might be a 
              better option for me during the evening peak (hours)."<br><br>The 
              transport minister also said that his ministry will embark on data 
              mining, making use of EZ Link cards to provide useful information for 
              commuters - such as whether a bus is full or whether seats are 
              available.<br><br>He added: "I would want to know when the bus is 
              coming, and going forward, I want to know if I can get onto the bus, or 
              whether I can find a seat, that is what you want to be able to do. <br><br>"And
               I think that information can be made available - it is not available 
              today but we will work with the operators and find ways to make this 
              information available and then you can make a more informed decision."<br><br>Mr
               Lui said he would continue to go on bus and train rides over the many 
              months ahead - to find out what are the most challenging hotspots. He 
              said he would then try to bring resources together to improve the 
              situation.<br><br>On Wednesday morning, Mr Lui had taken a ride on the 
              LRT with MP Liang Eng Hwa. He described the experience as comfortable, 
              noting that it was not as crowded, probably because of the school 
              holidays. <br><br>Mr Lui said he will take another trip in July to get a
               better sense of the situation there. He was also mindful about the 
              frequent breakdowns on the LRT. He said LTA has been coming down on SMRT
               on the issue, though he believes more can still be done.<br><br>On fares, Mr Lui said public transport operators have yet to submit any proposal for a fare increase.<br><br>But
               adjustments - if any - will come into effect at a later date, to 
              coincide with the opening of the last stage of the Circle Line this 
              October.<br><br>- CNA/ck/al</span></span></p>

              MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC Liang Eng Hwa on a packed LRT train
              at Bukit Panjang this morning (Jun 8).<br> <br> The minister was previously spotted taking the bus and the MRT on
              two separate occasions.<br> <br> STOMPer Ethan, who saw him and MP Liang Eng Hwa this morning,
              wonders if they were checking out the trains after the Bukit
              Panjang LRT disruption that occurred yesterday, affecting 1,420
              passengers.<br> <br> The disruption was caused by an electrical fault along the system
              at Keat Hong, South View and Choa Chu Kang stations.<br> <br> STOMPer Ethan said:<br> <br> "I saw the Transport Minister with my MP on the Bukit Panjang LRT
              at 7.50am.<br> <br> "Has he come to check it out after yesterday's disruption?"<br> <br> "Hope you can make things better, minister!"<br> <br> Another STOMPer, Waran, who also spotted them, said:<br> <br> "MP Liang Eng Hwa and Tranport Minister seen on the LRT."</div>

              <p>So now any MP who wants some free publicity can just hop onto an MRT train and wait to be spotted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Soon you will see more and more MPs hoping on the bandwagon (MRT carriage).</p>

              <p>It is encouraging to see the minister doing groundwork taking regular bus and mrt rides particularly during the peak hours to experience the congestion on the public transport. I don't think it is reasonable to expect that the problem of transport can be solved overnight but at the very least, we could see that they are seriously looking into the problem. Time is certainly needed to formulate and effect the measures, isn't it? So for now,it does send out positive signals to me that the minister is out on the public transport to experience first hand of the congestion problem.</p>
