              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's football legend Dollah Kassim collapsed
              after playing in a friendly match between ex-international players from
              Singapore and Malaysia in the Sultan of Selangor Cup on Sunday.
              <br> <br>The former national player, who was known as the Gelek King for his
              extraordinary dribbling skills, played for about 12 minutes during the
              first half of the game. Fans watching the match said Dollah looked
              uncomfortable while playing.
              <br> <br>Sources told MediaCorp the footballer had a seizure on the
              sidelines of the pitch after he came off and a doctor said he was
              having a cardiac event.
              <br> <br> MediaCorp understands Dollah needed resuscitation at the pitchside and in the ambulance on the way to hospital.
              <br> <br> He underwent surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and he is currently in a critical condition.

              unconscious and in a critical condition after suffering a heart attack
              at Sunday's Sultan of Selangor Cup veterans game.
              <br> <br>Paramedics had to resuscitate Dollah before he arrived in hospital
              and the 60-year-old underwent an emergency angioplasty procedure to
              unclog blocked arteries on Sunday night.
              <br> <br>Dollah is warded in the Intensive Care Unit at the Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital. He is hooked up to machines and his breathing assisted by

              <p>Doctors at Tan Tock Seng Hospital say that former national football star Dollah Kassim is in coma and has contracted pneumonia. <br> <br> In a news conference, the first since his collapse on Sunday, they said Dollah has suffered brain injury . <br> <br> The doctors say they are monitoring his condition closely. <br> <br> They said they would be only able to give a fuller update by Monday. <br> <br> Dollah collapsed from a heart attack at last Sunday's Sultan of Selangor Cup veterans' game at Jalan Besar Stadium. <br> <br> According to the doctor who attended to him at the scene, the 60-year-old's heart had stopped beating for up to 18 minutes. <br> <br> That deprived his brain of oxygen for an extended period. <br> <br> Dollah has not regained consciousness since he collapsed and has
              undergone an emergency angioplasty, a procedure to unclog blocked

              <p><strong>Dollah Kassim has underlying heart problems</strong></p>
              <p>Former Malaysia Cup football star Dollah Kassim had underlying heart problems before his collapse on Sunday. <br> <br> Doctors said the 60-year-old had 'advanced' coronary heart disease, a condition that was previously undetected. <br> <br> The former striker is still in a critical condition at Tan Tock Seng
              Hospital's intensive care unit, where he remains in a coma. <br> <br> He has not regained consciousness since Sunday, when he suffered a
              heart attack during half-time of the Sultan of Selangor Cup veterans
              game at Jalan Besar Stadium. <br> <br> Consultant Cardiologist Dr Dinesh Nair, says Dollah had suffered brain
              injury due to the lack of oxygen to his brain immediately after the
              collapse. <br> <br> He says his team is monitoring his condition closely and would only able to give a fuller update by Monday. <br> <br> "There’s always a possibility of making a full recovery. we can't tell
              you how bad or good that recovery is going to be. To him being
              completely normal, its impossible to say. But we have seen cases where
              people hve recovered. We cannot tell you for sure if thats going to be
              the case."<br> <br> Dr Dinesh says he’s not surprised by the public outpouring of sympathy for Dollah. <br> <br> "Dollah kassim being who he is. I remember watching him playing
              football when I was a kid. Of course we feel for him. He's a national
              hero to all of us. He's a Singapore icon."<br> <br> Dollah’s family also issued a statement expressing their gratitude at the outpouring of sympathy, support and concern. <br> <br> They requested the public keep Dollah in their prayers.</p>
