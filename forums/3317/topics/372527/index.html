              <p><strong>US man charged in massive credit card theft scheme</strong></p>
              <p class="first">WASHINGTON (AFP) - - A 28-year-old man was charged
              with the largest credit card theft ever in the United States, in which
              more than 130 million card numbers were stolen, the Justice Department
              said.</p>
              <p>Albert Gonzalez, of Miami, Florida, and two co-conspirators were
              accused of hacking into the computer networks of firms supporting major
              American retail and financial organizations and stealing data.</p>
              <p>The
              two co-conspirators were not named and were identified in the
              indictment handed down in New Jersey only as "Hacker 1" and "Hacker 2"
              living "in or near Russia."</p>
              <p>Beginning in October 2006, Gonzalez
              used a sophisticated hacking technique to get around firewalls and
              steal information related to more than 130 million credit and debit
              cards, the Justice Department said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"The scheme is
              believed to constitute the largest hacking and identity theft case ever
              prosecuted by the US Department of Justice," the US Attorney's Office
              for the District of New Jersey said.</p>
              <p>Targeted companies included
              Heartland Payment Systems, a New Jersey-based card payment processor;
              7-Eleven Inc., a Texas-based nationwide convenience store chain; and
              Hannaford Brothers Co. Inc., a Maine-based supermarket chain.</p>
              <p>Gonzalez
              and his co-conspirators sent stolen data to computer servers they
              operated in Latvia, the Netherlands, the United States and Ukraine and
              used "sophisticated hacker techniques to cover their tracks and to
              avoid detection by anti-virus software used by their victims," the
              Justice Department said.</p>
              <p>Gonzalez, who operated online as
              "segvec," "soupnazi" and "j4guar17," was charged with conspiracy and
              conspiracy to engage in wire fraud.</p>
              <p>If convicted, he faces up to
              20 years in prison for wire fraud conspiracy and an additional five
              years in prison for conspiracy as well as a fine of 250,000 dollars for
              each charge.</p>
              <p>Gonzalez is scheduled to go on trial in New York
              next month on separate charges for allegedly hacking into the computer
              network of a national restaurant chain.</p>
              <p>He is facing a separate
              trial next year in yet another case, in which he is accused of hacking
              into the computer networks of eight major retailers and stealing data
              related to 40 million credit cards.</p>
