              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601295">Libyan dictator <span id="lw_1319115620_0" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Moammar Gadhafi</span>, the most wanted man in the world, has been killed, the country's rebel government claimed today.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601439">The flamboyant tyrant who terrorized his country and much of the world 
                      during his 42 years of despotic rule was cornered by insurgents in the 
                      town of Sirte, where Gadhafi had been born and a stronghold of his 
                      supporters.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601302">The <span id="lw_1319115620_1" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">National Transition</span> Council said that its fighters found and shot Gadhafi in Sirte, which 
                      finally fell to the rebels today after weeks of tough fighting.</p>
              <p>Word of Gadhafi's death triggered celebrations in the streets of Tripoli
                       with insurgent fighters waving their weapons and dancing jubilantly.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601448">The White House and NATO said they were unable to confirm reports of his death.</p>
              <p>Gadhafi had been on the run for weeks after being chased out of the capital Tripoli by NATO bombers and rebel troops.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601451">He had been believed to be hiding in the vast Libyan desert while 
                      calling on his supporters to rise up and sweep the rebel "dogs" away, 
                      but his once fearsome power was scoffed at by Libyans who had ransacked 
                      his palace compound and hounded him into hiding.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601474">Gadhafi, 69, took over the top spot as the world's most wanted man after Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. troops in Pakistan.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601471">At the height of his ability to threaten terrorism, President Ronald Reagan dubbed Gadhafi the "mad dog of the Middle East."</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601452">He was accused of backing the 1986 bombing of a Berlin disco popular 
                      with American soldiers, reportedly funding the hijacking of the cruise 
                      ship Achille Lauro in 1985, and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, 
                      which resulted in the U.N. and United States imposing sanctions on 
                      Libya.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601455">For years, Gadhafi refused to take responsibility for the bombing, but 
                      that changed in 2003 when he acknowledged his role and tried to make 
                      amends.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601466">The eccentric leader, who amassed power and wealth by controlling the 
                      nation's oil industry, held the title of being the longest-serving 
                      leader in Africa and the Arab world.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601456">Over the years, Gadhafi earned an <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12h9lj0i0/EXP=1320328936/**http%3A//abcnews.go.com/International/story%3Fid=79438%26page=1">international reputation</a> for his outlandish apparel and much-ridiculed phobias and proclivities.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601463">In U.S. diplomatic cables recently released by WikiLeaks, Gadhafi was 
                      described as a "mercurial and eccentric figure who suffers from severe 
                      phobias, enjoys flamenco dancing and horse racing, acts on whims and 
                      irritates friends and enemies alike."</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601457">He was "obsessively dependent on a small core of trusted personnel," 
                      especially his longtime Ukrainian nurse Galyna, who has been described 
                      as a "voluptuous blonde," according to the cables.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1319119342601460">Among his other unusual behaviors, the Libyan leader reportedly feared 
                      flying over water, didn't like staying on upper floors and traveled with
                       a "pistol packing' posse" of female bodyguards.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">SINGAPORE: Singapore-based water treatment firm Hyflux has made its first foray into Libya. It has entered a joint venture to invest and develop two seawater desalination plants there.<br><br>The plants which use membrane-based reverse osmosis technology will be located in Libya's two largest cities - Tripoli and Benghazi.<br><br>Hyflux signed the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the General Desalination Company (GDC), the commercial arm of Libya's Ministry of Utilities on Wednesday.<br><br>The two plants will provide a combined total of at least 900,000 cubic metres of drinking water every day.</span></p>

              <p>But he had enemies with some of the tribal groups in the east of the country, since the King he overthrown in 1969 was from the eastern tribal groups plus he was an autocrat and ran the state through repressive means.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>  <br>have been Mohammad al-Bibi, a 20-year-old sporting a New York Yankees baseball cap who posed to the whole world brandishing Gaddafi's golden pistol; his ticket perhaps to collect the hefty $20 million dangled as the bounty for Gaddafi "dead or alive". <br><br>It gets curioser and curioser when one remembers that this is exactly what US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in her lightning visit to Tripoli, had announced less than 48 hours before; Gaddafi should be "captured or killed". The Fairy Queenie satisfied Clinton's wishes, who learned about it by watching the screen of a BlackBerry - and reacting with the semantic earthquake "Wow!"<br><br>To the winners, the spoils. They all did it; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Pentagon and the TNC. From the minute a United Nations resolution imposing a no-fly zone over Libya became a green card to regime change, plan A was always to capture and kill him. Targeted assassination; that's Barack Obama administration official policy. There was no plan B. <br><br><strong>Let me bomb you to protection </strong><br>As for how R2P ("responsibility to protect" civilians), any doubters should cling to the explanation by NATO's secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen; "NATO and our partners have successfully implemented the historic mandate of the United Nations to protect the people of Libya." Anyone who wants to check NATO's protection of civilians just needs to jump on a pick-up truck and go to Sirte - the new Fallujah. <br><br>Reactions have been quite instructive. TNC bureaucrat Abdel Ghoga went Colosseum in the Roman Empire, saying, "The revolutionaries have got the head of the tyrant." <br><br>United States President Barack Obama said the death of Gaddafi means "we are seeing the strength of American leadership across the world". That's as "we got him" as one can possibly expect, also considering that Washington paid no less than 80% of the operating costs of those dimwits at NATO (over $1 billion - which Occupy Wall Street could well denounce would be more helpful creating jobs in the US). Strange, now, to say "we did it", because the White House always said this was not a war; it was a "kinetic" something. And they were not in charge. <br><br>It was up to that majestic foreign policy strategist, US Vice President Joe Biden, to be starkly more enlightening than Obama; "In this case, America spent $2 billion and didn't lose a single life. This is more the prescription for how to deal with the world as we go forward than it has in the past." <br><br>World, you have been warned; this is how the empire will deal with you from now on. <br><br><strong>Feel my humanitarian love </strong><br>So congratulations to the "international community" - which as everyone knows is composed of Washington, a few washed-up NATO members, and the democratic Persian Gulf powerhouses of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This community, at least, loved the outcome. The European Union (EU) hailed "the end of an era of despotism" - when up to virtually Thursday they were caressing the helm of Gaddafi's gowns; now they are falling over themselves in editorials about the 42-year reign of a "buffoon". <br><br>Gaddafi would have been a most inconvenient guest of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, as he would have relished recalling all the hand-kissing, the warm embraces and the juicy deals the West was begging to clinch after he was promoted from "Mad Dog" (Ronald Reagan) to "our bastard". He would also relish detailing all the shady backgrounds of those opportunists now posing as "revolutionaries" and "democrats". <br><br>As for the concept of international law, it lies in a drain as filthy as the one Gaddafi was holed up in. Iraqi dictator Saddam at least got a fake trial in a kangaroo court before meeting the executioner. Osama bin Laden was simply snuffed out, assassination-style, after a territorial invasion of Pakistan. Gaddafi went one up, snuffed out with a mix of air war and assassination. <br><br>Power vultures are congesting the skies. London-based Mohammed El Senussi, the heir to the Libyan throne (King Idris was overthrown in 1969) is ready for his close-up, having already established that he "is a servant to Libyan people, and they decide what they want". Translation; I want the throne. He's obviously the favorite candidate of the counter-revolutionary House of Saud. <br><br>And what about those Washington think-tank donkeys mumbling that this was the Arab Spring's "Ceausescu moment"? If only the Romanian dictator had improved his country's standard of living - in terms of free healthcare, free education, incentives for the newlywed, etc - by a fraction of what Gaddafi did in Libya. Plus the fact that Nicolae Ceausescu was not deposed by NATO "humanitarian" bombing. v Only the brain dead may have swallowed the propaganda of NATO's "humanitarian" 40,000-plus bombing - which devastated Libya's infrastructure back to the Stone Age (Shock and Awe in slow motion, anyone?). This never had anything to do with R2P - the relentless bombing of civilians in Sirte proves it. <br><br>As the top four BRIC members knew it even before the voting of UN Resolution 1973, it was about NATO ruling the Mediterranean as a NATO lake, it was about Africom's war against China and setting up a key strategic base, it was about the French and the Brits getting juicy contracts to exploit Libya's natural resources to their benefit, it was about the West setting the narrative of the Arab Spring after they had been caught napping in Tunisia and Egypt. <br><br><strong>Listen to the barbaric whimpers </strong><br>Welcome to the new Libya. Intolerant Islamist militias will turn the lives of Libyan women into a living hell. Hundreds of thousands of Sub-Saharan Africans - those who could not escape - will be ruthlessly persecuted. Libya's natural wealth will be plundered. That collection of anti-aircraft missiles appropriated by Islamists will be a supremely convincing reason for the "war on terror" in northern Africa to become eternal. There will be blood - civil war blood, because Tripolitania will refuse to be ruled by backward Cyrenaica. <br><br>As for remaining dictators everywhere, get a life insurance policy from NATO Inc; Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, Tunisia's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh were clever enough to do it. We all know there will never be R2P to liberate the Tibetans and Uyghurs, or the people in that monster gulag Myanmar, or the people in Uzbekistan, or the Kurds in Turkey, or the Pashtuns on both sides of the imperially drawn Durand Line. <br><br>We also know that change the world can believe in will be the day NATO enforces a no-fly one over Saudi Arabia to protect the Shi'ites in the eastern province, with the Pentagon launching a Hellfire carpet over those thousands of medieval, corrupt House of Saud princes. <br><br>It won't happen. Meanwhile, this is the way the West ends; with a NATO bang, and a thousand barbaric, lawless whimpers. Disgusted? Get a Guy Fawkes mask and raise hell. </p>

              <p><strong>The US and Gaddafi: The murderer calls for an investigation of the crime </strong></p>
              <h5 style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; color: #666666;">24 October 2011</h5>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton solemnly announced Sunday that Washington “strongly supports” an independent investigation into the barbaric murder of Libya’s deposed head of state Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">What exactly is it that Ms. Clinton wants investigated that she doesn’t already know?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Gaddafi was captured Thursday while fleeing his hometown of Sirte. Over the previous month Sirte had been under continuous NATO bombardment and a brutal siege by the so-called “rebels” that destroyed the city and claimed untold numbers of civilian dead and wounded.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">His convoy, detected by US spy planes, was attacked first by an American Predator drone aircraft, operated by remote control from an airbase in Nevada. An American AWAC surveillance aircraft then called in French fighter jets, which dropped two 500-pound bombs on the vehicles in which Colonel Gaddafi and his entourage were fleeing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">The air strikes left dozens dead and the Libyan leader wounded. He was then hunted down by the NATO-backed “rebels,” who were operating together with “advisors” from the SAS British special forces.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Gaddafi’s final moments have been recorded in a number of jumpy videos filmed on his attackers’ cell phones. They show a wounded Gaddafi shouting and feebly resisting a mob of frenzied militiamen who are taunting and attacking him, while screaming “Allahu Akbar”—“God is greatest.” He is dragged, kicked and beaten bloody with guns and fists before being thrown onto the hood of a vehicle. Footage shows a gun placed to his head and then his body on the pavement, blood pouring from the back of his skull.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">As one member of the NATO-backed National Transitional Council (NTC) based in Benghazi has succinctly stated, “They beat him very harshly, and then they killed him.”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Asked by ABC’s Christiane Amanpour for her “gut reaction” to the hideous cell phone videos, Clinton responded, “Well, Christine, you know, obviously, no one wants to see any human being in that condition.”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Clinton’s statements were clearly well rehearsed, aimed at assuaging the worldwide revulsion over the footage of Gaddafi’s lynching. As for her “gut reaction,” that was revealed on the day of the killing itself, when she laughingly told a reporter, “We came, we saw, he died.”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Indeed, barely 48 hours before the lynching of Gaddafi, the US secretary of state had flown into Tripoli, where she declared that the Libyan leader should be “captured or killed” as soon as possible.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">This was hardly an offhand comment. The entire eight-month US-NATO war against Libya has been waged with the aim of “regime change,” ousting Gaddafi and installing a client regime that would more pliantly do the bidding of Washington and its NATO allies, along with the Western energy conglomerates.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Utilizing the popular upheavals in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt as a cover, the US and its allies deliberately fomented armed confrontation in Libya and then sought to drum up support and secure UN sanction for intervention on the phony pretext of protecting civilian lives.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Under this “humanitarian” banner they waged a relentless and criminal air war against the oil-rich North African country, while repeatedly staging missile strikes and bombings targeting Gaddafi and his family. A NATO missile strike on a Gaddafi residence in Tripoli on May 1 killed one of Gaddafi’s sons and three grandchildren. All of American and NATO technical resources were trained on Libya in an effort to locate the Libyan leader and kill him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Nor was this the first such effort. As early as 1969, as Henry Kissinger revealed in his memoirs, discussions were held within the US government about covert action to assassinate Gaddafi, largely because of his radical Arab nationalism, his interference with US-Saudi control over OPEC oil policies and his closing down of the Pentagon’s biggest airbase on the African continent. In 1986, the Reagan administration carried out the US bombing of Gaddafi’s Tripoli compound. And, in the 1990s, Britain’s intelligence service, MI6, conspired with Islamist elements in a bid to kill him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">While Gaddafi had, in the wake of the Soviet Union’s dissolution, sought to accommodate himself to the West, foreswearing “weapons of mass destruction” and actively collaborating in the US “global war on terror,” the imperialist powers neither forgave nor forgot his earlier offenses.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">For Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration to call for an investigation of the killing of Gaddafi goes well beyond cynicism. It is as if the Eisenhower administration had demanded an investigation of the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, or the Nixon White House called for an international probe of the death of Salvador Allende.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">The main difference is that in those days it was the CIA that was known as “Murder, Inc.” because of its clandestine operations. Now the US government as a whole openly and unabashedly embraces assassination as a principal tool of foreign policy.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">On three occasions in less than six months, President Obama has paraded before the television cameras to announce unlawful killings. Last May it was the liquidation of Osama bin Laden, who was shot to death, unarmed, by US special operations troops. In September came the assassination of a US citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen by means of a Hellfire missile. Killed in the attack was a second US citizen, Samir Khan. Now Obama has claimed credit for the lynching of Gaddafi.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Countless others have been similarly murdered with less fanfare in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and elsewhere. Two weeks after the killing of Awlaki, a Hellfire missile claimed the life of his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, like his father an American-born US citizen. This attack, which killed eight others, most of them also minors, went virtually unreported in the American mass media.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">Instead, media pundits debate whether these “foreign policy successes” will help the president’s reelection bid, with Obama presumably running on his record as “assassin-in-chief,” approving “kill lists” drawn up by a secret committee that has effectively become a new extra-constitutional branch of the US government.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">T</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">he savage murder of Muammar Gaddafi is emblematic of an utterly lawless and violent policy on the part of the American ruling elite, which is desperately seeking to offset the economic decline of American capitalism by means of an endless series of wars and provocations aimed at seizing control of vital resources and markets.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">With good reason, Obama and Hillary Clinton believe they have nothing to fear from an investigation of Gaddafi’s murder by the United Nations or the International Criminal Court. Nevertheless, the reckless attempt to reimpose colonialism in the Middle East and North Africa will not resolve, but will only deepen, the insoluble economic and social contradictions and crisis of American and world capitalism.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;">This crisis is bringing the working class internationally into struggle and creating the conditions for a revolutionary settling of accounts with the crimes of US imperialism.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.36em;"><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/oct2011/pers-o24.shtml">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/oct2011/pers-o24.shtml</a></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;"><strong>a few pertinent facts about libya</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">There is so much contradictory stuff circulating about Libya and Qadaffi I think a few points are worth clarifying.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Libya under Qaddafi:</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- The latest UN Human Rights Council report on Libya (issued just before the outbreak of hostilities) is glowing with praise for the country, and commends Libya’s government for improving human rights, educational opportunities and improving its “constitutional” framework</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- Libya has more legal protections for its citizens than any other african or middle-eastern country</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- An international delegation of medical professionals recently stated – in an appeal to Russian President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin no less – that in their view there were few nations in which the people lived in such comfort. They asserted that “Libyans are entitled to free treatment, and their hospitals provide the best in the world of medical equipment.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Education in Libya is free, capable young people have the opportunity to study abroad at government expense. When marrying, young couples receive 60,000 Libyan dinars (about 50,000 U.S. dollars) of financial assistance. Non-interest state loans, and as practice shows</span></span></strong>, undated.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Due to government subsidies the price of cars is much lower than in Europe, and they are affordable for every family. Gasoline and bread cost a penny, no taxes for those who are engaged in agriculture.</span></span></strong> The Libyan people are quiet and peaceful, are not inclined to drink, and are very religious.”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">- Today, Libya ranks 53 on the UN Human Development Index and qualifies as the most developed country in Africa, ahead of Russia, Brazil, Ukraine, and Venezuela.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- Qadaffi’s most ambitious project, costing $33 billion, is the largest and most ambitious – and expensive – irrigation project in the world. It has taken decades to complete, and was financed with no help from the international community or banks. The Great Man-Made River project provides 70% of Libyans with water for drinking and irrigation pumped from the huge Nubian Sandstone Aquifer system in the south all the way to coastal areas 4000 km to the north. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Qadaffi has intended for years that Libya become the bread basket of the region, providing food and water to surrounding countries to eliminate their dependency on western imports and aid, provoking a major regional economic boom</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- The central Bank of Libya provides interest free loans, complying with the tenets of Islam, thus stimulating local entrepreneurs and businesses. It manages all loans, and issues and regulates the Libyan money supply.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">Because eliminating interest has been shown to reduce the cost of public projects by an average of 50%, Libya has been able to build its education system and state-of-the-art medical care, and achieve many other projects for the public good. For the same reasons it has almost no foreign debt, and thus total financial independance from the western banking oligarchy. Libya has large gold reserves, in addition to the oil money in foreign banks currently blocked by the UN coalition and now destined to finance the “rebels”.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">- Women have a far better status than in most other Muslim countries. Qadaffi decided to create a personal military guard comprised only of highly trained women – mainly in order to make a point to the more mysogynistic Islamic hard-liners…</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- Entirely in contradiction with heavily biased western media reports, Qadaffi is adored as an idol by the vast majority of his people<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> (with the exception of Salafi Islamist fundamentalists and eastern clans that lost power to Qadaffi’s regime)</span></span></strong> quite simply because under his strong leadership their lives have improved tremendously compared to their experience under previous regimes.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- The first person to issue an international arrest warrant for Osama Bin Laden was Qadaffi, years before 9/11.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- Libya has been the most persistant fighter against terrorism in the entire Arab world, arresting more extremist Muslim terrorists than just about any other country over the last few years. Libya has been commended by both Washington and the FBI numerous times in recent years for its help fighting terrorism.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto;">- Qaddafi has accepted the African Union proposition for a roadmap to peace in Libya. This has been pretty much ignored by western media.</p>

              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></div>
              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If Washington’s plans succeed, Libya will become another American puppet state. Most of the cities, towns, and infrastructure have been destroyed by air strikes by the air forces of the U.S. and Washington’s NATO puppets. U.S. and European firms will now get juicy contracts, financed by U.S. taxpayers, to rebuild Libya. The new real estate will be carefully allocated to lubricate a new ruling class picked by Washington. This will put Libya firmly under Washington’s thumb.</div>
              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></div>
              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With Libya conquered, AFRICOM will start on the other African countries where China has energy and mineral investments. Obama has already sent U.S. troops to Central Africa under the guise of defeating the Lord’s Resistance Army, a small insurgency against the ruling dictator-for-life. The Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, welcomed the prospect of yet another war by declaring that sending U.S. troops into Central Africa “furthers U.S. national security interests and foreign policy.” Republican Senator James Inhofe added a gallon of moral verbiage about saving “Ugandan children,” a concern the senator did not have for Libya’s children or Palestine’s, Iraq’s, Afghanistan’s and Pakistan’s. </div>
              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></div>
              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Washington has revived the Great Power Game and is vying with China. Whereas China brings Africa investment and gifts of infrastructure, Washington sends troops, bombs and military bases. Sooner or later Washington’s aggressiveness toward China and Russia is going to explode in our faces. </div>
              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></div>
              <div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Where is the money going to come from to finance Washington’s African Empire? Not from Libya’s oil. Big chunks of that have been promised to the French and British for providing cover for Washington’s latest war of naked aggression. Not from tax revenues from a collapsing U.S. economy where unemployment, if measured correctly, is 23 percent...</div>

              <p><strong>The Nation: The View From China </strong></p>
              <p>by ROBERT DREYFUSS</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">
              </span></p><p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;">When Yiang Jiemian, president of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, gets together with his brother, Yang Jiechi, China's minister of foreign affairs, they don't talk strategy or politics. "We talk about our grandfather," he says, with a smile.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We're sitting in a conference room at SIIS, though, and Yang Jiemian is talking strategy with a few visiting journalists. I ask Dr. Yang about China's view of US policy in the Middle East and central Asia.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;"><span style="color: #333333;"> What, exactly, is his opinion of the notion that the United States is seeking to control that crucial region, including its oil and natural gas reserves, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">as part of a strategy of containing China? </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;">President Obama has just left Shanghai, the sprawling city of 19 million people, and he told China that the United States does not want to contain or limit China's influence in Asia or the world. Yet the United States and China don't always agree on Iran, Afghanistan, and other questions.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;"><span style="color: #333333;">"There might be a slight difference of understanding between our two cultures, our two languages," says Yang, who is flanked by a team of strategists and area specialists. "</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"When America talks about strategy, it implies military, security, confrontation. In China, we have a much broader view of the idea of 'strategy.' We mean something that is long-term and systematic."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is he concerned about the idea of US hegemony in the Middle East?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> Could it be a detriment to China, which is excruciatingly dependent on that part of the world for its energy? "If you ask different people in China, you will get different answers," he says.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> "Personally, I'm concerned about the possibility that these things could be part of a plan to 'contain' China."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 0.85em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">But, he adds, China's view is to work cooperatively with all countries in the region, and with the United States, to deal with what he calls a critical transition that the countries of central Asia and the Middle East need to make...</span></p>

              <p>QUESTION: Could you comment on the approach that says that U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East isn't credible unless we have an independent energy policy?</p>
              <p>CHOMSKY: That's based on a complete misunderstanding. Suppose the U.S. had 100% of its own energy right here. That wouldn't affect in the least American desire to control the Middle East because we want to make sure that nobody else has access to those cheap resources of energy.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> One of the ways the U.S. keeps control over Europe and Japan is by having a stranglehold on their energy supply.</span></span></strong> Therefore, if there was a solar energy or shale breakthrough, giving the U.S. its own energy supply completely independent of Middle East oil, we still would want to ensure control over that region as long as Middle East oil remained cheap and accessible.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Back in 1945, the Western Hemisphere was, by a large margin, the largest producer of oil, with most of it coming from the U.S. or the Caribbean.</span></span></strong> Nevertheless, the U.S. was absolutely insistent on kicking the French out of that tiny share they had of Saudi Arabian oil.</p>
              <p>In fact, the U.S. pressed to get Europe and Japan to shift to an oil-based economy after the Second World War, in part as a way of ensuring American control over them. Europe and Japan both have coal, but it is better for the U.S. if they are dependent on a foreign, American-controlled source of energy. In a sense, the major potential enemies of the U.S. are Europe and Japan. Russia is another world. They control their own empire and we can't do much about it at this point. But Europe and Japan are potential threats. They are the areas where most of the American investment is, so they have to be controlled by the American government.</p>
              <p>The real fear of the U.S., which is occasionally voiced quite explicitly (for example in Kissinger's "Year of Europe" speech in April 1973), is that Europe could become a system comparable to the U.S. in strength and that it would then set up the kind of bilateral arrangements with the Middle East and North Africa that we regard as an American prerogative. If this ever happened, the U.S. would in fact be a second class power in the world...</p>

              <p>QUESTION: How do you understand the oil-rate hikes?</p>
              <p>CHOMSKY: I think part of the apparent<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> American effort to maintain and raise oil prices can only be understood as an attempt (successful in this case) to punish and control our competitors, namely Europe and Japan. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>The rise in oil prices often attributed in the popular press to "Arab Sheikhs," in fact has only a marginal relation to the Arab-Israeli conflict. As noted in the Senate report cited above, "the leadership within OPEC in rising prices has come from Iran and Venezuela, countries which have a minimal interest in the Arab-Israeli dispute. " </p>
              <p><a name="6A">Some commentators go so far as to claim that "Since 1971, the United States has encouraged Middle East oil-producing states to raise the price of oil and keep it up,"</a><a style="color: #5189aa;" href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/197703--.htm#6">6</a> although by now the rise in price may be harming the American economy as well. This buttresses the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> basic American concern to control the energy resources and to use those resources as an implement to dominate the world of industrial capitalism.</span></span></strong>..</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #333333;">This analysis of the United States and energy security examines the</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> close relationship between U.S. military supremacy in oil-rich regions and America's maintenance of global power.</span></span></strong></span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.3em;"><span style="color: #333333;">The term energy security generally evokes thoughts of American intervention in the Middle East to protect U.S. interests in that region's oil-rich fields. Doug Stokes and Sam Raphael move beyond that narrow framework, considering as well U.S. actions in Latin America, Central Asia, and Africa. Drawing on State and Defense Department records as well as other primary sources and previous scholarship, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">they show how U.S. foreign policy since World War II has sought to maintain a global energy security regime that supports the nation's allies while maintaining American hegemony.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.3em;"><span style="color: #333333;">Through their rigorous analysis, Stokes and Raphael explain how U.S. intervention in energy-rich states insulates and stabilizes those nations' transnationally oriented actors and political economies and why American oil diversification strategy</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> strengthens the country's position against rivals in the global capitalist system. </span></span></strong></p>

              </span></p><p>More than ten years ago, before 9/11, Goldman Sachs was predicting that the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) would make the world economy's top ten - but not until 2040.</p>
              <p>Skip forward a decade and the Chinese economy already has the number two spot all to itself, Brazil is at number seven, India tenth - and even Russia is creeping closer. In purchasing power parity, or PPP, things look even better. There, China is in second place, India is now fourth, Russia sixth, and Brazil seventh.<br><br>No wonder Jim O'Neill, who coined the neologism BRIC and is now chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, has been stressing that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"the world is no longer dependent on the leadership of the US and Europe". </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>After all, since 2007, China's economy has grown by 45 per cent, the US economy by less than one per cent - figures startling enough to make anyone take back their predictions. US anxiety and puzzlement reached new heights when the latest International Monetary Fund projections indicated that, at least by certain measurements, the Chinese economy would overtake the US by 2016. (Until recently, Goldman Sachs was pointing towards 2050 for that first-place exchange.)<br><br>Within the next 30 years, the top five will, again according to Goldman Sachs, likely be China, the US, India, Brazil, and Mexico. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Western Europe? Bye-bye!</span></span></strong><br><br><strong>A system stripped to its essence</strong><br><br>Increasing numbers of experts agree that Asia is now leading the way for the world, even as it lays bare glaring gaps in the West's narrative of civilisation.</p>
              <p>Yet to talk about "the decline of the West" is a dangerous proposition....</p>

              <p>As a system goes into decline, as the level of tensions and frustrations within the society rises to a high level, we will see more and more violent class conflicts and imperialist wars.</p>
              <p>Occupy wall street movement, violent imperialist wars like the one in Libya, the U.S cannot stop the inevitable.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">The<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> decreasing rate of expansion of the Age of Conflict</span></span></strong> gives rise to the other characteristics of the age, in part at least.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;"> After the long years of the Age of Expansion, people's minds and their social organizations are adjusted to expansion, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">it is a very difficult thing to readjust these to a decreasing rate of expansion. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">Social classes and political units within the civilization try to compensate for the slowing of expansion through normal growth <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">by the use of violence against other social classes or against other political units. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">From this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">come class struggles and imperialist wars. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">The outcomes of these struggles within the civilization are not of vital significance for the future of the civilization itself. What would be of such significance would be the reorganization of the structure of the civilization so that the process of normal growth would be resumed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">Because such a reorganization requires the removal of the causes of the civilization's decline, the triumph of one social class over another or of one political unit over another, within the civilization, will not usually have any major influence on the causes of the decline, and will not (except by accident) result in such a reorganization of structure as will give rise to a new period of expansion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;">Indeed, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the class struggles and imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict will probably serve to increase the speed of the civilization's decline because they dissipate capital and divert wealth and energies from productive to nonproductive activities...</span></span></strong></span></p>

              <p>Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The anti-Wall Street movement has confounded Republicans, Democrats and analysts alike.</p>
              <p class="indent">The take on the right is that Occupy Wall Street is the same old riff-raff of leftist anarchists, unlike the grassroots conservative Tea Party; seen from the left, it's an authentic uprising against the huge income disparity in America and a call for redistributing the wealth.</p>
              <p class="indent">Actually, it is part of a combustible global protest that goes beyond the professional rabble rousers. There is a focus on income inequality; "Tax the Rich" is a favorite slogan. The protesters are diverse and seemingly directionless.</p>
              <p class="indent">Income and wealth inequality in America have been growing for decades with little public outcry. The catalyst for the movement now is that during the worst financial crisis since the Depression, there is a perception that Wall Street and the wealthy were taken care of while average folks suffer. That isn't a fringe view.</p>
