              </span></p><h1>Across Africa, Gadhafi remembered as martyr, benefactor, instigator in the continent’s wars</h1>
              <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <h3>By Associated Press, <span class="timestamp updated processed">Tuesday, October 25</span></h3>
              </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <p>BAMAKO, Mali — <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moammar Gadhafi’s regime poured tens of billions of dollars into some of Africa’s poorest countries. </span></span></strong>Even when he came to visit, the eccentric Libyan leader won admiration for handing out money to beggars on the streets.</p>
              <p>“Other heads of state just drive past here in their limousines. Gadhafi stopped, pushed away his bodyguards and shook our hands,” said Cherno Diallo, standing Monday beside hundreds of caged birds he sells near a Libyan-funded hotel. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Gadhafi’s death has touched every Malian, every single one of us. We’re all upset.”</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>While Western powers heralded Gadhafi’s demise, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">many Africans were gathering at mosques built with Gadhafi’s money to mourn the man they consider an anti-imperialist martyr and benefactor.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Critics, though, note this image is at odds with Gadhafi’s history of backing some of Africa’s most brutal rebel leaders and dictators. Gadhafi sent 600 troops to support Uganda’s much-hated Idi Amin in the final throes of his dictatorship.</p>
              <p>And Gadhafi-funded rebels supported by former Liberian leader Charles Taylor forcibly recruited children and chopped off limbs of their victims during Sierra Leone’s civil war.</p>
              <p>“Is Gadhafi’s life more important than many thousands of people that have been killed during the war in these two countries?” asked one shopkeeper in the tiny West African country of Gambia, who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing recrimination.</p>
              <p>Some analysts estimate that the Gadhafi regime invested more than $150 billion in foreign countries, most of it into impoverished African nations.</p>
              <p>“Gadhafi was a true revolutionary who focused on improving the lives of the underdeveloped countries,” said Sheik Muthal Bin-Muslim, from the Gadhafi mosque in Sierra Leone’s capital that was built with Libyan funds. Muslim worshippers were planning an all-night vigil in honor of the slain Libyan leader.</p>
              <p>In Bamako, the capital of the desert nation of Mali, one huge Libyan-funded mosque was built right next door to the U.S. Embassy.</p>
              <p>And in Uganda, Gadhafi built a mosque that can host more than 30,000 people. Libyan-funded companies — everything from mobile phone companies to cookie factories — are valued at $375 million and employ more than 3,000 people in the small East African country. Schoolchildren and Muslim supporters lined the roads, waving Libyan flags, whenever Gadhafi visited.</p>
              <p>“Gadhafi was a godfather to many Ugandans,” said Muhammed Kazibala, a head teacher at a Libyan-funded school in the country’s capital.</p>
              <p>The Libyan leader also built a palace for one of Uganda’s traditional kingdoms. It was a fitting donation for a man who traveled to African Union summits dressed in a gold-embroidered green robe, flanked by seven men who said they were the “traditional kings of Africa.”</p>
              <p>Gadhafi used Libya’s oil wealth to help create the AU in 2002, and also served as its rotating chairman. During the revolt against Gadhafi, the AU condemned NATO airstrikes as evidence mounted that his military was massacring civilians.</p>
              <p>Gadhafi’s influence even extended to Africa’s largest economy: The Libyan leader supported the African National Congress when it was fighting racist white rule, and remained close to Nelson Mandela after the anti-apartheid icon became South Africa’s first black president.</p>
              <p>Current President Jacob Zuma also was one of the most outspoken critics of the NATO airstrikes in Libya, and he told reporters he thought Gadhafi should have been captured and tried, not executed.</p>
              <p>The ANC Youth League described Gadhafi as an “anti-imperialist martyr” and a “brave soldier and fighter against the recolonization of the African continent.”</p>
              <p>For many of Gadhafi’s supporters, the military operation to oust him was another example of the Western interference and neocolonialism that he railed against.</p>
              <p>F. Mbossa, 52, a school teacher in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, said she was shocked by the “arrogance of the West” in carrying out the NATO airstrikes.</p>
              <p>“It’s clear that France and the others never truly wanted an independent Africa and that is why they never hesitated to kill all those who advocate for a strong and unified Africa,” Mbossa said with tears in her eyes. “But for Africa, Gadhafi remains a martyr.”</p>
              <p>In Central African Republic, Gadhafi sent troops to support a government confronting coup attempts and an insurgency in 2001. But he also fomented instability. He funded rebel movements that committed some of the worst human rights abuses on the continent, including the brutal civil war in Sierra Leone. Gadhafi also supplied arms, training and finance to rebels in Liberia and Gambia, and invaded Chad from 1980-1989.</p>
              <p>Historian Stephen Ellis called Gadhafi’s World Revolutionary Headquarters, just outside Benghazi, “the Harvard and Yale of a whole generation of African revolutionaries.”</p>
              <p>In the 1980s, they included Charles Taylor of Liberia and Foday Sankoh of Sierra Leone, as well as former Congolese President Laurent Kabila.</p>
              <p>While Gadhafi won praise from some for not fleeing Libya, others chastised him for failing to see how it all would end.</p>
              <p>In Zimbabwe, businessman Daniel Musumba said Gadhafi had been trapped by his own ego.</p>
              <p>“For a man who was telling his people they were rats and cockroaches to end up in a drain. Who is the rat now?” he said. “But the rat needed to be captured alive.”</p>

              <h1 class="article-title" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 36px; line-height: 36px;">Muammar Gaddafi: In Memoriam</h1>
              <div class="mainauthorstyle" style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 9px; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 1px;">by FAWZIA AFZAL-KHAN</div>
              <div class="main-text" style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; line-height: 21px; position: relative;">
              <p>Was he a “mad dog” as Ronald Reagan dubbed him, or  “the King of Kings” as some leaders of African nations  crowned him, or “Brotherly Leader and Guide of the First of September Great Revolution of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,” as he named himself in 1972?</p>
              <p>Whichever title describes him best, the fact is he was different things to different people, and the murkiness surrounding his character and contributions to Libya or lack thereof remain murky in these days following his assassination. That too , remains murky: did a young Libyan “rebel” shoot him, or was he killed by a Nato airstrike?</p>
              <p>“Facts”  around the achievements of his socialist policies remain similarly debatable, though reports of the Human Development Index as recently as 2009 gave<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Libya the highest ranking of all African countries, with a GDP  that was fourth highest in the continent.  </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Citizens had access to free health care and education and indeed, from having only one-fifth of its citizens able to read and write before he took power in 1969, at the time of his death, Gaddafi’s policies could boast an 83% literacy rate. </span></strong> His government also handed out 50,000$ to every couple on their marriage to help them secure a home, and bank loans accumulated no interest.</p>
              <p>His regime also became known for supporting “terrorism” around the globe (particularly against Israel), and though Libyans were arrested and indicted for the Lockerbie bombing, it has still not been proved that Libya under orders from Gaddafi had anything to do with it, nor why if so.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, his relationships with women—particularly his female bodyguards also known as “amazons” including his Ukrainian nurses—certainly seemed bizarre to say the least, though one of his nurses upon learning of his death claimed she was very saddened by it and by the fact that none of the elite female unit who surrounded him was by his side at the end.</p>
              <p>The woman, Oksana Balinskaya, also went on to say she and her other colleagues had a “good life” in Libya and that she would like to go back to the country to live once the dust settles. She did not condemn Gaddafi, but said he had been a good boss who paid them well , and that her life in Libya was much better than anything she could look forward to in her native Ukraine.</p>
              <p> Yet we are told that Gaddafi was a tyrant, who lived a life of immense luxury while his citizens suffered from economic deprivation and political repression , and that Libyans are now “free” and rejoicing after his ignominious end.</p>
              <p>So what do all these conflicting accounts add up to? What is the truth? Third world anti-imperialist hero and women’s libber, or rabidly repressive tyrant with a rapacious lust for women?</p>
              <p>All I can say is, from my personal viewpoint as the young and idealistic 14 year-old Pakistani girl I was when the dashing Col. Muammar Gaddafi  arrived for the 2<sup style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">nd</sup> meeting of the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) in Lahore, Pakistan, in the spring of 1974 when a whole generation was as green as the grass of Lahore’s numerous parks, the man represented hope for the third world against the imperial West –and what a package that hope came in!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He looked good, tall and handsome in his military uniform ( even though we knew better than to trust dictators in the guise of soldiers but we were girls of a certain age after all, and prone to romantic swoons at the figure a young man in uniform cut in front of our dazed eyes!)–and he sounded even better—that potent mix of revolutionary zeal combining the best of Islamic ideals of economic and social justice with the even headier language and concepts of western socialism.  </span></strong></p>
              <p>We all believed he meant what he said—we so wanted our leaders to stand up against the tyranny of a capitalist world order that was clearly dividing our world into one of haves and another of have-nots. And despite his descent into megalomania and crazy behavior, I ‘d still like to believe he retained some vestiges of that early promise.</p>
              <p>Yes, he died in a manner unbefitting a hero….but then, he had ceased being that to many in his country.</p>
              <p>But to others, both within Libya and elsewhere, he encapsulated the image of the resistance fighter, lobbing ill-advised and even insane comments and braggadocio at his militarily superior enemies, someone who some of the time at least, spoke truth to power. And perhaps for that, he  paid the price.</p>

              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mérida, 21</span><sup style="color: #333333;">st</sup><span style="color: #333333;"> October, 2011 (Venezuelanalysis.com)— Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez condemned the</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> killing of Libyan head of state Muammar Gaddafi as an “assassination” and “a disregard of life”.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The Libyan leader was confirmed dead yesterday by the rebel “National Transition Council,” (NTC) with images of Libyan rebels displaying his corpse beamed around the world. Gaddafi died while in the custody of the rebels, with varying accounts of exactly how he was killed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Hector Navarro, socialist deputy of Chávez’s party in the Venezuelan National Assembly, declared that the “assassination” of Gaddafi was “a situation which cannot be permitted in the world”, and that the beamed images went against “every logic of human relations”.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chávez stated that Gaddafi would be remembered as “a fighter and a martyr”</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> and opined that the conflict in Libya isn’t finished, because in the North African country “there is a people, a dignity, and the Yankee empire will not be able to dominate”.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">“The most lamentable thing is that in their [the US] determination to dominate the world, and their European allies, they are setting it alight”, he continued.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Speaking on Venezuelan public television, international analyst Laila Tajeldine also explained that the “assassination” of Gaddafi, “sent a clear message to governments who oppose the United States.”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">When the conflict began in Libya early this year, countries of the US-led NATO alliance recognised the anti-Gaddafi rebels, beginning with France on 10 March, and after winning a UN resolution began bombing Libya on 19 March.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Chavez backed Gaddafi and refused to recognise the rebels, criticising NATO involvement as waging an aggressive war in order to take control of Libya’s oil reserves, and a “pulverisation” of international law.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">In late February Chavez proposed forming an international peace commission in order to broker a peaceful resolution to the Libyan conflict, which would involve African Union and other countries that supported this aim.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">However, on 11 April the NATO-backed NTC refused to accept a peace plan from the African Union on that basis that didn’t contain provisions for Gaddafi to leave power.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Following his return in September from reportage in Libya, TeleSUR journalist Rolando Segura aired claims that over 1,800 people had been killed as a result of NATO bombing alone, and more than 50,000 as a result of the invasion and conflict as a whole.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Chavez had been a staunch ally of Gaddafi, considering strategic relations with Libya part of constructing a ‘multi-polar world’ with greater ‘south-south’ cooperation between Latin America and Africa. </p>

His criminal purpose was evident in Serbia, a Slavic country, whose people fought so heroically against Nazi troops in World War II. <br><br>When in March 1999 the countries of this nefarious organization in its efforts to break up Yugoslavia after the death of Josip Broz Tito, sent troops in support of the secessionist Kosovo, met strong resistance from nations whose forces experienced were intact. <br><br>Yankee management, advised by the rightist government of Jose Maria Aznar Spanish, attacked television stations in Serbia, the bridges over the Danube and Belgrade, the capital of that country. The Embassy of the Republic of China was destroyed by bombs Yankee, several officials were killed, and there could be no possible mistake as alleged perpetrators.</span></span><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Many patriotic Serbs were killed. President Slobodan MiloševiÑ�, overwhelmed by the power of the aggressors and the demise of the USSR, yielded to the demands of NATO and admitted the presence of that alliance troops in Kosovo under UN mandate, which eventually led to his political defeat and subsequent prosecution of any impartial court in The Hague. Strangely died in prison. In a few days have resisted the Serbian leader, NATO would have entered a serious crisis that was about to explode. The rule thus prepared much longer to impose its hegemony among subordinates increasingly members of that organization. <br><br>Between 21 February and 27 April this year, published on the website CubaDebate new thoughts on the subject, which I discussed at length the role of NATO in Libya and what I believe would happen. <br><br>I am therefore compelled to a synthesis of the essential ideas that I presented, and the facts that have been happening as envisaged, now a central figure in this history, Muammar Al-Gaddafi, was seriously wounded by the latest NATO fighter-bombers, and inundated intercepted his vehicle, yet captured alive and killed by men armed that military organization. <br><br>His body has been kidnapped and displayed as a trophy of war, conduct that violates the most elementary principles of Islamic rules and other religious beliefs prevailing in the world. It was announced that Libya will soon declared "democratic and human rights defender." <br><br>I am forced to spend several thoughts on these important and significant facts. <br><br>Will continue Monday. <em><strong><br><br>Fidel Castro Ruz - October 23, 2011</strong></em></span></span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">

              <p><strong>THE ANC YOUTH LEAGUE SALUTES THE ANTI-IMPERIALIST MARTYR, COLONEL MUAMMAR GADAFFI</strong></p>

              </span></p><h1 style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Shocking brutality</h1>
              <p class="teaser" style="font-size: 11px; font-weight: bold;">The following article on the death of Moammar Gaddafi was published as an editorial in the 'Daily Times' of Pakistan.</p>
              <p>Nothing defines the post-Gaddafi National Transitional Council (NTC) regime better than the shockingly brutal manner in which Colonel Moammar Gaddafi was literally beaten to death after his capture on Thursday in Sirte. <br><br>To reiterate the cliché that all is fair in love and war in this context is no comfort. The reports and footage of Gaddafi’s last moments are nothing short of hair-raising. This was a barbaric act in the extreme. With its usual expedient blinkers where its interests are concerned, the west, whether governments or the media, have tucked away their moral compass somewhere out of sight and convenient. <br><br>The NTC pro-west regime they are triumphantly supporting is less likely to be, as the Libyan Ambassador in London claimed, a state ruled by law so much as a western imperialist satrap. Given that this treatment of a captured leader was not the first manifestation of the brutality of the NTC fighters (note the violence perpetrated against unarmed migrant African workers captured by the NTC and accused of being Gaddafi mercenaries without any proof), what is the explanation for this barbarism?<br><br>The NTC forces include al Qaeda affiliated groups who have been trying to overthrow Gaddafi through armed uprisings (especially in eastern Libya) over the years. Ironically, the very west that claims to be fighting al Qaeda worldwide turned a convenient blind eye to the troubling inclusion of these extremist jihadi groups in the NTC ranks. One faction of these al Qaeda affiliates was held responsible for the murder of a Gaddafi regime senior general who defected to the rebels and was leading their military campaign. Yet to date, no one has been held accountable for this murder. <br><br>Libya presents the picture of the pattern likely to be used by the west from now on to take out regimes that oppose its imperialist ambitions. The model is to use local dissident or rebellious forces on the ground, supported by the US and Nato’s overwhelming technological superiority in air power, missiles and other ‘remote’ weapons to help crush regimes that do not play ball with the west. US President Obama boasted after Gaddafi’s brutal end was confirmed that not one American life had been lost in the Libyan campaign. What he conveniently forgot to mention was the role of covert special forces attached to the NTC rebels that arguably helped and directed their relatively amateur military efforts. Obama’s triumphalism pulled whatever thin fig leaf was put up by Washington under the rubric ‘leading from behind’.<br><br>Like in any detective novel, the two critical questions to be asked are: motive, and beneficiary, to determine the villain of the piece. Libya’s oil and gas riches are what the US-led west has been slavering over for a very long time. Gaddafi’s support to anti-imperialist movements worldwide earned him more than a fair share of the ire of the powers that be in our (still) post-Cold War unipolar world. France and Britain, that led the anti-Gaddafi pack, are licking their lips over the lucrative ingress they have gained through bringing the NTC to power into Libya’s oil and gas. As in Iraq, energy sources and imperialist intervention have a symbiotic relationship.<br><br>It may be too close to these horrific events to judge Gaddafi’s place in history. However, a few tentative conclusions can be tendered even now. Colonel Gaddafi’s coup in 1969 that overthrew the decrepit monarchy and established a popular Arab nationalist regime openly declared its support of all anti-imperialist movements in the world. Sometimes, his uncompromising stances and criticism of other third world countries that betrayed their ostensible support to such movements because of ties to, and pressure from, the west, invited retaliation and even relative isolation for Gaddafi.<br><br>He was however, undeterred for a very long time. It is only when the west was able to orchestrate a virtually total isolation of Libya because of the Lockerbie bombing and other incidents, that Gaddafi attempted to compromise with the west. He gave up his nuclear ambitions, support for already dwindling anti-imperialist movements, and tried to craft an acceptable modus vivendi with the western powers. <br><br>However, if there is one lesson to be drawn from his fate, it is that empires have long memories and are totally ruthless in achieving their goals.</p>
              <p>Gaddafi joins a long list of the victims of the rapacious greed and domineering imperialist ambitions of the west that litters the history of the modern world.</p>

              <p><strong>A great Arab leader has passed away</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Published: <span class="grey" style="quotes: “, ”; color: #999999 !important; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">25 October, 2011, 11:07</span><br style="quotes: “, ”; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></span></p>
              <div class="publishinfo fs11" style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 11px !important;">
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 13px;">Saudi Crown Prince Abdul Aziz was an ally of the West – "our kind of guy," <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not like that villain Gaddafi.</span></strong></span></p>
              </div>
              <p> Crown Prince Sultan Abdul Aziz was not your average Saudi. He was a half-brother of King Abdullah and apparently very talented. In 1953, at just 17 years of age, Sultan Abdul-Aziz had already become governor of the city of Ryadh. H went on to hold a range of top jobs in the government, being variously Minister of Agriculture, Aviation, Communication, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense – a position he held for 25 years.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">In that capacity, he was responsible for the massive militarization of the Saudi kingdom. Some say he saved the British aeronautics industry from bankruptcy with his lavish orders of fighter jets. In the process, he also became one of the richest men in the world. Prime Minister Tony Blair personally intervened to block an investigation of corruption for “reasons of national security” when the shady deals of Abdul-Aziz threatened  to surface in the British press.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Abdul-Aziz was also one of the driving forces behind the Gulf Co-operation Council comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi-Arabia – a true “country club” of medieval monarchies. One of the goals of the GCC is “a common military presence” in the Gulf. What that meant was made clear to the Arab Spring movement in Bahrain. Saudi troops quickly restored order there when protesters demanded real reforms.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">In other words, Crown Prince Abdul Aziz was ”our kind of guy”: a ruthless feudal lord overseeing a regime where public decapitation on the marketplace is so routine that Western media, so concerned about human rights elsewhere, hardly ever pick it up. And if they do, it’s neatly hidden somewhere in the back pages.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This faithful ally of the West has now passed away quietly in a New York hospital where he enjoyed the best medical care, something he never allowed the thousands of migrant workers in his country. He didn’t mind their slave-like working conditions. This, in a nutshell, is the kind of Arab leader that we seem to like.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not so that scoundrel Gaddafi. </span></strong>Now, Gaddafi was not a democrat, he had political opponents tortured and killed. Freedom of opinion was non-existent in Libya. However, he also did some other things: with the proceeds of petroleum he built infrastructure, schools, hospitals. He was also a proponent of African unity. Most of all, he was not an obedient servant of the US and the EU, and certainly not of Western oil companies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gaddafi was brutally slaughtered.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Abdul-Aziz passed away quietly in a New York hospital. The different ways that their death was reported in the Western media is living proof of the moral decay of our present day society. Hardly a ripple of comment for one, revengeful glee for the other.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The story of Abdul-Aziz tells us something. Our present economic system has no moral basis.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Have we become so morally blinded that we do not see this? That we do not see through the hypocrisy of the war in Libya?</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I think it is time that we prove otherwise and say, “<em style="quotes: “, ”; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">No: this does not happen in our name.</em>”</span></span></strong></p>
