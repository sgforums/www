              <p><strong>Chapter 11 plan cedes Reader's Digest to lenders</strong></p>
              <p class="first">NEW YORK - The publisher of Reader's Digest, the
              country's most popular general interest magazine, said Monday it will
              file for Chapter 11 protection with a plan to swap a portion of its
              debt for ownership of the company.</p>
              <p>Reader's Digest Association Inc., which also markets books and
              publishes dozens of other magazines and Web sites, said it has reached
              an agreement in principle with a majority of lenders to erase a portion
              of $1.6 billion in senior secured notes. The lenders will get ownership
              in return.</p>
              <p>Already, this year's advertising declines have
              prompted the shuttering of several high-profile magazines, including
              Conde Nast's Portfolio, Domino and Blender.</p>
              <p>Reader's Digest CEO
              Mary Berner insisted, though, that the company's U.S. magazines remain
              strong, with the number of ad pages down less than 6 percent through
              the September editions. She said Reader's Digest titles rely less on
              luxury brands and high-income tastes, giving them an added appeal in a
              recession that has clobbered much of the print media industry.</p>
              <p>"Our
              brands are home and heartland. Our brands have a very, very Midwestern
              sensibility _ a back-to-basics sensibility," she said in an interview.
              "Reader's Digest has actually done quite well."</p>
              <p>She said some
              additions for the company, including the magazine Everyday with Rachael
              Ray and cooking site AllRecipes.com, have succeeded as well.</p>
              <p>Instead,
              Berner blamed two underperforming properties the company agreed to sell
              off last year: Books Are Fun Ltd., a company that sells books at events
              and book fairs, and QSP, which assists with fundraising for schools and
              youth groups.</p>
              <p>Even so, Reader's Digest, the iconic monthly
              magazine founded in 1922 as a collection of condensed articles from
              other publications, has been searching for a new niche as the Internet
              upends the magazine industry's traditional business models.</p>
              <p>In
              June, the magazine announced it would cut the circulation guarantee it
              makes to advertisers to 5.5 million, from 8 million and lower its
              frequency to 10 issues a year from 12.</p>
              <p>In the second half of last
              year, the U.S. edition of Reader's Digest had circulation of 8.2
              million, down from a peak of roughly 17 million in the 1970s.</p>
              <p>The
              planned bankruptcy filing, which does not include operations outside
              the United States, marks the latest stage in a long evolution for the
              company.</p>
              <p>Reader's Digest went public in 1990 and was initially
              controlled by a charitable foundation set up by the company's founders,
              DeWitt and Lila Wallace. The company bought out the foundation's shares
              in 2002.</p>
              <p>Ripplewood Holdings LLC, a New York private equity firm,
              led a consortium of investors in a $1.6 billion buyout that took the
              company private in 2007. Those investors include GoldenTree Asset
              Management, GSO Capital Partners, Merrill Lynch Capital Corp., J.
              Rothschild Group and Magnetar Capital.</p>
              <p>In a statement Monday,
              Berner said the decision to file for Chapter 11 follows "months of
              intensive strategic review of our balance-sheet issues."</p>
              <p>The
              company said it will skip a $27 million interest payment on its 9
              percent notes due in 2017 while it looks to build support among lenders
              for its restructuring plans.</p>
              <p>The agreement includes $150 million
              in "Debtor-in-Possession" loans to finance the company during
              bankruptcy protection. Overall, the company plans to shrink its debt
              from $2.2 billion to $550 million following Chapter 11. It said the
              "vast majority" of suppliers will be paid in full under the bankruptcy
              plan.</p>
              <p>The company said it will seek further agreements from
              lenders and other stakeholders before making a formal bankruptcy filing
              within a month. Its largest debt holders, led by J.P. Morgan Chase,
              include GE Capital, Aries Management, DK Partners, Regiment Capital and
              Merrill Lynch. The company expects to emerge from bankruptcy protection
              45 to 90 days after the filing.</p>
              <p>Aside from Berner, all of the
              company's board members who have served since Ripplewood's $1.6 billion
              acquisition of the company in 2007 have resigned. Two members who
              recently joined will continue to serve.</p>
