              <p>NEWLY minted MP Tin Pei Ling has said the people of MacPherson are warming up to her.</p>
              <p>Calling this a 'significant change', she said: 'I guess, given what 
              has happened, they recognise me, but they have also become warmer.'</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old full-time MP, speaking to reporters on the sidelines 
              of a community event in Toa Payoh yesterday, was referring to her 
              baptism of fire when standing on the People's Action Party (PAP) ticket 
              in Marine Parade GRC in May's General Election.</p>
              <p>She was widely castigated online for the photos she posted 
              of herself on Facebook, a video clip which caught her in a show of 
              petulance, and for her links to the party through her husband, the 
              principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, among 
              other things. Soon after PAP's victory in Marine Parade GRC was 
              announced, many called for her resignation on Facebook.</p>
              <p>Ms Tin said it is still too early to tell whether the 
              public's ill will towards her has dissolved, but she is viewing it as a 
              positive sign that residents have appeared more at ease talking to her. 
              It has been a month since she quit her job as a business consultant at 
              Ernst &amp; Young to focus on being an MP. Saying she will not be 
              looking for a job for up to a year, she added: 'I'm just focusing on 
              MacPherson, on the people.'</p>
              <p>Her days are now filled with meeting residents, such as 
              during her Meet-the-People Sessions, her twice-weekly block visits or 
              when she takes her walks through the constituency. 'When I have lunch or
               meals in the constituency, residents come up to me... and then we will 
              have a chit-chat.'</p>
