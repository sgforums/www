              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore authorities have detained another three people for terrorism-related activities.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A statement from the
               Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said Jumari Kamdi, Samad Subari and 
              Abdul Majid Kunji Mohamad were all detained under the Internal Security 
              Act between January and July this year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The announcement 
              comes just a day after the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks,
               and as Singapore leaders reiterate the importance of vigilance in 
              tackling the terror threat in the region.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>MHA said Jumari was a Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) member in a neighbouring country, where he had relocated, in the 1980s.<br><br>He had undergone para-military training organised by the JI, including the handling of weapons and firearms. <br><br>He was arrested in November last year and subsequently deported to Singapore.<br><br>Abdul Majid had been residing in Malaysia since the mid-1990s.<br><br>MHA said he was a member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) since 1998.<br><br>He
               had undergone training in weapons handling and the making of improvised
               explosive devices at MILF's Camp Abu Bakar in Mindanao. <br><br>Over the years, Abdul Majid helped the MILF procure funds and weapon components. <br><br>He was arrested in Malaysia in May this year and subsequently deported to Singapore.<br><br>The third detained person, Samad, was one of the pioneer members of the Singapore JI network.<br><br>He had undergone terrorist training with Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2001.<br><br>Following
               the security crackdown against the JI network, Samad fled to Indonesia 
              and remained in hiding until his arrest by the Indonesian police in 
              Sumatra in June 2009. <br><br>He was charged and jailed for immigration 
              offences. Upon the completion of his prison sentence in June this year, 
              he was deported to Singapore.<br><br>Separately, the MHA said one JI detainee has been released on a Suspension Direction.<br><br>Mohamed
               Khalim Jaffar was a member of the Singapore JI and was detained under 
              the ISA in January 2002. He was released on 1 September this year.<br><br>Under
               a Suspension Direction, Mohamed Khalim is prohibited from associating 
              with any militant or terrorist groups or individuals, and is not allowed
               to leave the country without the prior approval of the Internal
