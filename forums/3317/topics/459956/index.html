              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE - Singapore's economy shrank by 1.5 percent in the 
              third quarter but avoided a technical recession after growth in the 
              previous three months was adjusted up, government figures showed Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Ministry of 
              Trade and Industry (MTI) said the export-driven city-state was still on 
              track to achieve annual growth of 1.5-2.5 percent in 2012.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>"Economic growth in 
              the second quarter was better than expected, resulting in an upward 
              revision of quarter-on-quarter annualised growth from the preliminary 
              estimates of minus 0.7 per cent to (plus) 0.2 per cent," it said.<br><br>The revision was thanks to new data showing stronger growth in both industrial and residential buildings, it added.<br><br>Construction expanded 14.3 percent in the June quarter instead of 0.9 percent as earlier estimated.<br><br>Two
               successive quarters of negative growth are regarded as a technical 
              recession. Singapore is seen as a bellwether for Asia's leading 
              economies because of its sensitivity to world trade.<br><br>"Technically, we averted a recession," Song Seng Wun, a regional economist with CIMB Research, told AFP.<br><br>The
               weak performance in the third quarter was largely due to a contraction 
              in the manufacturing sector, a key pillar of the Singapore economy, as 
              global demand for electronics goods declined.<br><br>"For the rest of the year, growth could be weighed down by the subdued global economic conditions," said MTI.<br><br>"Externally oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade will be affected by the slowdown in advanced economies."<br><br>Construction and transport engineering however are expected to be healthy, it added.<br><br>In
               a separate statement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) 
              maintained its policy of keeping a stronger local currency in a bid to 
              contain inflation amid price pressures from a tight labour market.<br><br>The
               MAS said there was no change to the slope and width of its policy band 
              for the Singapore dollar as well as the level at which it is centred.<br><br>It
               said that while Singapore's export-oriented sectors bore the brunt of 
              the downturn, construction and financial services were resilient.<br><br>"While
               there remains considerable uncertainty over the evolving fiscal 
              situation in the US and eurozone, recent central bank policy initiatives
               worldwide have reduced the risk of a severe global recession," MAS 
              said.<br><br>- AFP/ir</span></span></p>
