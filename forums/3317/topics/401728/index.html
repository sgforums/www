              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Minister for Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports, Vivian Balakrishnan, has stressed that the family is the key 
              institution underlying social policies. </span></p>
              <p><span>This comes even as Singapore faces a changing landscape and 
              questions are raised about whether the family can continue to be the 
              main support.
              <br> <br> Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once told Dr Balakrishnan that looking 
              after the family is key to building a stable society. This principle has
               underlined many of Singapore's policies, but times are changing.
              <br> <br> Speaking at a seminar on Singapore's social policies at the National 
              University of Singapore on Monday, Dr Balakrishnan noted that although 
              Singaporeans still value the family, some worrying trends have 
              persisted.
              <br> <br> These include low birth rates, marriages at a later age, and a rising 
              number of divorces. 
              <br> <br> These developments have raised questions about whether the family 
              institution can be relied on as the main provider of emotional and 
              material support.
              <br> <br> While recognising the stress placed on families, Dr Balakrishnan said 
              the state cannot take over the role of providing support.
              <br> <br> He said: "Government cannot be a surrogate family, we cannot be a 
              surrogate husband or a surrogate mother, or even a surrogate child.
              <br> <br> "Even as the family as an institution confronts greater challenges in 
              the future, we need to make adaptations so that the family remains the 
              crucial, social pillar of our nation and that we all continue to invest 
              in it. 
              <br> <br> "And it requires people both young and old, it requires the state, it 
              requires employers to pay attention to this aspect of it."
              <br> <br> "I hope we will arrive at the situation where employers take into 
              account the needs of families. So for instance, wherever possible, post 
              both spouses overseas, give them good, fulfilling jobs overseas so that 
              the family can stay intact. That would be so much better for our family 
              stability."
              <br> <br> Dr Balakrishnan felt that in order for Singapore to thrive in the 
              future, the nation must stay open to newcomers and help them integrate 
              into society.
              <br> <br> The minister also highlighted the importance of helping all citizens own
               assets, which will ensure that they are invested in the nation's 
              future.
              <br> <br> Dr Balakrishnan continued: "It's not just giving welfare, but making 
              sure that you've got mandatory savings - enough savings to last you a 
              lifetime and to look after your family. 
              <br> <br> "To translate those savings into assets, housing or other investments 
              which you can pursue through the CPF investment scheme so that these 
              assets can be productive assets and produce reasonable returns to you." 
              <br> <br> He said the government will continue to ensure that homes are 
              affordable, and cautioned owners against selling their flat for a quick 
              profit.
