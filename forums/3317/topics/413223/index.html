              <p>The rescue of 33 Chilean miners was turned into an international media event.</p>
              <p>For those knowledgeable of Masonic and occult symbolism, it's clear there's numerological symbols about the event. Here
              are some of them:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The number of Miners - 33<br></h2>
              <p>The number 33 is of great importance in Freemasonry and in Qabbalistic
              system of numbers. It can be found in many instances in Masonic lore.</p>
              <p><em>The first temple of Solomon stood for thirty-three years in its pristine splendor.</em></p>
              <p><em>King David ruled for thirty-three years in Jerusalem. </em></p>
              <p><em>The Masonic
              Order is divided into thirty-three symbolic degrees.</em></p>
              <p><em>Jesus was
              crucified in the thirty-third year of His life.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Date of the Rescue</h2>
              <p>10/13/10  which can qabbalistically be calculated this way: 10 + 13 + 10 which equals…33.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The ''Phoenix'' rescue device</h2>
              <p>The name of the rescue device was named “Fénix” (Phoenix), which is a mythological creature holding  great importance in occult
              mysteries and considered a symbol of
              accomplishment of alchemical transmutation, a process equivalent to
              human regeneration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Number of Days it Took to Drill the Hole..............33 days</h2>
              <p><em>“The work took 33 days total, one day a man,” said Mikhail
              Proestakis, manager of Driller Supply Company, which participated in
              the drilling of the rescue shaft with a diameter of 66 centimetres,
              which is 33 times two.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The First Note Sent by the Miners</h2>
              <p><em>“Others call attention to the first note the miners sent up to show
              they were still alive – “estamos bien en el refugio los 33” (all 33 of
              us are in the shelter) – which was 33 characters in length.”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Symbolism of the Event</h2>
              <p>33 miners, trapped in the depths and darkness of
              the underground were lifted one by one, on 10/13/10 in a device called
              “Fenix” – a creature representative of occult initiation – to the light
              of day. As they say “Ex tenebris lux”: From darkness to light.</p>

              clear there's numerological symbols about the event. Here are some
              of them:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The number of Miners - 33<br></h2>
              <p>The number 33 is of great importance in Freemasonry and in
              Qabbalistic system of numbers. It can be found in many instances in
              Masonic lore.</p>
              <p><em>The first temple of Solomon stood for thirty-three years in
              its pristine splendor.</em></p>
              <p><em>King David ruled for thirty-three years in
              Jerusalem.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Masonic Order is divided into thirty-three symbolic
              degrees.</em></p>
              <p><em>Jesus was crucified in the thirty-third year of His
              life.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Date of the Rescue</h2>
              <p>10/13/10  which can qabbalistically be calculated this way:
              10 + 13 + 10 which equals…33.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The ''Phoenix'' rescue device</h2>
              <p>The name of the rescue device was named “Fénix” (Phoenix), which
              is a mythological creature holding  great importance in occult
              mysteries and considered a symbol of accomplishment of alchemical
              transmutation, a process equivalent to human regeneration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Number of Days it Took to Drill the Hole..............33
              days</h2>
              <p><em>“The work took 33 days total, one day a man,” said Mikhail
              Proestakis, manager of Driller Supply Company, which participated
              in the drilling of the rescue shaft with a diameter of 66
              centimetres, which is 33 times two.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The First Note Sent by the Miners</h2>
              <p><em>“Others call attention to the first note the miners sent up
              to show they were still alive – “estamos bien en el refugio los 33”
              (all 33 of us are in the shelter) – which was 33 characters in
              length.”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Symbolism of the Event</h2>
              <p>33 miners, trapped in the depths and darkness of the underground
              were lifted one by one, on 10/13/10 in a device called “Fenix” – a
              creature representative of occult initiation – to the light of day.
              As they say “Ex tenebris lux”: From darkness to light.</p>
