              <p>SINGAPORE: Small states are commonly thought to be politically, economically and strategically vulnerable. Size aside, many assume these countries cannot exert any real influence in world affairs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in the new global economy, that is not the case any longer. Professor Tommy Koh, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sees an advantage for smaller states in a globalised world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking at a recent taping of Channel NewsAsia’s Perspectives at the National University of Singapore’s University Hall, Prof Koh said: “If you look at the table of prosperous countries, however you measure them, some of the most prosperous countries in the world are the smallest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Small countries can benefit from an open world where national boundaries are no longer sacrosanct, where the people believe in free trade, in open investment, in technology flow, capital flow and even talent flows.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Joining Prof Koh on the Diplomacy of Small States panel were past and present diplomats such as Dr Mohamed Waheed Hassan, former President of the Maldives and visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; Ms Berit Basse, Ambassador of Denmark to Singapore; and Mr Xanana Gusmao, Minister for Planning and Strategic Investment for the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste.<br></p>
              <p><strong>TIES THAT BIND</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The discussion covered how small states should amplify their voices and advance their interests on the global stage. According to the panel, forming strategic alliances with various international communities and keeping close ties with their neighbours are essential.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said Dr Waheed:  “We have to have clear vision of where we want to go and head strong leadership to be able to pursue that. At the same time I don’t see how we can be closed anymore in a world (that) is highly globalised.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As such, small states cannot afford to be insular and states must break out of their "small-town mentality" to think beyond their borders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Denmark’s stability, for example, has been defined by the relationships it has built with other countries over many years by being a part of the European Union, NATO and the Nordic Council.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But relying on those alliances is not enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“I think we should also be aware that the global architecture and geopolitics are changing, and there are new platforms to play on,” said Ms Basse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Among the alliances for small states to join is the United Nations' Forum of Small States (FOSS), which comprises 105 countries, and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) which addresses the impact of climate change on low-lying coastal and small island countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With many more alliances and platforms to join, ambassador Basse said small states should be strategic in picking which ones to be a part of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Denmark’s case, she said: “We (Denmark) do that because we cannot play on all agendas. We have to choose and prioritise, to have a focus and make alliances. It is through those alliances that we can really exert influence.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>RELATIONSHIP WITH BIGGER NEIGHBOURS<br><br></strong></p>
              <p>The survival of a small country also depends on its neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Referring to how Singapore has expanded its economy beyond its shores, in countries such as India and China where there is benefit for the parties involved, Prof Koh said: “If you have very limited space at home, you can build industrial parks in other people’s countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, Prof Koh pointed to the flip side of cross-border ties, where potential aggression from bigger states hangs above smaller countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea can offer some protection to small states but the reality is that enforcing the law is easier said than done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The international rule of law, although it’s growing stronger, is still not strong enough. It’s not strong enough to deter a determined big country from committing aggression against its smaller neighbour,” said Prof Koh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being the voice of a young and small state, Mr Gusmao said neighbouring countries ultimately need to recognise the small ones, be it as a form of infrastructural support or economic cooperation that benefits both sides.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“If the neighbours play fairly, if the neighbours respect the small ones, don’t bully them, we believe that in this historic moment of humanity and in this globalised world, we all can play a role and do something for humanity.” </p>
