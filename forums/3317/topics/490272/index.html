              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">22 patients diagnosed with Hepatitis C virus, four died: SGH<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Twenty-two patients at a renal ward in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) have been diagnosed with the Hepatitis C virus. Among them, four have died, possibly from the virus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a media conference on Tuesday (Oct 6), SGH said that in early June, the hospital discovered an increased frequency of Hepatitis C virus infections in a renal ward. The hospital subsequently stepped up checks for the virus in patients with abnormal liver function tests in the same ward, and found 22 patients infected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All 22 patients were admitted and stayed in the newly-renovated Ward 67 between April to June 2015. Among them, eight have died, including four who had “multiple co-morbidities and severe sepsis", and the possibility that the Hepatitis C virus could have been a contributing factor has not been ruled out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another three deaths were "thoroughly evaluated" and "no link to the Hepatitis C virus infection has been established". One recent death is pending review.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of the 22 infected, the youngest is 24 years old, and the remaining are between 50 and 60 years old.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH said that all cases were reviewed by a Medical Review Committee, in consultation with the Ministry of Health and chaired by an external senior hepatologist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH said that their initial investigation indicated that the source of infection might be due to "intravenous (IV) injectable agents" or multi-dose vials which typically contain insulin or vaccines. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said Dr Tracy Carol Ayre, the chief nurse at SGH: "There are policies in place that govern how intravenous drugs or drugs in general are prepared, diluted and administered and that includes your infection control practices, hand hygiene, new syringe, new needle, swabbing of the bungs."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In multi-dose insulin - and there are a number of multi-dose vials currently - insulin vaccines are one of them. These are generally shared. So you use it for that person, using a new syringe and new needle, but it's then shared among multiple patients. Because the idea is that you would have swabbed the bung, you would have used a new syringe and new needle for that episode and there's no reason for it to be contaminated again. So if in theory, that this is the cause of it at the end of the day, then that may have been some contamination along that process."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hospital has since taken immediate precautionary measures, stopping multi-dosing, even though it is, in SGH's words, a "long established and accepted practices in healthcare institution".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prof Fong Kok Yong, chairman of SGH’s Medical Board, said that there is "no conclusive evidence" yet as investigations are still ongoing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He also said that there had been no new cases of Hepatitis C virus infection since they implemented their precautionary measures. Hospital staff who provided care to the renal patients will also be screened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH CEO Prof Ang Chong Lye said: "We would like to apologise unreservedly for the grief, pain and anguish this has caused our patients and families.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"What happens to our patients is always our responsibility. We will spare no effort in reviewing our processes and examining all possible sources of infection to prevent recurrence."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>HEALTH MINISTRY CONVENES INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE 'OBJECTIVE, CRITICAL REVIEW'</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong said: "I am gravely concerned and disappointed with the occurrence of the cluster of Hepatitis C cases in SGH." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Gan added that he has appointed an independent review committee to ensure an objective and thorough review of the incident, to prevent future occurrences. "Going forward, the committee will take about two months to complete this work," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When the review is completed, we will share the outcome with the public as well as with our healthcare clusters. We hope that the SGH as well as all our healthcare institutions will learn from this incident and work hard to continue to improve our patients’ safety. In this way, we will be able to ensure that we will continue to take good care of our patients."   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Gan also urged members of the public to not jump to conclusions before the outcome of the review. Meanwhile, he said measures have been introduced to ensure that this issue will not recur again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "Our first priority is to extend our help and support to the patients to ensure that their conditions are managed and taken care of, and also to provide support for the family members. Our second priority is to look at how we can strengthen our precautionary measures and safeguards to ensure this does not happen again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Then, we will also put our efforts into reviewing the process and see where are the gaps and the possible weaknesses, so that we can introduce additional measures to strengthen them. This will be the work of the review committee going forward."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hepatitis C cluster at SGH: What you need to know<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Singapore General Hospital on Tuesday (Oct 6) said it is investigating a cluster of Hepatitis C infections in its renal ward. In total, 22 patients who were hospitalised between April and June this year were infected and SGH said it cannot rule out that Hepatitis C could be a contributing factor in the deaths of four of the people in the group. One recent death is under review.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here are answers to some frequently asked questions on the disease, based on information from SingHealth which runs SGH and the World Health Organisation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>1. What is Hepatitis C?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It can cause both acute and chronic and chronic Hepatitis infection, ranging from mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. The long-term effect of HCV infection is cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure or liver cancer, if the patient is left untreated for a prolonged period of time, according to SingHealth. However, it adds that HCV is very rarely associated with acutely life-threatening disease.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2. How is HCV transmitted? </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HCV infection is not air-borne, unlike Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS). HCV is largely transmitted by blood and blood products. HCV infections could happen via the following means: </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Intravenous drug abuse</p>
              <p>Receipt of donated blood, blood produces and organs from a HCV carrier</p>
              <p>Accidental needlestick injury in healthcare setting</p>
              <p>Haemodialysis in patients with kidney failure</p>
              <p>From HCV-infected mother to baby during childbirth</p>
              <p>Sex with an HCV-infected person</p>
              <p>Other healthcare procedures that involves invasive procedures, such as injections, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <br></p>
              <p><strong>3. How was the cluster of Hepatitis C infection detected?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In early June 2015, doctors in a renal ward in SGH noted an increased frequency of newly-diagnosed Hepatitis C infections in the ward. There was seven cases found within four weeks. This triggered heightened checks for HCV infection in patients in the ward who had abnormal liver function test results.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4. Who are the patients affected?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 22 infected patients stayed in the newly-renovated Ward 67 with overlapping periods of stay between April and June while the original renal ward, Ward 64A was being renovated. All the patients had renal disease and a majority had history of end-stage renal failure and/or renal transplant. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5. Who else is being screened?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH is proactively contacting all patients who were admitted to Wards 64A and 67 from January to June for screening. Care teams at SGH such as doctors and nurses are being screened as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Patients who are uncertain if they are affected can call 65 6321-3356, or leave a message via SMS to 65 8799-2736. They can also email check@sgh.com.sg with their name and IC number.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>6. Is the ward contaminated? Any plan to "clean up" the ward?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As HCV infection is not air-borne like SARS, "cleaning up" the facility is irrelevant, said SingHealth. Nonetheless, SGH has taken steps to tighten its infection control practice by conducting an additional round of environmental cleaning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>7. How sure is SGH that HCV will not affect patients in other wards, as well as their families?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HCV is spread mainly through blood, unlike SARS which is air-borne. In the absence of venous access such as via injections and unprotected open wounds, it should be safe, especially for the patient's family, said SingHealth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For patients, strict sterile practices, with no sharing of needles will prevent the spread of HCV. "Such standards are strictly observed," said SGH. "Nonetheless, we are reviewing all our processes and implementing more stringent measures."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>8. What are the symptoms for HCV?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to the World Health Organisation, 80 per cent of people do not exhibit symptoms after they are infected. However those who do show symptoms could show signs of fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>9. What is the incubation period for HCV infection?</strong> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In people who do develop symptoms for Hepatitis C, the average time period from exposure to symptom onset is 2 to 24 weeks. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some patients may be asymptomatic (i.e. may not show signs of disease) for years. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>10. What is the treatment for HCV infection?</strong> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no vaccine for Hepatitis C, but treatment is available to prevent the onset of complications, such as cirrhosis. Complications such as cirrhosis typically take years to occur if left untreated for a prolonged period. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Antiviral medicines can cure up to 90 per cent of people infected with Hepatitis C. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The treatment for HCV infection varies depending on the patient's condition and clinical indication. Hence, the cost of treatment varies and ranges from about S$5,000 to S$90,000 per course, SingHealth said.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">On Tuesday (6th Oct), SGH admitted that there was an outbreak of hepatitis C and that the cause may be linked to a lapse in the use of multi-dose medication vials. The outbreak has affected 22 patients since 17th April, with the 22nd case being detected on 18th September. At the moment, 4 out of 8 deaths related are believed to be linked to this incident.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">A relative of one of the patients who was infected with hepatitis C in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) has spoken up about her family's ordeal. The patient is one of 2 affected persons still warded at SGH.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The patient, who is in her late 50s, has been suffering from renal failure for the past 15 years.</p>
              <div id="block-inject-1" class="block-inject block-inject-1">
              <div id="block-block-21" class="block block-block no-title odd first block-count-1 block-region-block-inject-1 block-21" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 15px;">
              <div class="block-inner clearfix"></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">This year, the patient went to the hospital in June after she felt unwell. After numerous screening tests, she was diagnosed with hepatitis C and warded at SGH in July.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Unfortunately, the patient's condition has gotten worse. She had a loss of appetite, bed sores, nausea, and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit numerous times.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The patient's main caregivers are her husband and her domestic worker. The family had contemplated stopping the treatment because of the high costs. Each dose of medication can cost up to S$3,000 and the family had incurred about S$80,000 to S$90,000 in hospital bills over the last two months.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">“There isn’t much improvement, we are neither here nor there, and right now, the patient herself is quite depressed ... the whole treatment process has really dragged her down. Most of the time, she is telling us to just let her go, don’t want all this suffering,” said the relative.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Although SGH has informed the patient’s spouse that they will be footing the medical bill, medical costs alone are not the family's only problems. “I think they have tried their best ... We do appreciate the goodwill from the hospital, that they realise this mistake and are willing to bear the costs even before investigations have concluded. This is a relief for the family.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The relative revealed that the patient had already received a renal transplant previously, and that this setback was a huge blow to her. “Renal patients have been through a lot in their lives. To them, these organs are very precious ... but right now another of her organs, her liver, has failed."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">“Because of this possible lapse, the patient has to suffer, be it the treatment process, the side effects of antibiotics. The patient really has low willpower to live on. Even if the treatment goes well, what will be the home care needed for the patient. I think that is more worrying.”</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">In what may be the biggest public health fiasco in Singapore's recent history, the Singapore General Hospital has admitted that close to 1000 patients may have to undergo screenings as they may have been exposed to the risk of Hepatitis C when they sought treatment at the hospital between April and last month. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">SGH is in the process of contacting 678 patients who were admitted to its renal wards 64A and 67 from January to June this year. It is believed that the outbreak occurred in these 2 wards.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">This number is very much higher than the number announced to the public earlier this week. In that earlier announcement, chairman of the medical board at SGH Professor Fong Kok Yong said: “We will be calling back patients who passed through the ward from January to June 2015, and to date, we’ve actually looked through all those who passed through and we’ve identified 411 of them, whom we’ll be calling back just to check”.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">Hepatitis C virus has an incubation period of two weeks to six months. SGH has found 22 cases of infections so far.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">It is believed that lapses in the use of multi-dose medication vials may be the cause behind this shameful blot on Singapore's public healthcare industry. Of the 8 patients who died, 4 are believed to be linked to the virus infection. One case is under review.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">255 out of 325 patients tested negative for Hepatitis C so far: SGH<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SINGAPORE: As of 6pm on Monday (Oct 12), 255 out of the 325 patients screened for Hepatitis C have tested negative, said the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement on Monday evening, SGH said 207 of them have been informed of their results. Results for the remaining 70 patients are still pending, while a further 289 patients have confirmed their screening appointments. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"A total of 253 out of 319 staff has also been screened," said SGH, adding that more staff have stepped forward to be screened. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH said: "Since early last week, we have contacted the 14 affected patients and their family, and the next-of-kin of the eight patients who passed away. Our doctors and medical social workers met them over 12 family conferences with six more scheduled over the next few days and another three to be scheduled."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hospital said these conferences are just the first step in providing the necessary medical treatment and psychological and emotional support. At each session, the patient's primary physician and a social worker will address questions and concerns. SGH added that it will give full medical support and will continue to meet the patients' needs as they surface and evolve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Understanding the medical implications, the nature of Hepatitis C ... and support for their treatment - these are some of the concerns raised," said Dr Crystal Lim, Master Medical Social Worker (Clinical) at SGH. "Every patient and their family, each of them has a different set of needs and we will cater to their needs and meet them accordingly."</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: The first international expert appointed as part of the Independent Review Committee (IRC) looking into the Hepatitis C cluster at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) has arrived, said the IRC on Thursday (Oct 22).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Scott Dewey Holmberg from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and his assistant Dr Amanda Beaudoin have arrived in Singapore, said the IRC. Dr Holmberg's unit in the CDC is responsible for national surveillance, outbreak investigations and research projects in viral hepatitis, while Dr Beaudoin is a veterinary medical officer from the CDC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other expert, Prof Trish Perl from Johns Hopkins University, is expected to arrive later on Thursday with her assistant, Ms JoEllen Harris. Prof Perl is in charge of putting in place mechanisms to prevent potential healthcare-associated infections at her institution, while Ms Harris is the programme director of the epidemiology and infection prevention at the Johns Hopkins Health System.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Holmberg will be here from Thursday till Oct 25, and Dr Beaudoin will stay to assist the IRC till Oct 31. Both Prof Perl and Ms Harris will depart on Oct 28, and both teams will continue to assist the IRC even after they return to America, said IRC Chairman Prof Leo Yee Sin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said Prof Leo: "The experts will be assisting the Independent Review Committee by working with the local team to investigate the outbreak, reviewing the processes and identifying gaps in infection control, and providing expert advice on analyses, interpretation and report of findings."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The Committee members are working closely with the international experts in the outbreak investigation, including accompanying them for site visits, working on epidemiology data, and reviewing the cases and infection control practices. There will be daily discussions with them."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The IRC was set up after SGH's announced on Oct 6 that 22 of its renal ward patients had been infected with Hepatitis C, after which the hospital started contacting patients who were admitted from January to June 2015 at wards 64A and 67 for screening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So far, one of the 598 people screened by SGH for Hepatitis C has tested positive for the virus. </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 patients who recently tested positive for Hepatitis C are part of cluster: SGH<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Two more patients who tested positive for Hepatitis C after they were screened by the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) have been found to be part of a cluster announced earlier this month. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement issued on Monday (Oct 26), Professor Fong Kok Yong, chairman of SGH's Medical Board, said: “Phylogenetic studies done for the two patients who were tested positive as announced on Oct 23 showed that they are part of the affected cluster, bringing the total number of affected patients to 25.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The patients were admitted to Wards 64A and 67 from April to June 2015. We will provide the patients and their family with our full support and ensure that the patients receive timely and appropriate care.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH said that a total of 601 patients have been screened so far, 586 tested negative for the virus. The hospital has been screening patients that had been admitted to its renal ward from January to June, following the announcement of a cluster of 22 infections. It has said Hepatitis C may have been a contributing factor in up to five deaths.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'We must be determined to learn from this': Health Minister on SGH Hepatitis C outbreak<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday (Dec 8) announced the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be setting up a taskforce on top of other measures in the aftermath of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) outbreak at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) which infected 25 people and likely contributed to seven deaths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking after a news conference revealing findings and recommendations by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), Mr Gan said he had accepted the committee's report as comprehensive and adequately covering all key areas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The report identified infection control breaches as a likely cause of the HCV outbreak and also highlighted gaps in the overall response to the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Gan said that going forward, the MOH will set up a taskforce led by Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat. "It will look into enhancing our surveillance and detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks in the community and hospitals," he said, adding that "more details will be shared in time to come".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Additionally, taking into consideration the IRC's recommendation for a specific division to be set up within MOH to handle infectious outbreaks, Mr Gan said the ministry has designated its Communicable Diseases Division to be responsible overall for infectious diseases in both the community and in hospitals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Gan also revealed that SGH, MOH and SingHealth will each appoint a Human Resource panel to look into the roles, responsibilities and actions of all key staff involved in the process, to determine who will be accountable and to assess if disciplinary actions need to be taken.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said the SingHealth panel will include representatives from from the civil service - "so they understand the level of accountability" - and added that MOH's panel will be chaired by Ms Yong Ying-I, Permanent Secretary of the Public Service Division.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Gan also promised that MOH will work with SGH to ensure the recommendations of the IRC are followed up on. "We will also share the IRC's findings with the broader healthcare community, so all of us can learn and improve."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the issue of compensation to those affected, Mr Gan said: "Our current focus is to implement recommendations of the report, and at the same time we want to make sure patient medical needs are looked into and that we provide them with appropriate treatment as well as necessary support."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"SGH has made that commitment, and with regards to compensation, this will be part of the process which we will allow to take due course," he added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Gan also reiterated that there was no need to convene a Committee of Inquiry as demanded by the opposition Workers' Party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The review committee has already identified several areas we can improve on, identified likely causes, highlighted gaps in the system, and made a series of useful and important recommendations," he said. "So it is not necessary to convene a COI to repeat the work the IRC has done."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Gan also apologised to the affected patients and their family members. "I'm sorry for the lapses in the system," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This incident has been very painful for all of us, not just SGH," he noted. "We must be determined to learn from this, so that we can improve and we can be better. This journey of improvement will be a continuous one. We must work together as a healthcare family, and be relentless in our journey to strengthen our system to enhance and improve patient safety and care," said Mr Gan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I'm confident that that if we work together, we will be able to emerge stronger and better." </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SGH 'determined to regain trust of Singaporeans' after Hepatitis C outbreak<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The CEO of the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Tuesday (Dec 8) apologised for lapses at the hospital that resulted in a Hepatitis C outbreak that could have caused up to seven deaths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prof Ang Chong Lye said the hospital accepted the findings of an Independent Review Committee released on Tuesday afternoon and said SGH is determined to regain the trust of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH's statement is reproduced below:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"SGH has accepted the findings and recommendations of the Independent Review Committee (IRC), appointed by MOH, on the outbreak of hepatitis C virus infection at the Hospital’s renal wards. It has also apologised for the lapses at the hospital, and started on plans to close the gaps identified by the IRC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prof Ang Chong Lye, Chief Executive Officer, said: “My colleagues and I deeply regret what happened. I would like to apologise to the patients and their families who have been affected by the outbreak. It has been a hard and humbling lesson but we will learn from this, improve and work tirelessly to ensure that our patients are always safe in our care. We are determined to regain the trust of Singaporeans, whom we have been most privileged to serve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We thank the Committee for their thorough review. SGH takes a very serious view of what happened and will look into the areas identified by the IRC on top of the enhanced practices and additional measures we have taken since June 2015. Our patients’ safety and well-being are our highest priority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have met with all the affected patients and their family members or next-of-kin to provide them our full support. We are grateful for their patience and understanding; and will continue to care for them and assist them with their medical and emotional needs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There had been concerns from the public on the time we took to announce the cluster of hepatitis C virus infection in our renal wards. SGH has reflected on our response and approach, and acknowledge that we could have done better and escalated the matter earlier to SingHealth and MOH.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH will work closely with the SingHealth Infection Control Audit Taskforce to conduct cross-institution audits to reinforce the standards of infection control practices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SingHealth, the parent organisation of SGH, has also appointed a Report Implementation Committee to follow up on the IRC recommendations. Both these SingHealth committees are led by Prof Tan Kok Hian, SingHealth Group Director, Academic Medicine and Head and Senior Consultant, Perinatal Audit and Epidemiology, Maternal-Fetal Medicine, KKH.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prof Fong Kok Yong, Chairman, Medical Board, said: “Our top most priority was to ensure that affected patients were given appropriate and timely treatment according to their clinical needs and medical indications. In early June 2015, we reviewed our infection control practices and instituted additional measures. We are thankful that this action was effective in helping to subsequently contain the spread of the infection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have learnt from this outbreak that a more robust alert and escalation system at the Hospital has to be in place, with clear definition of roles and individual accountability. SGH will work with MOH to implement the IRC recommendations. We will leave no stone unturned to enhance patient safety, and do all we can to prevent recurrence of such an unfortunate event.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The immediate task of the SingHealth Report Implementation Committee is to address the recommendations made by the IRC. It will take a proactive audit approach to tighten surveillance and enhance infection control at the affected renal wards. It will also develop and implement the plan for corrective measures as recommended by the IRC and build a robust comprehensive system for infection control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Committee will work with MOH to facilitate a cross-institution framework for the detection, investigation and management of uncommon infections. The aim is to implement a sustainable action plan, which will help develop a culture that encourages and enables patient safety – where strict adherence to evidence-based infection control is a way of life and embedded in the DNA of our SingHealth institutions."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Independent Review Committee said the Hepatitis C cluster was likely caused by infection control breaches, and there were gaps found in the response. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The review committee also recommended measures to improve infection control. Responses to similar incidents were mooted on Friday afternoon as well. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The police on Friday released a statement that they ruled out foul play, after SGH lodged a police report on Oct 20 this year. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In October, SGH announced that 25 patients in its renal ward had contracted the virus. The hospital has screened hundreds of patients and staff following the discovery of the cluster. </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SGH Hep C cluster: Measures to improve infection control, response mooted<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Independent Review Committee (IRC) convened to investigate the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Tuesday (Dec 8) outlined recommendations to improve infection control and the national response system to such events.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The IRC’s recommendations followed its 79-page report, which was accepted by the Ministry of Health (MOH). The report identified breaches in infection control as a likely cause of the HCV cluster, where seven people died, and also highlighted flaws in the system response to unusual and unfamiliar outbreaks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The committee, which was set up in late September and which included international experts, said there was a need for SGH to review existing standard operating procedures (SOPs) and practices on infection control, to further reduce the risk of contamination of medical equipment and contact surfaces, as well as to ensure adequate environmental cleaning and disinfection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Specific measures included designating a clean area for the preparation of intravenous medication, using washable keyboard covers, not touching surfaces on computerised medical carts with contaminated or gloved hands, and considering the option of using fluorescent dye to assess the adequacy of cleaning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The committee also recommended that SGH ensure staff adhere to standard precautions for infection control, and adopt best practices such as those laid out in guidelines from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - but adapted to the Singaporean context.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For instance, the hospital should consider the use of needleless intravenous devices, to allow safe injection of medication without the use of needles. CDC guidelines also include the appropriate use of single-dose and multi-dose vials.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SGH should strengthen its monitoring and supervision framework for staff to ensure compliance to SOPs, said the review committee. It added that SGH should prepare a plan for corrective measures specific to the findings identified by the IRC. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This plan should be formulated within one month and submitted to MOH for review, to ensure patient and healthcare worker safety, and maintain a high standard of patient care with particular attention to infection control," the committee said in its report. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The IRC comprised of the following members: </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prof Leo Yee Sin (Chairman) - Director and Clinical Director, Tan Tock Seng Hospital</p>
              <p>Prof Lim Seng Gee - Senior Consultant, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine at the National University Hospital (NUH)</p>
              <p>Assoc Prof Helen Oh - Head of Infectious Diseases at Changi General Hospital (CGH)</p>
              <p>Dr Titus Lau - Senior Consultant, Division of Nephrology at NUH</p>
              <p>Ms Paulin Koh - Chief Nurse at CGH</p>
              <p>Assoc Prof Quek Swee Chye - Deputy Chairman of the Medical Board at NUH</p>
              <p>Dr Jeffrey Cutter - Director (Communicable Disease Division) at MOH</p>
              <p>Also present at the press conference on Tuesday were Assistant Professor Angela Chow, Head of the Department of Clinical Epidemiology at TTSH's Institute of Infectious Disease and Epidemiology, and Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, President of the National University of Singapore. They were appointed as resources for the IRC to tap on during the review.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>RESPONSE FRAMEWORKS SHOULD BE ENHANCED</strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The committee also recommended that MOH to enhance its current surveillance and outbreak response frameworks to cater for unusual and unfamiliar events, for outbreak detection investigation and management, communication and escalation protocols, and the appropriate roles of MOH and the hospital in question.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The IRC suggested improving the national notification and surveillance system for acute HCV, taking reference from international best practices and adapting them to the Singaporean context.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One possibility, said the committee, is to build an electronic system where laboratories can automatically send notifications to MOH. It also said there should be a designated team within MOH to carry out surveillance, identify and investigate potential outbreaks and ensure adequate expertise nationally for investigations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But hospitals should also continue to take responsibility and develop frameworks and capabilities for healthcare-associated infection outbreaks, it added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where required, the hospital’s capabilities can be supplemented with additional resources from the national healthcare system, including but not limited to infectious diseases specialists and epidemiologists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The committee also asked MOH to strengthen its escalation and communication processes for healthcare-associated infections, especially unusual and unfamiliar ones, within and between hospitals, public healthcare clusters and MOH. This should be achieved through clearer guidelines on the assessment of the significance and severity of a healthcare-associated infection, said the IRC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It noted that it may not be easy to set guidelines for all situations, so regardless of systems in place, healthcare professionals should be alert to escalate any event that is unfamilar and unusual. Doctors, especially, are reminded of their obligation to report instances of infectious disease, as stipulated by MOH.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When asked if MOH would convene a Committee of Inquiry (COI) as called for by the opposition Workers’ Party, the ministry said it was satisfied with the IRC’s findings and recommendations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“We do not see a need to convene a COI to repeat what the IRC has done. What else is there to establish that the IRC has not established?” said MOH in a statement. “Our priority now is to focus efforts and resources on implementing remedial measures to improve patient safety and patient care.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The infection has affected 25 patients at SGH’s renal ward.</p>
