              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Branded goods, holidays with her family and household
               expenses - that was what a woman who was convicted of forging cheques 
              worth S$1 million spent the criminal proceeds on, a court heard 
              Wednesday. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Samantha Chiam Hwee 
              Theng, 31, also had about 200 pairs of shoes and 80 branded bags, with 
              multiple purchases of the same item, the court heard.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The police have recovered a number of branded handbags, along with almost S$450,000 worth of jewellery and luxury watches.<br><br>Chiam,
               a former secretary for the director of Triple Electronic David Wu, was 
              charged in September last year for forging the signatures of Mr Wu on 32
               of his cheques. <br><br>She has been in remand since.<br><br>According 
              to court documents, between 2008 and 2009, Chiam forged Mr Wu's 
              signature on US-dollar dominated cheques of his account in Changhwa 
              Bank, a Taiwanese bank.<br><br>She would encash the cheques into 
              Singapore dollars at money changers Great East Forex. On the last 
              occasion, on 17 Feb 2009, she encashed a US$500,000 (S$750,500) cheque. <br><br>Mr Wu noticed this withdrawal five months later and confronted her. <br><br>A month later, Chiam decided to confess to her crimes and surrendered herself to the police after consulting a lawyer.<br><br>Yesterday, lawyers from the prosecution and the defence presented their psychiatric evaluations of Ms Chiam to the court.<br><br>The
               defence said, in mitigation, that Chiam is suffering from a mental 
              illness known as compulsive-impulsive disorder, which led her to spend 
              large sums of money on shopping.<br><br>For example, she was reported to
               have spent at least S$10,000 at Louis Vuitton and S$30,000 at Chanel on
               each shopping trip to the luxury outlets.<br><br>But the prosecution 
              said that Chiam's acts of forgery were pre-meditated and planned, and 
              did not involve any impulsive behaviour associated with 
              compulsive-impulsive disorder.<br><br>Chiam's mitigation plea also told 
              of her desire to elevate her social status among her peers, by buying 
              branded goods, some of which she kept for her own private collection and
               some she gave away to friends and colleagues.<br><br>"Without my branded goods, I am nothing," she said in her plea.<br><br>Her sentencing has been arranged for June 6.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
