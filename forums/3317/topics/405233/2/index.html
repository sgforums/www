              <p>HOUSTON (Texas)- SINGAPORE can expect the number of foreign
                          workers to increase by at least 100,000 this year in response to
                          the demands of the booming economy, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien
                          Loong.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the Singapore media here on Tuesday as he wrapped up
                          a six-day visit to the United States, Mr Lee said the government
                          had taken steps to moderate the number of foreign workers, but a
                          rise was inevitable given the strong growth.</p>
              <p>He added:<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 'It cannot be helped because with the market so tight,
                          if we don't allow the foreign workers in, you are going to have

              <p>Less any further clarification by the authorities about what they truly 
                  mean by 'overheated'- that the demand for labour is so high, it's 
                  considered 'overheated',  <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: red;">I think that 
                  the only thing really getting '<strong>overheated</strong>' is the Prime

                  PM's salary </a>is linked to nation's GDP (CEO's salaries, govt revenues

                   the fruits of their labour.<br> <br> If indeed the SG economy experiences "record growth", then why aren't 
                  the citizens salaries experiencing the same? Perhaps citizen salaries 
                  should be increased by 15% in line with the anticipated GDP expansion 
                  and only <strong>after </strong>this act of decent wage increment is performed 
                  should any further influx of foreign labour be considered, after all, 
                  the PM's salary, tagged to the top jobs of the land are bound to be the

              <p>So govt grows economy at all cost regardless of environmental/ social concerns, because the running theme- top down- in this country is to 'grow GDP' at all costs.</p>

              <p id="news"><strong>By Zakaria Abdul Wahab</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE, July 15 (Bernama) - A food aid programme for jobless migrant workers run by two local charity organisations in Little India, here is in jeopardy as its funds are drying up.<br><br>The Cuff Road Project is currently short of funds and it will dry up if no new donations and grants are coming in within a month, according to Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) and ONE (SINGAPORE) today.<br><br>They said sharply rising numbers of migrant workers seeking food aid threatened the survival of the food aid programme that had already served over 100,000 meals to homeless and jobless foreign workers.<br><br>Some 450 men depend on the programme for their daily meals, and last month, the project expenditure reached an all-time high of $17,914, up nearly 80 percent on average from the first quarter of the year.<br><br>"Most of The Cuff Road Project participants have either been forced to leave their jobs due to injuries or the non-payment of wages," said John Gee, president of TWC2.<br><br>He said many of the migrant workers were the victims of scams, and not only that, most of them went deep into debt to come to Singapore, often selling their family homes to do so.<br><br>"We aim to provide the men with meals in a safe and clean environment, where they can eat with dignity," said Vernetta Lopez, president of ONE (SINGAPORE).<br><br>"No one in Singapore, whether local or from overseas, should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from," she said.<br><br>TWC2 is now addressing an urgent appeal for funds to individuals and corporate bodies to ensure that the programme could continue.<br><br>The sharp rise in the project numbers might be due to higher visibility of the programme among the migrant worker community or there were more men who were out-of-work and qualified for the programme, the organisers said.<br><br>The project which is run by volunteers not only provides the men with food, but with a chance to socialise and a place to relax and talk about their problems.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br></p>
