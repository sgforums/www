              <p>If people earn too much ('<strong>overheating</strong>' of peasant's salaries) 
                  they might work less, think more and so expect  more. <br> Money is power and not one who of us who Plunders And Prospers knows 
                  that the more salaries the people earn, the lower are company profits 
                  and in tandem, the lower is CEO salary. Our salaries are tagged to the 
                  highest 8 of the 6 best paid professionals/ CEOs.<br> So the salaries of the people must be fixed to prevent natural 
                  'overheating' due to high labour demand in a developing economy.<br> If the 6man-GRC system of elections hasn't already adequately 'fixed' 
                  the opposition, then perhaps whats left of them can be bought- all par

              <p></p>
              <p>Why does PM Lee want SG
                           to become a country of cheap labour- that he eschews the proportional '<span style="color: red;"><strong>overheating</strong></span>' of Singaporean's salaries in 
                          tandem with an equally '<strong>overheated</strong>' economy? <br> That is because over worked and under paid low cost workers are 
                          generally most obedient to govt propaganda and have little in terms of 
                          time nor resource question government agenda.<br> <br> Only before overworked low wage workers can ruling party hold votes 
                          ransom with threats of  "solve this week's problem and forget about next
                           year's challenges",  "spend all my time thinking what's the right way 
                          to fix them (opposition)" or "buy  supporters votes" [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">YouTube</a>] .<br> In any case, the Singapore PM's salary is remains tagged to the highest 
                          paid CEO salaries of the land [<a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/misc/clippings/web/mstr0.jpg">pict chart</a>], and any well paid sweatshop CEO would 
                          tell you that company profits are driven by cheap labour costs.<br> <br> There are of course non-sweatshop CEOs, but I think PAP ministers are 
                          far from that league, and neither are their presence significant in 
                          Singapore- and so we revert.<br> <br> No surprise that PAP has decided that a hardworking yet unthinking 
                          populace would be most favorable to a continuous PAP rule, not to 
                          mention the rich returns such obedient populace routinely bring their 
                          masters.<br> <br> So the PAP profits from the manipulation of people; the economy would 
                          also never really overheat because the people remain obedient to what 
                          the PAP says- e.g. please pay higher GST/ property taxes etc.<br> <br> Indeed, the PAP has well taken a leaf from the dictatorial book of :<br> <img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx21/BicCherry/Interesting%20photos/kim-jong-ilnicedebwordpress.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> References:<br> - [A1forums:16Jun2010 ] (Global warming): Having babies today is cruel:

              <p><strong>Worker influx is good</strong></p>
              <p>THE influx of more than 100,000 foreign workers this year shows the 
              strength of job creation in Singapore and is not cause for concern, 
              labour chief Lim Swee Say said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Local workers should not fear, for the labour movement will still focus on upgrading their skills, he added.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on July 14 that more than 100,000 extra foreigners are set to enter the workforce this year.</p>
              <p>Commenting on this, Mr Lim said: 'It's a good sign, because it shows 
              that at a time when many countries are having a shortage of jobs, we are
               having a shortage of workers.'</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters at the launch of a training scheme for the 
              cleaning industry, Mr Lim added that the focus should not be on the 
              number of foreign workers, but on their quality.</p>
              <p>The 100,000 new workers will differ from the thousands who have 
              entered over the past three to five years: they will be higher-skilled 
              and more productive.</p>
