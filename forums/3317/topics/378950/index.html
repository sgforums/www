              <p>By Clare Jim and Saeed Azhar</p>
              <p>HONG
              KONG/SINGAPORE, Oct 15 - Banking group OCBC &lt;OCBC.SI&gt; clinched a
              deal to buy Dutch-based ING Group NV's &lt;ING.AS&gt; private banking
              unit in Asia for $1.5 billion in a deal which would elevate it to
              Singapore's second-ranked bank by assets.</p>
              <p>In the biggest deal
              in the private banking industry since the financial crisis, OCBC beat
              HSBC Holdings Plc &lt;HSBA.L&gt; &lt;0005.HK&gt; with a bid worth 5.8
              percent of the target's assets, or more than double what Julius Baer
              Group AG &lt;BAER1.VX&gt; paid for ING's Swiss banking assets earlier
              this month. [ID:nSIN287448]</p>
              <p>"Pricing appears full given it's
              from a distressed seller and the recent earnings stream looks highly
              leveraged and volatile," said Matthew Wilson, a banking analyst at
              Morgan Stanley, which has an "underweight" rating on OCBC.</p>
              <p>A
              number of private banking assets have come up for sale as banks
              restructure following state bailouts and industry consolidation is
              picking up pace. [ID:nLF187364].</p>
              <p>OCBC will more than triple
              its private banking assets to $23 billion with the deal, moving from
              being Singapore's third-biggest bank to second by assets after DBS
              &lt;DBSM.SI&gt;, which earlier dropped out of the race to buy the ING
              assets.</p>
              <p>CEO David Conner said the bank will now look to expand
              its private bank operations beyond Asia and is considering a Middle
              Eastern and European marketing team to attract new clients.</p>
              <p>He
              said the dynamics of the Asian business, recovering from the crisis but
              in a region seen as having many untapped millionaires, was different to
              a more mature European market.</p>
              <p>"We are not embarrassed in any
              way or surprised by the fact that we paid what we think is a healthy
              price for the franchise," Conner said. "This is a rare opportunity to
              acquire an Asian private bank franchise."</p>
              <p>Merrill Lynch/Capgemini see 8.8 percent growth a year until 2018 in the wealth of Asia's high-net worth individuals.</p>
              <p>GOOD PRICE</p>
              <p>ING's
              sale of its Asian private bank, with about $16 billion in assets, is
              its third major disposal in less than a month and the second in the
              Asia-Pacific region, as it seeks to restructure following a government
              bailout in Oct. 2008.</p>
              <p>Analysts said the price was good for ING but it was unfortunate it was selling assets in the present market.</p>
              <p>"ING continues to sell future profitability and presence in important growth markets," SNS Securities said in a research note.</p>
              <p>OCBC
              shares erased early gains to close 1 percent down at S$7.60, while ING
              rose 1.6 percent to 12.68 euros at 1025 GMT, after reaching their
              highest level in almost a year.</p>
              <p>OCBC said the deal would cut
              its Tier 1 capital by 1.5 percentage points to 13.9 percent. Conner
              said the bank had no need to raise more capital and Standard &amp;
              Poor's Ratings Services said its OCBC ratings were unaffected by the
              deal [ID:nnWLA5779].</p>
              <p>Citigroup analyst Robert Kong said OCBC's
              Tier 1 capital exceeded 12.5 percent, still giving it ample ammunition
              to seek M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
              <p>OCBC's private bank, which lost
              a third of its bankers to foreign rivals in 2006, is run by French
              national Olivier Denis, but the integrated private bank will be run by
              the head of the ING arm, Renato de Guzman. [ID:nSIN429740]</p>
              <p>Conner said OCBC had come to a retention agreement with senior ING staff.</p>
              <p>ING
              is in the process of raising 6 billion euros to 8 billion through asset
              sales under a restructuring programme announced in April and plans to
              ultimately exit 10 of the 48 countries where it does business.
              [ID:nL1574170]</p>
              <p>The restructuring follows 10 billion euros in
              state aid ING received in Oct. 2008 and a 22 billion euro asset
              guarantee it received from the Dutch state in Jan. 2009.</p>
