              <h2>Philippine President takes stairs up 20 flights</h2>
              <p>Philippine President Benigno Aquino III had to take 20 flights of 
              stairs up a water treatment plant in the first day of his state visit to
               Singapore after the building’s only lift broke down.</p>
              <p>Executives of Singapore’s national water agency PUB were touring the 
              51-year-old head of state and his delegation around the Changi Water 
              Reclamation Plant yesterday.</p>
              <p>As the group prepared to head back up after looking at some used 
              water pumps 60 metres underground, the only lift broke down — the first 
              time since the plant opened more than two years ago.</p>
              <p>The group waited for technicians to get the lift working again, but 
              after 20 minutes, Mr Aquino removed his jacket, loosened his tie and 
              started climbing the stairs, <em>The Straits Times</em> reported.</p>
              <p>Accompanied by Singapore Minister Lim Swee Say of the Prime 
              Minister’s Office, Aquino remained in good spirits, taking short breaks 
              along the way.</p>
              <p>Members of the delegation kept the mood buoyant. One Philippine 
              Cabinet secretary quipped: “We’re okay, Mr President, we’ll follow you 
              anywhere you go.”</p>
              <p>Upon reaching the top after a 10-minute climb, Mr Aquino received a 
              towel, some water and apologies from Mr Lim and PUB executives.</p>
              <p>“No problem at all,” the Filipino President replied.</p>
              <p>Mr Aquino is scheduled to have lunch with Singapore Prime Minister 
              Lee Hsien Loong today and attend a state dinner hosted by President S R 
              Nathan.</p>
              <p>The visiting leader will also have an orchid named after him 
              tomorrow, and will be speaking at an event organised by the Singapore 
              Business Federation and the Singapore Management University.</p>
