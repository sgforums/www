              <p><strong>Marina Bay Sands opening delayed to early next year </strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Marina Bay Sands integrated resort,
              originally slotted to welcome its first visitors by the end of this
              year, has pushed back its opening to the beginning of 2010. <br> <br> Developer Las Vegas Sands said this is due to the complicated
              construction of the integrated resort's SkyPark situated at the top of
              its 55-storey-high hotel.
              <br> <br>Half the facilities including the casino, half the retail and
              dining outlets and the first 20 storeys of each of the three hotel
              towers will open early next year for its initial phase. The other half
              will be operational two to three months later.
              <br> <br>The SkyPark is a 340-metre rooftop strip housing three swimming
              pools and gardens for 3,900 people. Construction of the SkyPark's
              foundation will start in August.
              <br> <br>Marina Bay Sands is Singapore's first casino project to be awarded,
              in 2006. As well as gaming, the complex will include hotel, convention,
              luxury retail and performing arts facilities.
              <br> <br>A second casino, Resorts World at Sentosa, is scheduled to open in
              phases also starting early 2010 and will feature the world's biggest
              oceanarium with 700,000 fish and a Universal Studios theme park.
              <br> <br>Singapore in 2005 gave the approval for casinos to be developed in
              a bid to draw more visitors to the city-state, whose main attractions
              are shopping, dining, night life and animal parks.

              <p><strong>Government in talks with Marina Bay Sands over delay</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government is currently in talks with Marina Bay Sands over the integrated resort's announced delay. 
              <br> <br> Another issue is a possible staff shortage as observers note Singaporeans tend to shy away from the gaming industry.
              <br> <br> The Marina Bay Sands integrated resort's opening has been pushed back
              to early next year. But with contractual obligations and Singapore's
              tourism sector at stake, the government is working with Sands to find a
              solution. <br> <br> Senior Minister of State, Trade and Industry, S Iswaran, said: "If
              there is a contractual obligation and if there is a deviation, then I
              think both parties must agree that it is on a mutually agreed basis. So
              STB and other government agencies are in discussions with them and we
              expect to have a good outcome."
              <br> <br> The minister declined to comment on whether there would be any penalties imposed on Marina Bay Sands for the delay. 
              <br> <br> Staffing problems could also add to it as Singaporeans generally seem to be avoiding gaming jobs.
              <br> <br>Ang Hin Kee, CEO, Employment and Employability Institute, said:
              "Not as many people have come forward because when we ask them, they
              say, 'Don't you need training, don't you need to learn how to do this
              job?' So they are a little bit conservative even though you don't need
              prior experience to do these jobs. But people are a bit hesitant."
              <br> <br> Experts also said that there is an issue of familiarity with the industry in Singapore. 
              <br> <br>Unlike Macau for example, where everyone knows what the gaming
              industry is about, in Singapore, there is a lack of family or friends
              who are currently working in that business for people to talk to to
              find out more.
              <br> <br>Observers said the rotating nature of the shift is another reason
              why some applicants are shunning the sector. However, non-gaming sector
              jobs at the IRs like retail have seen plenty of applicants. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Resorts World at Sentosa to stage first event in December</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: The integrated resort at Sentosa is
              expected to open early next year, but it is already planning to stage
              its first event ahead of the soft launch.</p>
              <p>Resorts World at Sentosa has teamed up with organisers of ChildAid
              to host its fifth concert at the Festive Grand Theatre in December.</p>
              <p>The
              organisers have yet to confirm the budget for the three—day event, but
              the Sentosa IR has already pledged to donate some S$153,000 in kind.
              ChildAid hopes others will come forward to help it beat last year’s
              record of S$506,000 raised.</p>
              <p>Peter Khoo, organising chairman,
              ChildAid, said: "There’s definitely a fear that sponsors aren’t
              forthcoming, but our duty is to try."</p>
              <p>The theatre, which seats up
              to 1,600 people, will also house the resort’s resident show, Voyage de
              la Vie. Resorts World said it would be a rock—circus extravaganza,
              featuring awarding—winning circus acts from around the world.</p>
              <p>Andrea
              Teo, vice president of entertainment, Resorts World at Sentosa, said:
              "They’re sort of telling the story of a journey of a boy through life.
              A discovery of himself... portrayed through circus acts."</p>
              <p>As for
              whether the theatre will be completed on time, Resorts World said
              construction efforts are on the fast track, with some 6,500 workers
              currently working on site. The IR added that it could increase that
              number to 8,000 or 9,000 workers within the next two months.</p>
