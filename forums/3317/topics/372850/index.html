              <p><strong>Police: Slain model's fingers, teeth were removed</strong></p>
              <p class="first">BUENA PARK, Calif. - A reality TV contestant was
              charged with murder Thursday in the death of his ex-wife as the manhunt
              for the suspect spread to Canada and police provided gruesome new
              details about the killing.</p>
              <p>Police said Ryan Alexander Jenkins removed the teeth and fingers of
              Jasmine Fiore, presumably to impede authorities in their efforts to
              identify the naked body after it was found stuffed in a suitcase in a
              California trash bin over the weekend.</p>
              <p>The former swimsuit model
              and Jenkins were briefly married after a quickie Las Vegas wedding this
              year, and had been fighting in recent months. Prosecutors said the two
              checked into a San Diego hotel last Thursday, and Jenkins checked out
              the next morning. Fiore was not seen alive again.</p>
              <p>He vanished after the body was found Saturday and Buena Park police Lt. Steve Holliday said he's possibly armed with a handgun.</p>
              <p>Jenkins
              is believed to have driven 1,000 miles to Washington state and then
              hopped in a boat to a peninsula on the border, where he walked into
              Canadian territory. A Canadian police official said ground, air and
              canine units are involved in the search for Jenkins.</p>
              <p>"At this
              time, although we believe he crossed the border, we're not one hundred
              percent sure of that," U.S. Marshal Chief Inspector Thomas Hession.
              "There will be no stone unturned and we'll look under every rock for
              him."</p>
              <p>A car and empty boat trailer belonging to the 32-year-old
              Calgary, Alberta native were found at a marina in the remote northwest
              Washington town of Blaine.</p>
              <p>Whatcom County Sheriff's deputies
              received a report Wednesday that a man matching Jenkins' description
              arrived by boat at Point Roberts, Wash., about 10 miles from Blaine at
              the tip of a peninsula. The point is reachable by land only from
              Canada, and Jenkins is believed to have walked across the border from
              there.</p>
              <p>Canadian Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan said police agencies across Canada are on the lookout for Jenkins.</p>
              <p>Constable Sharlene Brooks in the Canadian border city of Delta said ground, air and canine units are involved in the search.</p>
              <p>Fiore's ex-boyfriend, Robert Hasman, urged Jenkins' friends and family to help police find him.</p>
              <p>"Ryan
              Jenkins is an animal, what he has done to Jasmine is unspeakable and
              it's just not right and I'd appreciate your help," Hasman said at a
              news conference.</p>
              <p>Jenkins was a contestant on the VH1 reality TV show "Megan Wants a Millionaire."</p>
              <p>After
              taping for the VH1 series finished in early March, Jenkins met
              28-year-old Fiore in Las Vegas casino and the two got married on March
              18, said Fiore's mother, Lisa Lepore.</p>
              <p>But in May, "they had a big
              blowout," and fought because he was jealous of her ex-boyfriends,
              Lepore said. "She had the marriage annulled."</p>
              <p>The federal
              government was in the process of issuing a federal warrant Thursday
              afternoon, which would allow Canadian authorities to take Jenkins into
              custody there, Capt. Ken Coovert said.</p>
              <p>If Jenkins is arrested in Canada, California can request that he be extradicted to the U.S.</p>
              <p>At
              least one actor who appeared on "Millionaire" with Jenkins at a mansion
              in the Hollywood Hills was shocked by the latest developments and
              remembered a suave bachelor who grew in confidence as taping progressed.</p>
              <p>Jenkins
              earned the nickname "Smooth Operator" because of "his cheeky cockiness.
              And I mean that in a friendly way," said Rob Locke, who played the
              host, a butler named Niles.</p>
              <p>"We were all under the impression
              that he was single. Then I saw on Facebook that he got married and
              there were photos of him and his wife. My personal observation was,
              'Wow, that was quick,'" Locke said, adding that taping ended in March.</p>
              <p>Court
              records show that Jenkins was charged in June in Clark County, Nev.,
              with a misdemeanor count of "battery constituting domestic violence"
              for allegedly hitting Fiore in the arm and will be tried in December.</p>
              <p>Jenkins
              also has a criminal history in his hometown of Calgary, Canada. He was
              sentenced to 15 months of probation in January 2007 on an unspecified
              assault charge, according to the Alberta, Canada Ministry of Justice.
              No further details were available.</p>
              <p>Neal Tomlinson, a partner at
              the law firm representing Jenkins in the Nevada case, declined to
              comment and declined to say if his firm was representing Jenkins in the
              current matter.</p>
              <p>Fiore was last seen alive with Jenkins at a poker
              game in San Diego. Jenkins reported her missing Saturday night to the
              Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, police said.</p>
              <p>A preliminary coroner's report indicated Fiore was strangled.</p>
              <p>Jenkins,
              variously described as an architect, real estate developer and
              investment banker from Calgary, appeared in at least three episodes of
              the series "Megan Wants a Millionaire," about a woman seeking to land a
              wealthy bachelor by putting suitors through their paces, such as
              designing a marketing campaign for her pet Chihuahua.</p>
              <p>On the show, Jenkins was identified as an investment banker who had a couple million dollars.</p>
              <p>A
              resume posted on the professional networking site LinkedIn.com says
              Jenkins graduated from Mount Royal College in Calgary in 1999, has a
              license to fly commercial airplanes and worked in investment sales and
              as president of a boutique development company focused on cutting-edge
              green technologies.</p>
              <p>By May, Fiore "didn't trust him because he
              was doing (things) behind her back," Lepore said. She declined to say
              what the incident involved.</p>
              <p>Jenkins then went to Mexico to do
              another reality TV show, but struggled to get Fiore back when he
              returned. It was not immediately clear which show he appeared on.</p>
              <p>"He
              convinced her during that month that he was really the guy for her,"
              Lepore said. "He wrote poems and stories, and prayed, and (claimed he)
              had this huge spiritual awakening."</p>
              <p>VH1 said it has postponed any
              future airings of the show. The statement also said that the show was
              an outside production licensed to VH1, but that it was produced and
              owned by 51 Minds Entertainment.</p>

              <p><strong>Police say fugitive reality TV star found dead</strong></p>
              <p class="first">VANCOUVER, British Columbia - Canadian police say
              fugitive murder suspect Ryan Jenkins has been found dead of an apparent
              suicide in a motel in British Columbia. Sgt. Duncan Pound of the Royal
              Canadian Mounted Police border integrity unit says police responded to
              a call about a dead person in Hope, east of Vancouver, and then called
              investigators who were part of the massive manhunt for Jenkins.</p>
              <p>The real estate developer and reality show contestant was wanted in
              California on first-degree murder charges after the mutilated body of
              his ex-wife was found near Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>Jenkins, 32, disappeared last week but his boat was found Wednesday
              at a marina not far from the U.S.-Canada border south of Vancouver.</p>
              <p>Pound says police don't yet know how long Jenkins was at the motel before his body was discovered.</p>
