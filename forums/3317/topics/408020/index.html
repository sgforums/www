              <h4 class="piccaption">The meal in a box which was posted by a  
                  volunteer on his Facebook page. The caterer  said it has taken action to
                   improve the portions and variety of food served. -- PHOTO: FACEBOOK</h4>
              <p></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>THE caterer for meals provided to Youth Olympic Games 
                  (YOG) volunteers has moved to improve them after complaints about the 
                  food surfaced.</p>
              <p>The action resulted after a volunteer took a picture of the 
                  meal he was served and posted it on his Facebook page, igniting a 
                  furore.</p>
              <p>The meal, served in a plastic box, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>comprised a mound of rice, a meat fillet and six pieces of long bean.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Singapore Food Industries (SFI), a subsidiary of the 
                  Singapore Airport Terminal Services (Sats), provided the food. It had 
                  been awarded a $5.5 million catering services contract by the YOG 
                  organising committee.</p>
              <p>When contacted, a Sats spokesman confirmed that the meal in 
                  the picture was part of a meal provided to the YOG workforce. A bottled 
                  drink and some fruit were also provided, she added.</p>
              <p>'We have received feedback from the workforce regarding the 
                  meals served. We take their feedback very seriously and have promptly 
                  taken action to improve and ensure that the portions and variety served 
                  will provide the workforce with a balanced meal.'</p>
              <p>In its response to the criticism, the YOG's organising 
                  committee said: 'Our workforce is key to the successful organisation of 
                  the Games and their health and physical well-being is important to us.'</p>
              <p>Added a spokesman: 'We are aware of the feedback (on the 
                  meal) and have taken immediate action. We will work with the caterers to
                   continually improve the meal standards.'</p>
              <p>The committee did not respond to questions on how much was 
                  budgeted for volunteers' meals and whether there had been any guidelines
                   for food provision.</p>
              <p>Criticism of the food has been raging online since the picture was posted on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>One netizen, Mr Chris Liew, 33, an investment banker, said he was appalled after chancing upon the picture online.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Even if (the meal) was an isolated incident, such a
                   logistics oversight of providing sub-standard meals to our volunteers 
                  should have been avoided at all cost because we are hosting a 
                  world-class event after all.'</p>
              <p>SFI's contract covers meals for up to 7,000 athletes, officials and volunteers at the Youth Olympic Village, among other things.</p>
              <p>It is unclear whether the different groups involved in the 
                  YOG - such as full-time national servicemen and volunteers - were served
                   different food, but their experiences were varied.</p>
              <p>Full-time national serviceman Leslie Wong, 20, who was 
                  stationed at the Marina Bay floating platform, said the 15 or so meals 
                  he has been given so far were similar to the one that has been 
                  criticised.</p>
              <p>He said: 'One of the meals was a dry, tasteless piece of 
                  chicken with a few slices of carrot and some soggy rice. I ended up 
                  throwing most of it away.'</p>
              <p>He said that while he had no complaints about the portions, 
                  most of his friends on duty at the same venue chose to buy their own 
                  food instead of eating the packed meals.</p>
              <p>But volunteer Siaw Jie Hao, 22, who helped with the YOG 
                  flame arrival celebrations at the National University of Singapore, said
                   the food provided was acceptable.</p>
              <p>A typical meal, he said, consisted of rice, fish and vegetables.</p>
              <p>'The meals are not fantastic, but they're satisfactory.'</p>
              <p>Other volunteers who spoke to The Straits Times said that 
                  they had no complaints about the food, which also included main courses 
                  of pasta, rice and noodles, and ice cream for dessert.<br><br><a title="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Sport/Story/STIStory_565714.html" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Sport/Story/STIStory_565714.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Sport/Story/STIStory_565714.html</a></p>

              <p>Notice the distinctions for the 2 types of meals.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>They are clearly labeledÂ "Athlete" and the other
              "Workforce".</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The sandwich labeled "Athlete" has salmon in it, for the
              "Workforce" it's only a banana. Athletes get salmon, monkeys get
              bananas.Â <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
