              <p>A SINGAPOREAN man will not escape the gallows for an armed robbery he
               committed 10 years ago in Johor, after Malaysia's highest court threw 
              out his appeal.</p>
              <p>Lim Tiong Seng, 39, was sentenced to death in 2007 after he was found
               guilty of firing his gun five times during the botched robbery bid in 
              2001. One of the bullets hit a passer-by in the back but the man 
              survived.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, the Federal Court in Malaysia upheld Lim's sentence and 
              that of his accomplice Wang Hup Huat, 51. The Malaysian had also been 
              sentenced to death in 2007 for abetting Lim.</p>
              <p>Explaining the decision of the three-man Bench, Judge Hashim Yusof 
              said the Johor Baru High Court judge had correctly found the two men 
              guilty in 2007.</p>
              <p>The duo had gone to Eng Heng Huat medical hall in Pontian on July 14, 2001 at about 5pm.</p>
              <p>Lim had asked the shopowners, two brothers, for medicine, saying he was suffering from kidney failure.</p>

              <p>Once illegal possession of a gun is capital offence. When the capital punishment was lifted for that offence, gun use increased in gold smith robberies, with shots being fired. Where there was death from guns, the defence put up was there was no intention to kill as robbery was the purpose. And so the armed robbers escaped the murder charges.</p>
              <p>That ended when the law was made that whenever a firearm is discharged during the commission of a felon, it will attract the death sentence, for the shooter, and also all in the gang who know that a gun will be used.</p>
              <p>So in a robbery when the gunman shoots at the manager, but missed and the bullet hit the wall, thats death sentence for the gang.</p>
