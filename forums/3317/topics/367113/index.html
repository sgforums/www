              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: He withstood eight days of beatings in his prison cell before he finally caved in.
              <br> <br> And it started because his three cellmates, whom he became acquainted
              with during a spell in Reformative Training Centre in 2005, took
              offence to his "bragging".
              <br> <br> On April 27 last year, the victim said he once saw "monster trucks at a fair at the Police Academy".
              <br> <br>For that, he received a kick to the head, the first in a series of
              assaults that eventually landed him in hospital for nearly two months.
              <br> <br>At the end of the ordeal, the 22-year-old, who was then serving an
              18-month stretch in Changi Prison for theft, was left with fractured
              ribs and also suffered lung infection and lacerations to his internal
              organs. <br> <br> The details of what happened to the victim behind prison walls emerged
              yesterday on the first day of a trial to determine if his assailants,
              aged 20 to 21, also subsequently sexually abused him.
              <br> <br>Iryan Abdul Karim, Muhammad Hamdan Abdul Rahman and Mohammed Zameen
              Abdul Manoff are admitting to physical assault charges, but dispute the
              claims that they forced themselves sexually on their former cellmate,
              who cannot be named following a court order.
              <br> <br> He was a willing party, the accused persons are counter-claiming.
              <br> <br>According to the victim's testimony on Monday, the sexual abuse -
              he allegedly had to perform oral sex on several occasions and was also
              sodomised - was "punishment" for his bragging.
              <br> <br> "If I didn't do it, they said they would punch me," he told the court.
              <br> <br>The beatings began about two months into his prison term, two weeks
              after Iryan began sharing the prison cell he and Zameen were in. Hamdan
              was transferred from another cell a day later.
              <br> <br>"I remember I went out to the yard with a swollen eye, but the
              guards did not notice my swollen eye ... Maybe that's because I'm
              dark-skinned," the slight and bespectacled man told the Supreme Court.
              <br> <br> "I had approached a guard to tell him I wanted to change cells after the incident but he told me 'no'."
              <br> <br>The prison guard did not want to be a "coordinator" who helped
              place gang members together, said the victim, who kept mum about the
              beatings, even from the prison pastor, as he feared his cell mates and
              because Zameen "has my address and my sister's".
              <br> <br> The victim also claimed his cellmates stole his food and limited his water intake.
              <br> <br>But during cross examination, Iryan, who represented himself, told
              the court the victim himself was a "secret society member" who was
              prone to taking on bigger men in a fight.
              <br> <br> So why didn't he fight his way out of the jam instead of offering sexual favours to his cellmates, asked Iryan.
              <br> <br>The victim, who did not dispute his associations with gangs, said:
              "I did what I did out of fear and also because I was overpowered."
              <br> <br> "So you willingly offered us (sex) in order to stop the beatings?" asked Iryan.
              <br> <br> "No," replied the victim. "I was not someone who is easily bullied because I went through too much".
              <br> <br>Still, he gave in to his cell mates' beatings because he had "no
              choice". "If I didn't do what you wanted, you guys would retaliate," he
              said.
              <br> <br> The trial continues on Tuesday. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">3 prison accused say sexual abuse charges are baseless</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>On day two of the prison sex assault trial, the three accused prisoners admitted to physically assaulting their former cellmate.</p>
              <p>But they say the sexual abuse charges against them - such as
              sodomising the victim and having him perform oral sex on them - are
              baseless because he made the offers.</p>
              <p>And though they accepted - and stopped beating him each time as the
              victim had hoped - they say his consent absolves them of any sexual
              offence.</p>
              <p>This was the line of defence that came sharply into focus as two of
              the three accused persons, who are representing themselves in court,
              cross-examined the victim.</p>
              <p>Iryan Abdul Karim, Muhammad Hamdan Abdul Rahman and Mohammed Zameen
              Abdul Manoff left the former inmate with multiple rib fractures, a lung
              infection and injuries to his liver and kidney over an eight-day period
              last year.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old, whose identity is protected by a court order,
              testified on Monday that he agreed to perform the sexual acts they
              suggested because he was afraid of further beatings.</p>
              <p>But both Iryan and Hamdan tried to portray the victim as a serial liar.</p>
              <p>Iryan, for instance, said that their former cellmate offered oral
              sex because he could not take it after a round of "Sonic Blastment",
              where the victim acts like a punching bag that awards points to each
              attacker.</p>
              <p>And Hamdan told the court that his former cellmate was concocting lies as a way of "getting revenge".</p>
              <p>But the victim refuted all these claims.</p>
              <p>The trial continues tomorrow.</p>

              <p><strong>We were beaten up before we took statements, say inmates</strong></p>
              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Another surprise was sprung in the prison sexual abuse case currently being heard in the High Court.
              <br> <br> At the end of Friday's hearing, two of the three attackers – Iryan
              Abdul Karim, 21, and Muhammad Hamdan Abdul Rahman, 20 – told Justice
              Tay Yong Kwang that they had been beaten by prison guards two days
              before their statements were taken.
              <br> <br> It is not known when the alleged beatings took place.
              <br> <br> So were the beatings related to their respective statements, asked the judge?
              <br> <br> Iryan and Hamdan did not reply.
              <br> <br>The prison guards – who took the stand on Friday to provide their
              accounts of the alleged sexual assault which took place last year –
              were, however, not given the opportunity to respond to the allegations.
              <br> <br> This is because the six officers had already stepped down from the witness stand after giving evidence.
              <br> <br>Earlier, prison guard Mr Mohamad Muhayaddin Sapari said he did not
              spot anything usual about the victim during the period in question.
              <br> <br>However, the victim, described as "talkative", had told the guard
              that he had been fighting with his cell mates, but did not make any
              mention of being forced to perform sexual acts.
              <br> <br>Another prison officer, Mr Jamalluddin Abdul Aziz, said he had
              inspected the cell on May 5 and saw no "visible injuries" on the
              22-year-old victim. He also had no "problems standing".
              <br> <br>Iryan and Hamdan, along with Mohammed Zameen Abdul Latiff, 22, have
              been charged with sexually abusing the victim over an eight-day period
              last year, resulting in multiple rib fractures, a lung infection and
              injuries to his liver and kidneys.
              <br> <br>On Thursday, prosecution witness Lutfi Subagio created a stir when
              he claimed that the victim himself had demanded oral sex from him on
              two occasions. The trial continues on Monday.

              <p>THE first of three prisoners accused of assaulting a former
              cellmate took the stand on Tuesday to give his side of the story,
              saying it was the alleged victim's penchant for boasting that sparked
              the daily beatings.</p>
              <p>Iryan Abdul Karim, 21, told the High Court that the 22-year-old accuser
              was initially punched as part of an agreement to complete five
              punishments.</p>
              <p>Later, the accuser was beaten as punishment for his clumsiness -
              he stumbled around the cell from his injuries, knocking over their
              things. He was also told to eat a cellmate's faeces for soiling himself
              and creating a mess in the cell. 'Only when he did something wrong,
              then we punched and kicked him. We didn't assault him for no reason,'
              said Iryan.</p>
              <p>Iryan was the first accused inmate to testify in his defence after
              the prosecution closed its case against the trio on Tuesday. Testifying
              in shackles, he recounted how he became angry with the accuser for
              bragging about various things, such as stabbing someone during a fight.</p>
              <p>On April 27 last year, to 'settle' the dispute, the accuser agreed
              to choose and complete five of 10 tasks dealt to him. Contrary to the
              accuser's testimony, Iryan said the tasks did not contain sex acts.</p>
              <p>One of them entailed being a human punching bag. When he could not
              take the punches, however, he offered oral sex if they would cease.
              Iryan said he was 'shocked', but he and Mohammed Zameen Abdul Manoff
              took up the offer. Iryan said they did not threaten the accuser to keep
              quiet; he was the one who told them not to tell others.</p>
              <p>The next day, Muhammad Hamdan Abdul Rahman moved into the cell and
              beat the accuser for lying about the stories they swopped in prison.
              Again, the accuser offered oral sex to stop the beatings.</p>
              <p>On May 1, out of boredom, they held the alleged victim as he sat
              down and pulled his legs apart, injuring him. And the following night,
              he was beaten for being clumsy. 'We didn't punch him that much because
              we wanted him to heal,' said Iryan. Later, however, Iryan became angry
              because the accuser soiled himself, and the three of them had to clean
              up the mess. The next morning, Iryan told Hamdan not to flush the
              toilet and told the accuser to eat the faeces - he did. Five days
              later, after being punched and kicked constantly, he was taken to a
              hospital.</p>
              <p>After his account, Iryan was cross-examined on specific issues by
              Hamdan and Zameen. Deputy Public Prosecutor S. Sellakumaran pointed out
              that the alleged victim soiled himself and had to drag himself to the
              toilet because of what the trio did to him. 'I did not know it would
              turn out so bad,' Iryan said softly.</p>
              <p>Iryan admitted it was cruel and disgusting to make someone eat
              faeces, but said the accuser did it willingly because he knew what he
              had done the night before. He also denied beating the alleged victim to
              get him to offer oral sex. The accuser was beaten because it was his
              task, he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Inmates found guilty</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Their guilt established, they apologised to the court for the severe assaults on their former cell mate.</p>
              <p>But not once did Iryan Abdul Karim, Muhammad Hamdan Abdul Rahman or
              Mohammed Zameen Abdul Manoff say sorry to the victim — throughout the
              12—day trial and on Thursday, when the 22—year—old was with his family
              to hear the court’s verdict.</p>
              <p>In the end, the prisoners’ claim
              that the victim had consented to oral sex to end the beatings was not
              recognised under the law, as it was "forced consent", said Justice Tay
              Yong Kwang, who will sentence the trio on Monday.</p>
              <p>The judge
              acquitted Iryan, however, of one charge of oral sex. Justice Tay gave
              the accused — who maintained that the victim performed oral sex on him
              only twice — the "benefit of the doubt", as the victim may have been
              confused.</p>
              <p>The court had heard harrowing details of how the
              inmates attacked the victim, causing multiple fractures in his
              breastbone, ribs and spine, and also how they made him eat faeces and
              perform oral sex on them.</p>
              <p>But evidence also painted the victim as
              a sexual aggressor toward other inmates. This, Deputy Public Prosecutor
              David Khoo told the court, should not affect the credibility of the
              victim.</p>
              <p>The latter was subjected to abuse almost on a daily basis
              between April 28 and May 3 last year and was sodomised by Zameen, his
              friend and "de facto mastermind" of the sadistic beatings, said DPP
              Khoo.</p>
              <p>Zameen, 21, maintained yesterday they "did not force"
              themselves on the victim and were not as "sadistic" as the prosecution
              suggested.</p>
              <p>But Iryan, 21, said he did not mean to hurt the former
              inmate "that badly", while Hamdan, 20, said he regretted the beatings,
              which the prosecution described as "one of the worst cases of physical
              abuse in recent years", motivated by "petty and senseless reasons".</p>
              <p>DPP S Sellakumaran said the main purpose "was to bully the victim and break his will".</p>
              <p>He
              added: "Iryan was warped enough to state during his cross examination
              that the victim was ’stupid’ and ’clumsy’ because he had dragged
              himself in his soiled shorts and had knocked about the accused persons’
              things when moving around the cell.</p>
              <p>"That he would say this after
              causing the victim to be in the condition that he was is proof positive
              they were simply finding fault in everything and anything he did."</p>
              <p>DPP
              Sellakumaran pressed for the maximum sentence — 24 strokes of the cane,
              not less than 20 years imprisonment for Iryan and Hamdan and more for
              Zameen — because of the trio’s "propensity for violence".</p>

              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>TWO prison inmates who beat up a former cellmate and made him
              perform oral sex on them were on Monday jailed for 16 years and ordered
              to be caned 16 strokes of the cane.</p>
              <p>A third, found guilty of similar charges plus an additional charge
              of sodomy, was jailed 19 years and ordered to be caned 22 strokes.</p>
              <p>The trio - Iryan Abdul Karim, 21; Muhammad Hamdan Abdul Rahman, 20;
              Mohammed Zameen Abdul Manoff, 22 - were convicted last week of
              assaulting their former cellmate in their Changi Prison cell between
              April 27 and May 4 last year.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old victim suffered multiple rib fractures and was hospitalised for two months.</p>
              <p>'The atrocities committed by them in cell 5-55 speak for
              themselves,' said Justice Tay Yong Kwang in handing down sentence on
              Monday, describing their assaults as 'both crude and cruel'.</p>
              <p>'Their actions were inhumane and repulsive. It is shocking that
              they allowed themselves to be carried away by their numerical and
              physical superiority to the extent of bullying a fellow inmate using
              such sadistic and degrading acts.'</p>
              <p>Although prosecutors had pressed for at least 20 years and 24
              strokes of the cane, Justice Tay said he had not gone so far, as he
              believed the sentences were sufficient enough to punish the trio and
              make an 'indelible mark on their consciousness on the need never to
              stray into violence or any other crime again'.</p>
              <p>Justice Tay also spent time commenting on how the trio, who
              defended themselves during the trial, were highly intelligent young men
              whose lives could have been a lot different.</p>
              <p>The judge said that he observed over the past few weeks that they
              were able to grasp legal concepts and court procedures once these were
              explained to them.</p>
              <p>He left them with the closing words: 'Please put these talents of
              yours to good use, discipline your minds and study something that
              interests you. I know you all can study because I have seen the way you

              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>THREE prisoners who tortured their cellmate for eight days by
              beating him and making him submit to sexual acts and eat faeces were on
              Monday each jailed between 16 and 19 years and ordered to be caned.</p>
              <p>The 'crude and cruel' atrocities they committed in the Changi Prison
              cell speak for themselves, High Court Judge Tay Yong Kwang said when he
              sentenced the trio on Monday. 'Their actions were inhumane and
              repulsive,' he said.</p>
              <p>Between April 27 and May 4 last year, Iryan Abdul Karim, 21,
              Muhammad Hamdan Abdul Rahman, 20, and Mohammed Zameen Abdul Manoff, 22,
              repeatedly punched, kicked and stepped on their cellmate.</p>
              <p>To stop the beatings, the 22-year-old victim offered to perform
              oral sex on them, and did so a few times. Zameen sodomised him once.
              The trio also made him eat human faeces.</p>
              <p>The victim, who cannot be named, suffered multiple rib fractures
              and was hospitalised for two months. His attackers conducted their own
              defence and admitted assaulting him, but insisted that the oral sex was
              consensual.</p>
              <p>On Monday, Justice Tay noted that the three had claimed trial to
              fight the charges not because they wanted to make the victim recount
              his traumatic ordeal, but because they wanted to dispute points of his
              allegations. The questions they posed the victim were fair and relevant
              to what they perceived to be their defence, he said.</p>
              <p>The judge noted that they admitted beating up the victim, although
              they said they were angry with his incessant lies and bragging. They
              also admitted making the victim eat faeces, but disputed his account of
              when it took place and the events that led to it.</p>
              <p>As for the oral sex charges, Justice Tay noted that the dispute
              over this arose from the three men being young and untrained in law;
              they held a 'simplistic but mistaken' understanding of the legal
              concept of consent.</p>
              <p>The only real dispute was over one of the three oral sex charges
              faced by Iryan - of which he has been acquitted - and the sodomy charge
              against Zameen - of which he was convicted.</p>
              <p>Noting their 'sad criminal records', Justice Tay said the three
              were intelligent young men whose lives could have turned out a lot
              differently. He said they should use their time in jail to do some
              serious soul-searching and to learn to curb their impulses before
              something worse happens.</p>
