              <p><strong>Malaysian state probes huge graft claims: report</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - â€“ A Malaysian state
              government is probing investigators' claims that up to 60 percent of
              infrastructure funds possibly amounting to billions of dollars have
              been siphoned off, a report said Sunday.</p>
              <p>The deputy chief
              minister of Sarawak state on the resource-rich island of Borneo, George
              Chan, said his government would look into the allegation made by the
              Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).</p>
              <p>"The state
              government is investigating. We also want the MACC to give us a full
              and detailed briefing on these claims," he told the Star newspaper,
              which said the total lost could run to "billions".</p>
              <p>"If indeed
              funds from the government meant for projects for the rakyat (people)
              and the poor had been misappropriated, the state government wants
              action taken," he was quoted as saying by the English-language paper.</p>
              <p>MACC
              deputy chief commissioner Zakaria Jaffar said Wednesday that state
              graft-busters had unearthed embezzlement after they investigated road,
              housing and building projects completed between 2002 and 2008.</p>
              <p>The
              Sarawak MACC found that "only about 40 percent of the allocations were
              spent while the remaining 60 percent is 'bocor' (leaked out)", he said,
              according to the English-language Borneo Post.</p>
              <p>Zakaria said some projects were poorly completed but others did not even materialise although they were paid for in full.</p>
              <p>"When
              we talk about development projects in the state, there are many cases
              of fake claims, whether it involves the (state) officers or the
              contractors," he added.</p>
              <p>Zakaria did not disclose the location or number of projects investigated. The MACC could not be reached for comment Sunday.</p>
