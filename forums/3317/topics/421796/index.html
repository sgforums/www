              <p>If you’re single this Chinese New Year, you’re probably not looking forward to this week’s festivities.</p>
              <p>It’s hard to enjoy that reunion feast with nosy 
              relatives relentlessly dissecting your non-existent love life and 
              wondering why you still haven’t found someone to settle down with.</p>
              <p>For some Singaporeans, enough is enough. Tired of facing the firing 
              squad of probing questions, frustrated singles are opting for an easier 
              way out.</p>
              <p>Their solution? Getting help from dating agencies, casual friends and
               even hiring social escorts to pose as romantic partners — for a day, or
               even a couple of hours.</p>
              <p>David, a 29-year-old marketing executive tells <em>My Paper </em>that
               he shuns long-term relationships and prefers to date casually. He even 
              brings his dates on Chinese New Year family visits to avoid prying 
              questions.</p>
              <p>“I just take one of them along for these events to shut my relatives 
              up. The next time I meet my relatives, I just tell them that we broke 
              up,” he said.</p>
              <p>According to three out of four escort agencies, companions increase by a whopping 30 to 50 per cent during the festive season.</p>
              <p>The owner of Singapore Model Escorts, who only wants to be known as 
              William, said, “(Our make clients’) key concern is they don’t want girls
               to wear short skirts or look sexy. They should dress conservatively.”</p>
              <p>One of his social escorts, Kari, who is in her 20s, posed as a 
              girlfriend of a working professional at his family reunion dinner last 
              year. The pair only met an hour before the gathering to corroborate 
              details like how they met and how long they had been dating.</p>
              <p>Kari, who works as a bank executive by day, said she pulled of a 
              convincing act in front of her client’s 30 relatives at a Chinese 
              restaurant.</p>
              <p>“As we both worked at a bank, we told (his relatives) that we met at 
              work,” she explained. ” They even told us that we look good together.”</p>
              <p>Kari said, “I got paid a lot just to socialise and that’s the best I could’ve asked for. The guy wasn’t too bad looking, too.”</p>
              <p>The social escort of two years got paid S$1,600 for that job.</p>
              <p>She said she has received many professional requests to meet friends and family this festive season.</p>
              <p>A representative for escort agency Vie Models said, “The booking fee 
              is higher during this time  because these escorts are mostly Chinese and
               would take on assignments only if the pay is very attractive.”</p>
              <p>While he said the agency raises its rates by roughly 25 to 50 per 
              cent per hour during this period, he declined to reveal the actual 
              figures.</p>
              <p>According to Mr Jason Lim, the owner of Metro Touch Escorts, a 
              premium Singaporean social escort is typically defined as an attractive 
              university graduate in her 20s. These escorts can earn anything from 
              S$5,000 to a staggering S$20,000 for a three-hour session at a reunion 
              dinner.</p>
              <p>“The cost depends on the girl, the location, the duration, how many 
              people she has to meet at the dinner and whether she is required to 
              drink,” he added.</p>
              <p>Dating agencies are also seeing a surge in demand at this time of the year.</p>
              <p>One dating agency, Lunch Actually, sees a 15 to 20 per cent increase 
              in demand for its services in the period leading up to Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>Ms Violet Lim, 30,  the agency’s chief executive, said, “Chinese New 
              Year is a time when they feel more pressured as they will be meeting 
              family members who will probably ask them about their marital status. 
              This makes them more open to finding out about dating opportunities and 
              platforms.”</p>
              <p>Those who are unwilling to spend or uncomfortable with the idea 
              choose to skip town just to avoid facing a grilling by relatives.</p>
              <p>Ashley, a 24-year-old public relations executive, said she even got a guy friend to pose as her boyfriend three years ago.</p>
              <p>“I don’t mind getting someone to pose as my boyfriend. I’ll probably 
              have to find someone else next time but, this year, I’m getting out of 
              town,” she said.</p>
              <p>So, will you ‘rent’ a partner for the Chinese New Year?</p>
