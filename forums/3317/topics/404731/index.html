              <p>WHILE the desire to have sex as many as 10 times a day sounds like fun to some, the urge to approach and be physically intimate with strange men is ruining a British woman's life.</p>
              <p>Ms Donna Glover, 40, describes her experience to News of the World: "When I have an episode of the illness, all I want to do is have sex. Doesn't matter where I am, who I'm with or what the consequences will be. I just have to have it.</p>
              <p>"It's an overwhelming desire I just can't control. I become a sexual predator and I have to satisfy the urge as soon as I can - and that means any man will do, even a total stranger."</p>
              <p>She said she has slept with more than 150 men despite being married for five years and having had five long-term partners.</p>
              <p>Ms Glover said she has suffered from these sexual urges since she was in her teens.</p>
              <p>It was only during a recent visit to the doctor's that she was diagnosed as having Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS), also known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. About one person in six million suffers from this illness.</p>
              <p>Besides destroying her relationships and making it difficult to hold down a job, her illness makes even buying groceries a chore.</p>
              <p>"I was in a supermarket when a bloke made eye contact. Within minutes we were in the park tearing each other's clothes off," she told News of the World.</p>
              <p>"I'd scour Internet chat rooms for men who were just after one thing. That suited me fine. We'd arrange a meeting and within an hour or two we'd be having sex - at their house, in hotels and even in cars. The location didn't matter. My only concern was my sexual need."</p>
              <p>Her desire for sex has been enjoyable for her boyfriends, but after a while it was too much for them.</p>
              <p>She added: "When I recover from an episode, I can't believe some of the things I've done. Normally I'm a shy, reserved and faithful person. But I've even tried it on with friends' husbands. Most of my family don't speak to me now."</p>
              <p>Ms Glover, who is divorced and has a child, had her symptoms - excessive sleeping, altered behaviour and hypersexuality - diagnosed as KLS.</p>
              <p>Now that she is aware of her illness, she takes steps to prevent relapses - she removes batteries from her phone, stays off the Internet and stays at home.</p>
              <p>Dr Hilary Jones, who is a health columnist for News of the World, said KLS might be due to an imbalance of brain chemicals and treatment with amphetamines and drugs like lithium sometimes helps.</p>
