              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The High Court on Friday dismissed the appeal by the 
              elderly woman who had been sentenced to one-year jail for poisoning her 
              73-year-old husband with arsenic.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Fong Quay Sim, 71, 
              poisoned Mr Chan Tin Sun by lacing his food with arsenic between 2004 
              and 2005 in their Siglap home. Her trial ended in May last year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his grounds of 
              decision, Justice Choo Han Teck said the medical evidence was clear, 
              reasonable, and undisputed. The damage to Mr Chan was caused by arsenic.<br><br>He added that Fong was the only one who had access to Mr Chan's food and had the motive to poison him. <br><br>Justice Choo also noted that Fong had also made incriminating statements in three statements over two separate occasions.<br><br>Justice
               Choo earlier noted that Fong had questioned the credibility of the 
              investigating officer who was later charged with using the police 
              force's computer system to make unauthorised database searches for his 
              own use. <br><br>Justice Choo said he disallowed the evidence regarding 
              this because it would not have had a significant influence on the 
              outcome of the appeal.<br><br>On whether the sentence was "manifestly 
              excessive", Justice Choo noted that District Judge Ng Peng Hong had 
              considered Fong's old age, deep vein thrombosis, hypertension and 
              unhappy marital life.<br><br>However, he noted that Mr Chan had suffered anaemia and liver cirrhosis from the poisoning.<br><br>Justice Choo said: "It was not a one-off incident but was planned and carried out periodically over a long period of time."<br><br>Given
               that the penalty for the offence is a jail term of up to 10 years and a
               fine, the one-year sentence was not manifestly excessive, said Justice 
              Choo.<br><br>Fong, who was in court with her son on Friday, asked for a one-month deferment of her sentence to settle divorce matters.<br><br>Justice Choo granted her request. She will start serving her sentence next month.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
