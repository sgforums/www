              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a>’s widow may never find a
              better moment to sell her late husband’s $6.78 billion of <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=AAPL:US">Apple
              Inc. (AAPL)</a> and <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=DIS:US">Walt Disney Co. (DIS)</a> stock.</p>
              <p>Under U.S. law, Jobs’s heirs may sell Apple and Disney and
              avoid $867 million in capital gains taxes. If Apple’s late co-
              founder left his estate to his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs, the
              family won’t be liable for the 35 percent estate tax until she
              dies or gives money to others, according to estate planners.</p>
              <p>“I can’t see any reason not to sell all of it,” said <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.aspiriant.com/about/team/?bio=392">Kacy
              Gott</a>, chief planning officer at the wealth-management firm
              Aspiriant, whose clients have assets of as much as $100 million.
              “They should have been looking to diversify years ago.”</p>
              <p>Jobs’s heirs should sell some stock to reduce the estate’s
              risks, said Joyce Franklin, a <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> financial planner
              who works with high-tech executives. Making sales more
              attractive: the capital gains tax is set to rise to 20 percent
              in 2013 from 15 percent now, and high-income Americans will also
              be subject to a 3.8 percent levy on unearned gains.</p>
              <p>Jobs owned 138 million Disney shares, valued yesterday at
              $4.74 billion, and 5.55 million Apple shares worth $2.05
              billion, according to filings. Proxy statements show Jobs moved
              his holdings into trusts as his health worsened. Trusts let
              people distribute wealth over time and avoid probate fees.</p>
              <p>If Jobs had sold all of his Disney and Apple on Oct. 4, the
              day before he died, he would have registered a gain of about
              $5.78 billion and a tax bill of $867 million. That’s based on
              his investment of $55 million in Pixar Studios, now part of
              Disney, and Apple shares granted in March 2003. They vested
              three years later at $64.66 each, <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://cfdocs.bbwebds.bloomberg.com:27638/servlet/CfDocument/cfdoc?id=0001104659-03-004649&amp;filesize=0&amp;autodwld=0">filings</a> show.</p>
              <h2>Disney Stake</h2>
              <p>Candace Pugatch, a spokeswoman for Laurene Powell Jobs,
              declined to comment on her tax situation or whether she plans to
              buy or sell any Apple or Disney shares.</p>
              <p>Of the two holdings, Disney would be more complicated to
              sell. The stock represents almost 12 times the average number of
              Disney shares traded each day over the past year, according to
              data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
              <p>Disney, based in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/burbank/">Burbank</a>, California, could buy some or all
              of the shares, said <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/michael-morris/">Michael Morris</a>, an analyst with Davenport &amp;
              Co. in Richmond, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/virginia/">Virginia</a>, who rates the stock “neutral.”</p>
              <p>“They have not used leverage as effectively as other media
              companies and have the capacity to take on the added debt,”
              Morris said. The company bought back $5 billion in shares in
              fiscal 2011, according to a Nov. 10 statement.</p>
              <p>The Apple holdings represent less than a third of the 17.6
              million shares traded on a daily basis, making an open market
              sale much simpler.</p>
              <h2>Legacy Investor</h2>
              <p>“She may want to maintain the link because of what the
              companies meant to her husband, but legacy is the only reason to
              hold any of it,” Gott said. “You wouldn’t go out and buy $5
              billion in Disney stock, so why should you keep it?”</p>
              <p>Jobs died on Oct. 5 at age 56 from complications of
              pancreatic cancer. His will hasn’t been made public. Jobs is
              survived by his wife and four children, Lisa, Eve, Erin and
              Reed.</p>
              <p>Under U.S. law, the trust can sell the shares and incur
              taxes only on the appreciation since Jobs’s death -- a gain of
              about $338 million. If Jobs had died in 2010, when there was no
              estate tax, his heirs would have faced the capital gains tax on
              his entire investment profit if they had sold. That provision
              lapsed in 2011 when the estate tax was reinstated.</p>
              <p>The largest holding is Jobs’s 7.4 percent Disney stake,
              shares received in 2006 when the media and theme-park company
              acquired Pixar for $7.01 billion in stock.</p>
              <h2>Animation Gamble</h2>
              <p>Jobs bought Pixar from “<a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/star-wars/">Star Wars</a>” producer <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/george-lucas/">George Lucas</a> for $5 million in 1986 and invested $50 million more in the
              computer animation company over a decade, according to a person
              with knowledge of the situation who wouldn’t speak publicly.
              When Jobs died, the Disney stake was worth $4.35 billion.</p>
              <p>Excluding dividends, that marks an 18.5 percent annual
              return through Oct. 5, based on $55 million invested at the end
              of 1986. In that span, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/warren-buffett/">Warren Buffett</a>’s <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=BRK%2FA:US">Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</a> produced a 15.4 percent average yearly gain, using historical
              prices from Global Financial Data and returns compiled by
              Bloomberg.</p>
              <p>Jobs’s cost is likely what he spent to create Pixar, said
              Janet Brewer, a Palo Alto, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/california/">California</a>, lawyer who has worked
              with estates of as much as $300 million. She has no knowledge of
              the family’s actual holdings.</p>
              <h2>‘Perfect Time’</h2>
              <p>“From a tax point of view, this is the perfect time to
              diversify,” Brewer said.</p>
              <p>Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple have
              appreciated about 33 percent annually since the stock grant
              vested in 2006. Jobs’s holdings include 120,000 shares acquired
              in August 2007 from options exercised at $5.75 each. Berkshire
              Hathaway Class A has gained 4.3 percent a year since March 2006.</p>
              <p>Three people who know Powell Jobs, who has a master’s
              degree in business administration from <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/stanford-university/">Stanford University</a>,
              don’t think she is interested in taking her husband’s seats on
              the Apple or Disney board. Disney CEO <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/robert-iger/">Robert Iger</a> joined Apple’s
              board this month.</p>
              <p>Powell Jobs’s intentions may not matter if a bank is
              managing the investments, said <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/experts/55.html">John Barcal</a>, an estate lawyer and
              associate professor at USC’s Leventhal School of Accounting who
              has worked with a trust that exceeds Jobs’s public holdings.</p>
              <p>“I don’t know if his wife is a co-trustee or if it’s a
              bank, but a bank would be duty-bound to diversify the
              holdings,” Barcal said.</p>
