              <p><strong>Affluent Singapore attracts luxury retailers in force</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Sept 11 - Luxury fashion brands are wafting into
              Singapore in droves, betting on the city-state's ambitions of becoming
              a playground for Asia's super-rich as it recovers from its worst-ever
              recession.</p>
              <p>Defying the global economic downturn, several high-end stores have
              opened, or shortly will, in the Southeast Asian financial centre, home
              to the world's highest density of millionaires and which is positioning
              itself as a centre for luxury living, with apartments with yacht berths
              and six star hotels.</p>
              <p>A string of new malls is giving Singapore's
              main shopping belt, Orchard Road, a facelift, and retailers are also
              expecting a boost from the opening of the country's first two casino
              resorts next year.</p>
              <p>"Singapore offers flagship-style stores and
              strong facades, so it is a good opportunity to present a brand in an
              important street that hasn't seen that much new luxury retailers for
              some years," said Paul Husband, managing director of Husband Retail
              Consulting and author of a book on luxury trends in Asia.</p>
              <p>Orchard
              Road, which already has over 20 malls, opened its latest offering, the
              Ion Orchard, in July with retailers such as jeweller Harry Winston and
              designer Diane von Furstenberg, as well as larger outlets for brands,
              including Louis Vuitton, that already have boutiques in the area.</p>
              <p>Visitors
              to another mall, the Mandarin Gallery which opens in October, will see
              stores from designers such as Marc Jacobs and Giorgio Armani, while its
              neighbour, Knightsbridge, will host 8 to 10 luxury tenants when it
              opens in May next year.</p>
              <p>Add to that a raft of new outlets at the
              Marina Bay Sands casino resort, opening in 2010, as well as rival
              Resorts World Sentosa, which will house almost half a football field's
              worth of luxury retail space.</p>
              <p>And it's not just Singapore. Luxury
              brands are making inroads into other countries in Asia such as Vietnam
              and India as firms look to escape a gloomy landscape in the West by
              heading East.</p>
              <p>From a retailing point of view, Singapore's got,
              and attracts, more than enough local and Asian shoppers willing to
              spend on luxury goods.</p>
              <p>Economist Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, in his latest
              book "Succeeding Like Success: The Affluent Consumers of Asia",
              predicts the number of rich households in Singapore to rise to 31,700
              or 2.5 percent of total households by 2015, with each estimated to
              spend close to $150,000 on discretionary, or non-essential, items.</p>
              <p>Singapore's is also a magnet for wealthy Malaysians, Thais and Indonesians, whose ranks are increasing.</p>
              <p>"This
              is creating a bigger mass affluent market, dominated by well-educated
              and therefore more technologically savvy and sophisticated consumers,"
              Hedrick-Wong wrote in the book.</p>
              <p>"Make no mistake however, there
              will be a lot of nouveaux riches in Southeast Asia in the next 10
              years. Like nouveaux riches elsewhere, they will be loud and they will
              be conspicuous. And they will want attention."</p>
