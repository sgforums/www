              <p><strong>MOH alerts hospitals after two women given wrong dosage of cancer drugs</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health has alerted all hospitals to
              take immediate measures to ensure safety in the use of infusion pumps
              when administering drugs. </span></p>
              <p><span>This follows a pharmaceutical error at KK Women's and Children's
              Hospital - where two cancer patients are now under observation, with
              one potentially in grave danger.
              <br> <br>Mrs L K Ng, aged 51, and Mrs Yip Poh Hung, aged 44, were given
              chemotherapy drugs via an infusion pump - but settings on the pumps
              were inaccurate, despite two pharmacists checking to ensure accuracy
              before the infusion pumps were given to the women.
              <br> <br>The ministry said it will share the findings and risk reduction
              strategies with other hospitals after KK Hospital completes its
              detailed root cause analysis.
              <br> <br>If things go wrong, Mrs Yip Poh Hung's organs could be damaged
              seriously. She is being given an antidote – Vistonuridine - specially
              flown in from the US. Although stable at the moment, she still needs to
              be observed carefully. She had consumed five days worth of cancer drugs
              in just five hours.
              <br> <br>The hospital said the antidote being given to the patient is safe
              to use, even though the drug has not been approved for general use in
              Singapore. The drug has not even been approved by the FDA in the US.
              But the hospital is citing a recent study to vouch for its safety.
              <br> <br>"They have tested this drug and out of the 17 patients, all
              actually recovered well. So that is why it is important to have this
              particular drug for our patient here," said Associate Professor Tan Kok
              Hian, director, Clinical Quality, KK Women's &amp; Children's Hospital.
              <br> <br> The hospital said her chances of full recovery are "very high".
              <br> <br>Singapore's Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which gave the last
              minute green light for the special use of the antidote in this
              instance, said: "Our regulatory framework has a system in place that
              allows HSA to consider special concession for clinicians to use
              unregistered medicinal products under exceptional medical
              circumstances, when there is no registered alternative available in
              Singapore. <br> <br> "This is to ensure that patients are not denied access to critical
              treatments in the case of unmet medical needs." The HSA added that
              there have been past approvals granted in life or death situations
              where no alternative is available in Singapore.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, the pharmacists in question have been assigned "light duties", while they assist in investigations. 
              <br> <br>Hospital officials said they have apologised to the patients and
              their families. The hospital is also waiving current medical fees for
              the next cycle of chemotherapy treatment. As for further compensation,
              the hospital said the issue has not surfaced.
              <br> <br>As a safeguard, the hospital has now decided to use only one type
              of infusion pump, so that the rate and calibration will be clearer and
              chances of error will be further diminished.
              <br> <br>"We have a variety of pumps - the default rate is set at one rate
              and another pump is set at another rate. So sometimes if you are using
              the different pumps you should know the default rate and to set it
              accordingly. Unfortunately, it is very rare, there was an error and it
              wasn't recognised," said Prof Tan.
              <br> <br>"KK is also sorry about this incident and we take full
              responsibility for this error and we would also like to say sorry to
              the patients and their families who are involved," added Prof Tan.
              <br> <br>Some patients, the hospital said, were concerned about their own
              medication after learning about the incident. However, doctors said the
              patients' fears were assuaged and they were informed that the chances
              of such errors are extremely rare.
              <br> <br> The hospital said investigations are ongoing.

              <p><strong>Patient given chemotherapy drug overdose may be discharged next week</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A cancer patient who was accidentally given an
              overdose of chemotherapy drugs may be discharged from hospital early
              next week. </span></p>
              <p><span>51-year-old Mrs L. K. Ng was given three days' worth of drugs in
              just three hours on 6 November because her infusion pump was wrongly
              calibrated.
              <br> <br>Giving an update on her condition, Associate Professor Tan Kok
              Hian, clinical director of KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said Mrs
              Ng is in a stable condition.
              <br> <br>A second patient, Mrs Yip Poh Hung, 44, is also in stable
              condition. She was given five days' worth of chemotherapy in just five
              hours.
              <br> <br>Her case is more critical because the overdose could lead to organ
              damage, but doctors have administered an antidote which they say could
              counter the toxicity of the drugs.
              <br> <br>The hospital said the two pharmacists who calibrated the infusion
              pumps are assisting with investigations. Any disciplinary action taken
              will depend on the results of the investigations.

              <p><strong>Health Minister urges hospitals to learn from recent overdose episode</strong></p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said he's touched by the generosity and
              understanding of the two cancer patients at KKH Women's and Children's
              Hospital despite being affected by a drug blunder. <br> <br> The incident happened earlier this month after two pharmacists at KKH gave the two patients an overdose of chemotherapy drugs. <br> <br> Mr Khaw who wrote on his Ministry's blog, said he's relieved one
              patient, Mrs Yip Poh Hung, is making good progress and that doctors
              expect to have her discharged soon. <br> <br> Another patient has since recovered and is able to return home. <br> <br> Mr Khaw also commended the reaction of the Yip family. <br> <br> Mrs Yip's husband had said the pharmacists who made the mistake should
              be penalised, but not to the extent of being fired or ostracised. <br> <br> Mr Yip also reminded his wife that mistakes do occur and added that there had been no malice. <br> <br> Eventually, Mrs Yip forgave the pharmacists for their error. <br> <br> Mr Khaw added that KKH and other hospitals will learn from this episode. <br> <br> Mr Khaw also said that when mistakes are made, those involved should
              readily admit them and learn from them so that they are not repeated.</p>
