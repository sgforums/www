              <p>NTUC Assistant Secretary-General Josephine Teo is once again urging
              the government to rethink its foreign workers policy in a bid to boost
              productivity.</p>
              <p>She suggested that companies that can increase their output be allocated with more foreign workers as a reward for instance.</p>
              <p>Currently, the quota is fixed according to industries.</p>
              <p>In the construction sector for example, employers can hire seven
              foreigners for every Singaporean employed, even if the productivity is
              less than desirable.</p>
              <p>"Right now, as long as you're in the same sector, you're entitled to
              the same foreign worker quota but actually maybe his company makes a
              more serious effort and somehow his productivity level is much higher
              than yours so should we find way to differentiate? If he's productive,
              it benefits his Singapore workers. Why should I limit him to the same
              extent I limit you?"</p>
              <p>Mrs Teo's call for change comes just a week after Labour Chief Lim
              Swee Say encouraged companies to boost their output even as they cut
              costs to save jobs.</p>
              <p>She feels, the steady decline in productivity in recent quarters, is
              an unintended consequence of the foreign worker policy which the
              government did not forsee when drafting the laws.</p>
              <p>Others have become more reliant on foreign labour, instead of
              thinking how they can find better ways to do the same job, for
              instance, through the Job Recreation Programme or JRP.</p>
              <p>"If indeed they can find these foreign workers who're good why
              should we stop the companies. But the fact is we talked to many people,
              the standards are also not there otherwise why do we need to do JRP? So
              we've become abit more tolerant of poorer standards. I mean you talk
              about hawker centre cleaning, we're partly culprits right? We continue
              to patronise the stalls which are dirty so who's to blame?"</p>
              <p>To improve the quality of workers, Mrs Teo suggested tapping the
              Workforce Skills Qualifications Framework to sieve out the skilled
              foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Now it's used largely to assess and acknowledge the skills of local workers.</p>
              <p>Mrs Teo was speaking at a National Day Observance ceremony today.</p>
