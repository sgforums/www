              <p>Anti-Wall Street protests escalated
              with more than 700 arrests over the weekend, thrusting the once-
              dwindling demonstrations into the national spotlight.</p>
              <p>The rallies, which began 16 days ago with a goal of
              occupying Wall Street for months, spread to cities including <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/los-angeles/">Los
              Angeles</a> and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/boston/">Boston</a>, where 25 people were arrested Sept. 30 after
              police said they refused to leave the lobby of a <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=BAC:US">Bank of America
              Corp. (BAC)</a> building. The next day, New York City police halted a
              march over the Brooklyn Bridge and took hundreds of activists
              into custody for blocking traffic. Some people arrested claimed
              officers had tricked them into leaving the pedestrian walkway.</p>
              <p>“The huge event on the Brooklyn Bridge is likely to bring
              thousands more into the movement,” said T.V. Reed, a professor
              of American studies at Washington State University who wrote
              “The Art of Protest: Culture and Activism From the Civil Rights
              Movement to the Streets of Seattle.”</p>
              <p>On placards and in chants, protesters are citing Americans’
              frustrations with a financial industry that received
              unprecedented taxpayer bailouts while damaging an economy in
              which unemployment remains above 9 percent. They aim to put Wall
              Street on the defensive, just as firms seek to shape regulations
              and influence next year’s general election.</p>
              <h2>More Cities Targeted</h2>
              <p>Protests also have been held in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>, and last
              week, about 200 people met in a Methodist church in Philadelphia
              to organize a similar event in that city, the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/philadelphia-inquirer/">Philadelphia
              Inquirer</a> reported yesterday. (For a slide show of Amy Arbus’s
              portraits of Wall Street protesters, <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/money-gallery/2011-09-19/portraits-of-peaceful-populist-rage-on-wall-street.html">click here</a>.)</p>
              <p>Demonstrators initially struggled to build momentum,
              drawing a fraction of the 20,000 participants that organizers
              such as Adbusters, a group promoting the demonstrations, aimed
              to lure to lower Manhattan for the Sept. 17 kickoff. Instead,
              about 1,000 people showed up, and by the time traders and
              bankers returned to work two days later, the crowd had dwindled
              to about 200. The number of protesters camping in Zuccotti Park
              a few blocks from the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/">New York</a> Stock Exchange fell into the
              dozens that week.</p>
              <p>On Sept. 24, a larger group of weekend protesters watched
              as a New York Police Department deputy inspector used pepper
              spray on some participants. The incident stoked public interest.</p>
              <p>Amateur videos of the episode were posted to Google Inc.’s
              YouTube. Celebrities including Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon and documentary filmmaker Michael Moore stopped by to
              voice support. The police department, facing protester
              accusations that it had acted improperly, said its <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/">Civilian
              Complaint Review Board</a> would examine the incident.</p>
              <h2>‘Cucumber Mist’</h2>
              <p>“Maybe the pepper spray was a mistake,” <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/jon-stewart/">Jon Stewart</a>, host
              of the news-satire program “The Daily Show,” joked on his Sept.
              29 broadcast. “It was a hot day. Maybe that officer was
              reaching for his canister of cooling, cucumber-mist spray and
              grabbed the pepper spray by accident.”</p>
              <p>Provoking police is part of protesters’ strategy to get
              noticed, said Michael Heaney, a political science professor at
              the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/university-of-michigan/">University of Michigan</a> in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/ann-arbor/">Ann Arbor</a> who has researched
              social movements.</p>
              <p>“The police actions give them sympathetic attention,”
              Heaney said yesterday in a telephone interview. “The protesters
              want to be pepper-sprayed, they want to be arrested,” because
              if authorities take actions that may be perceived as unjust,
              “then that helps their cause.”</p>
              <p>The arrests on the Brooklyn Bridge may have a bigger impact
              on public opinion.</p>
              <h2>Entering ‘Prime Time’</h2>
              <p>“This gets you into the prime time,” said David Meyer, a
              professor of sociology at the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/university-of-california/">University of California</a> at <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/irvine/">Irvine</a> and author of “The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in
              America.” The question activists face is “‘How do you do
              something that generates news, which doesn’t implicate you for
              being at fault?’ And I guess New York City police were really
              helpful in this regard.”</p>
              <p>Police gave “multiple warnings” and told protesters to
              remain on the bridge’s pedestrian walkway, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/paul-browne/">Paul Browne</a>, an NYPD
              spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. Some people complied,
              while others blocked traffic. Authorities issued more than 700
              summonses and tickets, he said.</p>
              <p>New York Mayor <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/michael-bloomberg/">Michael Bloomberg</a> supported the police
              department’s actions on the bridge.</p>
              <p>“The police did exactly what they are supposed to,” he told
              reporters yesterday before marching in the Pulaski Day Parade in
              midtown <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/manhattan/">Manhattan</a>. New York “is the place where you can come to
              express your views. Protesting is fine, but you don’t have the
              right to go and without a permit violate the law.”</p>
              <p>The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
              parent Bloomberg LP.</p>
              <h2>Overshadowed by Economy</h2>
              <p>The protests are part of broader theme of class warfare,
              which might help President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> in next year’s election,
              said G. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/terry-madonna/">Terry Madonna</a>, a pollster and political scientist at
              Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/pennsylvania/">Pennsylvania</a>. Still,
              Wall Street isn’t likely to supplant voters’ primary focus on
              jobs and the economy.</p>
              <p>“No doubt there is genuine concern about ‘Wall Street
              Greed,’ ” Madonna said in an e-mail. “Unless the economy turns
              around -- translation: the job picture improves, confidence in
              spending is restored, and folks think their personal finances
              will improve -- it won’t be a significant factor in the re-
              election campaign.”</p>
              <p>Another challenge facing demonstrators is their lack of a
              focused agenda, said Meyer. As events began in Manhattan,
              organizers aimed to get Obama to establish a commission to end
              “the influence money has over our representatives in
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/washington/">Washington</a>,” according to the website of Vancouver-based
              Adbusters.</p>
              <h2>‘All Different Causes’</h2>
              <p>On the ground, protesters have been less unified, with
              demands that ranged from increasing taxes on Wall Street and the
              wealthy to ending global warming.</p>
              <p>“There’s certainly a potential for starting a movement, but
              right now it’s just a series of events and a holder for all
              different causes,” Meyer said. “You have people talking about
              ending global capitalism, and that doesn’t poll well.”</p>
              <p>Yesterday afternoon, people who had been arrested the night
              before congregated again in lower Manhattan, celebrating and
              vowing to stay put. Musicians strummed guitars, beat drums and
              played a saxophone while people danced. A bare-chested singer
              painted the words “Lotion Man-Utube” on his torso and bellowed
              the words “Occupy Wall Street.” National television networks
              trolled the area, broadcasting live updates.</p>
              <p>“This is the start of something big,” said Shannon
              Deegan, a 28-year-old employee of a <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/seattle/">Seattle</a> technology company
              who said she flew to New York Sept. 30 and witnessed the bridge
              arrests. She aims to replicate the protests when she returns
              home.</p>
              <p>Though the incident on the Brooklyn Bridge was initially
              discouraging, “the arrests gave us more visibility,” she said.
              “People are watching, and they will see our cause.”</p>

              <p>so? u got to extend on the idea that marriage can turn a person into a coward (in a new topic perhaps). but the activists do include both men or female and couples can also be protesting together. marriage got nothing much to do with the protest. it's got to do with making a living, and scare of the goverment. it's also pointing to capitalism. they are other factors for cowardice, to blame it largely on marriage. anyway, sorry, i don't see much linkage.</p>
