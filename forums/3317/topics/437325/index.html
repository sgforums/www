              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports Chan Chun Sing said Singapore must constantly defend and enlarge 
              the common space for all.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He highlighted this 
              as a way to meet the challenge of a growing divide between the religious
               and non-religious, as well as a society that is becoming more diverse.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Major-General Chan 
              cited other challenges such as misunderstandings arising from 
              differences between citizens and new immigrants, and the rise of social 
              media that can "sow discord" through insensitive remarks.<br><br>He made these points at a workshop for the Inter-racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCC) on Saturday morning.<br><br>He
               also said the IRCC must groom the next generation of leaders and reach 
              out to new segments of the population, and this can be achieved through 
              social media.<br><br>MG Chan added that while Singaporeans are fortunate
               to be living in relative peace and stability, racial and religious 
              harmony should never be taken for granted.<br><br>He said: "We do not 
              have to worry about racial strife, we do not have to worry about being 
              victimised because of our race or religion. We do not also have 
              religious or racial enclaves that people from other races or faith would
               fear and tremble to walk into, as in some other countries in the world.<br><br>"For
               all these, we may be lulled into a sense of complacency, believing the 
              absence of evidence on such issues is evidence of absence. Racial and 
              religious harmony is not a noun, but a verb. A verb which says it's a 
              work in progress, something that is fragile, something that we must be 
              very careful with."<br><br>IRCC leaders and members have been helping to manage incidents with racial and religious dimensions.<br><br>One leader recalled a dispute between a Muslim and Hindu family early this year.<br><br>Taman
               Jurong IRCC chairman Muhd Faizal Othman, said: "The Muslim neighbour 
              was disputing about the incense burning but we came in and we mediated. 
              We meet with the neighbours individually first and let them tell us 
              their side (of the story). After that, we meet the other neighbour and 
              let them tell us the whole story. Then only we discuss with our members 
              and then we get the two neighbours to come together and they themselves 
              propose what they can do.<br><br>"The proposal was that the Hindu family
               would only burn the incense inside their house because the complaint 
              was that the burning went into the Muslim's house. They offered the 
              solution and the Muslim family accepted it."<br><br>A guidebook was also
               launched at the workshop to serve as a reference for members on their 
              roles and responsibilities, as well as the process of crisis management.<br><br>Cases
               of possible inter-faith clashes and the suggested responses - which 
              includes working with the government and calming the population - are 
              listed inside the guidebook.<br><br>-CNA/ac/fa</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Racial and religious harmony - look into the blood, you cant find another color besides red. Animals blood also red. Incense burning, is expressing heartfelt glory, the almighty will not because of more burning will like u more. Otherwise, everyone will join in to burn as much. Too much may cause enviromental problem - stuck yr nose there a min for an instantaneous impact.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>STOMPer Jean, who came across the postings online, was enraged by the foreigner's comments.<br><br>She wrote to STOMP:<br><br>"I chanced upon some outrageous comments made by Ms Rachelle Ann Beguia who is one of the many netizens who commented on Ms Penny Low's Facebook.<br><br>"The discussion took off when MP Ms Low was apologising for being caught using her iPhone when the National Anthem was being played at the recent NDP. In the midst of heated discussion, Ms Beguia made a few insulting and hurtful remarks about Singaporeans.<br><br>"She said: 'These moronic 'Singaporeans', their code, their morals, their 'loyalty' and 'patriotism'... all dropped at the first sign of trouble... just ask any of them if they want to be excused from serving NS and they will be the first to raise their hands... Require any of them to serve an extra month of NS and they will riot in Singapore... Ask them to fight a war, almost all will declare they are ready to pack up and run.'<br><br>"Is she trying to say all our NSMEN are cowards? On what grounds was she making such accusations?<br><br>"She further explained the followings to one of the Facebook users: 'But when foreigners like Bangladeshi, Thais and Indians come and provide labour for building flats and roads, you didn't seem to have complained about it...if tomorrow the government decides to hire foreigners to become soldiers and no more serving of NS for all men let's see if you will make the same comment...By the way, if foreigners can come and snatch your jobs and flats it only shows one thing.... how incompetent you are.'<br><br>"I strongly believe she owes Singaporeans and our NSMEN an apology. She insults our soldiers, their commitment to the nation and the lives lost for the safe protection of her and her family to grow up in Singapore.<br><br>"These insults are totally uncalled for."<br></p></div>

              <p>She has been named sacred prostitute, devadasi, temple dancer, hierodule. ... Likewise, Kwan Yin is Lady of Infinite mercy and Most compassionate One and is ...</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The first reason would be the stories about her unique beginnings.<span> </span> One states that she began life as a male who later became a female, she is sometime shown as half male and half female and she is also shown as a female. Another story that states that the worship of Kuan-Yin is older than Buddhism and that she is the original Earth Mother and the original Triple Goddess.<span>  </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The second reason is the correlation between this last information and the information that came up in my research on Hecate my Patroness Goddess.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>        </span> She is the Goddess that you can reach out to when you need to learn how to give yourself and others unconditional love, compassion, and forgiveness and healing.<span> </span> If you ask for her help she will never turn you away.</span></span></p>
