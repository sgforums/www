              <p><strong>Obama to world: Don't expect America to fix it all</strong></p>
              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>UNITED NATIONS – <span id="lw_1253753436_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">President Barack Obama</span> challenged world leaders Wednesday to shoulder more of the globe's
              critical burdens, promising a newly cooperative partner in America but
              sternly warning they can no longer castigate the U.S. as a go-it-alone
              bully while still demanding it cure all ills.</p>
              <p>"Those
              who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now
              stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone,"
              said Obama in put-up-or-shut-up comments before a packed <span id="lw_1253753436_1" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">U.N. General Assembly hall</span>. "Now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges."</p>
              <p>In
              his first appearance before the group, Obama promised the U.S. would
              reach out in "a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and
              mutual respect," but he also wagged a rhetorical finger at leaders who
              spend much of their time at international gatherings excoriating the
              U.S. He said "an almost reflexive anti-Americanism" that swept the
              globe under the administration of his predecessor, <span id="lw_1253753436_2" class="yshortcuts">George W. Bush</span>, is not "an excuse for collective inaction."</p>
              <p>"Nothing
              is easier than blaming others for our troubles and absolving ourselves
              of responsibility for our choices and our actions," he said.</p>
              <p>And yet, directly following Obama at the podium was Libyan leader <span id="lw_1253753436_3" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Moammar Gadhafi</span>, who railed against the <span id="lw_1253753436_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">U.N. Security Council</span>,
              which includes the U.S., calling it a "terror council" and accusing it
              of treating smaller nations as "second class, despised."</p>
              <p>U.S. presidents — Bush included — have come to the <span id="lw_1253753436_5" class="yshortcuts">United Nations year</span> after year with a wish list of action items and preaching the gospel of
              working together. The U.S. is rich and powerful, but cannot solve
              problems without help, they say, whether Democrat or Republican.</p>
              <p>So Obama's message was not new.</p>
              <p>But it was delivered in an unmistakably new, more humble tone.</p>
              <p>Following
              a president criticized for making my-way-or-the-highway "requests" of
              allies, Obama didn't demand so much as he chided and cajoled. It's now
              an inextricably interconnected world, he said, so that each country's
              problems become the others'.</p>
              <p>"In the year 2009 — more than at any point in human history — the interests of nations and peoples are shared," Obama said.</p>
              <p>Following a president pilloried for arrogance, Obama talked more modestly about the United States.</p>
              <p>To
              be sure, he listed American contributions. But this was no
              chest-thumping bragging; instead it was a more lawyerly argument aimed
              at convincing the jury of Obama's world peers that the U.S. has heard
              the complaints and, under his leadership, is addressing them. That
              ranges from banning torture to winding down the Iraq war, working to
              rid the world of nuclear weapons, aggressively pursuing Mideast peace
              and bringing new energy to the battle against <span id="lw_1253753436_6" class="yshortcuts">climate change</span>.</p>
              <p>And he delivered the message that America will not behave as if it is better.</p>
              <p>"No
              one nation can or should try to dominate another nation," Obama said.
              "That is the future America wants — a future of peace and prosperity
              that we can only reach if we recognize that all nations have rights,
              but all nations have responsibilities as well."</p>
              <p>At
              home, it remains to be seen whether Obama's critics on the right will
              see this sort of talk as giving away some of America's accepted status
              as the globe's lone superpower.</p>
              <p>Many were
              already criticizing Obama along these lines after previous speeches
              meant to reach out a conciliatory hand — such as during his
              inauguration or in Cairo to the <span id="lw_1253753436_7" class="yshortcuts">Muslim world</span>. As <span id="lw_1253753436_8" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">John Bolton</span>,
              a U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under Bush, said before Obama's trip:
              "Why should we not expect a visible demonstration of Obamamania at the
              U.N.? He is giving them pretty much what they ask for."</p>
              <p>The
              president's reception in the traditionally staid U.N. hall was hardly
              Obamamania. But he received several rounds of applause, something
              rarely afforded to Bush. <span id="lw_1253753436_9" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</span>, perhaps Obama's chief foe in the room who was delivering his own address later, listened intently but did not clap.</p>
              <p>Even
              while offering new cooperation from Washington, Obama was blunt that
              others must step up or face dire consequences: "extremists sowing
              terror in pockets of the world, protracted conflicts that grind on and
              on, genocide, mass atrocities, more <span id="lw_1253753436_10" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">nations with nuclear weapons</span>, melting ice caps and ravaged populations, persistent poverty and pandemic disease."</p>
              <p>At the top of Obama's urgent challenges are the nuclear programs of <span id="lw_1253753436_11" class="yshortcuts">North Korea</span> and <span id="lw_1253753436_12" class="yshortcuts">Iran</span>, the first having already produced several <span id="lw_1253753436_13" class="yshortcuts">atomic bombs</span>,
              the second suspected of moving rapidly in that direction and both in
              defiance of repeated international demands. He said the two nations
              "must be held accountable" if they continue, without mentioning the
              tougher sanctions that are his preferred penalties.</p>
              <p>"The world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise," Obama said.</p>
              <p>The president was particularly muscular on the need to tackle <span id="lw_1253753436_14" class="yshortcuts">global warming</span>,
              declaring that America's days of dragging its feet on the issue are
              over. "If we continue down our current course, every member of this
              assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders," he said.</p>
              <p>And, seeking to build on his three-way meeting in New York on
              Tuesday with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, Obama urged nations
              aligned with either side to abandon old divides — by speaking honestly
              to the Israelis about the Palestinians' legitimate claims to land and
              livelihood and to Palestinians and <span id="lw_1253753436_15" class="yshortcuts">Arab nations</span> about Israel's right to exist.</p>
              <p>"All of us must decide whether we are serious about peace, or whether we only lend it lip service," Obama said.</p>
              <p>He said that all leaders will be held accountable by their citizens.
              "They will not long tolerate those who are on the wrong side of
              history," he said.</p>
              <p>And yet the problems he said require action are enormously
              complex and have bedeviled the world for decades. Also, when national
              interests collide with global priorities, leaders almost always choose
              the former, or pay a steep price politically. Obama himself said, "I
              will never apologize for" acting in America's interests.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the president saw two tests of this firsthand on
              Wednesday, as his U.N. speech was bracketed by meetings with the
              leaders of <span id="lw_1253753436_16" class="yshortcuts">Japan</span> and <span id="lw_1253753436_17" class="yshortcuts">Russia</span>.</p>
              <p>Talks with <span id="lw_1253753436_18" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Russian President Dmitry Medvedev</span> focused almost entirely on <span id="lw_1253753436_19" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Iran</span>,
              with Obama seeking support for tougher U.N. action if multilateral
              talks with Tehran next month yield unsatisfying progress. Russia, which
              has strong <span id="lw_1253753436_20" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">economic ties</span> with Iran, has stood in the way of such stronger action in the past.</p>
              <p>Emerging from the talks at Obama's hotel, Medvedev gave at least some
              ground, saying sanctions are usually unproductive but opening the door
              to more nonetheless. "In some cases, sanctions are inevitable," the
              Russian leader said.</p>
              <p>The White House was thrilled at even this muted support, and
              said that Obama's decision last week to scrap a plan for a new U.S. <span id="lw_1253753436_21" class="yshortcuts">missile defense shield</span> in Eastern Europe that deeply angered the <span id="lw_1253753436_22" class="yshortcuts">Kremlin</span>,
              while not designed to increase cooperation from Russia, may well have
              made it more possible. "The notion that we needed to do what we did as
              a concession for Russia never came up," said Obama Russia adviser Mike
              McFaul. "But is it the case that it changes the climate — I think
              that's true, of course."</p>
              <p>Japan, meanwhile, just elected a leader who campaigned on
              shifting its diplomatic stance to one less centered on Washington. In
              public remarks, Obama and <span id="lw_1253753436_23" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama</span> reaffirmed the importance of the traditional U.S.-Japan alliance.</p>
