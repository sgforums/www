              <p><strong>Fertility doctor on brink of cloning human: report</strong></p>
              <p class="first">LONDON (AFP) - - A US-based fertility doctor claimed
              to have cloned 14 human embryos and transferred 11 of them into the
              wombs of four women in an interview published on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Panayiotis Zavos told Britain's Independent newspaper that although
              none of the women had had a viable pregnancy as a result, the first
              cloned baby could now be born within a couple of years.</p>
              <p>"There is
              absolutely no doubt about it... the cloned child is coming. There is
              absolutely no way that it will not happen," he said, quoted by the
              paper.</p>
              <p>"If we intensify our efforts, we can have a cloned baby
              within a year or two, but I don't know whether we can intensify our
              efforts to that extent."</p>
              <p>Zavos's work is widely condemned by
              mainstream fertility experts, who question whether the technique, which
              also raises complex ethical questions, is safe.</p>
              <p>Although other
              scientists have created human cloned embryos in test tubes to extract
              stem cells for research, Zavos has broken a taboo by actually putting
              them inside women's wombs.</p>
              <p>He said he has also produced cloned
              embryos of three dead people, including a 10-year-old girl called Cady
              who died in a car crash in the US. The child's blood cells were frozen
              and sent to Zavos.</p>
              <p>The doctor, a naturalised US citizen born in
              Cyprus, is thought to have carried out the procedures in a secret
              laboratory somewhere in the Middle East to escape the US ban on cloning.</p>
              <p>He uses the same technique as was used to clone Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.</p>
              <p>The procedures were recorded by a documentary maker and will be shown on the Discovery Channel in Britain later Wednesday.</p>
              <p>In
              2004, Zavos claimed to have implanted the first human cloned embryo
              into a woman's uterus although scientists then expressed scepticism
              over a lack of proof about his findings.</p>
