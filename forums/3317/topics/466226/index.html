              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore does not have to sacrifice green spaces to 
              be a beautiful and sustainable city, said Environment and Water 
              Resources Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He added Singapore can become a role model for the world to achieve this.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Dr Balakrishnan was 
              speaking to the media during his visit to the Bukit Timah Market and 
              Food Centre on Sunday morning to unveil a new lift for the centre.<br><br>He said high density living is the most sustainable and green way of life on the planet and which Singapore can take the lead.<br><br>He
               said: "The most amazing thing about Singapore is that almost half of 
              our land is covered in green. But equally, you realise that this has 
              been achieved because we have been able to go high-rise. Because so many
               of us live in apartments, and that also give the fantastic landscape, 
              cityscape of Singapore and the bright lights at night.<br><br>"So the 
              point I'm making is we have to stop thinking in terms of zero-sum games,
               that I can only have this or that and not go, but to actually exercise 
              imagination and to make it even better."<br><br>On Sunday morning, Dr 
              Balakrishnan, who is the adviser to the Bukit Timah Grassroots 
              Organisations and the area's MP Sim Ann unveiled a new lift for the 
              centre, which they hope will provide easy access for customers and stall
               holders with heavy goods.<br><br>Ms Ann said: "We do have a number of 
              elderly residents and it is a mature estate and I think for them to 
              climb up and down the stairs especially after having done their shopping
               is not very convenient. Some of them have also told me it is quite 
              painful to do that, so I think with the lift, it improves the 
              situation."<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said the government has improved this
               food centre over the years based on feedback from patrons and stall 
              holders and will continue to do so.<br><br>He added that Singapore will need many more of such places with an authentic identity of its own.<br><br>Dr
               Balakrishnan said hawker centres can be cosy and unique places within 
              the high density urban environment Singapore is moving towards.<br><br>His
               vision of the city, he said, is to make most things, including school, 
              eating places and work, within a walking range of up to 400 or 500 
              metres.<br><br>On the negative reactions from some Singaporeans towards 
              the Population White Paper, Dr Balakrishnan said the high level of 
              emotions is a good thing as it shows Singaporeans care deeply about the 
              country.<br><br>He said: "Well, actually part of me is actually quite 
              glad because it shows that the people loves Singapore, people care 
              deeply about the future, care deeply about what happens to our identity 
              our children our livelihood and to our senior citizens. So the level of 
              emotions to me is a good thing. I would be far more worried if people 
              say I don't care, so let's recognise and give credit to Singaporeans for
               that. That we all care and care very deeply."<br><br>He added: "At the 
              end of the day, the government has to do the right thing for the long 
              term good of our people but has to convince our people. If we cannot 
              convince people, then these plans will not work." <br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>its true about about land fill reclaimation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the last time we reclaim land, if there is erosion thy should have gathered all teh necessarily evidences, readings taken and recods. if their problem is real this are things logical country gahmen will do, so that in future if same thigg happen then if they need to go international caourt to stop us they then can do so peacefully.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now see we country small can bully issit?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if we propose landfill again go international court lah. for survival and to suck the white paper balls on real population increase that we also need to increase land by reclaimaiotn within or own backyard why cannot?</p>
