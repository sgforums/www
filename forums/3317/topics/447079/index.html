              <p>I thought assault carries a caning sentence as well?Then how come the Aussie was not whipped in the buttocks?Why were their passports returned to them in spite that they have committed an offense?</p>

              <p>Ya,I read that they injured some of the locals too.That's another charge right?What do you think would happen if the accused were locals?</p>
              <p>The Kiwi's old man already said that he has no plans to return here...Had not heard from the Briton yet.</p>

              <p>Ya,even a 3 year old kid also know that if a guy had committed a crime,you impound his passport and keep him from leaving the country so that he can face his punishment here.Now the egg is on the faces of those who authorised the releasing of the passports of the Kiwi and the Briton.</p>

              <p>Would you be tempted by a compensation offer of S$20,000 if the guy who beat you up ran away? <br><br>That
               was how much New Zealander Robert Stephen Dahlberg, 35, offered to Paul
               Louis Liew, 27, the victim from the Suntec City brawl in April 2010, 
              reported The New Paper.<br><br>However,
               Liew, a second-year law student studying in Australia decided that 
              taking the money would not be acceptable, especially if it would affect 
              the judicial process, the same paper wrote.<br><br>Dahlberg, an options broker, had allegedly assaulted Liew on 11 April 2010. TNP reported that Liew, who is now suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,
               fractured his nasal bone and suffered a 4cm-long cut on his forehead as
               a result of the incident. He was also the most seriously-injured of the
               four victims in the attack.<br><br>Dahlberg went on bail for S$25,000 
              in July last year for trips to London and Hong Kong. However, the Kiwi 
              did not return and on 12 September, a warrant of arrest was issued. He's
               now on Interpol's wanted persons list.<br><br>The police, who were the ones who notified Liew of Dahlberg's compensation offer on 6 March, could not be reached for comment.</p>
