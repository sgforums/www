              <p>the pt i am bringing across is this: often the actual situation could be like the one i cited...however, cos we often only noe one side of the story, we end up wif a judgement that may not be fair to both parties...if the judge jail the gal, then isnt he sending across the msg that women shld allow themselves to be raped and dun defend themselves lest they end up killing the guy and get jailed, tarnishing their clean record? if the judge acquit the gal, isnt he sending the msg across that its ok to kill out of self-defence?</p>
              <p>we are all imperfect human beings...even the alw is imperfect as its laid down by imperfect humans...in classic cases like the one i cited, there can be no absolute fairness..somebody has to take the blame which sadly i believe will be the gal who will probably be jailed for a short term for manslaughter...however, looking from the gal's perspective, is it fair for her to be jailed???</p>

              <p><br>Self-defence is a form of justifiable homicide not amounting to manslaughter or murder. In other words, the girl in your hypothesis will walk free.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>our education system probably got flaw. i even begin to feel it. coz i cannot do jobs that a foreign talent can do. where they come from? where they from i bet they have a better education system than me. but sadly its a trend for the middle income and tiertary educated sgreans. they jobs usually are not filled by their equally educated foreign talents, but rather these 'talents' that replaces us are usually of higher education, but drawing a lesser pay. - to support their cheaper better faster motto. now is this fair for sgreans? against an opponent for the same level of job if gahmen allows them with higher education, but drawing cheaper pay to come here then we are all analled screwed!</p></div>

              <p><br>Well..... in some countries, you can literally get away with shooting an unarmed person if he trespasses on your property. But that's the law. The bigger question is, "What would you be willing to do if someone is about to hurt and kill your family"?</p>
              <p>Anyway, we're completely off topic on this thread. The situation here might have more to do with provokation and possibly the state of education today.</p>
