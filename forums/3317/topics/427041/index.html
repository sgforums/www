              <p>Kuala Lumpur, Apr 4 (ANI): A woman in <span id="lw_1301899451_0" class="yshortcuts">Taiwan</span> has revealed that she had to pay her husband about RM 10,000 to have sex with her.</p>
              <p>According to the Nanyang Siang Pau, the woman, who is demanding a 
              divorce from her husband, revealed to the municipal council in Taiwan 
              that he had sex with her only three times in the last 10 years.</p>
              <p>The woman, who brought along her 10-year-old daughter to the council,
               claimed that she paid to have sex with her husband on the third time, 
              as she wanted to have a son.</p>
              <p>"Not only does he not play his role as a husband, he also does not 
              give us a monthly allowance. I have to support the family," the Star 
              Online quoted the woman, who sells bean curd to support her family, as 
              saying.</p>
              <p>She said she wanted a divorce as she could not live with her husband 
              anymore but he insisted she wait until their daughter turned 18.</p>
              <p>"So I had to resort to this method to force him to divorce me," she added.</p>
