              <h1 class="headline">CHIJMES 'Chapel Party' organisers apologise to Archbishop</h1>
              <p>The organisers of the now-cancelled "Escape Chapel Party" apologised in 
              person on Wednesday to Archbishop Nicholas Chia for offending members of
               the Catholic community with its event.<br><br>In a statement sent to 
              the media on Wednesday afternoon, the company, Creative Insurgence, said
               its representatives were granted an audience with the Archbishop, who 
              leads the Catholic church here, to apologise for their actions.<br><br>"We've
               used this opportunity to express how deeply remorseful we are for all 
              the upset we've caused to the Catholic community in the days leading up 
              to their most holy of weekends," said its director Aaghir Yadav. "We 
              never intended to offend or mock the Catholic faith and chapel - and are
               very sorry for the poor judgement we've displayed in our marketing 
              decisions," he added.<br><br>In a letter of apology submitted to the Archbishop, Yadav added that they "understand the hurt our actions have caused".<br><br>After
               the venue, timing and promotional material for the party sparked 
              adverse response from several Catholics and other Singaporeans online 
              earlier this week, alongside a statement from Archbishop Chia calling 
              for its cancellation, the company managing CHIJMES, Perennial Retail 
              Management, intervened on Tuesday to call the party off.<br><br>In a 
              meeting held between the management and Creative Insurgence on Tuesday 
              evening, the organisers were warned to cancel the party or legal action 
              would be taken.<br><br>Creative Insurgence later posted a statement on 
              its Facebook wall, which said, "It has come to our attention that 
              Perennial (Singapore) Retail Management Pte Ltd, the landlords for 
              Chijmes has intervened to immediately stop the event planned for 
              Saturday."<br><br>"Therefore, despite our best intentions to move 
              forward - after having apologised for unintentionally offending the 
              Catholic community - and to carry on with an event that aimed to 
              showcase the sounds of one of UK's most popular recording labels and 
              super-clubs, we will have to cancel the event."<br><br>"We would like to
               reiterate that we used no religious symbolism in any of our marketing 
              and promotional materials and had no intention to cause any upset."<br><br>Publicity for the event commenced last week, and a description on its Facebook event page and website marketed the party as a “sacrilegious night of partying”.<br><br>The
               event was also headlined with a picture of a model dressed in a nun’s 
              habit and a party dress, alongside other pictures of girls dressed in 
              similar habits ending in short skirts. The pictures were captioned “A 
              sneak peak [sic] at what some of our girls will be wearing on the 7th of
               April”. The publicity photos were removed and the event page was 
              deleted by Wednesday morning.<br><br>Catholics who spoke to <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> said they found the pictures of the girls in nuns’ costumes offensive 
              and in bad taste, with several filing reports with the police and 
              various ministries, including the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports as well as the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts.<br><br>Law
               undergraduate Jean Seah was among the first to submit a report to the 
              police and the MHA. In the complaint she submitted, she said she was 
              “appalled and deeply disappointed” at the existence of the event.<br><br>She
               explained that the event not only insulted the church’s religious 
              orders with its provocative nun costumes, it also made a mockery of the 
              venue it would be located at — the CHIJMES chapel is located across the 
              road from the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic church where Singapore’s archbishop, Nicholas Chia, is based.<br><br>She also said that the 7th of April happens to fall on the eve of Easter Sunday, the most important event on the Catholic church’s calendar, which adds further insult to injury.<br><br>“What
               really gets my goat is them trying to profiteer off making something 
              sacred into something so offensive and crass,” she said. “Freedom to 
              hold a function in such a sacred place comes with the responsibility of 
              using it with respect,” she added.</p>
              <p>24-year-old Nicole James, a consultant, added she spotted girls walking 
              around Raffles Place in similar costumes over lunchtime last Friday, 
              presumably to promote the event.<br><br>“I was shocked and offended that they were allowed to walk around in such an offensive costume,” she said. <br><br>Political science student Benedict Chen noted that no action was taken after a previous incident occurred in Filter Members’ Club, where the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) logo was associated with “one night stands”, alongside that of the Anglo-Chinese School.<br><br>“I
               feel it is getting out of hand because it seems like people look at 
              Christianity as a fair target,” he said. “If the government doesn’t take
               action on these people, it will seem as though Roman Catholicism is not
               being protected by the law.”<br><br>When contacted by <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>, Archbishop Nicholas Chia, who heads the Catholic church in Singapore, called for the organisers to cancel the event entirely.<br><br>“Such an event is scandalous to the Church, and should not be held in the chapel,” he said.<br><br>Chia
               added that the organisers, Creative Insurgence, have apologised to the 
              archdiocese for “upsetting” the Catholic community, however, and later 
              removed the promotional material — which consisted of the pictures of 
              girls in nun costumes, as well as its description of the event as 
              “sacrilegious”.<br><br>Responding to <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>’s queries
               on Monday, director at Creative Insurgence Aaghir Yadav said the party 
              was actually intended to occur earlier this year, over the Chinese New 
              Year weekend, but was postponed to the next public holiday weekend, 
              which happened to be Good Friday.<br><br>“The overlap with Easter 
              weekend was not intended to be offensive. We have since been in touch 
              with the Archbishop’s office to explain our position and have apologised
               for offending anyone unintentionally,” he said.<br><br>He added the 
              main concept of the party was to help UK-based club brand Escape gauge 
              the viability of setting up a franchise club here.<br><br>He also 
              maintained that the party has no theme, but is instead focused on the 
              music of the Welsh label, saying that the fact that it would be held in a
               chapel led them to follow the theme in some of its promotional 
              material.<br><br>“We would like to clarify that the images contained no 
              religious symbolism,” Yadav added, saying he realised that his image of 
              two of his friends in nun-inspired Cosplay costumes had “unintentionally
               upset some people”, hence the decision to remove it.<br><br>“This also 
              applied to teasers that said nuns will be at the party — we meant the 
              secularised, costume version that contains no religious symbolism. 
              However, in light of these sensitivities we will not be doing this as 
              well,” he said.<br><br>Yadav reiterated that the agency’s actions were 
              “certainly not intended to be offensive”, also saying that they will no 
              longer be having “costumed nuns” at their party, and will be advising 
              its attendees to avoid dressing up in religious-themed costumes as well.<br><br><strong>Seditious act?</strong><br><br>As police investigate the details of the agency’s publicity material, which some Catholics said have violated Singapore’s Sedition Act,
               assistant law professor Jack Lee said there does seem to be legitimacy 
              to their claim, although noting that the tendency of people to make 
              police reports over such matters is “not a healthy trend”.<br><br>“The 
              advertisement technically falls within the definition of uttering 
              seditious words or publishing a seditious publication since a seditious 
              tendency is defined as one that ‘raise[s] discontent… among the citizens
               of Singapore or the residents in Singapore’,” he said, adding that once
               it is proven that the material in question has a seditious tendency, 
              the intention behind its creation, whether deliberate or careless, is no
               longer relevant.<br><br>However, he said the measures taken by the 
              agency should be a sufficient response to expressed public sentiment, as
               their actions seemed more to be done in thoughtlessness rather than to 
              have calculated intent to insult the Catholic or wider Christian 
              community here.<br><br>“People have already expressed their unhappiness 
              with the advertisement online and the organisers have apologised, so it 
              doesn’t seem necessary for this issue to be blown out of proportion,” he
               said.</p>
              <p>Others also called for calm following the backlash that ensued online, 
              saying that the agency has already responded to the complaints from 
              members of the public.<br><br>21-year-old Kevin Chan acknowledged such 
              an event would compromise Singaporeans’ freedom, but pointed out that 
              the authorities “have intervened early enough”.<br><br>“Clearly, this 
              was just a moment of folly on the part of the organisers, and since the 
              necessary action has been taken, and the organisers know their 
              boundaries, there isn’t much need to pursue the matter any further,” he 
              said. “We as Catholics are taught to forgive, aren’t we? Let’s let the 
              matter rest.”<br><br>A 57-year-old Catholic teacher, who declined to be 
              named, also pointed out that the CHIJMES chapel had already previously 
              been de-consecrated, and so other secular events could appropriately be 
              held there.<br><br>She disagreed with the agency’s promotional strategy,
               saying, “I don’t think people who use CHIJMES for secular events should
               make references to what the chapel was used for.”<br><br>The former 
              student at CHIJ Victoria Street added that this was likely a lesson 
              learnt for the event’s organisers, noting also the need for people to be
               more tolerant to such situations.<br><br>“I think we need to be more 
              understanding as a multi-religious society. Some people make mistakes, 
              but as long as they show that they have reacted to adverse criticism, 
              then it’s okay with me,” she said.<br><br>Non-Catholic Singaporeans whom <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> spoke to reflected divided opinions on the issue as well, with some 
              agreeing with the Catholics who were offended, and others saying that 
              the party should go on.<br><br>"I think it's insulting, and the theme 
              should be changed clearly, or the event cancelled altogether," said 
              25-year-old Sufiyan Sulaiman, a final-year university student. <br><br>Free-thinker
               Cheong Wei Ming acknowledged the tactlessness behind the organisers' 
              initial conceptualisation of the event, but lauded their remedial 
              actions.<br><br>"It was well-meaning of them to apologise as promptly as
               they did, and we should allow the event to go on with their proposed 
              remedies," he said.</p>
