              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A seven-year-old girl who was removed from the care of
              her mother has been returned for the time being to her parents after
              the case went from the Juvenile Court to the High Court.
              <br> <br> Her father had previously been described by the court as a "missing parent" and his wife as "difficult" and "unreasonable".
              <br> <br>But the couple, who cannot be named to protect the child's
              identity, filed an appeal in their legal tussle against Child
              Protection Services (CPS) - resulting in a consensual arrangement
              between all parties on Monday, said presiding Judge of Appeal V K
              Rajah.
              <br> <br> The parents will now work with CPS to ensure the child's welfare and needs are attended to.
              <br> <br> The case came before the courts in August, when CPS raised concerns over the psychological impact of the wife's parenting.
              <br> <br>From 2005 to 2006, the child changed schools four times; school
              authorities found it difficult to deal with the mother, who was
              reportedly demanding and harassed them.
              <br> <br>The mother also made the girl wear diapers till Primary 2. When she
              was in pre-school, the mother reportedly disallowed teachers from
              changing her soiled diapers.
              <br> <br>The Juvenile Court ordered the child to be placed in The Salvation
              Army Gracehaven for three months so that CPS could assess her
              development, away from the interference of her mother.
              <br> <br>The mother, a university graduate, was clearly aggrieved by the
              court's interim order. "If you're not happy with me, lock me up. Why
              lock up my child?" she said in court yesterday.
              <br> <br>On the diaper issue, she retorted: "Who's this great philosopher
              who says you're toilet trained from three to four years, or five to six
              years?"
              <br> <br> The 40-year-old said her child was toilet-trained and was wearing pull-up pants which looked like underwear.
              <br> <br>The father, a diploma-holder, argued there were no records of any
              abuse on the child, and that there was nothing to suggest she was in
              imminent danger.
              <br> <br>The 42-year-old related the family's financial difficulties. After
              losing his job in 2002, he moved out of their matrimonial home to get
              help from his mother, but denied that his marriage was breaking down.
              <br> <br>State Counsel Chung Yoon Joo argued, however, that the father was
              known to the child as "Uncle". The child also did not know she had an
              elder sister who was placed under her grandparents' care five years ago
              after she showed up in school with a black eye.
              <br> <br>The father, now a production team operator, is back with his
              family. He said: "I believe I have taken responsibility (for the child)
              and will continue doing so."
              <br> <br> Justice Rajah assured the couple that all parties in yesterday's hearing "wanted the best for the child".
              <br> <br>"The removal of the child from the parents is a very drastic remedy
              that should be resorted to only when there's a real fear of imminent
              physical and psychological danger," he said. All parties should work
              together on the issue, he added.
              <br> <br>The appeal adjourned to the Judge's chambers after being heard in
              open court for 90 minutes. After more than two hours of closed-door
              discussions, Justice Rajah said the parties had "consensually arrived
              at an arrangement".
              <br> <br>He did not disclose details of his orders, but said the parents
              will work with CPS now that they have their daughter back. Another
              review will be conducted in two months.
