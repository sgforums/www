              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Peter Ho: Although small, Singapore can shape its future</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore may be small but with new technology, it can shape a future that transcends its physical size and enlarges its identity, the former head of the civil service, Mr Peter Ho, said on Thursday (May 17).<br><br>Citing three countries that have re-invented themselves in the digital age, he urged Singaporeans to balance their prevailing attitude that Singapore is a price-taker with a more hopeful view.<br><br>He made the call in his last lecture as the Institute of Policy Studies' S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore, a series of lectures that explores Singapore's future.</p>
              <p>For instance, Estonia, with 1.3 million people, introduced e-residency.</p>
              <p>It now has 18,000 such residents who are not citizens of Estonia. But they can set up companies based in the Baltic nation.<br><br>This scheme helps Estonia generate business for its companies, from independent contractors to small companies with clients worldwide.<br><br>Denmark, with 5.7 million people, is mulling the creation of a "Silicon Valley Ambassador" to better engage digital companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook.<br><br>"This is almost as if technology was its own country, unlike the present," said Mr Ho.<br><br>"For Singapore, such an approach would build on our earlier efforts to partner other cities and sub-national regions to plug them into international production networks," he added.<br><br>The third country is Luxembourg, with fewer than 600,000 people.<br><br>It is, however, creating a market by letting companies own resources obtained from space.<br><br>These are ideas Singapore can consider, Mr Ho told officials and students at the National University of Singapore.<br><br>The country does not have to be at the mercy of forces which it thinks are beyond its control. "Because we are a small country, we often speak as if the future were a car speeding toward us - we can swerve, or we can run backward. We can scarcely control the car."<br><br>But "even small city-states can influence, shape, and even create, not just markets, but also their operating environment," he added.<br><br>Mr Ho gave two reasons for his optimism.<br><br>First, Singapore can experiment with policies and roll them out more easily because it is small.<br><br>It can also correct its course quickly if a policy was wrong or misguided.<br><br>Second, Singapore has experience in responding to complexity and uncertainty and can draw on it.<br><br>As a newly-independent nation, it eschewed import substitution, courted multinational corporations and chose multicultural meritocracy when its neighbours were going for the opposite.<br><br>But Singapore has to have the courage to seize this hope and reinvent itself, added Mr Ho, who is now a senior adviser at a think-tank, the Centre for Strategic Futures.<br><br>"Just as Sir Stamford Raffles made Singapore a free port in 1819, welcoming traders from any country, Singapore in 2017 could welcome data from any country - a free data port," he said.<br><br>It could allow data centres in Singapore to hold data governed by the laws of another country, as if they were stored in the source country.<br><br>This would anchor the data here, allowing local-based companies to harness insights from data, he added.<br><br>It makes sense in a world where data and digital technology frequently and easily cross international borders.<br><br>Estonia's e-residency "hints at how nations could redefine their identities, and what it means to be a nation, in a digital era," said Mr Ho.<br><br>Such reinvention can ensure a country's way of life survives beyond its physical borders, he added.<br><br>Quoting an Estonian official, he said: "Land is so yesterday. It doesn't matter where you physically live or operate. That is how the game will change.''<br><br>But becoming a "virtual nation" carries risks.<br><br>To withstand cyber-attacks, Estonia is experimenting with "digital embassies'', where data is stored on servers in its embassies abroad.<br><br>It is also developing ways to migrate data to commercial servers, such as those hosted by Microsoft, as back-up in the event that cyber-attacks take place.<br><br>Re-invention in the digital age is a matter of long-term survival for global hubs like Singapore, said Mr Ho.<br><br>This is because changes in technology, trade routes and geopolitics can gradually diminish a country's position as a global hub.</p>
