              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman 
              Shanmugaratnam said there is no alternative to raising productivity as 
              the government embarks on a major restructuring of the economy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said the 
              government will spare no effort to help businesses, especially small and
               medium-sized enterprises, to make this transition to higher 
              productivity, which will in turn lead to higher wages for workers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Tharman was speaking at the Indian New Year celebrations in Serangoon.<br><br>On the Indian Community, he said one of its achievements is that it has become more cohesive over the years.<br><br>Mr
               Tharman said: "It's a community that's coming closer together. We've 
              got to keep up the spirit and also make an effort as we have new 
              immigrants coming into our society.<br><br>"Make a special effort to 
              integrate them, and the new immigrants themselves also must make a 
              special effort to understand our society, understand the fact that it is
               multicultural with major ethnic groups that are from very different 
              parts of Asia."<br><br>Several Indian communities gathered in Little 
              India to showcase their own art forms and customs. These included 
              exhibitions on Indian culture, tradition and heritage.<br><br>Mr Tharman
               added that more professional and business elite have become involved in
               the community, and that philanthropy efforts are on the rise in this 
              group.<br><br>The week-long Indian New Year celebrations aim to forge a 
              strong bond among various ethnic Indian communities as well as other 
              racial communities within Singapore. <br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>increase in productivity means that one person now produces enough for maybe two person's consumption...</p>

              Is there anything new to what he has said? That has always been the modus operandi of this government. Productivity -work! work! work! work! And they tell you work is good for you  even at 75 driving a taxi is good for you.
               
              But realistically, does  ANY GOVERNMENT  in the world tell its citizens "oh it ok  we can afford lower productivity!" I doubt any does that.        
                  
              The problem with Singapore is  a "problem of extremes". we add on all the time! The momentum and rate at which we have to keep going goes up all the time!  Why?  How many people have we brought in here  to share the small pie?  To grow the GDP  indefinitely - where is there any alternative  or slow down?  How else  can a little red dot be a super global first? How else can we be giving away scholarships? How else can we subsidize our PRs? How else can we host FI?        
                  
              Bet you they'll soon sell you the idea: "working to 80 years old is normal!" . Or "scrap the whole idea of retirement, just work till you drop dead- that's what a meaningful life is about.." .

                  If they could solve the problem of everyone having to be like mice on a treadmill in this productivity drive cycles and their wonderful restructures after restructures almost  annually on a continuous basis- would they be repeating their own echoes? That's their modus operandi in governance-the treadmill can only be turn on faster and higher ....until you drop dead...then they  get new batches of mice...simple! NO ALERNATIVE -get it?

              Professor whatever is only trying to rectify what he  has not done over the years, whilst sitting  in the CWN!  If he had recommended the right thing earlier over the years  -we don't have to be so drastic suddenly which indeed can have some dire consequences. O am also surprise why  all of a sudden this Professor speaks up?  Why nobody  talks about global benchmarked  salaries these days?

                      At different stages , we were already doing a  lot of wrong things anyway! All the lousy practices in accounting we followed  the West! silly spending wastages and write offs! And the presumption was that  the country was a jackpot machine and growth  is eternal! Property speculative fervour was allowed. For donkey years over a decade at least year after year, the top band of salaries in the land were "meticulously benchmarked" higher and higher, ( justification to retain talents!)  whilst at the lowest end -no minimum wage and oh yes! "we must not encourage a "crutch mentality" by helping the very poor with only a 30 dollar increase! How to forget such meaness?  Too many wrongs  cannot be corrected with a one swipe drastic right unfortunately-even if it is right!

            <div class='col-md body'>The productivity issue  and the issue of uneven distribution of wealth despite growing GDP  are  really two seperate issues! The assumption is that if productivity is increased- everyone's life will be definitely better off- not necessarily so. If policies are made so that the rich continually becomes richer- the poor can never even catch up a quarter of the way! For example if I  have  20 slaves and  make them work twice as hard  giving them extra payment of one extra bowl of porridge a day  so that I can buy three more bungalows a year-how does that narrow the gap between the rich and the poor?</div>

              Sustainability Theory of Wages â€“ by Fcukpap
              
              As productivity and wages are involuntarily affected by multiple factors from investments, bargaining and purchasing power, government spending to human capital, it is dependent on the stages of economic development as well as global market competitiveness and changes; which short term solutions of minimal wage incentives and compensation are not capable to sustain the accelerating growth of market and future developments.
