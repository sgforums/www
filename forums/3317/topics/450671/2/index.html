              <p>we can follow this. and still die eventually.. because it is a
                  death spiral anyway...</p>
              <p>we really need to find an alternative instead of just taking

              <p>Really, it begs the question of whether we are willing to take little or no growth at all if the FDI flies out.</p>
              <p>I am. Because I think there's more things than money out there.</p>
              <p>But not the others. And I can't blame them. </p>
              <p>The alternative is to find a niche so that we can rely less on FDI. That's what the govt is doing now.</p>
              <p>But its gonna take time and meanwhile we still try to woo the MNCs.....and carry on this rat race.</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>I find that how I feel is rare. I reckon for example we shouldn't have DBSS flats because it defeats the purpose of "public housing" since it clearly is priced to keep it out of reach of ordinary folks.</p>
              <p>Yet most feel that DBSS flats are welcomed and there is nothing wrong with the concept of segmenting the public housing market!</p>
              <p>An implicit elitist view in my opinion and sadly, this is how many feel.</p>

              Actually the worse  contributors to this very very bad situation of the wide gap  are the so called  bloody salary survey consultants and  HR salary so called experts!  From the middle executive level  for almost a decade and a half these glcs and multinationals have been benchmarking their salaries up to the CEO level on global basis. Realistically  every country is different - the tax structure and social policies of different countries are also different . Our economy  as well as our employment vulnerability  and job risk are all different. But our CEOs and also politicians started comparing what " they thought they deserve" in accordance to what other CEOs get in UK or America etc. Now we know better that these Americans, especially the top bankers there , have been over paying themselves! Just look at Citigroup - there is currently a hue and cry over the CEO's salary package!
                       So what if a CEO who is a performer and very very happy with his job  which is paying 10% or 15% lower than  the global benchmark? If the guy is happy  and think it is a fair deal why the need to  pay the monetary pound of flesh to the very last ounce? Intrinsic satisfaction on the job was not even considered!  Greed was and is  rampant ! Directors on the Board who were all too eager to recommend that the GM or CEO's salary be reviewed , hopeful that in so doing the Directors remuneration  will also be reviewed.. All kinds of scratching each other's back to get the most out of the company. DID  accurate productivity measure  even  come into the picture in many of these case?  A CEO appointed into office of a decade old reputable conglomerate with great strength and sparkling performance- all the work of that new  expensive CEO of two years?

              <p>What is higher productivity in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Pay less for more for the employers .</p>
              <p>How about the consumers ?</p>
              <p>Do we get more value for less price ?</p>
              <p>So we should continue to deny . And make them rethink of their model .</p>
              <p>Stop patronising everything that will contribute to the taxation and coffers of the goverment .Until government will have no means but to derive their taxation from cars and properties . Lets push this two to sky high . Starve them of taxation .</p>
