              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A former managing director of a company that sells 
              aviation spare parts and equipment was jailed eight weeks Thursday for 
              bribing a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) captain in exchange for 
              confidential information on military projects.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Fifty-eight-year-old
               Richard Yow Wah pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly giving 
              gratifications amounting to more than S$53,000 to 31-year-old Phua Poh 
              Sim.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Three other similar charges were taken into consideration.  <br><br>Phua,
               who was convicted and jailed earlier this year for accepting the bribe,
               was working in research and development projects with the SAF.<br> <br>Court
               documents revealed that Phua had a gambling addiction and had chalked 
              up debts of about S$100,000 at casinos onboard cruise ships. <br> <br>Phua
               was later introduced by his colleague to Yow, who had earlier expressed
               an interest in wanting to know SAF personnel dealing in procurement.<br> <br>Yow, who was the MD of Certified Aerospace Singapore, believed the information could help him in his business. <br> <br>He agreed to give Phua the money after Phua revealed that he was involved in projects of interest to Yow's business.<br> <br>Between May and August 2008, Phua made several trips to Yow's house at Brighton Road to pass Yow confidential information.<br><br>In exchange, he received between S$1,700 to S$28,000 each time. <br> <br>The
               court heard that Yow, a father-of-two, did not place tenders for any 
              military project despite having the confidential information.<br> <br>He could have been jailed a maximum of five years and fined S$100,000 on each charge.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
