              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: There was drama on Monday at the Resorts World 
              Sentosa's corporate office after dolphin activist Ric O'Barry, 72, and 
              representatives from animal welfare group Animal Concerns Research &amp;
               Education Society (ACRES) turned up unannounced.<br><br>The group 
              wanted to meet RWS chief executive Tan Hee Teck - having had two 
              requests in the last week turned down - to hand him a petition to 
              release and rehabilitate 25 dolphins which the integrated resort has 
              bought for its Marine Life Park.<br><br>With Mr Tan unavailable, the petition was passed to an RWS employee. <br><br>But
               the group subsequently got wind that Ocean Embassy founder Robin Friday
               - who has been engaged by RWS as a consultant for its Marine Life Park -
               was turning up for an interview with this newspaper. They then decided 
              to wait for Mr Friday, in order to "challenge him to a public debate", 
              in the words of Mr O'Barry. <br><br>The debate did not materialise: Mr 
              Friday, who is in his 60s, did not turn up at the office and opted for a
               phone interview with this reporter later in the day. <br><br>In 
              response to TODAY's queries, a Marine Life Park spokesperson reiterated:
               "We welcome dialogue with ACRES and perhaps this can be arranged at a 
              mutually-agreeable time. While we have differing views about the 
              dolphins in our care, we respect the mission of animal groups concerned 
              about the welfare of animals. On this we are on common ground."<br><br>The
               spokesperson added: "As for Mr O'Barry, whose agenda is to release the 
              dolphins, we haven't seen any reason to meet. We have long said that we 
              believe that our dolphins will play a significant and meaningful role 
              for marine conservation. Bottlenose dolphins have thrived and propagated
               in human care. They contribute immense knowledge and experience to 
              marine mammal specialists, whom are using all that today to help 
              dolphins both in the wild and in facilities."<br><br>Mr O'Barry pointed 
              out that he has released several dolphins after years of captivity to 
              positive results. He said: "You want to swim with the dolphins, but what
               about how they feel? The key solving all our environmental problems is 
              to control our desires."<br><br>In response, the RWS spokesperson noted that the dolphins under its care for the past three years are "doing well". <br><br>The
               spokesperson added: "The track record of dolphin reintroductions is 
              patchy at best, and we will be gravelly irresponsible to even consider 
              that." - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a></span></p>
