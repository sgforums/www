              <p class="first"><strong>Polish President Lech Kaczynski has signed the European Union's much-delayed Lisbon Treaty.</strong></p>
              <p>His
              signature means the treaty, which is intended to streamline
              decision-making, remains un-ratified by only one country, the Czech
              Republic.</p>
              <p>It must be ratified by all 27 member states before it can come into force.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Kaczynski, a noted Eurosceptic, said he was convinced the treaty would
              be successful but that the EU should remain a union of sovereign
              states.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The treaty's prospects of coming into
              force received a major lift last week when Irish voters approved it in
              a second referendum.</p>
              <p>But the Czech President Vaclav Klaus then
              raised fresh doubts when he said he would not sign the treaty unless
              his country was granted an opt-out from the EU's Charter of Fundamental
              Rights.</p>
              <p>Mr Klaus raised fears about possible property claims by Germans expelled from the then Czechoslovakia after World War II.</p>
              <p><strong>'Historic'</strong></p>
              <p>Mr
              Kaczynski said in a speech just before the signing he was "deeply
              convinced" that the "great experiment" of the treaty would be
              successful.</p>
              <p>"The fact that the Irish people changed their minds meant the
              revival of the treaty, and there are no longer any obstacles to its
              ratification," he said.</p>
              <p>"Today is a very important day in the history of Poland and the European Union."</p>
              <p>But
              he said that the EU was a "union of sovereign states" and should remain
              so, adding that it remain open to new members such as countries of the
              former Yugoslavia and Georgia.</p>
              <p>European Commission President
              Jose Manuel Barroso, European Parliament speaker Jerzy Buzek and
              Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, whose country holds the EU's
              rotating presidency, attended the Polish ceremony.</p>
              <p>Welcoming the Polish signing, Mr Reinfeldt said that the EU "eagerly awaits" the full ratification of the treaty.</p>
              <p>"We do not need more delays," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              BBC's Jonny Dymond in Brussels says that Mr Kaczynski's signature
              leaves the Czech Republic, and in particular its Eurosceptic president,
              entirely isolated.</p>
              <p>But, he says, that appears not to concern Mr Klaus.</p>
              <p>The
              president is insisting on a "footnote" being added to the text so as to
              exempt his country from the Charter of Fundamental Rights much like
              Poland and the UK already are, our correspondent says.</p>
              <p>"Before
              ratification, the Czech Republic must, additionally at least, negotiate
              a similar exemption," Mr Klaus was quoted by the Reuters news agency as
              saying on Friday. "I believe that this exemption can be resolved
              quickly."</p>
              <p>He said the charter would "allow [claimants] to
              circumvent Czech courts and place, for example, property claims by
              people expelled after World War II directly at the European Court of
              Justice".</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Mr Klaus has said previously that he will not sign the treaty until
              the Czech Constitutional Court rules on a new legal complaint against
              it, lodged by senators allied to him.</p>
              <p>The Czech parliament has
              already approved the treaty and his critics note that it is the
              government, not the president, who negotiates international treaties.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, President Klaus's move has already had an impact in Brussels, our correspondent adds.</p>
              <p>Officials
              say the next summit at the end of October will now probably be devoted
              solely to dealing with Czech objections, rather than selecting people
              for the new posts created by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
              <p>France has already expressed opposition to Mr Klaus's demand.</p>
              <p>Supporters
              of the treaty are also concerned that if Mr Klaus holds up the treaty,
              Britain's opposition Conservatives may fulfil their pledge for a
              referendum on it should they come to power.</p>
              <p>A UK general election must be held by June next year.</p>
              <p>At
              the Conservative party conference this week, shadow foreign secretary
              William Hague restated its opposition to the treaty, saying the EU
              should not place its own president above any nation's.</p>
