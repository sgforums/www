              <p>CHICAGO (AFP) - â€“ A 15-year-old youth took 23 students and a teacher
               hostage at a high school in a small Wisconsin town before turning the 
              gun on himself, police said.</p>
              <p>The youth was hospitalized with a gunshot wound, with no immediate 
              word on his condition, but the captives were unharmed, according to 
              officials in Marinette, Wisconsin, where the drama unfolded Monday.</p>
              <p>Marinette police chief Jeff Skorik said earlier reports on social 
              network sites that students had been injured in the attack were 
              incorrect.</p>
              <p>Skorik told a late night press conference the student who had held 
              the hostages shot himself as police approached him after officers had 
              heard three gunshots go off in the classroom.</p>
              <p>The male gunman, who was not identified, was transported to a local 
              hospital where his condition or the nature of the injuries was not known
               late Monday.</p>
              <p>"Emergency rescue personnel on stand-by treated the suspect and 
              transported him to Bay Area Medical Center," a police statement said.</p>
              <p>The drama came to an end at 8:03 pm (0103 GMT Tuesday) moments after
               the gunman had released five students to allow them to use the 
              washrooms.</p>
              <p>After hearing gunfire, officers who had been in dialogue with the 
              teacher, immediately entered the room, and saw the boy shoot himself.</p>
              <p>"The officers breached the door, entered the classroom and saw the 
              suspect in front of the classroom," Skorik said. "At that time the 
              suspect fired one shot, injured himself with a self-inflicted gunshot 
              wound." Skorik did not say where he was shot.</p>
              <p>The hostage-taker, an unidentified student, entered the classroom toward the end of the school day, around 3:00 pm (2000 GMT).</p>
              <p>Police had been hoping to resolve the drama without violence. "The 
              game plan all along was to have the situation end peacefully," Skorik 
              said.</p>
              <p>The youth, a student at Marinette High School, had entered the 
              classroom with two handguns, a .22 caliber semi-automatic and a 9-mm 
              pistol. Cartridge casings found on the scene revealed both weapons had 
              been used, he added.</p>
              <p>The motive for the situation remained unclear according to Skorik, 
              who noted the student was not known to local police. One parent told the
               Milwauke Journal Sentinel that the situation unfolded during a Western 
              Civilization class.</p>
              <p>"We have no idea as far as motivations at this point," he said.</p>
              <p>The high school will be closed until further notice and grief 
              counselors will be on hand once the decision is made to re-open, said 
              Superintendent Timothy Baneck.</p>
              <p>The district had held a drill last fall to practise what to do if a shooter had entered the school, he added.</p>
              <p>Marinette is approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the city of Green Bay. The school has approximately 700 students.</p>
              <p>Police had earlier said there were 20 students and one teacher being held hostage.<br><br><strong>Source:</strong><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20101130/twl-us-hostage-4bdc673.html"><br>http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20101130/twl-us-hostage-4bdc673.html</a></p>
