              You've heard of the ugly Singaporean. Now meet its cousin -- the ugly Singaporean parent.
              
              Demanding, unreasonable and self-righteous, this new breed of parents have an overbearing sense of entitlement.
              
              They expect nothing less than the best triple A-care for their child in school, and woe befall any teacher that doesn't match up.
              
              Often displaying a warped sense of what is wrong and right, these pushy parents come down hard on any educator who dares mess with their kid, even if the latter is wrong. 
              
              "Haircut mum" has thrown the spotlight on both the kinds of demands placed upon educators and the sky-high expectations of parents.
              
              To recap, Serene Ong filed a police complaint after a Unity Primary school teacher re-trimmed her boy's S$60 haircut despite several warnings by the school to keep his hair tidy. 
              
              "There is absolute no right or wrong in this matter," said Madam Ong, after her son's case was highlighted by Education Minister Heng Swee Keat at an education seminar recently.
              
              One might say the above example demands a re-look at current school rules and discipline. What, for example, does it matter if a student's hair "covers his ears" or "touches his collar"? But that's for another day.
              
              What's more frightening is the sense of entitlement some parents have.
              
              Consider these. 
              
              A teacher at a government-aided mixed school in the East told Yahoo! Singapore a parent of her Sec 3 pupil tried to pay her extra money to focus more on her son in class.
              
              "When I told her 'no', she said she would complain that I had neglected his progress and ask that he be put in another class," she said.
              
              Another teacher, 37, who has been teaching over a decade, recounted how she had let slip in class that she was a Tampines Junior College alumni.
              
              "The next thing I knew, parents of three girls had written in to the principal to say that I was not fit to teach at the school and they wanted me transferred out,â€� she said.
              
              â€œI was so hurt and angry. The parents only want teachers from brand-name schools teaching their brand-name children,â€� she added.
              
              A former teacher with 27 years' experience shared how a parent had demanded that his daughter be allowed to eat anytime of the day, claiming that she had a gastric problem. He filed a police report against her art teacher and wrote letters to the Prime Minister and senior management at MOE when she was not allowed to eat in the art room.
              
              In a separate instance, she also recounted how a parent volunteer filed a report with the MOE to investigate the school for misappropriating resources when her son didn't receive drinks donated by another parent at a school cross-country run.
              
              So who are these pushy parents exactly?
              
              Several educators we spoke to said they're likely to be university-educated, well-to-do and stay in private housing. 
              
              What kind of society and what kind of human beings are we raising our kids to be?
              
              Our education blogger, Daniel Wong, recently wrote that parents cannot shirk the responsibility of raising their own children and instilling in them the right morals and values.
              
              "Are you an excellent role model for your child? Do you show respect and honour for everyone you interact with, regardless of their social status? Are you always in control of your emotions?"
              
              I couldn't agree more.

              <p>Many a times, parents though that as long as they pay the school fees, education in all forms is and should be taken care of in school. That meaning, they foster out their roles of educating as parent out to the teachers without realising that some things have to be taught by parents themselves. Yet by thinking that they are paying tax and civil servants are somewhat like their servants, they have forgotten about all their values and what they should indeed be teaching their kids.</p>
              <p>These i feel are parents who are not ready for their roles as a parent, parents who are not ready for their responsibility as a parent and therefore, pushed their responsibiliy somewhere else through the use of money.</p>

              <p>A friend of mine (a teacher) once told me about a pushy parent who complained to MOE that his son was given a bottle of mineral water past its expiry date during a road run.</p>
              <p>As it turns out, the parent had actually misread the expiry date as DD/MM/YYYY when it was actually MM/DD/YYYY.</p>
              <p>So he read it as '05 Mar 2012' instead of '03 May 2012' (as an example).</p>
              <p>The kicker was that the bottle had clearly stated that it was in MM/DD/YYYY format.</p>

              <p>There are stories of PRC undergraduates who don't know how to peel oranges..... because their parents always do it for them.</p>
              <p>Anyway, bad parents are everywhere. I only hope that they are a minority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To that teacher who is a TPJC alumni: those parents are idiots, and they are demonstrating their idiocy by saying that you are unfit to teach solely by virtue of your alumnus.</p>
              <p>I mean, seriously, at most the MOE officer who receives the complaints is just going to laugh it all off and toss it into the office shredder. MOE has better things to do than to attend to stupid complaints by total retards.</p>
