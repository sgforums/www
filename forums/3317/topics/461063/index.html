              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Many Singaporeans have not grasped the implications 
              of low economic growth in light of an uncertain economy, or even the 
              effects of an aging population, Minister K Shanmugam said. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In a community where
               more than 20 per cent of its residents are senior citizens, the 
              importance of having good facilities for the elderly is more important 
              than ever, especially as Singapore faces a rapidly ageing population.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Shanmugam said: 
              "I don't think the implications of that have been fully internalised 
              within our society. I think by 2030, we're only going to have, if 
              projections are accurate, two persons working to support one retired 
              person.<br><br>"Today, it is eight persons working to support one 
              retired person. The economic, social consequences, healthcare costs, the
               possible impact on our entire support system, we need to be thinking 
              very actively about these things."<br><br>Going forward, Mr Shanmugam 
              said beyond more outreach and educational efforts, the government must 
              ensure more medical services within easy reach.<br><br>He said: "I think
               we need to bring and make sure that medical services are available 
              within a reasonable geographical proximity, and you know a lot of issues
               they may face might require say home nursing for example. So we need to
               start thinking in terms of we don't want everyone to necessarily have 
              to come to the hospital, because it may not require a full-scale medical
               treatment, but they need some sort of medical treatment and we need to 
              seriously look at home-nursing and things like that."<br><br>Mr 
              Shanmugam also gave his take on Singapore's economy where he highlighted
               the plight of small and medium enterprises, many of which are 
              struggling with the government's move to restrict the number of foreign 
              workers.<br><br>This he said, has implications on jobs for Singaporean too.<br><br>Mr
               Shanmugam said: "You've seen Minister Lim (Swee Say) saying we may have
               to settle for low growth. Now low growth does not mean that we will all
               be able to say, be graceful, have a good standard of life, play golf. 
              No.<br><br>"Low growth in Singapore, in the context of high growth 
              region means lack of opportunities in Singapore. A lot of people don't 
              understand this. You see articles all around - 'oh it's okay, let's 
              adjust to a low growth'.<br><br>"First, low growth is going to be a fact
               of life. We're not going to be able to grow at six to eight per cent. 
              Not easy, let's understand that.<br><br>"Second, what does low growth 
              mean when all your neighbours are growing high? Just look at Japan, it 
              means less opportunities for young people, in the event of 40 to 50 per 
              cent of the population coming out with degrees. It means reduced 
              dynamism in the economy, it means industries moving out, these are the 
              challenges we have to face and these are the messages we have to get 
              across and what are the choices that people want to make. Low growth 
              carries serious consequences."<br><br>Mr Shanmugam also added that the government must manage low growth even as it ensures enough opportunities for Singaporeans.<br><br>He
               was at an Active Ageing Carnival in Nee Soon GRC on Sunday. More than 
              3,000 Nee Soon GRC residents came together to commemorate the launch of 
              the Wellness Programme, through its Active Ageing Carnival.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
