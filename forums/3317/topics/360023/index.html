              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Government has said it welcomes
              religious groups and individuals getting active in social issues. But
              it has warned against mixing religion with politics. <br> <br> Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said this in reply to the TODAY
              newspaper, in an interview to be published on Friday, on the recent
              saga involving the Association of Women for Action and Research
              (AWARE).
              <br> <br>Mr Wong added that the government's position on homosexuality is
              clear, and it will not be pressured into changing its position as a
              result of lobbying by pressure groups.
              <br> <br>Two years ago, during the debate on whether to decriminalise sex
              between men, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had clearly stated that the
              conventional family, a heterosexual stable family is the norm and
              building block of Singapore society. <br> <br> But the government also recognises that homosexuals are part of the society.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee had said then: "Homosexuals work in all sectors, all over the
              economy, in the public sector as well and in the civil service. They
              are free to lead their lives, free to pursue their social activities."
              <br> <br> That position has not changed.
              <br> <br>Mr Wong said: "The government was not going to be pressured into
              changing its position on homosexuality before the takeover of AWARE.
              Nor does the government intend to change its position now that the Old
              Guard has recaptured AWARE."
              <br> <br>He added that as Singaporeans become more educated and informed,
              and more space is being opened up for people to express alternative
              views, there will be more tussles between people holding different
              points of views.
              <br> <br> If any group pushes its agenda aggressively, there will be strong reactions from other groups.
              <br> <br>As for the AWARE controversy, the government was worried about the
              disquieting public perception that a group of conservative Christians -
              all attending the same church, which held strong views on homosexuality
              - had moved in and taken over AWARE because they disapproved of what
              the organisation had been doing.
              <br> <br>Hence, he was gratified that the National Council of Churches of
              Singapore issued a clear statement that it does not condone churches
              getting involved in the AWARE dispute, and that leaders of different
              religious faiths came out to reinforce the NCCS message.
              <br> <br>Mr Wong said the government has to maintain order impartially. It
              encourages the development of civic society, and gradual widening of
              the out-of-bounds (OB) markers. But it will not stand by and watch,
              when intemperate activism threatens Singapore society.
              <br> <br>Asked for his comments on the May 2 AWARE extraordinary general
              meeting, which saw the new exco being voted out, Mr Wong said both
              sides must now calm down, and move on. </span></p>
