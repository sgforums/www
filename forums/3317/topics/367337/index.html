              <p><strong>Google takes aim at Microsoft with new PC platform</strong></p>
              <p>Google Inc &lt;GOOG.O&gt; is declaring war on Microsoft Corp
              &lt;MSFT.O&gt; by seeking to unseat the software giant's globally
              dominant Windows operating system for personal computers.</p>
              <p>Google,
              which already offers a suite of e-mail, Web and other software products
              that compete with Microsoft, said on Tuesday it would launch a new
              operating system for computers ranging from ultra-compact netbooks to
              full-size desktop PCs.</p>
              <p>Called the Google Chrome Operating System,
              the new software will be in netbooks for consumers in the second half
              of 2010, Google said in a blog post, adding that it was working with
              multiple manufacturers.</p>
              <p>"It's been part of their culture to go
              after and remove Microsoft as a major holder of technology, and this is
              part of their strategy to do it," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst
              at Enderle Group. "This could be very disruptive. If they can execute,
              Microsoft is vulnerable to an attack like this, and they know it," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Google and Microsoft have often locked horns over the years
              in a variety of markets, from Internet search to mobile software. It
              remains to be seen if Google can take market share away from Microsoft
              on its home turf, with Windows currently installed in more than 90
              percent of the world's PCs.</p>
              <p>Key to success will be whether Google
              can lock in partnerships with PC makers, such as Hewlett-Packard Co
              &lt;HPQ.N&gt; and Dell Inc &lt;DELL.O&gt;, which currently offer
              Windows on most of their product lines.</p>
              <p>Google's Chrome Internet
              browser, launched in late 2008, remains a distant fourth in the Web
              browser market, with a 1.2 percent share in February, according to
              market research firm Net Applications. Microsoft's Internet Explorer
              continues to dominate, with nearly 70 percent.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Microsoft had no immediate comment.</p>
              <p>FAST AND LIGHTWEIGHT</p>
              <p>The
              new Chrome OS is expected to work well with many of the company's
              popular software applications, such as Gmail, Google Calendar and
              Google Maps.</p>
              <p>It will be fast and lightweight, enabling users to
              access the Web in a few seconds, Google said. The new OS is based on
              open-source Linux code, which allows third-party developers to design
              compatible applications.</p>
              <p>"The operating systems that browsers run
              on were designed in an era where there was no web," Sundar Pichai, vice
              president of product management at Google, said in the blog post. The
              Chrome OS is "our attempt to re-think what operating systems should be".</p>
              <p>Google
              said Chrome OS was a new project, separate from its Android mobile
              operating software found in some smartphones. Acer Inc &lt;2353.TW&gt;,
              the world's No.3 PC brand, has already agreed to sell netbooks that run
              Android.</p>
              <p>The new OS is designed to work with ARM &lt;ARM.L&gt; and x86 chips, the main chip architectures in use today.</p>
              <p>Charlene
              Li, partner at consulting company Altimeter Group, said Google's new OS
              will initially appeal to consumers looking for a netbook-like device
              for Web surfing, rather than people who use desktop PCs for gaming or
              high-powered applications.</p>
              <p>But eventually, the Google OS has the
              potential to scale up to larger, more powerful PCs -- especially if it
              proves to run faster than Windows, she said.</p>
              <p>Enderle expects
              Google to charge at most a nominal fee for the new OS, or make it free,
              saying the company's business model has been to earn revenue off
              connecting applications or advertising.</p>
              <p>Li added: "A benefit to the consumer is that the cost saving is passed on, not having to pay for an OS."</p>
              <p>"It's clearly positioned as a shot across the bow of Microsoft," she said.</p>

              <p>depends on how google does the OS. if they somehow lift from linux and is able to provide the compatibility solutions for the documents and program dependence on windows, it can be quite fast.</p>
              <p>Some current linux distributions are already very user friendly, what they lack of is acceptance and possibly compatibility which google can provide via branding and funding.</p>

              <p>no mac user would be converted over to their system that easily. and to unseat microsoft, they either have to start designing their own hardware or get all the PC makers to support them.</p>
