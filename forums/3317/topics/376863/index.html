              <p><strong>AIDS breakthrough as vaccine cuts infections for first time</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>BANGKOK (AFP) - â€“ An experimental AIDS
              vaccine has for the first time cut the risk of infection in humans in
              what scientists Thursday called a "breakthrough" in the quarter-century
              fight against the epidemic.</p>
              <p>The vaccine reduced the chance of
              being infected by a third, researchers announced after the world's
              largest trial of 16,000 volunteers, carried out by the US Army and
              Thailand's Ministry of Public Health.</p>
              <p>The surprising result
              comes after years of fruitless attempts by the medical world to find an
              HIV vaccine, including one trial jab that apparently boosted infection
              rates.</p>
              <p>"It is the first demonstration that a vaccine against
              HIV can protect against infection," Colonel Jerome Kim of the US
              military HIV research programme told a news conference in Bangkok via
              videolink.</p>
              <p>"This is a very important scientific advance and
              gives us hope that a globally effective vaccine may be possible in the
              future," he said.</p>
              <p>Thai Public Health Minister Witthaya Kaewparadai said the "outcome of this study is a scientific breakthrough."</p>
              <p>The
              vaccine was a combination of two older drugs that had not reduced
              infection on their own and the researchers said they were now studying
              why the two apparently worked together.</p>
              <p>The study combined the
              canarypox vaccine ALVAC, manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis of France, and
              AIDSVAX, originally made by VaxGen Inc and now licensed to the
              non-profit Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases.</p>
              <p>Researchers said the latest vaccine showed a 31.2 percent efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV infection.</p>
              <p>"The
              outcome represents a breakthrough in HIV vaccine development because
              for the first time ever there is evidence that HIV vaccine has
              preventative efficacy," said the research team in a statement.</p>
              <p>The
              vaccine was tested on volunteers -- all HIV negative men and women aged
              from 18 to 30 -- at average risk of infection in two Thai provinces
              near Bangkok starting in October 2003.</p>
              <p>Half received the
              vaccine and the rest were given a placebo. Out of the placebo
              recipients 74 of 8,198 became infected compared with 51 of 8,197 who
              got the vaccine.</p>
              <p>The World Health Organization and the Joint
              UN Programme on HIV/AIDS congratulated the researchers for the
              "encouraging" results.</p>
              <p>"The study results, representing a
              significant scientific advance, are the first demonstration that a
              vaccine can prevent HIV infection in a general adult population and are
              of great importance," they said in a statement. Experts' reactions</p>
              <p>The
              UN said it may not be possible to get licensing permission for the drug
              at the moment based on the results, and that further studies were
              needed to determine if the vaccine has the same effect in other parts
              of the world.</p>
              <p>AIDS first came to public notice in 1981 and has
              since killed at least 25 million people worldwide, and 33 million
              others are living with AIDS or the HIV virus.</p>
              <p>Swift progress
              in identifying the virus that caused AIDS unleashed early optimism that
              a vaccine would quickly emerge. HIV destroys immune cells and exposes
              the body to opportunistic disease.</p>
              <p>But out of the 50
              candidates that have been evaluated among humans, only two vaccines
              have made it through all three phases of trials, and both were flops.
              About 30 vaccines remain in the pipeline.</p>
              <p>Scientists were in
              2007 forced to abandon two advanced clinical trials of a vaccine by
              pharmaceutical company Merck after it appeared to actually heighten the
              risk of AIDS infection.</p>
              <p>Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division
              of Sanofi-Aventis, said the results of the latest test, although
              "modest", were the first concrete demonstration that a vaccine "could
              one day become a reality."</p>
              <p>The Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise,
              an alliance of researchers, policymakers, donors and advocates that
              includes the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said it was a "historic
              day in the 26-year quest to develop an AIDS vaccine."</p>
              <p>The
              International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), an organisation that
              promotes the search for a vaccine, said the trial results were "very
              exciting and a significant scientific achievement."</p>
              <p>The head of the US agency tasked with controlling the spread of infectious disease said it was an important breakthrough.</p>
              <p>"These
              new findings represent an important step forward in HIV vaccine
              research," said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of
              Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US National
              Institutes of Health, which provided major funding and logistical
              support for the study.</p>
              <p>But a top AIDS scientist, France's
              Jean-Francois Delfraissy, warned that the results were "good news but
              the effect remains modest".</p>
