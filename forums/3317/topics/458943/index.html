              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>22-year-old 
              Shanurfahmi Shariman was found guilty of three counts of underage sex. 
              Three other similar counts were taken into consideration. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Shanurfahmi was married with a daughter when he met the victim, who was then a Secondary 3 student in 2010.<br> <br>They started a relationship shortly after he told her that he was going to divorce his wife.<br> <br>They then had unprotected sex several times at his home and in a tent at East Coast Park. <br> <br>Within a year of knowing him, the victim became pregnant and later aborted the 5-month-old foetus.<br> <br>In his mitigation, Shanurfahmi said he had learnt his lesson and would not repeat the offence.<br> <br>But that cut no ice with District Judge Low Wee Ping, who noted that Shanurfahmi already had a child born out of wedlock.<br> <br>The judge also highlighted the trauma caused to the girl as a result of the unwanted pregnancy and subsequent abortion.<br> <br>Chastising
               Shanurfahmi for having sex with the underage girl, the judge said 
              although it was consensual, the law had to be "very severe, not only to 
              serve as a deterrence, but also to protect young girls like this 
              victim."<br> <br>For underage sex, Shanurfahmi could have been jailed up to ten years and fined for each charge. <br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

              <p>It is better to bear the child than to abort it.</p>
              <p>If the child is born, at the very least he/she will live as an ordinary person. Not the great suffering as most people imagine. And there is a possibility that he/she become some one  great.</p>
              <p>Abort, and there is a permanent loss, and the mother will be constantly sad, and keep track of the childs age if the abortion had not taken place.</p>
              <p>The miles stones are there. If not aborted, will be in primary one, if not aborted will be in secondary school, if not aborted will be doing NS, if not aborted will be about married etc. there is no escaping this sort of  thinking.</p>

              <p>I'm actually quite surprised that the doctor aborted the foetus.</p>
              <p>While the maximum limit is 6 months, 5 months is dangerously close to this limit. And an abortion at this stage is more complicated with greater risk, especially since the girl is only 14 years old.</p>
              <p>From what I read doctors generally refuse to abort foetuses at more than 3 months except for medical reasons.</p>
