              <p>THE woman who is being sued by her mother over money from the sale of an apartment took the stand on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Accountant Lim Shook Luan, 49, painted a vivid picture of her mother 
              as a volatile woman prone to violent outbursts at her six children, 
              particularly after consuming alcohol.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim's mother, Madam Lim Geok Swan, 76, claims she is owed more 
              than $308,000 after their Minton Rise apartment was sold in a collective
               sale in 2007 for $617,737.</p>
              <p>Madam Lim claims she had a verbal agreement with her 
              daughter when they bought the privatised HUDC apartment in 1991 that, as
               joint tenants and equal owners, the sale proceeds would be shared 
              equally if the property was sold.</p>
              <p>Other terms of this alleged verbal agreement include her 
              daughter's promise to buy her a three-room flat if the former ever 
              wanted to keep the Minton Rise apartment for herself.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim, who works in Brussels, denies any such agreement. In
               her opening statement on Monday, she said her mother's actions were a 
              'contrived ruse'.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Siblings support sister's account of 'violent' mother</h1>
              <p>THREE siblings turned against their mother yesterday and supported 
              their sister's description of the older woman as prone to episodes of 
              violence.</p>
              <p>Their mother, Madam Lim Geok Swan, 76, had taken one of her 
              daughters, accountant Lim Shook Luan, 49, to court over what she said is
               her share of money from the sale of an apartment.</p>
              <p>She claims her daughter owes her more than $308,000 after their 
              Minton Rise apartment became part of an en bloc sale in 2007 and fetched
               $617,737.</p>
              <p>On the stand on Wednesday, Ms Lim painted a vivid picture of
               her mother as a woman who would erupt in violent outbursts at her six 
              children, especially after she consumed alcohol. She cited a few 
              incidents, including one in 1997, when her mother allegedly threatened 
              her with a chopper and police had to be called in.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, her older sister, Ms Lim Soo Kheng, 52, who had 
              been in the house at the time, told the court emphatically: 'It 
              happened.'</p>
              <p>She said that although she had not seen her mother wielding 
              the chopper at the time, she had run into the room with her sister and 
              locked the door. Their mother continued to bang on the lock with the 
              chopper.</p>

              <p>One lesson learnt from this story.</p>
              <p>Never take verbally as an agreement/acknowledgement.</p>
              <p>Even in the working place, verbally will not constitute an agreement if the other party want to sabotage you.</p>
