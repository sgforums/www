              <p><span><span>Singapore: MediaCorp announced Tuesday that Mr Lucas Chow will be resigning from the company as its CEO on 31 July 2011 and that the company has initiated the search for his successor. <br><br>Mr Teo Ming Kian, MediaCorp Chairman, said a Search Committee to consider candidates from outside and within the company has been set up.<br><br>"I am confident that with the robustness of MediaCorp and the commitment of its management and staff, the transition to the next CEO will be a smooth one” said Mr Teo.<br><br>“Lucas has built up MediaCorp to what it is today in the five years as its CEO. Under his watch, MediaCorp has done well to keep up with audiences’ needs and changes sweeping the media industry" added the MediaCorp Chairman. <br><br>In a statement, the Asian media firm noted that Mr Chow who had joined MediaCorp in December 2005, took the company through some of its most challenging years, including the world recession that started in 2009. <br><br>Under his leadership, the company had not only weathered the financial storm but also emerged stronger in terms of stature and offerings.<br><br>This includes garnering several international accolades, including last year’s double win of Asian Television’s Terrestrial Broadcaster and Terrestrial Channel, as well as major product innovation and launches, among them the popular video portal xinmsn.sg, high definition channel HD5, out of home business and soon-to-be-launched Over-the-Top TV service. <br><br>Under Mr Chow, the media firm also saw the restructuring and integration of MediaCorp’s sales and marketing division, pulling together the efforts of TV, radio, print and interactive to provide a one-stop solution for advertisers. <br><br>The MediaCorp statement also noted that during Mr Chow's tenure, the company started and led a regional broadcasters’ association called SMART Alliance, which aims to synergise efforts in programming, sales and technology.<br><br>In addition, there were strategic investments in Indonesian media conglomerates PT Media Nusantara Citra and its parent company, PT Global Mediacom.<br><br>Mr Chow said: “I am very grateful to my colleagues who have worked tirelessly with me all these years, and fortunate to have had the guidance of chairmen Ho Kwon Ping and Teo Ming Kian, as well as a supportive board. <br><br>"For the next phase of MediaCorp’s development, I wish the new CEO well in taking the company to even greater heights, as well as moving physically to a new campus at Mediapolis. I think the timing is right for a new CEO to take over the reins from here. Having been with MediaCorp for five years, I think I have done what I have set out to do, and it is time to move on."<br><br>Mr Chow said he plans to join another company which is in a different line of business. <br><br>- CNA/sf</span> </span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Former MediaCorp CEO joins Far East Organization</h1>
              <p>FORMER MediaCorp chief executive Lucas Chow is taking the leap into 
              the property sector after being appointed as an executive director at 
              developer Far East Organization.</p>
              <p>Mr Chow, 57, whose background is in media and technology, announced 
              he was quitting the broadcaster earlier this month after five years.</p>
              <p>In his new role, he will be giving advice to Far East's CEO Philip Ng
               on new business growth and brand development across the company's 
              diverse real estate portfolio. He takes up the post on Aug 1.</p>
              <p>In a statement issued on Thursday, Mr Ng said: 'Lucas brings
               an excellent record of accomplishments in developing people, businesses
               and customers across the dynamic fields of technology, infocomm and 
              media.'</p>
              <p>He said he was confident Mr Chow will add value to Far East's efforts to expand the scope of its business platform.</p>
              <p>'His sharp business acumen and strong customer orientation 
              have been recognised as key assets in managing change and identifying 
              market opportunities,' said Mr Ng.</p>
