              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Minster of State for Manpower and National 
              Development Tan Chuan-Jin said the move to increase the maximum 
              employment period of unskilled foreign workers is not meant to ease 
              Singapore's labour crunch.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Tan said the extension makes more effective use of labour within the time period allotted.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>On Monday, the 
              Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said from 1 July, unskilled work permit 
              holders from non-traditional sources can be employed up to 10 years, up 
              from the current six years.<br><br>Workers from non-traditional sources are those from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and China.<br><br>Many companies have been asking for an extension to the period of employment of unskilled foreign workers.<br><br>This
               is to help them keep workers who are trained, experienced, and thus 
              more productive. It is hoped these workers can also improve on their 
              skills and qualifications.<br><br>"It's not so much easing the labour 
              crunch. I think what it does is that it allows employers to hold their 
              staff for a little bit longer so the numbers don't change because they 
              still operate within the dependency ratio ceiling," Mr Tan said.<br><br>"They
               have been here a while. They have become socialised to the norms so 
              that is also important not in terms of assimilation but in terms of 
              adjusting to the society as opposed to, say, bringing in another new 
              worker. <br><br>"This means another whole round of adjustments needs to 
              take place. And from a safety perspective, it's also important because 
              they become seasoned to the practices here. <br><br>"They understand the different measures put in place, so they are also more attuned to that."<br><br>In addition, Mr Tan indicated the government would not be considering removing the period of employment totally, so soon. <br><br>MOM will continue to track the industry, gather feedback and take one step at a time.<br><br>Earlier,
               during a visit to Caliberlink, Mr Tan launched several initiatives from
               the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) targeted at professionals, 
              managers and executives.<br><br>To meet the needs of individuals 
              on-the-go, a free mobile application called Learn SG was introduced. Job
               seekers can also play Go Rush! - a mobile game designed to encourage 
              them to upgrade their skills.<br><br>Meanwhile, WDA has revamped its 
              website. One new feature is the job profiler that helps determine the 
              occupations that best fit job seekers. <br><br>Other features include a salary benchmark, a tool for users to find out more about the average salaries for various occupations.<br><br>WDA
               chief executive Wong Hong Kuan said: "What we find is that there are 
              different segments of professionals that need different help. <br><br>"Some
               just need some touch up in terms of their job-search skills. Some 
              actually need deeper training to enable them to make significant 
              transition into new areas of interest and to follow their passion. <br><br>"So
               in that sense, our approach will be individualised to each professional
               depending on what his or her needs and interests are."<br><br>Some 400 PMEs have benefited from Caliberlink's services since it was launched last December.<br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>
