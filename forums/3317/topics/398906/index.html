              <p>KUALA LUMPUR - LAWYERS for Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim 
              on Monday sought to implicate the country's prime minister in a 
              conspiracy to frame Anwar on charges that he sodomised a former male 
              aide.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Najib Razak has admitted meeting Anwar's accuser, 
              Saiful Bukhari Azlan, after he said he was sodomised by Anwar, but 
              before a complaint was made to the police in March 2008. Najib has also 
              denied interfering in the case.</p>
              <p>Saiful told the court that he met Najib on March 24, two 
              days before his deposition stated that Anwar, the 63-year-old opposition
               leader, had sodomised him, a crime in this mainly Muslim country, and 
              four days before he went to the police. 'I told him (Najib) about my 
              problems,' a nervous-looking Saiful, now 25, told the Kuala Lumpur High 
              Court on the first day of his cross-examination by Anwar's lawyers. He 
              did not elaborate on what his problems were.</p>
              <p>If convicted, Anwar could be jailed for 20 years, a sentence
               that would effectively end the career of the man who has succeeded in 
              uniting Malaysia's opposition rainbow coalition of Islamists, reformers 
              and ethnic Chinese political parties. Anwar was convicted of sodomy in 
              2000, adding to an earlier sentence for corruption, following his ouster
               as deputy prime minister at the height of the 1998 Asian financial 
              crisis. The earlier sodomy conviction in a trial that was widely 
              criticised for being unfair was overturned on appeal.</p>
              <p>Najib was deputy prime minister at the time of the alleged 
              sodomy and took the top job in April last year, pledging to open up the 
              economy and mend tensions between the majority Malay and minority ethnic
               Chinese and Indian populations.</p>
              <p>'The prime minister is involved. There is a political 
              conspiracy to eliminate Anwar from his seat,' defence lawyer Karpal 
              Singh told the court. Karpal on Monday also challenged Saiful's claims 
              that he had been sodomised, saying they were not backed up by a medical 
              report. The trial is due to last until August.</p>
