              well....there are basically 2 kinds....
              
              kidnapping from Sg and from lawful guardianship...apart from other varied situations...i.e. murder (which is death sentence) etc...
              
              human trafficking is of much concern...

              <p>I certainly hope so. </p>
              <p>but looking at the way how some criminal cases are handled,  I really dunno man.  I am talking about those crimes by our gahmen's beloved foreign talents.  Look at how the Suntec assault case was handled (the one where three ang mohs assaulted the locals and two were allowed to leave sg after being charged).  Also look at the case of hit-and-run case by the former Romanian diplomat was handled.  the victim was killed but the wrongdoer was allowed to return to home town in Romania. </p>
              <p>If the female abductor and her male companion were some foreign talents and were eventually caught, will they be locked up, or just simply charged and allowed to leave Sg anyway, just like the assault case ang mohs and the Romanian?  I have very little faith in sg's law enforcement liao. </p>
              <p>The only good side of the news report is that the AMK's MP got proactively involved in the investigation and gave his word that the police will investigate.</p>

              <p>A woman has complained on the internet that a Chinese national couple tried to abduct her child at Ang Mo Kio Hub.</p>
              <p>Ms 'Allison Goon' shared her experience on her Facebook page, explaining that she was at the AMK Hub Fiesta on Sunday (18 Mar).</p>
              <p>She had just fed her son and walked away to throw some rubbish when 
              she turned back and found another woman taking her son away by his hand.</p>
              <p>She shouted after her son and asked the woman why she was holding her son's hand.</p>
              <p>The woman, who spoke with a China accent, replied that she had "the

              nothing had happened.</p>
              <p>When Ms Allison Goon asked her son why he had followed the stranger, 
              the boy said that the woman had told him, "follow me, I will bring you 
              home".</p>
              <p>Concerned about the incident, Ms Allison Goon spoke to the mall management and was advised to make a police report.</p>
              <p>She has since done so.</p>
              <p>The mall's management has emphasised that this was an isolated incident and advises the public not to panic unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>The Member of Parliament who looks after the area, Mr Seng Han Thong,
               has also expressed concern and told reporters that the police will step
               up their patrols while the mall management will monitor the situation.</p>

              <p>the woman telling lil kid that lil kid will go home with her and be satis is something like PAP telling all sporeans that they are the first and that all will be ok and they will have a decent wage job!!!!.</p>
              <p>i have an experience when i was in primary3 school and was on way back home when i met with an auntie asking me to get into her car smiling etc etc outside school.she looked malaysian or north korean with a tanned face like she been planting rice.so i got in as a small innocent lil kid and she waited for someone else for 10 mins.when her partner never came ,she got out n told me to stay behind in car.....after she got out....i studied the car....ewww...why so rusted n old one the brakes n gear etc....so i conveniently got out of car and walked to nearby shopping centre somewhere in katong.end of story.</p>
              <p>thinkin  of it today the incident in the past somewhat resembles current PAP status to me really with its smiles.</p>

              Just wonder, why the police never report and warn plp on the crime watch once mother report it.  Do they want something to really happen before they decided to warn the plp?
              Basic on the following statement make them, it sound to me that the police is more like unhappy that the victim post it online and try to warn other parents on such things.
