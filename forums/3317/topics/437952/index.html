              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A private investigator has claimed that he was abused
               and handcuffed by a Certis Cisco officer outside the Embassy of Israel 
              while he was investigating an alleged adultery case, and is suing the 
              security company and its employee Chua Geok Teck for assault and 
              wrongful arrest.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Simon Suppiah 
              Sunmugam, 62, was conducting surveillance around the vicinity of Stevens
               Road and Dalvey Road on March 10, 2009, when the alleged abuse took 
              place, the High Court heard on the first day of hearings on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Sunmugam said that he had not been aware the embassy was nearby as there are no signs indicating it was a restricted place.<br><br>In
               court papers, the former police officer claimed that on the day of the 
              incident, a male Caucasian employee of the embassy's security department
               had first approached him. Mr Sunmugam had said that he was waiting for 
              someone, and Mr Chua was alerted to the incident.<br><br>Mr Sunmugam claimed that Mr Chua had approached him in an aggressive manner and he was accused of being a suspected terrorist.<br><br>He
               added that Mr Chua then violently handcuffed his right wrist and swiped
               at his feet, causing him to fall face down onto the ground. Throughout 
              the incident, Mr Sunmugam did not declare that he is a private 
              investigator.<br><br>In court, Mr Sunmugam said he was restrained for 30
               minutes and his handcuffed hand was yanked many times, causing him 
              tremendous pain. As a result, he was emotionally and psychologically 
              disturbed for a year, he said. <br><br>The court also heard that Mr Sunmugam had his injuries captured on video and photographs. <br><br>During cross-examination, defence lawyer Gary Low said that Mr Sunmugam's account is "completely inconsistent" with his case. <br><br>He
               told Mr Sunmugam: "Your account is wholly unbelievable and grossly 
              exaggerating", and noted that Mr Sunmugam's medical report following the
               incident indicated that he was "discharged well without the need for a 
              follow up".<br><br>The court also heard that Mr Sunmugam had insulted Mr
               Chua by saying he is "lowly educated" and is "not a real policeman", 
              while Mr Chua had remained polite.<br><br>Mr Low added that when Mr Chua
               attempted to reach for Mr Sunmugam's bag, Mr Sunmugam shoved Mr Chua's 
              hand away and caused the latter to fall. Mr Sunmugam disagreed with Mr 
              Low, saying he neither insulted nor pushed Mr Chua.<br><br>The hearing continues on Wednesday.</span></span></p>
