              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Medisave contribution may go up as the need for long-term care increases with Singapore's aging population. </span></p>
              <p><span>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the current contribution rate
              of 6.5% to about 9% does not build up enough reserves to pay for both
              big medical bills and long-term care.
              <br> <br>Medisave has been around for 25 years and was originally meant to
              pay for major hospital stays but its use has since been expanded to
              include some outpatient payments. <br> <br> Mr Khaw said the current contribution rate is not enough to cover long-term healthcare bills. 
              <br> <br> "We've never priced that into Medisave contribution rate. So that's a
              topic almost certainly I see a need for discussion during the upcoming
              Budget Debate," he said. <br> <br> Speaking on the sidelines of his visit to the Bloodbank@HSA on
              Thursday, Mr Khaw said the increase in contribution rate will depend on
              what the Members of Parliament are ready to support. <br> <br> Meanwhile, more money will be injected into the common health subsidy pool for citizens. 
              <br> <br> This follows the ministry's decision to reduce health subsidies given
              to permanent residents (PRs) from January 1 next year. The idea is to
              further sharpen the distinction between Singapore citizens and PRs.
              <br> <br>The Health Ministry said in a statement: "Citizens enjoy heavy
              subsidy in Class B2 and C wards. PRs receive significant subsidy while
              foreigners are not subsidised at all. The subsidy distinction reflects
              the privileges of citizenship, but there is scope for refinement."
              <br> <br> PRs now get 10 percentage points less in subsidy than citizens. This will go up to a 20-point difference by 2012. 
              <br> <br>With the revision, citizens are still entitled to an 80% subsidy
              for a Class C ward. But PRs will be entitled to 60% of cost, down from
              70%. <br> <br> And Mr Khaw explained how the cost savings from the move will be used. 
              <br> <br> "Our data suggests that about 6% of our patients are PRs, so this
              reduction in subsidy for them, will save us about seven million dollars
              a year, which we would then use to top up our growing subsidy for
              citizens." <br> <br> The minister said that it is only right for citizens to enjoy more subsidies than non-citizens. 
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw added that the move will mean PRs have to make some adjustments like getting additional health insurance. 
              <br> <br> "If you're not already insured with a private shield, then you should
              seriously think about taking up one because your basic MediShield is
              really aimed at the B2, C subsidy rates. So now that your subsidy will
              be less, I think you need to augment it with a private shield."
              <br> <br> To help the PRs affected by the policy to ease into the adjustments, the reduction will be carried out in stages. 
              <br> <br>From January 1 next year, the subsidy for PRs in the public
              hospitals (Class B2 and C wards) and specialist outpatient clinics will
              be reduced by 5 percentage-points.
              <br> <br>From July 1 next year, another 5 percentage-point reduction will
              apply in the public hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics. <br> <br> Also from July 1 next year, the subsidy for PRs in the intermediate and 
              <br> long-term care sector like community hospitals and nursing homes will be reduced by 5 percentage-points.
              <br> <br> From January 1, 2012, another 5 percentage-point reduction will apply in the intermediate and long-term care sector.
              <br> <br> By 2012, there will be a 20 percentage-point difference in healthcare subsidies between citizens and PRs.
