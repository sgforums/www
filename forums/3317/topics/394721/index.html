              <p>SINGAPORE: Some 4,000 fans of Tom Jones were left disappointed on Friday evening when he ended his concert at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) abruptly after two songs.</p>
              <p>Callers to the MediaCorp hotline said the concert started at 8.15pm.</p>
              <p>They said the singer appeared on stage and sang two songs.</p>
              <p>He then explained that he could not continue as he was not feeling well.</p>
              <p>One concert—goer told MediaCorp: "Tom Jones said ’My voice isn’t good, I can’t continue. I hope we can do this again some time. Sorry’."</p>
              <p>Five minutes later, an announcement was made explaining that the concert would be rescheduled.</p>
              <p>A spokesman from RWS told MediaCorp that Tom Jones was ill.</p>
              <p>RWS is discussing with the singer’s management to see if the concert can be rescheduled.</p>
              <p>Details on ticket refunds will be available on RWS’ website and facebook page on Saturday.</p>
              <p>RWS said ticket holders should hold on to their ticket stubs and added that it would honour all refunds. — CNA/vm</p>

              <p><strong>Tom Jones concert rescheduled to 1st April </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tom Jones has rescheduled his Singapore performance 
              to next Thursday (01/04), after last night's abrupt end to his concert.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">The 69-year-old Welshman sang just two songs in 
              Resorts World Sentosa's Compass Ballroom, before announcing that he 
              could not continue performing.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">In a statement, the integrated resort said the singer
               has been diagnosed with Acute Laryngitis and under doctor's advice, he 
              will remain in Singapore to recuperate over the next few days.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">The singer and his management also apologized to all 
              concert goers for the unexpected postponement of the concert.</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Guests will be required to produce their ticket stub 
              from the 26th of March concert for entry. <br> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Arial;">A full refund, including the $3 SISTIC booking fee 
              will also be made available to guests who choose to give the concert a 
              miss.</span> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial;"><br> But the $1 handling fee will not be refunded.</span></p>

              <p>Guys, i really hate you all not caring for Sir Tom Jones. I respect that singer because his music is good to listen to. So please, be considerate and just pray for his recovery for crying out loud. From the way i view it, i see only a few posts being caring to him. Please, he is old and when you are at old age, you tend to get sick. Tom Jones did a wise decision by stopping the concert not because he was selfish, but because of he was caring of his own health and he knew that if he didn't, things would be more worse like further dissapointment and a risk of more severe health problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, i beg of you all to pray for his recovery and hope that he will perform better in his rescheduled performance.</p>

              <p><strong>Tom Jones scraps show</strong></p>
              <p>WELSH singing icon Tom Jones has cancelled his show at Resorts World 
              Sentosa (RWS) - again.</p>
              <p>The 69-year-old singer's doctor has advised him against 
              carrying on with the show on Thursday night as he 'could risk serious 
              permanent damage to his vocals'.</p>
              <p>Jones stopped his show after two songs there last Friday
               and has been diagnosed with acute laryngitis. He has been recuperating 
              in Singapore since then. Thursday's performance was supposed to be his 
              make-up show.</p>
              <p>In a statement on Thursday, RWS said Thursday's concert 
              had been called off due to Jones' being 'genuinely ill'.</p>
              <p>'He stayed behind in Singapore with the full intention 
              to perform for his fans. He was advised by his doctor only today against
               risking permanent loss of his vocals by staging the performance. We 
              again apologise to our guests,' said Andrea Teo, RWS vice president of 
              entertainment.</p>
              <p>RWS assured patrons that full ticket refunds would be 
              made. The management also apologised for disappointing Singapore fans 
              and said it would try to reschedule the performances in the near future.
               Separately, Jones' management team also released a statement, saying 
              that Jones' doctor had forced the star to cancel the concert.</p>
              <p>'Sir Tom has been resting his voice all week in 
              Singapore, with regular checkups with local specialists. Unfortunately, 
              the doctors are nevertheless unable to guarantee that Sir Tom would be 
              able to perform the full show tonight at 100 per cent vocal strength. In
               addition, they have warned that by performing, Sir Tom could risk 
              serious permanent damage to his vocals.'</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, an irate Indonesian concert-goer - one of 
              4,000 disappointed by Jones' walkout last Friday - has issued a letter 
              demanding compensation from the singer and RWS, reported mypaper.</p>
              <p>Mr Hotman Paris Hutapea, 50, a litigation lawyer and 
              founder of law firm Hotman Paris and Partners in Jakarta, said his firm 
              is preparing to file a civil suit against RWS, its agent in Indonesia 
              and the singer.</p>
              <p>He is also seeking compensation for his and his friend's
               expenses on flight, accommodation and transportation, and punitive 
              damages of US$2 million.</p>
              <p>He and his friend each bought a $368 concert ticket. He 
              paid $540 for flights for both of them, and stayed two nights at the 
              Mandarin Orchard Singapore. He told mypaper he was filing a civil suit 
              because he wanted to teach the singer and the concert organisers 'a 
              lesson'.</p>
