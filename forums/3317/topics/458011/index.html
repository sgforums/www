              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that 
              Singapore and China can work together to make the economies of both 
              countries more resilient.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking in an interview with China correspondents based in Singapore ahead of his official trip to China. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Lee has since 
              arrived in Chengdu on the first leg of a six-day visit to China at the 
              invitation of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.<br><br>Mr Lee spoke of 
              Europe's deep-seated woes and America's weak recovery. He said Asia is 
              now "the brightest spot in the global economy".<br><br>Hence, Asian economies should work together to make up for the absence of demand in Western countries, said Mr Lee.<br><br>Mr
               Lee pointed to how Singapore and China can work together to develop 
              capabilities and upgrade each other's economies for the long term.<br><br>But he also noted how this pattern will change as China progresses to a more highly skilled economy.<br> <br>He said other countries, including Singapore too, will have to develop new skills to complement new players.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "I think Singapore is moving forward, because we also do not want to remain where we are indefinitely.<br><br>"We have to have better standards of living, higher skills, more productive workers, more competitive economy.  <br><br>"So
               I see ourselves developing more capabilities and we hope that these 
              will also be capabilities which will have a market in China and which 
              will complement what China is doing.<br><br>"There will always be room for different economies to do different things; it is a very big world."<br><br>Mr Lee also talked about the South China Sea maritime dispute between China and some ASEAN economies.<br><br>He
               said that while Singapore is not a claimant state, the country has an 
              interest in ASEAN being strong, cohesive and effective in solving issues
               to maintain peace in the region.<br><br>There is also interest in freedom of navigation since Singapore is heavily dependent on international trade.<br><br>Mr
               Lee pointed out that it is important that disputes are settled in line 
              with international laws, particularly that of the United Nations 
              Convention on the Law of the Sea.<br> <br>He explained that Singapore is
               a small country and if arguments are settled by force, it would create a
               "very disorderly international environment" which would prove to be 
              "bad for all countries".<br><br>Mr Lee also responded to a question on 
              how far Singapore needs to go before achieving its aim of being an 
              offshore international centre for Renminbi (RMB), the Chinese currency.<br><br>Mr Lee said there is still some distance to go.<br><br>So
               far, it is understood that Singapore will be an RMB centre and one of 
              the Chinese banks will be designated an RMB clearing bank. As to which 
              is the bank, Mr Lee said it is up to China to decide.<br><br>On a 
              lighter note, Mr Lee said he is looking forward to the two Chinese 
              pandas - Jia Jia and Kai Kai - which are expected to arrive in Singapore
               from Chengdu next week. <br><br>He said the pandas' arrival is a sign 
              of friendship between Singapore and China. Mr Lee hopes that while two 
              pandas will come, maybe three will go home.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
