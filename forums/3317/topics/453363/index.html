              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A fishmonger who fled to Malaysia while on trial for 
              beating a man in 2003 was on Friday given a 25-month jail sentence and 
              three strokes of the cane.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>45-year-old Chua 
              Chai Chuan pleaded guilty to a series of offences, including 
              abscondence, theft and possessing a false Singaporean passport.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The offences started
               in March 2003 when Chua, who was S$20,000 in debt, turned the tables on
               a debt collector who came knocking at the door of his Toa Payoh flat. <br> <br>Chua
               cornered his debt collector at a staircase landing and hit him with a 
              77-centimetre long iron rod. He also stole his victim's mobile phone 
              during the attack.<br><br>Chua was then charged with causing grievous hurt to 36-year-old Tan Kok Wee, and a separate count of extortion in 2003.<br> <br>However, he did not show up in court for a scheduled hearing on 21 July 2003.<br> <br>Insteady, he fled to Johor Bahru the next day - the same day a warrant was issued against him. <br> <br>Chua stayed in Johor Bahru for the next seven years.<br> <br>In
               2008, he was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the 
              two charges brought against him in 2003, as he was still at large. <br> <br>However, he was arrested by Malaysian police in August 2010 for an alleged offence. <br> <br>While
               he was in prison in Malaysia, Chua met a man called "Ah Peng", who 
              offered to make a false Singaporean passport for him in exchange for 
              Chua taking the rap for the alleged offence. <br><br>Chua was repatriated to Singapore upon his release from the Malaysian prison in May 2011. <br> <br>But two months later, he was arrested by the police here after he was found to have a fake passport in his possession.<br> <br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
