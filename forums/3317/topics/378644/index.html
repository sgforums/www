              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A cosmetic surgeon has been fined S$2,000 for professional misconduct. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Singapore Medical Council's Disciplinary Committee found Dr
                  Jonathan Lee Yi Liang, a hand surgeon who practises at True 'Est in
                  Ngee Ann City, to have failed to exercise necessary supervision in the
                  prescription and supply of diazepam, a sedative.
                  <br> <br>The disciplinary committee found that the nurses were given full
                  autonomy to administer and dispense medication without requiring
                  medical consultation or the doctor's written instructions.
                  <br> <br>The charge was in relation to carrying out a body contouring
                  procedure by laser lipolysis, known as SmartLipo, on one of his
                  patients.
                  <br> <br> He was censured and ordered to provide a written undertaking not to engage in such practices again.
                  <br> <br> Dr Lee was acquitted of a charge of not getting proper informed consent from his patient for the procedure.

              <p><strong>Another plastic surgeon guilty of professional misconduct</strong></p>
              <p>The Singapore Medical Council has found another cosmetic surgeon guilty of professional misconduct. <br> <br> Dr Martin Huang Hsiang Shui, who practises at The Cosmetic Surgery
              Clinic at the Paragon, had performed cell therapy involving the
              injection of animal foetal cells into patients for anti-ageing and
              rejuvenation purposes. <br> <br> The procedure was not generally accepted by the medical profession,
              outside the context of a formal and approved clinical trial. <br> <br> Dr Huang pleaded guilty to the charge. <br> <br> In his mitigation Dr Huang, had stated that he had gone through 6 months of research self-experimentation. <br> <br> However, the Council’s disciplinary committee felt that whilst he may
              be at liberty to try the procedure on himself, he was not entitled to
              inflict an unaccepted treatment on members of the public. <br> <br> He was fined 5,000 dollars and censured. <br> <br> Dr Huang was also ordered to give a written undertaking not to engage in such conduct. <br> <br> He was also ordered to pay costs of the disciplinary proceedings. <br> <br> A cosmetic surgeon has been fined 2,000 dollars for professional misconduct. <br> <br> Earlier this week, Dr Jonathan Lee Yi Liang, who practises at True ‘Est in Ngee Ann City, was found guilty of the same charge. <br> <br> He was found to have failed to exercise necessary supervision in the prescription and supply of diazepam, a sedative.</p>

              <p><strong>Three Gps suspended and fined for misusing hypnotic drugs</strong></p>
              <p>Three General Practitioners have been fined between two and ten
              thousand dollars for improperly prescribing hypnotic drugs to patients. <br> <br> According to the Singapore Medical Council, the three have also been suspended from practicing for between three and 30 months. <br> <br> Dr Wong Cheng Yiew had inappropriately prescribed Benzodiazepines, a
              hypnotic medication used to treat patients with insomnia and anxiety
              related problems. <br> <br> The Council said Dr Wong had also prescribed cough mixtures containing
              codeine, which could potentially be abused by drug addicts. <br> <br> Because of his repeated offences, he has been suspended for 30 months and fined $10 000. <br> <br> The other two GPs - Dr Sim Tiong Puay and Dr Ng Chee Keong -- were also
              disciplined by the SMC for failing to exercise due care in using these
              medications.</p>

              <p><strong>Haematologist suspended</strong></p>
              <p>The Singapore Medical Council has suspended a haematologist for three
              months for failing to exercise due care on his patient who subsequently
              died. <br> <br> A disciplinary inquiry against Dr Toh Keng Kiat was held after the patient’s wife complained in August 2005. <br> <br> Dr Toh, who was a consultant haematologist at K K Toh Clinic, had
              administered chemotherapy on the patient who was suffering from <br> lymphoma between February and April of that year without testing him for Hepatitis B as was the usual practice. <br> <br> The patient was tested and diagnosed with Hepatitis-B in May and was hospitalised at Gleneagles Hospital. <br> <br> Dr Toh discharged the patient three days later although it was a potentially life threatening condition. <br> <br> The patient passed away 11 days later. <br> <br> The cause of death was certified as Hepatitis-B with Non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma as a contributing condition. <br> <br> Dr Toh was also censured and ordered to provide a written undertaking to the Medical Council. <br> <br> His suspension took effect on October the 30th 2009.</p>
