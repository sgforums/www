              <p>A 24-YEAR-OLD polytechnic student was on Friday sentenced to 13 
              years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane for raping a 13-year-old 
              secondary school student.</p>
              <p>Wang Jianbin had befriended the girl in October 2008 after coming 
              across her email address in the 'making friends' column of a teenage 
              magazine. They started to communicate via text mesages and telephone 
              calls.</p>
              <p>But he started asking her sexual questions and sent her sexually 
              explicit text messages. In December 2009, he asked to meet at her home.</p>
              <p>The girl asked two male friends, 17 and 18, to hide in her mother's room and to call for help if she could not handle Wang.</p>
              <p>When Wang arrived, the girl brought him to her room as he 
              demanded. She did so because she thought he would not dare to do 
              anything to her because her brother was having a lesson with his piano 
              teacher in the living room. But inside, Wang molested her.</p>
              <p>One of the girl's male friends came into the room and 
              struggled with Wang but he made the girl tell the friend to leave. Both 
              teenage boys then went to seek help from a nearby fire post, in their 
              absence, Wang raped the girl. The two teenage boys then returned with 
              several civil defence officers. The police arrived shortly after and 
              arrested Wang.</p>

              1.Challenge that beast into calling the cops if he doesn't leave the room immediately.
                                  
              2. Alert the piano teacher and the girl's brother.
                                  
              3. Either me or friend go to nearby fire post, of course 1 must stay!!!

              <p>This guy has some balls, figuratively and literally.</p>
              <p>The girl and her friends have got to be pretty darn timid to have let this happen, even as victims.</p>
              <p>I honestly can't imagine how it will be like for him in prison though, with his fellow imates aware of the atrocities he committed.</p>
              <p>Beyond all this, I really sympathise with the girl. She lost her virginity at 13 years of age (I am assuming she is), and because of rape. Not a typical rape incident too, one that happened in the comforts of her home ( her room in fact), with her 2 older male friends and brother nearby and aware of impending harm coming to her before the crime took place.</p>
              <p>I wonder if something will happen to the guy beyond the law.</p>

              <p>This guy has some balls, figuratively and literally.</p>
              <p>The girl and her friends have got to be pretty darn timid to have let this happen, even as victims.</p>
              <p>I honestly can't imagine how it will be like for him in prison though, with his fellow imates aware of the atrocities he committed.</p>
              <p>Beyond all this, I really sympathise with the girl. She lost her virginity at 13 years of age (I am assuming she is), and because of rape. Not a typical rape incident too, one that happened in the comforts of her home ( her room in fact), with her 2 older male friends and brother nearby and aware of impending harm coming to her before the crime took place.</p>
              <p>I wonder if something will happen to the guy beyond the law.</p>

              <p>But this is caning AND jail sentence... probably kids think that getting caned makes them appear cooler and more 'badass' in front of other schoolmates.</p>
              <p>This guy is an adult, who is he gonna 'show off' to? After caning, he will be in a prison cell for 13 years with other criminals.</p>
              <p>Adults different from kids... kids have strange behavioural patterns due to their immaturity I guess? Hahaha</p>
