              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A S$20m makeover to convert the former Changi General Hospital into a luxurious spa resort has been shelved. </span></p>
              <p><span>Separately, plans to develop a former military camp for commercial use have also stalled.
              <br> <br> Changi Point is located in an idyllic part of eastern Singapore, a perfect getaway for stressed urbanites.
              <br> <br> Tapping on the potential of the area, land authorities have earmarked several state buildings for commercial use.
              <br> <br> These include the 70-year-old former Changi General Hospital. Tender
              for this site was awarded to Premium Pacific, a subsidiary of Bestway
              Properties, for a proposed spa and resort development. <br> <br> The project was to have been completed by the first half of 2008. But today, the building stands vacant.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) said the site was returned to the
              state on 11 January this year upon expiry of the initial three-year
              term lease.
              <br> <br> When contacted, the developer declined to comment on reasons for the project falling through.
              <br> <br>Property analysts said the reasons could include developers not
              being able to meet conditions tied to the preservation of a historical
              site.
              <br> <br>Nicholas Mak, real estate lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, said:
              "Sometimes it could be (because the developer could not meet the
              required) modifications to the building. Sometimes it could be...for
              example, if the building was originally earmarked for hospitality, the
              developer may find that they may not be able to find a tenant for
              hospitality use but they may find one perhaps for commercial use which
              may not be in the authorities' original plan." <br> <br> Nearby, a former military camp at Hendon Road had been put up for hotel
              use. The project has also stalled. The SLA said the bidders had "failed
              to meet the tender requirements". <br> <br> Responding to queries from MediaCorp, the SLA and the Urban
              Redevelopment Authority (URA) said the pace of development is market
              driven. It added the stalled projects will not affect the overall
              vision to develop Changi Point into a leisure destination.
              <br> <br>Analysts also cited Changi's rustic charm as a draw. Mr Mak said:
              "The plan to transform Changi into a recreation area is a more medium-
              to long-term plan and it is important to find the right kind of uses or
              tenants or developers in that area than to rush through the process and
              end up having a wrong mix for that area." <br> <br> Both SLA and URA said they are working together to put up the sites for
              suitable uses in the near future. They also pointed to other projects
              at Changi that have taken off. These include converting the
              single-storey Art-Deco style house, built in 1934, into a seafood
              restaurant.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile a project to develop the site at a former commando
              headquarters at Fairy Point Hill into a hotel is ongoing. The first
              phase of that development is expected to be completed by the end of
              this year.

              <p>a group of my friends went there the other time, saw another new group of ah bengs walking in, we hid behind the bushes and made some eerie sounds and they thought it spooks. think it scared the living daylights out of them. perhaps all the hauntings were caused by pranksters like us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
