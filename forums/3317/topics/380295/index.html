              <p><strong>McDonald's worker dies of 'overwork': officials</strong></p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>TOKYO (AFP) - â€“ A store manager with
              hamburger chain McDonald's in Japan who died of a brain haemorrhage was
              a victim of "karoshi" or death by overwork, a regional labour office
              said Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The woman, employed at an outlet in Yokohama
              near Tokyo and reportedly aged 41, had done more than 80 hours of
              overtime per month before she collapsed in October 2007 during a
              training programme at a different store.</p>
              <p>She died in hospital three days later, said an official at the Kanagawa Labour Bureau, which oversees the Yokohama region.</p>
              <p>"We
              determined her work caused the illness," said the official in charge of
              work-related compensation, a decision that makes her dependent family
              members eligible to receive a public pension.</p>
              <p>"She had early
              symptoms such as headaches some three weeks before she collapsed, and
              we presume she already had the illness at that point."</p>
              <p>McDonald's
              Co. (Japan) Ltd. declined to comment on the case, with a spokesman
              saying only that the company had not been contacted by authorities and
              had not confirmed the decision by itself.</p>
              <p>The woman had
              performed more than 80 hours of overtime a month on average for the six
              months before she suffered early symptoms, although she had a vacation
              shortly before she collapsed in October, the official said.</p>
              <p>Japan's
              welfare and labour ministry investigates whether deaths are caused by
              excessive work if the victim had performed monthly overtime of 80 hours
              or more for the preceding six months, or 100 hours for the previous one
              month.</p>
              <p>The number of deaths, usually through strokes or heart
              attacks, in Japan that are classified as "karoshi" has been hovering at
              around 150 annually in recent years, according to ministry data.</p>
              <p>McDonald's
              suffered a blow to its image when a Tokyo court last year ordered it to
              pay compensation of more than 70,000 dollars to an employee who had
              performed unpaid overtime for several years.</p>
              <p>The plaintiff,
              who had carried the job title of store manager, had earlier said he
              sometimes worked more than 100 hours of unpaid overtime in a month.</p>
              <p>Japan's
              labour laws do not oblige companies to pay overtime to workers in
              managerial posts. McDonald's argued their store chiefs have a say in
              management decisions, but the court rejected that argument.</p>

              <p>oh okay...</p>
              <p>7.2 x 26 = 187.2 (normal working hours)</p>
              <p>187.2 + 80 = 267.2</p>
              <p>267.2 / 26 = 10.28 hours per day.</p>
              <p>Taking a normal retail staff that work 9 to 9 and 6 days a week... I think most of the retail staff in sg would die too.</p>
