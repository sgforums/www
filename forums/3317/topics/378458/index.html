              <div class="cap">[South Korea and Japan have agreed an aid proposal for North Korea]</div>
              <p class="first">Â </p>
              <p>During talks in Beijing, the three leaders said they were committed to a denuclearised Korean peninsula.</p>
              <p>Tokyo
              and Seoul have been pushing a policy of withholding aid packages until
              after the North has dismantled its nuclear weapons programme.</p>
              <p>But correspondents say that winning the support of China - a key ally of Pyongyang - may not be easy.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>North
              Korea has already indicated that it may return to multi-party talks on
              the nuclear issue but has also said it wants direct negotiations with
              the US first.</p>
              <p>In a joint statement issued after their morning
              summit in Beijing, the leaders said: "We will remain committed to
              dialogue and consultation and continue to work through peaceful means
              to pursue the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.</p>
              <p>"We
              will make joint efforts with other parties for an early resumption of
              the six-party talks, so as to safeguard peace and stability in
              north-east Asia."</p>
              <p>The six-party talks involve the two Koreas, China, the US, Russia and Japan.</p>
              <p>The
              leaders in Beijing also said that they would work closely together to
              make the upcoming global climate change talks in Denmark a success.</p>
              <p><strong>Improved ties</strong></p>
              <p>Chinese
              Premier Wen Jiabao, who recently visited North Korea, said the country
              appeared to be open to discussions and it was time to "seize the
              opportunity" to make progress.</p>
              <p>"North Korea does not only hope
              to improve relations with the United States, it also hopes to do so
              with South Korea and Japan," he said.</p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/46526000/jpg/_46526664_008073878-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao (C) and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il (R) in Pyongyang (4 October 2009)" width="226" height="170"></p>
              <p>"This is the deepest impression I got from my visit," he said.</p>
              <p>On
              Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was reported to have told Mr
              Wen he was "willing to attend multilateral talks, including the
              six-party talks".</p>
              <p>But Mr Kim said doing so was dependent on
              North Korea first holding bilateral talks with the US, a request
              Washington has not confirmed it will grant.</p>
              <p>The US has said it
              is willing to engage directly with North Korea, but only as part of a
              return to the six-party forum. Washington wants the North's complete
              denuclearisation.</p>
              <p>Mr Wen said he supported the idea of direct US-North Korea talks.</p>
              <p>But
              South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak said that while he also welcomed
              the idea, the "final purpose of any talks between South and North Korea
              should be denuclearisation of North Korea".</p>
              <p><strong>Conditions</strong></p>
              <p>On
              Friday, Mr Lee and Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said
              sanctions against North Korea should remain in place until it began
              dismantling its nuclear programme.</p>
              <p>But Mr Lee told reporters
              the countries had agreed on the "need for a fundamental and
              comprehensive solution" to the nuclear issue.</p>
              <p>The two leaders
              agreed to offer North Korea a one-off package of aid in exchange for
              denuclearisation, instead of the step-by-step measures that have been
              followed since the talks began in 2003.</p>
              <p>As North Korea's biggest trading partner, China holds the greatest sway over the secretive Pyongyang regime.</p>
              <p>The
              BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing says South Korea and Japan might find
              it tough to win China's public support for their latest proposals as
              Beijing sees North Korea as a close ally.</p>
              <p>But there was a sense
              of optimism following Saturday's meeting, which was a rare chance for
              the three regional powers to show unity, our correspondent says.</p>
              <p>Pyongyang
              pulled out of the six party talks in April this year and tensions in
              the region rose after it launched a series of missiles and conducted an
              underground nuclear test - drawing UN sanctions in response.</p>
              <p>The country had previously said it would never re-engage with the multilateral talks.</p>
