              <p>why?</p>
              <p>PR is not difficult if u got a job which earns u 4k+/month.</p>
              <p>this case is not that serious leh, attempted only.</p>
              <p>8k is quite heavy fine for 1st time offender not involving private parts. <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; font-size: 12px; border-collapse: collapse;">Even some cases not involving private parts are allowed to compound such as <a style="font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none; color: #462c75; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_581085.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking...ry_581085.html</a></span></p>
              <p>remember mark chow case which involved multiple touchings of private parts, only 6k fine. But cannot compare leh, because chow was defended by #1 lawyer.</p>

              how do the law interpret molest-related cases?
              
              recently there was a case which was compounded.  the alleged molester paid the victim.

              <p>Decision made by the court is based on complete facts of the case which can be up to thousand pages of docs. We are here just readers who read superficial info from newspaper. Don't try to be smart to tell the court what to do.</p>

              <p>your argument is based on assumption that all offenders will repeat their mistakes. Such an assumption is groundless.</p>
              <p>with due respect, let take a different angle, imagine that you or your son run into an unfortunate incident with law, do you still think that jail is mandatory. (sorry, forgive me, just an unreal immagination).</p>
              <p>Decision made by the court is based on complete facts of the case which can be up to thousand pages of docs. We are here just readers who read superficial info from newspaper. Don't try to be smart to tell the court what to do.</p>
              <p>Singapore court is famous for its clean system, respectable and well-paid judges. They won't do a shoddy job.</p>

              <p>from what i know, it is considered 'molest' as long as the girl/victim doesn't allow it. <span style="color: #0000ff;">so if a girl touches a guy without his consent, he is being molested.</span></p>
