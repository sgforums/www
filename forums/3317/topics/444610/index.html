              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's economy grew 4.8 per cent in 2011, 
              significantly slower than the dramatic rebound of 14.7 per cent growth 
              in 2010.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It is slightly below the forecast of around five per cent by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong, who announced the growth figures in his 2012 New Year 
              message on Saturday, described the pace of growth for the year as 
              "steady".<br><br>He warned that with the external environment uncertain 
              and debt problems in Europe far from solved, 2012 will look like a 
              difficult year for the global economy.<br><br>He said that Singapore, as a small, open country, will inevitably be affected. <br><br>Mr
               Lee said 2011 was a significant year for Singapore, when its people 
              went to the polls twice, and elected a new government and President.<br><br>He
               said that having made a significant political transition, the country 
              and its people are now adjusting to new norms in a changed environment. <br><br>Mr
               Lee said that amidst this flux, Singapore needs to be confident of its 
              position and clear about its priorities and plans to build a better 
              country.<br><br>The prime minister said the government is working hard to tackle the immediate challenges. <br><br>It is committed to keeping homes affordable to all Singaporeans.<br><br>In 2011, it launched 25,000 Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, which enabled many first timers to book their HDB flats.<br><br>In 2012, it's launching another 25,000 BTO flats. <br><br>In
               the private property market, the new Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty will
               moderate capital inflows and foreign demand, and help to stabilise 
              prices.<br><br>Mr Lee said the government will redouble efforts to improve the public transport system and expand the train and bus network. <br><br>It will identify and put right the causes of the recent Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) service disruptions.<br><br>The Circle Line, completed in October, now transports 300,000 commuters daily, and more MRT lines are on the way. <br><br>Mr Lee said the government will also continue to enhance bus services to improve the daily commuting experience.<br><br>But these improvements will take time, and he urged the commuting public to "bear with us".<br><br>Mr Lee said beyond these pressing concerns, the government is attending to long-term issues to improve Singaporeans' lives. <br><br>Healthcare, he said, must stay affordable and accessible to give Singaporeans peace of mind. <br><br>The government is enhancing the education system to give young Singaporeans the best possible start in life.<br><br>Mr Lee stressed the importance of upholding inclusive growth and social mobility as pillars of a united Singapore. <br><br>He said this calls both for upgrading skills and productivity to improve wages, and for strengthening social safety nets. <br><br>And
               given Singapore's low birth rate, the country needs to find workable 
              solutions to keep society and the economy vibrant and forward-looking.<br><br>Mr Lee described population as a "particularly complex challenge" which involves unavoidable trade-offs.<br><br>He
               said these issues will be discussed in the coming year, so that 
              Singaporeans understand better what is at stake, and the choices they 
              must make as a nation.<br><br>Mr Lee said overall, there is every reason to be confident and optimistic. <br><br>He
               said Singaporeans pulled together as one nation to overcome the 2008 
              Global Financial Crisis and stressed that the country must never lose 
              its strengths.<br><br>He expressed confidence that Singaporeans will 
              continue to bond as one people and "walk shoulder to shoulder into a 
              brighter tomorrow" in a changing world.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
