              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: There are mixed reactions from residents in response 
              to the Health Ministry's plan to proceed with building a nursing home, 
              the Lions Home for the Elders, in a Bishan housing estate.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Some residents had earlier expressed concerns that the home would block their view and cause traffic congestion.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>MP for Bishan-Toa 
              Payoh GRC Mr Wong Kan Seng said he and his grassroots leaders have 
              worked with the Health Ministry to study how the concerns of residents 
              can be mitigated.<br><br>The decision has been made to build the nursing
               home on a plot of land at Bishan Street 13, after an earlier dialogue 
              was held with Bishan East residents on May 27.<br><br>Reactions to the announcement to proceed with the construction have been mixed.<br><br>N.
               Sethuranman, a Bishan resident who has stayed in the area for about 20 
              years, said: "We thought they would revert the decision, and go for a 
              better place - closer to the MRT or something."<br><br>Ronnie Ho, 
              another Bishan resident, echoed similar sentiments. He said: "We are 
              already very congested in this area, so why are we now building a 
              building, putting it right in the middle of three blocks of flats? We'll
               just increase the flow of traffic (in the area)."<br><br>Faraaz, who 
              has stayed in Bishan for 15 years, said: "Residents have mentioned that 
              the view is going to be obstructed and (the authorities) have responded 
              appropriately. They've said they'll build green spaces and make it 
              accessible to the public. It's not going to be just a hospice, I think 
              that's a misconception many people have."<br><br>"Right now, what we 
              should do is that since the thing has been decided, let's embrace it and
               make it better. We had a dialogue and they spoke to us, and they've 
              given us good suggestions like how to make it benefit the residents 
              around here," said Charles Yee.<br><br>In a written response to Channel 
              NewsAsia, MP for the area Wong Kan Seng said he supports the plans to 
              build the nursing home. He said with a fast ageing population, the 
              demand for nursing homes is expected.<br><br>In response to alternative 
              sites raised by residents, the Health Ministry said it has since worked 
              with other planning agencies, such as the URA and HDB, to study these 
              sites.<br><br>But in land scarce Singapore - the green field sites have 
              already been designated for future development to meet critical needs, 
              such as housing and education, and the shifting of the nursing home to 
              other sites will in turn displace these uses.<br><br>To address some of 
              the concerns raised by residents, MOH has agreed to cap the building at 
              six storeys. It will also incorporate design features to screen off 
              direct views of the wards and provide greenery to the rooftop and ground
               floors.<br><br>MOH said it will also ensure there are enough car 
              parking facilities in the area. It also plans to keep residents updated 
              on developments and continue to engage the residents about the actual 
              design of the nursing home.<br><br>MOH has added that it intends to build more eldercare services in HDB housing estates in the next five years.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
