              <p><strong>WSQ System well received amongst employers, workers: WDA</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Workforce Skills Qualifications System is bringing about dividends for both workers and their companies.
              <br> <br> According to a recent survey of workers and companies, 90 per cent of
              those polled experienced better work performance after training.
              <br> <br>The Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) System was introduced in
              2005. Since then 390,000 workers have obtained some form of
              certification to improve their skills levels.
              <br> <br>Of these, some 3,000 workers were surveyed between July and October
              last year. Among the key findings, 93 per cent of trainees were able to
              apply the skills acquired at work and said they could perform better at
              work.
              <br> <br>14 per cent got a pay rise, while another 12 per cent received a
              promotion. Five per cent of those surveyed moved to another company
              within the same industry with the skills training they received.
              <br> <br>The WSQ training also had a positive impact on companies. 62 per
              cent of the 572 companies surveyed experienced improvements in the area
              of work productivity.
              <br> <br>Minister of State for Manpower, Lee Yi Shyan, said: "Higher
              productivity in a process plant means minimum shutdown and quick
              turnaround. <br> <br> "We also want to urge employers and companies to fully support this
              programme because once they are able to train their workers
              consistently and be sure that their workers have the skills that are
              bringing about productivity increase at the plant and industry level,
              they will see the benefits."
              <br> <br>"The survey also showed that half of them get bigger jobs and
              better responsibilities and I think up to 12 per cent have a pay rise
              immediately. This is a very good encouragement for workers that if they
              acquire new skills, the company will put them to good use and the
              companies will appreciate them."
              <br> <br>In line with calls to enhance productivity at all levels of the
              Singapore workforce, the Workforce Skills Qualifications System is
              being expanded into new areas. <br> <br> One of them is in the chemicals industry. The Workforce Development
              Agency said this sector alone employs nearly 23,000 workers and
              continuing education and training is something which is indispensable
              for the chemicals sector.
              <br> <br>Among those who trained such workers to enhance their skills is a
              71-year-old former mechanical engineer. He had worked in Exxon Mobil
              for 30 years.
              <br> <br>Goh Kok Kheng, trainer, Petrofac Training, said: "I do training on
              pump operations and maintenance and I also look after the maintenance
              in the live plant. They are very interested in my experience and
              training which I provide. This is the advantage I have."
              <br> <br>85 per cent of the companies surveyed have indicated that they will
              continue to send their employees for WSQ courses, and a majority of the
              trainees said that they would recommend the courses to their friends.
              <br> <br>There is also greater awareness and adoption of WSQ by companies.
              The top sectors with the highest WSQ adoption rates are security,
              aerospace and tourism.</span></p>
