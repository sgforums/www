              <p><strong>Grangeford residents refuse to vacate premises, demand compensation</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Some 300 residents of troubled condominium The Grangeford
              said owner Cove Developments has no right to evict them since their
              rental leases were signed with another company.</p>
              <p>Ideal Accommodation had been contracted to rent out the apartments but Cove said that has since been terminated.</p>
              <p>The
              condominium came under the spotlight after the authorities found some
              140 apartments converted into 600 units through illegal partitions.</p>
              <p>On
              Thursday, it was supposed to be a meeting for Cove Developments to
              explain alternative accommodation which included those on shorter
              leases and hotel rooms at preferential rates at Meritus Mandarin.</p>
              <p>But
              the residents wanted answers to other burning issues. One resident
              said: "Since you’re chasing us away in 10 days, I think we should be
              talking about how to get back our compensation?"</p>
              <p>Cove said they
              cannot guarantee the deposits and advanced rent payments, since the
              money was paid to Ideal Accommodation. Residents walked out 30 minutes
              into the meeting, but some came back for more answers.</p>
              <p>One key
              issue was whether Cove, a subsidiary of Overseas Union Enterprise
              (OUE), had the right to ask residents to vacate, since the leases were
              signed with Ideal Accommodation.</p>
              <p>Steven Ng, group company
              secretary, OUE, said: "Cove Developments has taken over these premises
              and we’re in the process of obtaining a court order to repossess this
              building."</p>
              <p>The company said it plans to demolish the illegal
              partitions on June 15. But some residents have heard different stories
              from Ideal Accommodation.</p>
              <p>One resident said: "They’ve informed us
              that we can still stay up to June 30 and we can consume our deposit, so
              they’ll not refund anything to us but we can consume it. And just right
              now, Cove is telling us that their contract is terminated, how can that
              be? Where are we going to stay?"</p>
              <p>Some residents said they have paid deposits ranging from S$1,200 to S$1,800 for leases between three months to a year.</p>
              <p>Another
              resident said: "I also know of some people who have paid six months
              rent because they had an offer that if you paid six months rent, you
              get half a month off or one month off."</p>
              <p>Residents are also putting up a petition to seek compensation from Ideal Accommodation and Cove Developments.</p>

              <p><strong>Landlord tells Grangeford tenants to stay till end-June</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The housing saga at The Grangeford condominium continued on Friday.
              <br> <br> Landlord Ideal Accommodation told tenants they can stay till end-June,
              so that it does not have to return them their month's deposit. Those
              who have given more than a month's rent will get back the balance. <br> <br> There was also drama on Friday after some tenants went to Ideal's
              office demanding a staff accompany them back to The Grangeford to
              ensure the presence of a spokesperson during negotiations.
              <br> <br> Many residents were also worried they might be evicted before the end of the month.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Cove Development says that 49 former tenants of Ideal
              Accommodation have decided to stay on at The Grangeford after the June
              30 deadline. <br> <br> They are being offered rental rates of between S$2,600 and S$3,500 for a whole apartment. 
              <br> <br> Until the deadline, residents can continue to stay at The Grangeford rent-free, while they seek other accommodation.
              <br> <br> Cove recently took control of The Grangeford, after terminating the
              contract with Ideal Accommodation, which had illegally installed
              partitions in the condominium complex. <br> <br> Cove is a subsidiary of building owner Overseas Union Enterprise.

              <p><strong>Grangeford sub-tenants were in danger of having power cut off</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A new twist has emerged in the ongoing saga at The
              Grangeford. TODAY has learnt that more than 200 sub-tenants at the
              condominium in Leonie Hill were in danger of having their power cut off
              because former master tenant Ideal Accommodation did not pay the
              electricity bill.
              <br> <br>Utility firm SP Services had sent Ideal a letter on June 5, seeking
              arrears amounting to nearly S$130,000. It had to pay up by last
              Saturday or face power cuts, the letter said. It is not known if Ideal
              had settled their accounts with SP Services as the firm could not be
              contacted for a response.
              <br> <br>Now, building owner Cove Development is stepping in to help remedy
              the situation. In a statement on Monday, Cove said it had applied to SP
              to open new accounts for all the units at The Grangeford previously
              leased to Ideal.
              <br> <br>This was done so that the sub-tenants – a mix of mostly young
              expatriate and local professionals, as well as college students – did
              not have to face any power disruptions. However, they will have to pay
              Cove for utilities consumed from Saturday. <br> <br> Property consultant Savill Singapore will be collecting and issuing
              receipts of payment on behalf of Cove. The landlord declined to comment
              on the arrears owed to SP Services by Ideal.
              <br> <br>Ideal, set up by Chinese citizen Tang Yong, made headlines on June
              3 after Cove terminated its two-year lease after just five months. This
              was after Ideal failed to comply with an Urban Redevelopment Authority
              (URA) order to reinstate the property to its originally planned use and
              cease unauthorised sub-letting.
              <br> <br>Without the approval of the URA, Ideal had sub-divided 141
              apartments at The Grangeford into 600 units. These were then
              individually leased to the sub-tenants as though the property was a
              boarding house or a hostel.
              <br> <br>The failure of Ideal to comply with the URA order meant that the
              sub-tenants have until the end of the month to move out or sign a new
              and costlier lease with Cove.
              <br> <br>To help the sub-tenants cope, Cove said it would not charge rent
              from June 3 to June 30. However, a sub-tenant - who declined to be
              named - told TODAY that yesterday's development was "confusing".
              <br> <br>"We previously paid our utilities to Ideal through our deposits.
              I'm still waiting for word on a return of our deposits, but now we hear
              about this," said the 35-year-old, who moved into the condominium just
              last month.
              <br> <br> "How is Cove going to bill us – especially when we don't have a tenancy agreement with them?" he asked
              <br> <br>TODAY understands that there is a meter that records the amount of
              power used for each "sub-unit". Cove will charge the former sub-tenants
              of Ideal based on the reading. Letters were sent to update residents of
              the situation last Saturday, said a Cove spokesperson. <br> <br> In the meantime, "as the owner of Grangeford, Cove will ultimately be
              responsible to recover the property effectively and rectify the
              infringement of the Planning Act," the URA said.
              <br> <br>Cove said it would be carrying out work to remove the unauthorised
              structures and restore the units to their original layouts. Under the
              URA order, it has until July 27 to do so.

              <p><strong>40 tenants may stay on at The Grangeford under new leases</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: After a near month-long tussle, some tenants at The Grangeford may stay on at the condominium after all.
              <br> <br> About 40 of them have expressed interest to do so under the new
              landlord, Savills, although the actual number could be higher as some
              enter into joint-leases with others to rent whole apartment units.
              <br> <br>Residents had been given till 5pm on June 30 to vacate the premises
              after the previous landlord, Ideal Accommodation, got into trouble with
              the authorities for converting 140 apartments into 600 rooms. <br> <br> The new landlord, Savills, is still tallying the total number of tenants who have moved out.
              <br> <br> The condominium owner, Cove Developments, said a few tenants have
              requested for an extension to move due to various reasons such as
              travelling, and it is considering these on a case-by-case basis.
              <br> <br> Authorities were roped in to ensure those leaving did not take more than they came with.
              <br> <br>Tenants told Channel NewsAsia they were warned by management that a
              police report would be made if they took furniture that the apartments
              had come furnished with.
              <br> <br>Out of those who moved, some were unhappy with terms offered by the
              new landlord, which requires them to rent an entire apartment instead
              of individual rooms.
              <br> <br> 40 units have been offered at rates ranging from S$2,600 to S$3,500 per month, with a minimum lease period of six months.
              <br> <br>Others just had enough of the hassle. Rizky Priandika, an
              Indonesian student, said: "There are already many problems here so we
              need to move out already."
              <br> <br>Kentaro Fujiyama, an expat working in Singapore for the first time,
              said: "I cannot live under the contract with them. I haven't got my
              deposit back and the previous landlord didn't even say sorry."
              <br> <br>Another Indonesian student, George Mason, said: "I'm really pissed
              off now. I've just started staying here for one month and the contract
              said one year for me." <br> <br> Cove Developments said the tenancy agreements between Ideal Accommodation and its tenants are a private matter.
              <br> <br> At least 10 tenants told Channel NewsAsia they plan to file complaints
              with the Small Claims Tribunal for deposits ranging from S$1,200 to
              S$1,800 paid to the previous landlord. Ideal Accommodation could not be
              reached for comment.
              <br> <br>Cove Developments has declined Channel NewsAsia's request to film
              the interior of the condominium and the tearing down of the illegal
              partitions. It said that with more people expected to move out on
              Tuesday, it might be unsafe for the media to be around. <br> <br> But it added that it is on track to completing the refurbishment of all the apartments by the July 27 deadline. </span></p>

              <br> <br> Cove had obtained a court order to recover 171 apartments last Friday. 
              <br> <br> The firm would only say it is in the midst of ascertaining how many

              possession to evict them. <br> <br> Channel NewsAsia understands this will take place before the end of the week.
              <br> <br> Tenants were given till Wednesday noon to move out.  
              <br> <br> The long-drawn saga started when authorities found 140 apartments had
              been illegally converted into 600 units when Cove leased them out under
              a master contract to Ideal Accommodation. That contract has since been
              terminated. <br> <br> Cove said it has been progressively taking down the illegal partitions
              and is also offering new leases to tenants willing to stay behind. So
              far, 29 letters of intent have been signed. <br> <br> - CNA/yt </span></p>
