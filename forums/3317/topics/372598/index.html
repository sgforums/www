              <p><span>SINGAPORE: There has been a spike in the number of elderly
              citizens filing applications at the Tribunal for Maintenance of Parents
              over the last 12 months.
              <br> <br> From August 2008 to July this year, 172 people filed applications, much higher than the average of 100 in previous years.
              <br> <br>Singapore is one of the fastest ageing societies in the world,
              making the issue of adult children who cannot or will not support
              ageing parents much sharper.
              <br> <br> The elderly are left stranded to their own devices or forced to seek help from charities or the state.
              <br> <br>Responding to what he called an escalating situation, the Minister
              for Community Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan told
              Parliament on Wednesday that his ministry will tighten the system in
              three key areas.
              <br> <br> Firstly, the ministry will look at tightening workflow and referral processes. 
              <br> <br>For example, it says one third of the elderly who approach the
              Community Development Councils (CDCs) for help do not even have the
              contact details of their children.
              <br> <br>Secondly, the ministry will strengthen the office of the
              Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents so that he can play a more
              active role in mediation.
              <br> <br> Currently, mediation is used before resorting to legal means.
              <br> <br>At the end of a mediation session where the children and parents
              are brought before a three-member tribunal, a Maintenance Order is
              issued. <br> <br> Even after that, a number do not pay up. Last year, 67 Enforcement
              Orders were issued by the Family Court to compel them to do so.
              <br> <br>Hence, a third area the ministry will look at is giving elderly
              parents timely and comprehensive information on their options,
              including legal recourse, even if they choose not to take it up.
              <br> <br>Going forward, Minister Balakrishnan said he is also studying if
              the Maintenance of Parents Act itself needs to be amended so that it
              remains an active deterrent to irresponsible children. He is inviting
              public feedback on this.
              <br> <br>But he added that legislation should be a last resort. "We cannot
              legislate love nor can you use legislation in this House to guarantee
              emotional support," he said.
              <br> <br>Going forward, Dr Balakrishnan added that Singapore has to arrive
              at a situation where every generation earns and saves enough for its
              own life cycle so that the question of inter-generation dependence is
              reduced.
