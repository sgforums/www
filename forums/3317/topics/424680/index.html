              <p>An Israeli army officer who fired the entire magazine of his rifle into a 13-year-old Palestinian girl and said he 
              would have done the same if she had been 3 years old was<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> acquitted on all charges yesterday.</strong></span></p>
              <p>“Captain R”, was charged
               with minor offences for the killing of Iman al-Hams who was 
              shot 17 times as she ventured near an Israeli army post near Rafah 
              refugee camp in Gaza a year ago.</p>
              <p>The manner of Iman’s killing, and the revelation of a tape recording in 
              which the captain is warned that she was just a child who was “scared to
               death”, made the shooting one of the most controversial since the 
              Palestinian intifada erupted five years ago even though hundreds of 
              other children have also died.</p>
              <p>The military court cleared the soldier of perverting the course of justice by 
              asking soldiers under his command to alter their accounts of the 
              incident.</p>
              <p>Following the verdict, Capt R burst into tears, turned to the public benches and said: “I told you I was innocent.”</p>

              <p>###   The tape revealed that Imam was heading away from the army post when she was shot. The captain shoot Iman twice in the head, walk away, turn back and fire a stream of bullets into her body.</p>
