              <p><strong>Unemployment rate for Q1 likely to be higher than Q4 2008</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: With the first three months of 2009 just over,
              Singapore's Manpower Minister, Gan Kim Yong, said the unemployment rate
              for the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than the last
              three months of 2008.
              <br> <br>Speaking to reporters at a community event on Sunday, he said while
              his ministry is seeing more retrenchment notices being issued, schemes
              like the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) is
              helping companies cut costs to save jobs.
              <br> <br> Detailed statistics about the job market in the first quarter of this year will be released shortly, said the manpower minister.
              <br> <br>But as the economy has yet to recover, the ministry's immediate
              focus is the unemployment situation and it will continue pressing on
              with the various schemes like SPUR and Jobs Credit Scheme to tackle the
              downturn.
              <br> <br>Mr Gan said: "SPUR, Jobs Credit Scheme and the Workfare Income
              Supplement Scheme - so many programmes have been put in place, and we
              will continue to work hard with the tripartite partners to help our
              workers cope with the downturn.
              <br> <br>"But we cannot just focus on the downturn. We still have to focus
              on the longer term fundamental issues, such as re-employment,
              employment of older workers and women. This is because when the economy
              recovers, the labour market will tighten again and so we must ensure we
              have this source of workers to support our economic growth in future."
              <br> <br>Mr Gan believes SPUR has been very successful in the last four
              months. He said it has helped many companies reduce the number of
              workers who could have ended up being retrenched. With SPUR in place,
              some companies have decided to defer retrenchment and make a decision
              later.
              <br> <br> But how quickly the Singapore economy recovers depends much on external factors like the global economy's performance.
              <br> <br>Mr Gan said: "We must prepare ourselves for another few quarters of
              downturn. What is more important now is to focus on managing the
              downturn and managing costs so that we can save more jobs. <br> <br> "Sometimes during a downturn, restructuring is inevitable and some
              retrenchments are unavoidable. If employees are retrenched, we want to
              reach out to them to help them to upgrade themselves and increase their
              employability so that they can find jobs faster." <br> <br> Mr Gan added that there are several sectors in Singapore which have job
              openings and his message to job seekers is to be flexible and consider
              sectors they may not have worked in before.
