              The guy is a real ahgua. Hangs around with a group of ahgua too.
              A guy should nvr hit a girl. Being an ahgua doesnt give u the right
              To hit a girl. If I see him outside, I give him jialat2. The one recording

              <p>Action needs to be taken on this particular 2 teenagers. In addition, education about such stuffs needs to be stepped up to prevent such things from happening in the future.</p>
              <p>Such incidents are common in many countries around the world but it shouldn't happen in a country like Singapore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>Netizens outraged by teen assault inÂ lift</strong></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p>A video of an enraged youth 
              repeatedly slapping and hitting his female schoolmate in anÂ HDB lift has
               sparked a wave of outrage from SingaporeÂ netizens.Â </p>
              <p>Taken inside the lift, the videoÂ that was first postedÂ on FacebookÂ  showsÂ the 
              male student repeatedly slapping the girl and slamming her head against 
              the lift walls.Â The conversation inÂ the video reveals that theÂ girl was 
              being accused of ratting on him to the teacher, which she denied.</p>
              <p>The attack lasted more than a minute and was filmed by another female
               student.</p>
              <p>Judging from the studentsâ uniform, comments on online forums suggest
               they areÂ from Siglap Secondary School.Â  The schoolâs principal 
              Low Joo Hong confirmed this to <em>The New Paper.</em> Strangely enough,
               tough, in photos from theÂ assaulterâs blog, it seems both schoolmatesÂ are 
              close friends.Â </p>
              <p>And yet, this incident of school violence is not the first of its 
              kind in Singapore or elsewhere.</p>
              <p>In January this year, a video of a bullied
               Malaysian teen made its rounds on the Web.</p>
              <p>The video, taken atÂ the stairwell of aÂ shopping mall in Selangor, 
              shows one of the girlsÂ slapping the student before others take turns to 
              punch and kick her. The attackers continued to taunt her even as she got
               down on her knees and pleaded with them to stop.</p>
              <p>Last October, a video clip titled âShanghai Girl beatenâ was also widelyÂ circulated online. The 
              clip, shot with a mobile phone camera, lasted five minutes andÂ showsÂ a 
              femaleÂ attacker furiously kicking another girl in the waist and belly as
               well asÂ slapping her in the face.</p>
              <p>Angry netizensÂ retaliated byÂ publishing the attackerâs personal 
              information online and even launched a mass protest demanding justice 
              for her violent behaviour.</p>
              <p>Teen violence in schools is not justÂ a problem that plagues Singapore
               but isÂ increasingly a global concern.Â The recent suicide of TemasekÂ Polytechnic student Melissa 
              TohÂ also brings to mind the many problems young teens face.</p>
              <p>Do you know what your kids are up to these days and should parents 
              step up to take more responsibility?</p>
              <p>What should be done to punish those guilty ofÂ teen violence and how 
              can a repeat ofÂ such violence be avoided among youths?</p>
