              <p>Oh my...i just saw this article in a local chinese paper with regards to the 1st accident on the BKE.</p>
              <p>It seems that the truck was stationary on the right-most lane of the expressway when the car hit the back of it.</p>
              <p>On the back of the truck, one can see that all too familiar yellow coloured safety contraption that looks like it's supposed to be a crash absorber of some kind.</p>
              <p>The driver, I believe went into a coma after the accident - my heart goes out to his family and I hope he recovers from this unfortunate accident.</p>
              <p>However, my present concern is with the yellow coloured safety device mounted on the back of the stationery truck that was hit.</p>
              <p>Is it a tested (and/or proven) safety device that has been studied/approved by the local authorities (LTA/Traffic Police/etc)?</p>
              <p>If it was meant to absorb the force of the crash, I must say it did not do a very good job - as you can see from the photos as well as the status of the driver after the accident.</p>
              <p>I am also a driver and I see these trucks on the expressways almost all the time - it's a familiar sight.</p>
              <p>I wonder if I am resigned to the same fate if my car hits one of these stationary trucks while the workers are clearing rubbish?</p>
              <p>(I scanned these photos from the local chinese paper for general reference - if they infringe any copyright law or whatever, I will gladly delete them)</p>
