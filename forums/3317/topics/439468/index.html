              <p>The <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/u.s.-senate/">U.S. Senate</a> passed legislation
              punishing China for its undervalued currency as opposition from
              House Speaker <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/john-boehner/">John Boehner</a> casts doubt on whether the measure
              will become law.</p>
              <p>The Senate voted 63-35 yesterday for the measure backed by
              Democrats such as Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/charles-schumer/">Charles Schumer</a> of <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/">New York</a> and Republicans including Lindsey Graham of
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/south-carolina/">South Carolina</a> and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/jeff-sessions/">Jeff Sessions</a> of Alabama.</p>
              <p>China’s leaders and Washington opponents such as Boehner
              and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have said the measure letting
              U.S. companies seek duties on Chinese goods to offset the weak
              yuan risks starting a trade war. Senate passage put the focus on
              Boehner.</p>
              <p>“By passing by a large majority, maybe they think they
              will be able to intimidate Boehner into a vote,” <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/nicholas-lardy/">Nicholas
              Lardy</a>, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International
              Economics in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/washington/">Washington</a>, said in an interview.</p>
              <p>The Senate bill mandates that the Treasury Department
              identify misaligned currencies, instead of deciding whether a
              currency was manipulated, as is now required. Governments that
              undervalue their currencies and don’t take corrective action
              would face penalties, including increased dumping duties, a ban
              on federal procurement in the U.S. and ineligibility to receive
              financing from the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/overseas-private-investment-corporation/">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</a>.</p>
              <p>“We are very supportive of the objectives of that bill,
              which is to try to make sure there’s a level playing field
              around the world, that countries can’t keep their currencies
              weak at the expense of American exporters,” Treasury Secretary
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/timothy-f.-geithner/">Timothy F. Geithner</a> said yesterday on Bloomberg Television. “We
              have been pushing very, very hard to get <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/china/">China</a> to move.”</p>
              <h2>‘International Obligations’</h2>
              <p>Geithner said that while China’s currency has appreciated
              10 percent in real terms since the middle of 2010, the Obama
              administration wants the Chinese government to allow a bigger
              rally.</p>
              <p>Schumer, who has proposed similar measures on China’s
              currency over the past six years, failed in his previous
              attempts to get an up-or-down Senate vote on a bill.</p>
              <p>“We are in trade war,” Brown said in a statement
              following the vote. “We’re fighting back with one of the
              biggest bipartisan jobs bill the Senate has seen this year,”</p>
              <p>Opponents say they worry that protectionism and trade
              conflicts may stall a global economic recovery already weighed
              down by the slumping U.S. housing market and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/europe/">Europe</a>’s sovereign
              debt crisis. The legislation is opposed by business groups, such
              as the Chamber of Commerce, that say it may cause a trade
              dispute.</p>
              <h2>‘Got To Stop’</h2>
              <p>The current policy “may be good for this company or that
              company, but it is not good for America,” Sessions said on the
              floor before the vote. “It’s got to stop.”</p>
              <p>The measure may stall in the House Ways and Means
              Committee, which controls trade legislation in its chamber.
              Representative <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/dave-camp/">Dave Camp</a>, the Michigan Republican who heads the
              panel, hasn’t committed to supporting the bill even though he
              voted for a similar measure last year backed by Representative
              Sander Levin of Michigan, top Democrat on the committee.</p>
              <p>“While currency is certainly an issue, solely looking at
              currency manipulation misses the larger points,” spokesman Jim
              Billimoria said last week in an e-mail. Camp “will begin
              looking aggressively at China’s abuses this fall.”</p>
              <p>Boehner, an <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/ohio/">Ohio</a> Republican, and House Majority Leader <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/eric-cantor/">Eric Cantor</a> of Virginia voted against Levin’s bill last year.</p>
              <p>“To force the Chinese to do what is arguably very
              difficult to do I think is wrong, it’s dangerous,” Boehner said
              Oct. 6 at the Washington Ideas Forum, sponsored by the Atlantic
              magazine and the Aspen Institute. “Given the economic
              uncertainty around the world, it’s just very dangerous and we
              should not be engaged in this.</p>
              <h2>Avoid ‘Symbolic’ Laws</h2>
              <p>President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> said at a news conference the same
              day that while ‘‘China has been very aggressive in gaming the
              trading system to its advantage and to the disadvantage of other
              countries, particularly the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/united-states/">United States</a>,’’ he wants to avoid
              laws that ‘‘are symbolic, knowing that they’re probably not
              going to be upheld by the World Trade Organization.’’</p>
              <p>Levin has said that the House version of the legislation
              had 225 supporters and urged Boehner to let members vote.</p>
              <p>‘‘It’s clear to me momentum is very much increasing,’’ he
              told reporters yesterday before the vote. ‘‘The pressure will
              mount here in the House to act.’’</p>
              <p>Representative Mark Critz, a Pennsylvania Democrat who
              backs Levin’s bill, sought in July to force a vote against the
              wishes of Republican leaders. He rounded up more than 173 House
              members, mostly Democrats, to sign a petition that would bring
              the measure to the floor. It needs at least 218 signatures, a
              majority, to succeed.</p>
              <h2>Yuan Appreciation</h2>
              <p>The yuan has appreciated 4.6 percent against the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/u.s.-dollar/">U.S.
              dollar</a> in the past year and 24 percent in the past five years,
              the steepest advance after Colombia’s peso among 25 emerging-
              market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. China limits currency
              conversions for investment purposes and buys dollars to slow the
              yuan’s advance and preserve the competitiveness of China’s
              exports.</p>
              <p>Even if the bill becomes a law, it could take years for it
              to have any substantive effect in the U.S., Lardy said. Between
              filing complaints and conducting investigations, companies
              wouldn’t get any immediate relief, he said.</p>
              <p>‘‘I would think it would take years before you saw any sort
              of microeconomic effect,” Lardy said. “I don’t think it would
              reach its objective, it might not make any difference for a long
              time.”</p>
              <p>The bill is S. 1619.</p>

              <h1 class="disqus_title">China Wal-Mart Stores Suspended on Pork Probe</h1>
              <p><a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=WMT:US">Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)</a> temporarily
              closed six more stores in southern China on orders from local
              officials, bringing the total to 13, as authorities probed the
              company for mislabeling ordinary pork as organic.</p>
              <p>The six outlets in Chongqing were ordered shut for 15 days
              by the city’s industry and commerce administration, adding to
              seven that were suspended from doing business on Oct. 10, the
              supermarket operator said in an e-mail yesterday. Wal-Mart was
              also fined, the city government said in a statement.</p>
              <p>“We believe this will allow us to complete comprehensive
              actions to upgrade the standards in these Chongqing stores,”
              the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said of the store
              closures in its <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.cq.gov.cn/today/news/351834.htm">statement</a>.</p>
              <p>Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is reinforcing
              training at its Chongqing stores after being cited repeatedly by
              local authorities. The company has been punished 21 times in the
              city since opening there in 2006 for false advertising and for
              selling food that had expired or that hadn’t passed safety
              inspections, the city government said in a statement Oct. 10.</p>
              <p>In the latest incident, the Chongqing government fined the
              retailer 3.65 million yuan ($575,000), five times the 730,000
              yuan that Wal-Mart stores in the city made from selling
              mislabeled pork over 20 months, according to a statement on the
              city government website. The 730,000 yuan will also be seized by
              the government, it said.</p>
              <p>“We are cooperating fully with the public security bureau
              and doing everything possible to conclude the investigation,”
              said Anthony Rose, a Hong Kong-based company spokesman, who
              declined to comment on the fine and whether any more stores
              would be closing.</p>
              <h2>Detentions</h2>
              <p>“Some” company employees were detained as part of the
              investigation, Wal-Mart said in a statement on Monday. The
              retailer’s management may be “dysfunctional,” given that the
              company has “once and again violated laws and regulations,”
              Zuo Yong, an official with the Chongqing Administration of
              Industry and Commerce, was quoted as saying by <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/china/">China</a>’s official
              Xinhua News Agency. Wal-Mart referred questions to Rose, who
              didn’t immediately respond after regular office hours.</p>
              <p>Wal-Mart, China’s second-biggest supermarket operator, had
              $7.5 billion annual revenue in the country, where it has 329
              stores and 107,000 employees, Asia Chief Executive Officer <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/scott-price/">Scott Price</a> said March 30. The retailer, with sales of $421.8 billion
              last year, entered China in 1996.</p>
              <p>Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. is China’s largest hypermarket
              operator by sales. Sun Art reported in August that first-half
              net income rose 42 percent to 784 million yuan as sales jumped
              24 percent.</p>
              <p>Phone calls to the media department of the Chongqing
              government weren’t answered.</p>
