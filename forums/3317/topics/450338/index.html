              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said 
              Asia is growing in importance, and Singaporeans need to understand the 
              region and its complex connections better.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said the "Genius of India" offered by the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology is welcome in this regard.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Tharman said this to IIT alumni gathered in Singapore at the Suntec Convention Centre on Saturday. <br><br>Since 2002, IIT alumni have gathered alternately in India and the United States, where there are about 40,000 IITians.<br><br>The
               number of IITians in Singapore has been growing over the years. This 
              growth, a result of the growing economic and strategic importance of 
              Asia Pacific, is one reason why the IIT alumni decided to meet in 
              Singapore this year.<br><br>The Indian Institute of Technology - also 
              known as the MIT of India - is seen as a pinnacle of its education 
              system and helps foster India's relationships with the world.<br><br>Deputy
               Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said Singapore needs to engage 
              India more, so as to play a useful role in helping others in the region.<br><br>"From
               a fairly young age, people need to understand Asia and other parts of 
              Asia besides their own country. This is extremely important for 
              Singapore. We have always had strong relationships with the immediate 
              regions around us. We have fairly strong relationships with China and 
              East Asia and we have relatively weak linkages with India in education 
              until the last five or six years, when it has been growing rapidly," 
              said Mr Tharman.<br><br>Mr Tharman said some 15 per cent of Singapore secondary schools already have tie-ups with India, but more can be done.<br><br>Mr Tharman said Singapore could help India with urban solutions, like clean water and the environment.<br><br>"The
               challenge in India, in this regard, is to develop urban solutions that 
              provide a standard of living that is acceptable to a broad mass of 
              people and can spur economic growth both in manufacturing and services. 
              There is a whole range of urban solutions that cities like Singapore 
              have had longer experience in," he said.<br><br>Mr Tharman also spoke of Singapore's need to have a diversified economy.<br><br>"We
               are a city as well a country, you need the diversity of economic 
              options, work options for your population both in order to maximise 
              their strengths and their natural talents and abilities... You can't 
              depend purely on services... For us it is part and parcel of our 
              economic thinking - preserving manufacturing and moving it upstream," he
               said. <br><br>The PanIIT Summit is the first to be held outside India 
              and the US, and many see it as a way to further promote and deepen 
              Singapore-India ties.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
