              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Challenges of dealing with a widening income gap in 
              Singapore are here to stay, say political watchers and economic 
              analysts, while MPs say the key to narrowing the gap is up-skilling 
              low-wage workers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They were responding to the Prime Minister's New Year's message which highlighted the issue.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singapore experienced strong growth in 2010, and economists say one group likely to benefit is the high income earners.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>CIMB regional 
              economist Song Seng Wun said: "As a result of the very strong growth, 
              what you normally find is that the top 20 per cent of income earners 
              will generally ride on the growth and benefit from it far more than the 
              lower 20 per cent. <br><br>"Benefiting them are things like wealth from 
              appreciating assets such as properties, whereas in the lower income 
              group, you do not have that kind of appreciation of asset. <br><br>"If 
              you're... in the bottom 20 per cent (group), your salary is relatively 
              stable (but) you're only getting that much, whether (the) economy is 
              growing 15 per cent or four to six per cent. <br><br>"(But) if you're 
              (in) the top 20 (per cent group), you'll likely ride (on) the growth and
               the kind of opportunity that presents much more than a bottom 20.<br><br>"...
               As a result after an exceptional year, you do find that income gap will
               widen very significantly. Perhaps with a return to normalcy, we will 
              see a little bit of return in the gap itself".<br><br>Some of the issues which Singaporeans are always concerned about include inflation and the cost of living. <br><br>These can be a perennial concern for the lower income group. <br><br>MPs
               whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to say they intend to raise this issue 
              during the Budget debate and will be calling on the government to extend
               whatever support it can to help lower income Singaporeans. <br><br>And 
              this is where Workfare -- a key pillar of Singapore's social security 
              landscape to provide support for low-wage workers so they have the best 
              chance to progress -- comes into play.<br><br>MPs say the Workfare has been a great help in encouraging workers to be gainfully employed, to benefit from the payments.<br><br>MP
               for Jalan Besar GRC Denise Phua said: "What we need to do is to move 
              from these broad-based strategies to more targeted help, for example, 
              specific industries and specific segments of low wage workers. <br><br>"(We
               can) then hone in...and understand the low wage workers' families, so 
              (as) to make sure that (the) poverty spiral can be broken.  <br><br>"One
               area to target is to ensure that children from low-wage families have 
              specific support in terms of tuition (and having access to) computers, 
              to make sure they can be pulled out from the poverty spiral.<br><br>"We 
              have sufficient numbers of helping agencies (such as) the CDCs (and) the
               family service centres. What we need to do now is to tighten the 
              coordination of these helping agencies to make sure that help indeed 
              reaches those who need to be helped."<br><br>GPC Chair for Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports Seah Kian Peng said: "One part is to keep 
              the economy running and booming like what it is now, just like what we 
              have experienced last year. <br><br>"What it means is that unemployment 
              is very low and we know that the majority of people are earning a salary
               and as the economy booms, the government will be in a position to also,
               in any budget, consider how it could possibly distribute and share the 
              growth with as many Singaporeans as possible.<br><br>"The other part is 
              rallying the community (including) those who have done well and are 
              successful, (to) make life better for those (who are) not as successful.
               <br><br>"Singaporeans are, by and large, a generous lot; corporate 
              philanthropy is there and I hope individual philanthropy will also be on
               the rise".<br><br>Meanwhile, MPs say they will urge the government to 
              continue with measures already in place, like the GST Credits and 
              various rebates, to help low income Singaporeans.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>Sad to say, I'm sure PAP with their cronies and
              families will be laughing with their pockets full of money,
              happy to have found a solution for themselves, no need to care
              about locals but just have a workforce that will help them earn
              money, which this workforce will self - renew. Those who earn
              enough will withdraw CPF and leave, then new FTs will
              arrive to suck all locals dry again. </p>
              <p>PAP have found a good solution and they will not let go of this
              idea. </p>
