              <p>ONLY 20 per cent of respondents to a StraitsTimes.com poll indicated 
              that they truly believe enrichment and supplementary classes help in 
              their children's development - and that they would continue sending 
              their children to the classes even if no one else did so.</p>
              <p>In contrast, almost half of the 286 respondents indicated that they 
              had no choice; Preventing their children from falling behind their peers
               was the main reason they cited for sending their children to 
              supplementary or enrichment classes.</p>
              <p>Another 32 per cent left the decision mostly to their children. If 
              their children no longer enjoy the classes, they would stop sending 
              them.</p>
              <p>This was the response to our poll question - What is the main reason you send your kids to supplementary/enrichment classes?</p>
              <p>The poll was created in response to a Straits Times Forum 
              letter - and the larger debate of the past weeks centred around the 
              Tiger Mum, Nanyang Kindergarten and Singaporean parents' expectations of
               relief measures in Budget 2011, currently being debated in Parliament.</p>
              <p>In the Straits Times Forum letter, published on Monday, Madam Phyllis Cheong had made a passionate case for supplementary classes.</p>
              <p>She argued that such classes are not meant for weak children
               in need of remedial help. Instead, they serve pupils who are competing 
              to be in, or to stay in, the best schools.</p>
              <p>Inevitably, she argued, there is a gap between the brilliant
               child - be he naturally so or hothoused by parents who can afford the 
              fees - and those less academically inclined.</p>
              <p>That is why non-elite schools must make sure that the gap 
              does not widen by holding supplementary classes and give the less 
              affluent children a fairer fighting chance.</p>
              <p>On Facebook, a majority of Straits Times readers placed the blame squarely on the 'kiasu' mentality.</p>
              <p>For example, Ms Joyce Sun felt that sending a child to 
              supplementary classes is needed to prepare him or her for school, as the
               curriculum is always changing and getting tougher each year.</p>
              <p>'Three years prior to my child going to P1, my friend, who 
              is a teacher, already warned me of what is to come when a child moves on
               from preschool to P1,' she wrote.</p>
              <p>'She told me to prepare my child early by sending her to 
              enrichment classes if needed because what they are learning in school 
              now is very different from yesteryear. I am very thankful that I heeded 
              her advice... the enrichment centres can teach my child better than I 
              can as they are more in tune with the current MOE syllabus.'</p>
