              <p><strong>YOG: NZealand gets 1st medal after 17-year-old clinches Boys' Triathlon Gold</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It's Day 2 of the Youth Olympic Games and it's 
              celebrations for the New Zealand contingent as Aaron Barclay's won his 
              country's first medal of the YOG. </span></p>
              <p><span> The 17 â€“year- old clinched the Boys' Triathlon Gold medal in a time of

              <p><span> As for Singapore triathlete Scott Ang, he finished 29th out of 32 competitors, with his time of 1 hour 2 minutes 15.11 seconds. </span></p>
              <p><span> The 3rd and final gold medal in Triathlon, will take place on Thursday in the 4-person Mixed Team Relay. </span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile over to the qualifying heats from swimming, Singapore's 
              Pang Sheng Jun did not make the cut for the Finals of the 200meters 
              Individual Medley, after finishing in 16th place overall.
              <br> <br> But fans will get to see South Africa's rising star Chad le Clos (Chad 
              le Claire) in action, as he was the second fastest qualifier at the 
              Singapore Sports School this morning. 
              <br> <br> The 18 year old Commonwealth Youth Games champion, will be looking to 
              add on to last night's silver medal in the 400meters Freestyle. 
              <br> <br> Checking in with the 100meters Butterfly heats, Singapore's pairing of 
              Rainer Ng and Sheng Jun crashed out while Kenneth To from Australia 
              advanced to the semifinals, with the fastest qualifying time of 54.16 
              seconds. 
              <br> <br> Chad le Clos (Chad le Claire) will also feature in the semis for this event. 
              <br> <br> As for Dai Jun who struck gold in last night's 400 meters Freestyle, the
               Chinese sensation returns Monday night to do battle in the 200 meters 
              Final. 
              <br> <br> Singapore's Clement Lim did well but missed the Final 8, by just 2 seconds. 
              <br> <br> And over in the Girls' 100 meters Freestyle, Australia's Emma McKeon was
               the fastest in qualifying with her time of 56.04 seconds.
              <br> <br> She advances to this evening's semi-finals, together with Singapore's 
              Amanda Lim, who was 2 seconds slower than her Aussie rival. 
              <br> <br> Looking at the 200meters Butterfly, Hungarian teenager Boglarka Kapas 
              will lead the pursuit of her country's 1st YOG medal, after qualifying 
              fastest. 
              <br> <br> And in the 4 x 100 meter Medley Relays, Team Singapore failed to qualify for the Final, by just 4 seconds.
              <br> <br> But surprisingly, the American Girls are also out of this relay event, 
              which leaves the Gold medal to be contested tonight, by the other 
              traditional powerhouses from Australia, China and Russia. 
              <br> <br> And finally in badminton round-robin action, Singapore's Huang Chao beat
               Mario Cuba of Peru 21-15, 21-10 to keep his quarterfinal hopes alive. -
