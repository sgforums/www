              <p><strong>YOG organisers say first day ticket sales encouraging</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Tickets for the world's first Youth Olympic Games (YOG)
               went on sale Wednesday on-line, through a hotline, and over 35 
              counters, including six overseas. </span></p>
              <p><span>Organisers said that sales have been encouraging, with more than 
              50 per cent of the tickets sold online.
              <br> <br> When Channel NewsAsia visited one of 29 SISTIC counters selling the YOG 
              tickets on Wednesday, the response was slow.
              <br> <br> No purchases were made at the Novena outlet when our news team was there
               just after lunch; but earlier, 67 tickets were sold.
              <br> <br> 63 of those were bought through on-line booking and the collection made 
              at the counter.
              <br> <br> Tickets can also be purchased through a Hotline at +65 63482010.
              <br> <br> Overall, organisers said more than 600 tickets were snapped online in 
              the first 30 minutes of operations.
              <br> <br> They were unable to give a total sales figure for the day, but added 
              that most transactions were from Singapore.
              <br> <br> The fastest selling tickets were for diving, gymnastics and swimming.
              <br> <br> Due to the overwhelming response, some sessions for these sports are 
              unavailable for the moment.
              <br> <br> MediaCorp understands organisers are looking at making provisions to 
              offer more tickets for these popular sports.
              <br> <br> While it is still early days, organisers said they are confident that 
              all 320,000 tickets will be sold. 
              <br> <br> However, they said they have contingency plans should demand be slow. 
              <br> <br> Organisers also confirmed that no discounts and complimentary tickets 
              will be offered.

              <p><strong>Best seats for opening ceremony of Youth Olympic Games could cost S$200</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: As Singapore gets set to welcome athletes and officials
               to the YOG with a colourful opening ceremony at The Float@Marina Bay on
               August 14, MediaCorp has learnt that tickets for the best seats could 
              cost S$200, with the cheapest at S$30. </span></p>
              <p><span>Tickets for the closing ceremony at the same venue on August 26 
              are understood to be priced between S$15 and S$80.
              <br> <br> Full details of the final ticket prices are expected to be announced 
              later this month.
              <br> <br> While no figures are available as to how many tickets will go on sale 
              for both ceremonies, they are expected to be allocated via balloting due
               to the limited seating capacity at The Float@Marina Bay which can 
              accommodate 25,000 spectators.
              <br> <br> The creative director for both ceremonies is theatre director, actor and
               playwright Ivan Heng, while Cultural Medallion recipient Iskandar 
              Ismail will be in charge of sound and music.
              <br> <br> Last month, the government launched a tender for costumes for 
              participants in the Games' opening and closing ceremonies on 
              www.gebiz.gov.sg. The tender closes on April 5.
              <br> <br> The Youth Olympics will feature athletes aged between 14 and 18 years 
              competing in 200 events across 26 sports.
              <br> <br> On Wednesday, the organisers released 320,000 tickets for sale via the 
              Internet, phone booking and at 29 SISTIC outlets islandwide. These 
              tickets can also be purchased through six SISTIC outlets in Indonesia 
              and Malaysia.
              <br> <br> "I would pay S$200 for the best seats," said Ding Yifei, a 29-year-old 
              sports scientist.
              <br> <br> "The pricing is alright for a prestigious event like this and we cannot 
              always expect really low prices simply because it is a youth event. But 
              the price must be justified with good quality content."
              <br> <br> However, operations executive Vic Ng felt otherwise.
              <br> <br> "I will pay money to watch the Youth Olympics, but not for the opening 
              or closing ceremony," said the 33-year-old.
              <br> <br> "I'd rather spend the money on attending the sports events and watching 
              the athletes in action,” he added. </span></p>

              <p><strong>YOG to provide horses for equestrian competition</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Organisers of the first Youth Olympic Games (YOG) will 
              bring in their own horses for the equestrian events. </span></p>
              <p><span>This is to ensure a level playing field as horses at equestrian 
              events are generally brought in by the riders.
              <br> <br> Set to arrive in July, the 38 Australian thoroughbred horses will 
              undergo riding tests and veterinary inspections before they are 
              selected.
              <br> <br> They will get to meet their riders just a day before the opening of the 
              games in August.
              <br> <br> "On the August 13, the riders will be balloted a horse, and the rider 
              and the horse will stay together for the competition throughout the 
              games," said Patrick Lee, director of Sports &amp; Venues from the 
              Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee. 
              <br> <br> "After August 13, the riders will train with the horse once a day, so 
              that they get acquainted with each other before the competition starts 
              on the August 18."
              <br> <br> Organisers said they chose Australian thoroughbreds as they are 
              generally lighter and more suited to Singapore's tropical climate.
              <br> <br> After the games, the horses will be relocated to clubs and riding 
              schools in Singapore.

              <p><strong>S'pore weightlifters looking at finishing top 10 at upcoming YOG</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's weightlifters are hoping to lift the sport 
              to a higher level by competing at the upcoming Youth Olympic Games and 
              while they are not targeting medals, they are hoping to begin developing
               future champions. </span></p>
              <p><span>17-year-old Jaimee Wee really pushed herself to lift the heaviest 
              weights she could in qualifier competitions for the inaugural Youth 
              Olympic Games.
              <br> <br> The ITE student almost knocked herself out as she attempted to lift 60kg
               but thankfully, no serious damage was done.
              <br> <br> She said: "Basically there is a vein over here so if you lift the 
              weight, the blood supply stops to the brain. It has happened once before
               but I didn't drop down like that, I was just a bit blur."
              <br> <br> The plucky girl went on to clear 60 kilograms for the clean and jerk and
               combined with her 50kg for the snatch category, her 110kg total marked 
              an improvement over her previous qualifier result.
              <br> <br> She still wants to better that and such spirit among young athletes is 
              what is helping the sport of weightlifting make a comeback of sorts in 
              Singapore.
              <br> <br> Joining Wee for the selections are two other athletes including Ng Choon
               Yeow who is making a switch from badminton.
              <br> <br> And he knows he has much to do including beefing up a little if he wants
               to do better in the sport.
              <br> He said: "My balance is not that good so I have to improve on my 
              balance, so that I could carry heavier weights."
              <br> <br> He's up against Victoria Junior College student Joel Law.
              <br> <br> Joel said: "I think my chances are quite good because according to the 
              website I have already met the qualification criteria for YOG because 
              the total for qualifying on the website stated 132.5kg and today I 
              already managed to lift 139."
              <br> <br> The trio recently returned from a three-week training stint in Zhuhai, 
              China where they picked up new tips from their Chinese peers.
              <br> <br> China and other European powerhouses will be favourites to win medals at
               the YOG in August.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Weightlifting Federation has set the target for its 
              athletes to finish in the top fifth or sixth spot at the YOG as they aim
               to build for the future.
              <br> <br> For now a host of other overseas tournaments awaits the lifters, as well
               as a final qualifying round in May.
              <br> <br> Most of the young athletes said they were inspired by Singapore's most 
              famous weightlifter, Tan Howe Liang. 
              <br> <br> Tan won Singapore first Olympic medal, a silver at the 1960 Rome Games. </span></p>

              <p><strong>FINA looking to bring US swim team to S'pore for YOG</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The US swim team could be at the Youth Olympic Games 
              (YOG) in Singapore in August after all. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Americans, one of the powerhouses in the sport, had earlier 
              said that they will not be competing at the Games as they did not think 
              the competition would be of a high level.
              <br> <br> FINA's executive director Cornel Marculescu is working to bring the US 
              swim team to Singapore, before they head for the Pan American Games.
              <br> <br> The Romanian, who is in town for the 9th FINA World Swimming Officials 
              seminar, said that besides swimming, the diving competition is also 
              expected to be world class.
              <br> <br> 15-year-old Tom Daley from Britain, the current world champion for the 
              10-metre event, will be competing in Singapore in August.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, the unique format at the Youth Games, such as the mixed 
              gender relay, could be extended to other major meets.
              <br> <br> Mr Marculescu said: "Probably the mixed relay can be something which may
               be of interest at the end of the day...It is a very good opportunity to
               test new ideas which after that may become an event in a world 
              championship or in the Olympic programme..."

              <p><strong>Fewer hostel rooms left for students when NTU becomes Youth Olympic 
              Village</strong></p>
              <p>The Nanyang Technological University will be housing some 5,000 athletes
               and coaches who will be here for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games this
               August. <br> <br> Some students may have to move out of NTU's hostels while the athletes 
              are in town. <br> <br> The <em>Newsdesk </em>with more :<strong> <br> </strong><br> Refurbished hostels in NTU will transform into the Youth Olympic Village
               come August when the games kick off. <br> <br> To make room for their foreign guests, Lee Chee Meng, a third-year 
              student from Malaysia, may have to move out by end May during his 
              three-month vacation. <br> <br> Chee Meng, a YOG volunteer, says he's prepared for this arrangement when
               NTU was named Youth Olympic Village in August 2008. <br> <br> "Actually the feeling is quite complicated because we are proud to be 
              part of the YOG but it's sad that I need to find off campus 
              accommodation." <br> <br> While most locals can choose to go home during the holidays, it's a 
              different story for foreigners like Chee Meng and his Filipino roommate,
               Neil Brian. <br> <br> Neil said he would prefer to stay on campus during the holidays as he is
               involved in organising the freshman orientation camp. <br> <br> "I find it very troublesome to begin with because for foreign students 
              with no residence here - and for me especially, because I don't have any
               family members here - I'll have to resort to renting rooms from 
              outside." <br> <br> The situation may not be all that bad. <br> <br> About 3,300 places have been reserved for NTU students during the 
              vacation. <br> <br> Associate Professor Lok Tat Seng is the Dean of Students at NTU : <br> <br> "Anyone who's undertaking a course or academic programme will be given 
              top priority to remain in those six halls of residence." <br> <br> NTU says about 2,800 to 4,500 students choose to remain on campus during
               the holidays. <br> <br> Results of hostel applications will be released by end May. <br> <br> But some students aren't wasting any time in hunting for accommodation. <br> <br> The university maintains an online platform where students can contact 
              potential landlords. <br> <br> But students say finding a suitable place is challenging since most 
              landlords are only willing to rent their place out for at least half a 
              year.</p>

              <p><strong>Diving tickets for YOG sold out; public urged to book early to avoid 
              disappointment</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Tickets for the Youth Olympic Games are selling fast 
              and the public is encouraged to book early to avoid disappointment. </span></p>
              <p><span>This update was given by the organisers at the latest sponsorship 
              signing ceremony on Monday.
              <br> <br> Pico Arts is the latest to come on board for the Youth Olympic Games.
              <br> <br> Their more than S$2 million deal will cover overlays at the various 
              venues.
              <br> <br> And there was more good news about the games as organisers said ticket 
              sales have been brisk.
              <br> <br> A total of 320,000 tickets went on sale last week and sports like 
              swimming, diving and gymnastics are seeing good demand.
              <br> <br> Goh Kee Nguan, CEO, organising committee, Singapore Youth Olympic Games 
              2010, said: "Singaporeans actually make up 75 per cent of the ticket 
              sales. Overseas, we have about 10 over countries that have come in to 
              buy most of the tickets. For diving, most of the tickets are not 
              available any more. For swimming more than 50 per cent of the tickets 
              has also been taken up." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Ban on Iran's girl footballers</strong></p>
              <p>IRAN'S girls' football team has been kicked out of the upcoming Youth
               Olympic Games here on Aug 14 to 26 because Fifa rules prevent players 
              from wearing an Islamic headscarf.</p>
              <p>Appeals from the Iran National Olympic Committee (NOC) to review the 
              ban were rejected by Fifa, the sport's world governing body.</p>
              <p>The Asian Football Confederation said in a statement on 
              Monday: 'Fifa decreed that the wearing of Islamic hijab was not in 
              accordance with the laws of the game.'</p>
              <p>Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke had said in a letter to
               the Iran Football Federation: 'Taking into consideration the clear 
              position stated by the (Olympic committee) of Iran, the Fifa executive 
              committee had no choice but to take the decision that (Iran) will not be
               able to participate.'</p>
              <p>Fifa's international rule book contains a section on 
              players' onfield equipment and attire. One of the decisions under Law 4 
              states: 'The basic compulsory equipment must not have any political, 
              religious or personal statements.'</p>
              <p>This is the second time within a year that the issue of 
              athletes donning a hijab has cropped up in Singapore.</p>

              <p><strong>Organisers give glimpse of opening and closing ceremonies of YOG</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Details of the much-anticipated Opening and Closing 
              ceremonies of the world's first Youth Olympic Games (YOG) are out. </span></p>
              <p><span>Organisers did not want to disclose too much, saying it is still 
              work in progress.
              <br> <br> But they said the shows will be by the young, for the young, and inspire
               global unity and national pride.
              <br> <br> The National Day Parade at the Marina Bay Floating Platform has wowed 
              Singaporeans over the years.
              <br> <br> But come August, the venue will stage the biggest party for a global 
              audience, where an estimated 7,000 youths are expected to perform in the
               first-ever Opening Ceremony of an Olympic Games to be held on the 
              waterfront with a city skyline as a backdrop.
              <br> <br> The opening ceremony of the YOG will kick off at 20:10 hours or 8.10pm 
              Singapore time on August 14 and will last for two hours. The Games will 
              close on August 26.
              <br> <br> 25,000 people will be at the platform for each of the ceremonies, with 
              billions more around the world watching it on TV and via new media.
              <br> <br> It will be history in the making, as organisers said the inaugural Games
               will create a new chapter in the Olympic movement.
              <br> <br> But organisers were tight-lipped about revealing too much.
              <br> <br> "(There will be) 7,600 performers, 
              (with)...lighting...multimedia...fireworks, fountains, huge props, and 
              an amazing set against this beautiful backdrop," said Ivan Heng, 
              creative director, Opening and Closing Ceremonies, Singapore Youth 
              Olympic Games 2010.
              <br> <br> The Opening Ceremony will showcase Singapore's multi-racial diversity 
              and elements from around the world.
              <br> <br> The creative team brainstormed with young people for their ideas.
              <br> <br> "We had workshops in early February last year when we got together with a
               group of youths. Over the course of two weeks, we sat down and we 
              really talked to each other. We listened to what they felt what the YOG 
              Opening Ceremony and Closing Ceremony should be," said Mr Heng.
              <br> <br> He added, "This is going to be an event that will be very much involved 
              by youths. It would be for the youths and we will be working with the 
              youths."
              <br> <br> While not like the Beijing Olympics, the team said Singapore will 
              deliver a memorable show, despite its modest budget.
              <br> <br> Francis Chong, Deputy CEO, Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising 
              Committee, said, "It is not about outspending or bragging rights. If 
              that is the case, big cities always have the edge. It is about finding 
              and creating the meaning.
              <br> <br> "It is not about how much is being spent. Enough will be spent to create
               a show that will move people and entertain."
              <br> <br> His comments were echoed by Mr Heng, who believes that sincerity matters
               more than a big budget.
              <br> <br> He said: "A big budget does not mean good (shows). You can make good 
              shows with a smaller budget but with a lot of heart. That is what we 
              want to do."
              <br> <br> The team also faces another challenge - the short lead-up time in 
              getting the resources, concept and performers together.
              <br> <br> "Performers are being trained as we speak, and that training is more the
               kind of dancers that we want, costumes are being created...and this 
              will all come together sometime in mid-July when we begin the combined 
              rehearsals," said Brigadier-General Ishak Ismail, chairman, Opening and 
              Closing Ceremonies, Singapore Youth Olympic Games 2010.
              <br> <br> Organisers are expecting good demand for seats and tickets will be 
              offered through a balloting system, where each person is only allowed to
               buy four tickets. The tickets themselves are unique as they are an 
              all-in-one event ticket - allowing entry, transit and payment.
              <br> <br> Tickets range from S$30 to S$200 for the Opening Ceremony and S$15 to 
              S$80 for the Closing Ceremony. 
              <br> <br> Registration starts on April 23 and can be done online at </span> www.singapore2010.sg/tickets <span> or

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It started out as a cloudy, damp day but ended with 
              some fiery competition as four young Singaporean triathletes battled it 
              out for the chance to represent their country at the Youth Olympic Games
               in August. </span></p>
              <p><span>And Scott Ang and Clara Wong clinched the two spots on offer at 
              the final YOG selection trial held on Saturday as part of the OSIM 
              Singapore International Triathlon.
              <br> <br> There were some nervous faces on the start line at the East Coast Park 
              as 17-year-old Scott lined up to take on Travis Woodford.
              <br> <br> But the Anglo-Chinese School International student led from the gun and 
              opened up a two-minute lead over Travis in the swim leg. 
              <br> <br> He extended his lead on the bike before finishing off with a fast run to
               secure his YOG slot.
              <br> <br> He clocked a time of one-hour 26 minutes for the 750-metre swim, 
              20-kilometre bike and 5-kilometre run.
              <br> <br> Victoria Junior College student Clara, also 17, used her balanced swim, 
              bike and run skills to beat Samantha Ho by almost eight minutes, and she
               credits an overseas training stint for her strong performance.
              <br> <br> Clara Wong, winner, YOG Final Triathlon Selection Trial, said: "Last 
              year, from  November 20 to December 20, I went to Kunming, China, for 
              high-altitude training especially for bike training and I have to give 
              credit to that as my cycling really improved after that."  - CNA/vm</span></p>

              <br> <br> These two artists are working to deliver it, despite having only three 
              months to craft them.
              <br> <br> 22-year-old Huang Yifan is incorporating the 26 sports of the games.
              <br> <br> "(I) have to do a bit of research on the sports first... And after that,
               I try to combine it into a circular form. It's quite a challenge but it
               takes time," said Huang, artist of the YOG sculpture. 
              <br> <br> Huang's art work "A World United " - a stainless steel structure 
              measuring four metres in diameter - symbolises peace and mutual respect 
              of different cultures.
              <br> <br> 36-year-old artist Edwin Cheong's 10-metre tall art piece called 
              "Breathe" resembles moving trees. 
              <br> <br> "The site has an abundance of wind, and also in terms of the sculptures 
              available in the surrounding, they are rather static, so I wanted to do 
              (a)certain sculpture that is kinetic," explained Cheong.  
              <br> <br> The project is a collaboration between the Urban Redevelopment Authority
               (URA), City Developments Limited (CDL) and the Singapore Youth Olympic 
              Organising Committee (SYOGOC).
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, the countdown clock has recently been shifted to One 
              Fullerton. 
              <br> <br> There will be also be a host of YOG-related activities - from the 
              opening and closing ceremonies at the Floating Platform, to the official
               media centre and Marina Bay Sands. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p>ORGANISERS of the upcoming Youth Olympic Games have lined up another 
              round of pre-event competitions as a warm-up for the international event
               which will be hosted in Singapore in August.</p>
              <p>Tagged as the Friendship Games, the list of free events covers 10 
              sports ranging from gymnastics and archery to weightlifting and tennis 
              in May and June.</p>
              <p>A previous round of Friendship Games was held in January, 
              with sports such as fencing and judo.</p>
              <p>The pre-events are designated trial runs for some YOG venues
               such as the newly-refurbished Bishan Sports Hall, which was appointed 
              the official gymnastics venue yesterday. Other venues were tested at the
               Asian Youth Games last year.</p>

              Together, we can make the YOG an international success.'</p>
              <p>About 250 residents attended the event, which included a

              <p><strong>39 athletes from 12 sports selected so far for YOG</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) revealed 
              Tuesday an initial list of athletes that will represent the country at 
              the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Singapore contingent so far numbers 39 athletes from 12 
              individual sports. Two team sports, boys' football and boys' hockey, 
              have also been fielded. 
              <br> <br> Notable absentees from the list are athletes in track and field and 
              badminton.
              <br> <br> With 31 individual slots still open, athletes have until end-May to 
              convince selectors they should participate in the Games.
              <br> <br> As for team sports, volleyball and handball have a two-week window.
              <br> <br> The SNOC must submit a confirmed list of athletes to the International 
              Olympic Committee by July 15.
              <br> <br> The Youth Olympic Games will be held here from Aug 14-26 and will 
              feature some 3,600 athletes from 205 nations doing battle in 26 Olympic 
              sports.
              <br> <br> All eyes will be on two athletes at the YOG - Sportsboy of the Year 2009
               Darren Choy and Natasha Yokoyama, who have been chosen to do Singapore 
              sailing proud at the Games.
              <br> <br> Mr Choy says: "For me I honestly don't really feel any pressure, I mean,
               as a person myself I handle pressure quite well I think."
              <br> <br> Ms Yokoyama says: "I'm actually quite confident to medal at YOG because 
              this is our home ground and I know the conditions here very well - the 
              weather, the wind, the waves, the current."
              <br> <br> Other athletes selected so far hail from swimming, archery and judo, 
              among others.
              <br> <br> Says Deputy Prime Minister and president of SNOC: "What we've done is we
               have selected the athletes and the teams who have clearly demonstrated 
              their qualification capability. There's a group of sports which have not
               yet finished their qualification trials yet, so we have to wait for 
              those. And then there's a group of athletes who are on the margin and we
               have to evaluate those athletes again on a set of criteria to make sure
               that they're competitive."

              more tickets</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Organisers of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) 
              are aiming higher - to sell more than the initial target of 320,000 
              tickets that had gone on sale. </span></p>
              <p><span>This was revealed at the opening of the largest merchandise store 
              for the Games outside Ngee Ann City.
              <br> <br> The Olympic buzz hits the Orchard Road shopping belt - at this store. It
               has 70 new products on offer, and business has been brisk.
              <br> <br> The same can be said for ticket sales - prompting the organisers to aim 
              to sell beyond the initial 320,000 tickets that had gone on sale.
              <br> <br> With about 100 days to go to the Games on August 14, preparations are on
               track.
              <br> <br> The Sports Minister also touched on the Singapore contingent for the 
              Games, part of which was announced on Tuesday. 
              <br> <br> But he's not putting any undue pressure on the athletes.
              <br> <br> Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian 
              Balakrishnan, says: "I don't want to make predictions but it will soon 
              become evident especially when other countries also start filing in 
              their athlete list."
              <br> <br> As the organisers step up the buzz - the new store should help to spread
               the word on the Games.
              <br> <br> "The 70 new products are on top of the 50 that were launched when the 
              merchandise first went on sale in November last year. And the range will
               be expanded to 500 during Games times, with the most expensive, this 
              limited edition pen set.

              <br> <br> Amanda Lim says: "Positive kind of motivation for me to since I am sort 
              of the ambassador for this campaign."
              <br> <br> Darren Choy says: "I'm hoping this would boost my confidence and I would
               train harder for the upcoming YOG."
              <br> <br> The trio says fronting the campaign was something new and challenging.
              <br> <br> Jeffrey Lightfoot says: "We took about 100 shots I think so I had to do 
              it a lot of times, I don't think I did jump that high, but I think they 
              edited it."
              <br> <br> The ceremony was also attended by American gymnast Kerri Strug, who 
              shared her experience with the students.
              <br> <br> Strug is known for her memorable moment at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, 
              where she went on to help Team USA win gold despite competing with an 
              injured left foot.
              <br> <br> The "Go World" campaign started at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 
              <br> <br> Besides Michael Phelps and Kerri Strug, the organisers are looking at 
              bringing in other big name athletes before or during the Youth Olympics.
               And these sports superstars will not only be sharing their experience 
              but also taking part in other activities like training session with 
              young Singaporean athletes.

              <p><strong>IOC co-com satisfied with YOG prep on final visit </strong></p>
              <p>The 99-day countdown to the 2010 Youth Olympic Games will begin later 
              this evening with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong attending the 
              celebrations at *Scape at Orchard Road. <br> <br> And at a media conference today, International Olympic Committee 
              Coordination Commission Chairman, Sergey Bubka, said the commission was 
              satisfied with the preparations so far. <br> <br> He described the organisers, the Singapore Youth Olympic Games 
              Organising Committee, as having worked diligently to deliver a best 
              possible experience for all. <br> <br> During the conference, a question was asked regarding the readiness of 
              Marina Bay Sands, where the main media centre for the Games will be 
              located. <br> <br> But the commission said it had no issues with it, as it fulfilled all 
              requirements. <br> <br> The Integrated Resort has been plagued with teething problems since it 
              opened, including a blackout during a legal conference. <br> <br> Organisers added that ticket are selling well, and they are looking at 
              increasing the capacity of some venues where sales have been very good, 
              such as swimming and gymnastics.</p>

              <p><strong>Organisers say about a third of YOG tickets sold or committed</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : One third of the 320,000 tickets for the Youth Olympic
               Games (YOG) have been sold or committed. </span></p>
              <p><span>This update was given by organisers at the latest and final IOC 
              Coordination Commission meeting.
              <br> <br> With three months to the games, organisers said Singapore is almost 90 
              per cent prepared. 
              <br> <br> Only final touches are needed, and the International Olympic Committee 
              (IOC), which has made three previous visits, said there are less 
              questions to ask of the Singapore organisers.
              <br> <br> Publicity on the YOG has been cranked up, and IOC President Jacques 
              Rogge is personally looking into this area.
              <br> <br> Manpower has been boosted with 1,000 personnel from government agencies 
              deployed to help the 600 full time staff and 20,000 volunteers run the 
              games.
              <br> <br> The competition venues and Games Village are going through the final 
              touch-up. 
              <br> <br> But the biggest challenge is not the technical aspect. Instead, it's 
              keeping everyone involved motivated as they approach the final lap.
              <br> <br> And all the efforts are paying off as ticket sales are brisk. Sales 
              expected to pick up once the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) have 
              their final lists of athletes.
              <br> <br> "More than one third (have been) sold or committed in different forms. 
              We are also waiting for the NOCs. Once they have confirmed their 
              selection of athletes, then you will the families and friends (of the 
              athletes) coming to Singapore as well," said Ng Ser Miang, chairman of 
              the Singapore YOG Organising Committee.
              <br> <br> In fact, organisers are looking at selling over and above the 320,000 
              tickets earlier allotted as demand for some sports has been 
              overwhelming. </span></p>
