              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Just two days after Singaporeans celebrated the 99-day 
              mark for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games with a party at *SCAPE last 
              Friday, there was more good news for organisers of the Youth event this 
              week. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (Syogoc) 
              has exceeded its sponsorship target of S$50million with the addition of 
              as beverage giant Coca-Cola to its stable of sponsors. 
              <br> <br> Syogoc chairman Ng Ser Miang expects that figure to go up by S$10 
              million to S$20 million from now till the opening ceremony at The Float @
               Marina Bay on August 14. 
              <br> <br> Worldwide Olympic partner Coca-Cola has been associated with the Summer 
              Olympic Games since the 1928 Amsterdam Games, and will partner Syogoc to
               provide cash, goods and services which includes over 1.5 million units 
              of beverages for the Games.
              <br> <br> Coca-Cola has also signed on as Presenting Partner of the Singapore leg 
              of the Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame (JYOF), which will see 52

              <br> <br> The SYSD committee was formed in September 2008. It comprises members 
              from the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports; the 
              Ministry of Education; the Singapore National Olympic Council; the 
              Singapore Sports School; the SSC and the NSAs.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : With 90 days to go, preparations for the inaugural 
              2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG) are entering their final stage. </span></p>
              <p><span>Over the next month, as many as 10 validation events will be held 
              at various competition venues islandwide to test hosts Singapore's 
              operational, logistical and administrative readiness for the Games, 
              which will be held from Aug 14-26.
              <br> <br> "The validation exercises will further ensure we are operationally ready
               for the Games," said Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee
               (SYOGOC) CEO Goh Kee Nguan.
              <br> <br> "At the same time, we would like to encourage the public to participate 
              and immerse themselves in the exciting sports atmosphere by catching 
              athletes in action at the pre-Games competitions," he added. 
              <br> <br> To help ramp up publicity and interest in the Games, Mayor of Central 
              District Zainudin Nordin on Sunday unveiled a plaque at Toa Payoh 
              Swimming Complex to signify the facility as one of the 18 competition 
              venues.
              <br> <br> The festivities also saw some 350 brisk-walkers in a mass walkabout on 
              Sunday morning.
              <br> <br> Over the next month, more than 700 athletes from over 30 National 
              Olympic Committees (NOC) will be here for the pre-Games validation 
              events in 10 sports - archery, athletics, basketball, canoe-kayak, 
              cycling (BMX and mountain bike), gymnastics, rowing, tennis, volleyball 
              and weightlifting.
              <br> <br> The first of these will be the Asian Area Qualifying Championship for 
              Athletics at Bishan Stadium, and the Singapore Open Junior and Senior 
              Weightlifting Championships at Toa Payoh Sports Hall.
              <br> <br> Both events will be held from May 22 to 23.
              <br> <br> "We will also see more publicity, such as banners, community events, and
               city dressing towards August. Billboards will also start appearing in 
              the heartlands like Toa Payoh, and... on the roads and streets. (We'll) 
              have more events to promote the YOG directly and indirectly," said Mr 
              Zainudin. 
              <br> <br> "There will also be the community envoys to talk about the Games, 
              increase the excitement, (and) organise activities towards the SYOG," he
               added. </span></p>

              <p><strong> </strong>Preparations for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games are well on 
              track.</p>
              <p>Speaking in Parliament, Community Development, Youth and Sports 
              MInister, Vivian Balakrishnan says the key components such as the 
              competition formats, the event schedule as well as the culture and 
              education programme have all been finalised. <br> <br> "We have also completed the construction of 14 out of the 18 competition
               venues. The remaining four will be completed within the next two 
              months. Training of the over 20 thousand volunteers which also includes 
              1000 public officers is also going on in earnest." <br> <br> Dr Balakrishnan said through the Olympic Education and the Friends of 
              YOG programmes, both the Education Ministry as well as the YOG 
              Organising Committee have reached out to over 500,000 students. <br> <br> They ranged from primary school students to those in the universities. <br> <br> "Our young people have made their presence felt online through the YOG 
              Youth microsite. They have also expressed their views and contributed 
              their ideas and perspectives on the latest happenings and issues which 
              will affect Singhapore 2010. To date, we have 177 such projects and 
              initiatives which have reached to another 108 thousand young people." <br> <br> The Organising Committee has also worked with community partners to 
              involve disadvantaged youths. <br> <br> Such partners include the Wheelchair Basketball Association, Special 
              Olympic Singapore, and the St Andrew's School of Autism, says Dr 
              Balakrishnan. <br> <br> He adds, to support the young athletes, the Singapore Youth Sports 
              Development Committee is investing up to $6.2 million to help the 
              National Sports Associations. <br> <br> This will be used to set up a youth talent pipeline to prepare the young
               people for the games and beyond.</p>

              <p><span> Bishan Stadium will be the venue for the YOG athletics competition. </span></p>
              <p><span> The highlight on Saturday for the two-day event was the 200 metres 
              finals, with Japan's Homma Keisuke winning the boys event with his time 
              of 21.23 seconds. </span></p>

              <br> <br> "There will be representation from Singapore, that's what they call home
               court advantage. It's not that my athletes' standard is low. My 
              athletes' standard at youth and junior level right now, we are fast 
              moving up," said Loh Lin Kok, president of the Singapore Athletic 
              Association. 
              <br> <br> Being a validation exercise for the YOG, officials from the 
              International Association of Athletics Federations were present to check
               on the progress. 
              <br> <br> And according to the Singapore organisers, the officials are happy with 
              what they have seen so far. But there are areas for improvement, such as

              <br> <br> The Chinese took top spots in 8 of the 20 events contested on Sunday.
              <br> <br> For Singapore, none of its 16 athletes made the cut. But as host, 
              Singapore will get 10 slots at the YOG.
              <br> <br> "Some of them have maintained their standards and for some of them, it 
              is a new experience for them and meeting up with new challenges. I think
               it is a good experience for the young athletes, moving forward from 
              here," said C Veeramani, technical director of Singapore Athletic 
              Association. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The song that represents the spirit of the Youth 
              Olympic Games (YOG) in Singapore will premiere worldwide on Sunday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Entitled "Everyone", the theme song aims to become a global anthem
               for today's youth.
              <br> <br> It is written and produced by Singaporean record producer and composer 
              Ken Lim to reflect the spirit of over 3,600 athletes who will be in 
              Singapore.
              <br> <br> "Everyone" is sung by Sean Kingston, Jody Williams, Steve Appleton, 
              Jessica Mauboy and Singapore's Tabitha Nauser.
              <br> <br> The music video shows them performing at landmarks like the Marina 
              Barrage and Singapore Flyer.
              <br> <br> At the YOG opening ceremony on August 14, all five will perform together
               "live".

              <p><strong>Upgraded Tampines Bike Park ready for YOG</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Organisers of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) 
              have unveiled the upgraded Tampines Bike Park (TBP) as one of the 
              competition venues. </span></p>
              <p><span> The upgraded TBP was certified by Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), 
              the International Federation for Cycling, as ready to host the Bicycle 
              Moto-Cross (BMX) and Mountain Bike competition for the Singapore 2010 
              Youth Olympic Games. </span></p>
              <p><span> Spanning over 23 hectares, the upgraded TBP is the first of its kind in 
              Olympic Games. It is designed such that spectators to the Singapore 2010
               races will be able to have a clear view of the BMX competition as well 
              as watch the start and end of Time Trial and Mountain Bike events from 
              the spectators stand. </span></p>
              <p><span> The bike park is made up of two cycling tracks - mountain bike trail and
               BMX track. </span></p>
              <p><span> The mountain bike trail that will be competed on during Singapore 2010 
              spans three kilometres with four rock garden downhill trails. The track 
              is a test of true skills of the riders through their bike handling 
              techniques and endurance. </span></p>
              <p><span> Sixty percent of the trail consists of a single track, which provides 
              greater challenge in overtaking the opponents. </span></p>
              <p><span> The BMX track spans 355 metres with the purpose of testing swiftness and
               speed in completing the course. This dirt track consists of no less 
              than 26 jumps and three banked corners. </span></p>
              <p><span> The BMX track is designed and built by Tom Ritzenthaler from UCI and his
               team, who also constructed the BMX track for the Beijing 2008 Olympic 
              Games when this discipline made its debut. The same team will be 
              building a cycling track for London 2012. </span></p>
              <p><span> Some 800 residents, grassroots leaders and MPs from Tampines GRC, as 
              well as Olympic mascots Lyo and Merly, attended the launch of the 
              upgraded TBP on Sunday. </span></p>
              <p><span> MP for Tampines GRC, Irene Ng, said: "Tampines residents can enjoy these
               world-class facilities at the Tampines Bike Park after the YOG is over,
               and it will be one of the lasting legacies of the Games to Tampines." </span></p>
              <p><span> The Youth Olympic Games will take place from 14-26 August. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Stage for YOG show nearing completion</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Organisers of the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) have 
              promised a stunning show at the YOG's opening ceremony on August 14. </span></p>
              <p><span> They want to blaze a new trail with 7,000 performers staging a fiery 
              ensemble of theatre, music, song and dance at Marina Bay. </span></p>
              <p><span>The two-hour show has seven parts - one of them interestingly 
              titled 'Monster'.
              <br> <br> Ivan Heng, Creative Director, Opening/Closing Ceremonies, Youth Olympic 
              Games 2010, said: "All of us, inside us, have a monster. And that 
              monster is fear. That monster stops us from achieving our full 
              potential. 
              <br> <br> "So what do we do? We face the fear and we do it anyway. And I think 
              that tells the story of every youth athlete."
              <br> <br> The stage has taken four months to build and is expected to be completed
               by the end of this month.
              <br> <br> The backdrop is the city skyline, and lights from the performance will 
              'dance' on the nearby skyscrapers. All the elements are set to create a 
              unique space.
              <br> <br> Randy Chan, Architectural Stage Designer, Youth Olympic Games 2010, 
              said: "We wanted some intimacy, which is why you can see that the main 
              stage is right in front of the gallery. 
              <br> <br> "In fact, it's three layers - you can see that the main stage will host 
              most of the show, and the back where the performers are going to be at 
              the lake itself will be the second tier."
              <br> <br> With the mammoth task ahead, one challenge is the sharing of resources 
              with the National Day Parade.
              <br> <br> Vernon Teo, Show Producer, Opening/Closing Ceremonies, Youth Olympic 
              Games 2010, said: "We are five days apart - 9th August, we celebrate our
               45th birthday; 14th August, we celebrate the birth of a new Olympic 
              movement by a very young country. I look at it as double happiness!"
              <br> <br> So in 74 days, Marina Bay will be lit with special effects, 
              pyrotechnics, even flames - for an opening show that befits a global 
              first.

              who will represent Singapore at the upcoming Youth Olympic Games (YOG).</p>
              <p>This brings the tally of individual-sport athletes to 65, with only

              <p>Also making the grade were athletes from diving, track and 
              field, wrestling, badminton and rowing. This means Singapore will have

              <p><strong>YOG organisers set up operations at Games Village</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Organisers of the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) have moved
               into the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) campus to set up 
              operations for the Games, which take place on August 14-26. </span></p>
              <p><span>Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Vivian 
              Balakrishnan, toured the Village on Monday to see how preparations are 
              coming along.
              <br> <br> The minister got a first-hand look at the rooms which athletes will use 
              during the Games. Ten hostel blocks out of 16 at NTU will house more 
              than 5,000 athletes and officials at the Village.
              <br> <br> A temporary kitchen, which will serve 20,000 meals daily, has been set 
              up. Security has also been improved and a World Culture Village will 
              allow athletes to interact and learn more about each other.
              <br> <br> Dr Balakrishnan said: "In most places, if you go to a village at this 
              stage, two months before, you will see a construction site, whereas here
               we already have an established site which we are now renovating."
              <br> <br> Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports, Teo Ser Luck, has been appointed the 
              Mayor of the Village. He will be assisted by veteran athletes C Kunalan 
              and Joscelin Yeo.
              <br> <br> Mr Teo said: "One of us will residence inside the Games Village. We will
               have to look at the different situation and scenarios. We will decide 
              later. I think it is important because at any point of time when there 
              is a need for our attention, the team can call upon us to help them."
              <br> <br> In late-July, there will be validation exercises to ensure everything is
               in order.
              <br> <br> The Games Village will be officially opened on August 10. When fully 
              operational, the Village will have a workforce of more than 2,000, half 
              of whom will be volunteers.

              "There are obviously many finishing touches to do. But after speaking to
               people here and seeing what’s on the ground, we are very confident that
               everything will be well-prepared."
              <br> <br> By 20 June, the remaining validation exercises for gymnastics, tennis, 
              canoe-kayak and archery will end giving the Singapore Youth Olympic

              <br> <br> It's based on a give-way concept.
              <br> <br> Motorists only need to give way when they see special Youth Olympic 
              vehicles approaching.
              <br> <br> This is similar to what they would do when they see an emergency service

              <br> <br> The second left-most lane along seven expressways and 15 main roads will
               be designated as the Youth Olympic lane.
              <br> <br> These lanes will be clearly marked with the Olympic rings and the words

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore will be represented in all 26 sports at the 
              upcoming Youth Olympic Games. </span></p>
              <p><span>The selectors said the remaining five slots have been awarded and 
              the republic will field a 130-strong contingent.
              <br> <br> It's a sponsorship deal to promote up-and-coming athletes.
              <br> <br> Sailing, swimming and football have been identified and among the 
              activities planned, visits by athletes to schools to meet students under
               the "SingTel Inspires" Programme.
              <br> <br> There's also a 'Longest Wave" contest.
              <br> <br> Natasha Michiko Yokoyama, sailor, Team Singapore, Youth Olympic Games 
              2010, said: "One big thing SingTel is helping us to do is the wave of 
              support whereby students from other schools will be filming themselves 
              doing waves and I think that is one very big initiative to do for us 
              because it's good to know everyone is behind in supporting us."
              <br> <br> As mutli-media sponsor of the games, SingTel will also offer 
              applications for language translations and 3D animation maps of venues 
              and Singapore.
              <br> <br> Still on the YOG, Singapore has used the full allotment of 70 individual
               and 60 team slots set aside for the host nation.
              <br> <br> Even tennis made the mark after an appeal.
              <br> <br> The other final slots are taken up by athletics, rowing, canoeing and 
              sailing.  - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><strong>Preparations for YOG Opening Ceremony get into high gear</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : "The Best Show on Earth in 2010" - that's how 
              organisers are describing the Opening Ceremony for the Youth Olympic 
              Games (YOG). </span></p>
              <p><span>And to deliver on that, more than 20 choreographers and 7,000 
              youth performers are hard at work to transform the stage into a 
              spectacle for billions around the world come August 14.
              <br> <br> 800 students gathered at Mandai Hill Camp on Friday morning to rehearse 
              their performances for the YOG's Opening Ceremony. 
              <br> <br> Their spirits were not dampened when the heavy rain led to rehearsals 
              being moved indoors.
              <br> <br> Education Minister Ng Eng Hen was also there to give them an added 
              boost. 
              <br> <br> "I'm very confident they will put up a spectacular show and the setting 
              couldn't be better - with new Marina Bay Sands up. I think we are on 
              track to wow the world but we have to work very hard to achieve that," 
              said Dr Ng. 
              <br> <br> Hard work aside, the clock is also ticking away, as there are only 50 
              days to go.
              <br> <br> But the students are not letting that get in their way, practicing even 
              late into the night.
              <br> <br> "The instructors have been really, really helpful, and really patient 
              with us," said student Joseph Sim. 
              <br> <br> "Our parents are aware of this and our teachers are also making plans 
              for us. They have already come forward with extra lessons if we have 
              missed any," said student Soniya d/o Selvaraju. 
              <br> <br> Unlike the National Day Parade, the YOG Opening Ceremony will involve 
              more students - 4,000 from 47 schools, and supported by 200 teachers.
              <br> <br> Despite the large numbers, quality is not compromised.
              <br> <br> The 7,000 performers are involved in both the Opening Ceremony on August
               14 and Closing Ceremony on August 26.
              <br> <br> Organisers said a few previews, including camera rehearsals, will be 
              conducted closer to the date of the Opening Ceremony.
              <br> <br> Singapore has been experiencing heavy downpours recently, but YOG 
              organisers assured there are wet weather plans for the Opening Ceremony.
               
              <br> <br> Olympic protocol will be followed and alternatives include a separate 
              site where part of the ceremony will be conducted. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><strong>34 new torchbearers chosen for YOG torch relay in S'pore</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : 34 new torchbearers were chosen on Thursday for the 
              inaugural Youth Olympic Games torch relay in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>The latest group comprises volunteers and employees of various 
              Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs). They will join the first pair of
               torchbearers who were selected when the torch was unveiled to the media
               in March.
              <br> <br> In all, 2,400 torchbearers will make the final list.
              <br> <br> The young people from diverse backgrounds now have a common aim - to do 
              their organisations and country proud as torchbearers of the first Youth
               Olympic Games.
              <br> <br> Worldwide Olympic Partner Coca-Cola will also distribute cheering kits 
              and lead spectators in cheering the torchbearers on. The beverage giant 
              also displayed torches from past Olympics at the ceremony.
              <br> <br> The Olympic flame will arrive in Singapore on August 5, and make its 
              first public appearance the next day at the National University of 
              Singapore.
              <br> <br> The islandwide torch relay starts on August 7 and continue till 13 
              August 13, stopping at 20 schools along the way.
              <br> <br> Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Community Development, 
              Youth and Sports, said: "Our national leaders will be involved in many 
              ways and in different ways, but for the torch relay we hope that more 
              placings and more slots will be given to our citizens, our Singaporeans 
              and to our community."
              <br> <br> 50,000 specially designed car decals with the message "We Support 
              Singapore 2010" were also released. 15,000 of them will be displayed on 
              Singapore's largest fleet of taxis operated by ComfortDelgro.
              <br> <br> CityCare, a not-for-profit organisation, is also behind the drive to 
              raise awareness for the Games.
              <br> <br> Separately, Usain Bolt - the world's fastest man - was named a Games 
              Ambassador on Thursday.
              <br> <br> The Jamaican is the latest to join a stellar cast of YOG ambassadors, 
              including Olympic swim sensation Michael Phelps of America and Russia's 
              Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva.

              <p><strong>Sprinter Usain Bolt appointed YOG ambassador</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The world's fastest man is set to lend star power to 
              the upcoming inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in Singapore from Aug 
              14-26. </span></p>
              <p><span>Usain Bolt, who won the men's 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold medals at
               the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, was named a YOG ambassador on Thursday.
              <br> <br> The Jamaican flash is the latest to join a stellar cast of YOG 
              ambassadors, among whom are American swim sensation and winner of 14 
              Olympic gold medals Michael Phelps, and Russia's two-time women's 
              Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva.
              <br> <br> As Games ambassadors, their main task is to help promote the YOG, 
              including the 2014 edition in Nanjing, China.
              <br> <br> The 1.95m tall Bolt appreciates the importance of his new role.
              <br> <br> "I know how important it is to have mentors and role models when you are
               young to help give you focus and dreams to aspire to," said Bolt in a 
              statement released by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
              <br> <br> "I couldn't be happier to be an ambassador for the first Youth Olympic 
              Games and to provide inspiration and encouragement to the young athletes
               participating in Singapore this summer, and to kids everywhere," he 
              said.
              <br> <br> Bolt, who set a trio of world records en route to victories at the 
              Beijing Olympics, has gone on to re-write the 100m and 200m marks since,
               clocking 9.58sec and 19.19sec at the World Championships in Berlin last
               year.
              <br> <br> The record for the 4x100m registered in the Chinese capital two years 
              ago, stands at 37.10sec.
              <br> <br> The YOG here will feature over 200 events across 26 sports, and see 
              about 3,600 athletes aged 14 to 18 from 205 National Olympic Committees 
              participating.
              <br> <br> IOC president Jacques Rogge said the appointment of Bolt will be a boost
               for aspiring young athletes all over the world.
              <br> <br> "We are very pleased that Usain will now join Michael and Yelena as 
              Youth Olympic Games Ambassadors," said Rogge. 
              <br> <br> "These athletes are at the very top of their respective sports and they 
              know the importance of having inspirational figures in their lives. 
              Children around the world look up to Usain and it is wonderful that he 
              has decided to motivate young people to become more active by joining 
              the Youth Olympic Games team."
              <br> <br> Last month, the IOC also unveiled a list of 46 present and former 
              athletes, including former Russian swim star Alexander Popov, Moroccan 
              middle-distance world champion runner Hicham El-Guerrouj and Chinese 
              diver Guo Jingjing, as the Games' athlete role models.
              <br> <br> However, their roles are different from the Games' ambassadors, and are 
              nominated by the respective international sports federations.
              <br> <br> These former greats will be here to give talks and share their 
              experiences with the competing athletes. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><strong>YOG surpasses budget</strong></p>
              <p>THE budget for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) has surpassed 
              original estimates of US$75 million ($104 million) by more than three 
              times.</p>
              <p>The projected government spending for the 13-day Games in August will
               now be approximately $387 million.</p>
              <p>This was revealed today by Mr Niam Chiang Meng, the Permanent 
              Secretary for Community Development in a briefing at MCYS headquarters 
              at Thomson Road regarding the Aug 14-26 Games.</p>
              <p>He stressed however, that the benefits will still continue to 
              outweigh the increased cost. Besides $260 million (or 70 per cent of the
               budget) worth of contracts that has been awarded to local companies, 
              the YOG is also expected to attract about 40,000 foreign visitors, 
              generating a $57 million boom in tourism receipts.</p>
              <p>Also, the IOC has estimated that the YOG will be watched by a global 
              audience of 1.5 billion, with the total international media value in 
              excess of $86 million.</p>

              <p><strong>Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame will help with global promotion of 
              YOG</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The hype to the inaugural Youth Olympic Games is 
              getting bigger and one event that will put a global spotlight on the 
              games is the Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame. </span></p>
              <p><span> Come July 23, Olympic history will be made when the flame for the first 
              Youth Olympic Games is lit in Ancient Olympia, Greece. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Singapore flag will be flying high at the sacred grounds as swimmer 
              Amanda Lim and hockey player Silas Abdul Razak will bring out the flame 
              from the temple. </span></p>
              <p><span> The flame will travel to five cities as part of the journey with 
              celebrations at each stop showcasing Singapore culture. </span></p>
              <p><span> The five cities are Berlin, Dakar in Senegal, Mexico City, Auckland and 
              Seoul. </span></p>
              <p><span> Olympic partner Samsung is also chipping in to promote the Games. </span></p>
              <p><span> Its initiatives include naming singer JJ Lin as the Youth Ambassador for
               the games and getting youngsters to file live reports on the event. </span></p>
              <p><span> Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, 
              said: "There is going to be extensive publicity. The lighting ceremony 
              itself will be broadcast live from Greece into Europe and I think 
              negotiations are going on now and we hope it will also be telecast LIVE 
              in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span> “Apart from watching it on TV, ultimately I want Singaporeans to 
              participate and celebrate as the flame passes through our own 
              neighbourhoods."  - CNA/vm </span></p>
