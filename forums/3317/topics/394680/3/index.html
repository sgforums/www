              <p><strong>Singapore's YOG paddlers enter final leg of training</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's table tennis team for the Youth Olympic 
              Games is gearing up for a wave in training before the games begin next 
              month from August 14-26. </span></p>
              <p><span> The pair of Clarence Chew and Isabelle Li is headed to three 
              international tournaments over the next few weeks. </span></p>
              <p><span> These are the Asian Junior Championships, the Korea Junior Open and the 
              Hong Kong Junior Open. </span></p>
              <p><span> This is also the final leg of centralised training the duo has been 
              under for the past two years. </span></p>
              <p><span> It's intended to give them exposure to the various playing styles and 
              techniques, and also to prepare them for the YOG. </span></p>
              <p><span> Isabelle Li said: "It's a very good experience and exposure, getting to 
              play with world class players of my age and I get to see different 
              players of different styles and different techniques." </span></p>
              <p><span> Both players have also seen their world rankings rise. </span></p>
              <p><span> Clarence currently ranks 136th in the Under-18 category. Previously he 
              was was ranked 400. </span></p>
              <p><span> Isabelle is 24th in the Under-18 category, much better than her previous
               ranking of 146. </span></p>
              <p><span> President of the Singapore Table Tennis Association, Lee Bee Wah said: 
              "Since two years ago we have been preparing them for this YOG - both 
              Clarence and Isabelle have attended many centralised training and now 
              they're ready to face the challenge of once in their lifetime. </span></p>
              <p><span> "As usual we do not want to place too much pressure on them, we want 
              them to hit out there, do their best, play with their heart and fly the 
              Singapore flag high." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Singapore celebrates as Youth Olympic Flame lit in Greece </strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Celebrations were held in Youth Olympic Games (YOG) 
              host country Singapore as the Olympic Flame was lit in Greece on Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span> Athletes Amanda Lim and Silas Abdul Razak represented Singapore at the 
              lighting up of the Flame on the grounds of Ancient Olympia. </span></p>
              <p><span> Hockey player Silas said it was a privilege to be part of the historic event. </span></p>
              <p><span> "It was a great feeling being here at Olympia, running with the torch. 
              Many world-class athletes don't get to do that. How do I put 
              it?....happy and excited, and yes, too many feelings!" he said. </span></p>
              <p><span>As for swimmer Amanda, she is confident that the torch journey 
              will create more buzz for the YOG. "I think with the Flame starting (the
               journey), more Singaporeans and more people around the world 
              will....know the Games are here."
              <br> <br> The Youth Olympic Flame will travel to one city each in five continents, starting with the German city of Berlin.
              <br> <br> The next stop will be Dakar in Senegal - representing the African continent - followed by Mexico City.
              <br> <br> The Flame will then travel across the globe to Auckland in New Zealand.
              <br> <br> Its last stop on its international journey will be South Korea's capital
               Seoul, before its arrival on 5 August in Singapore which is hosting the
               first-ever YOG.
              <br> <br> More than 2,000 others will have the honour of carrying the first Youth Olympic Flame in a six-day relay around Singapore.
              <br> <br> And as the torch begins its journey around the world to its final 
              destination Singapore, celebrations were also held in the host city.
              <br> <br> At Merchant Loop, near Clarke Quay, 2,010 students got together in a spectacular mass formation that's shaped like a torch.
              <br> <br> CEO of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, Goh Kee 
              Nguan, said: "I hope that when the Flame reaches our shores, many more 
              people in Singapore will be as excited and enthusiastic as the crowd 
              gathered here for this human torch formation. I also hope that many more
               records would be broken when the sports competition starts. While not 
              all of us can participate in the Youth Olympic Games as athletes, we can
               all get involved and be part of the Games in our own ways."
              <br> <br> The event was organised by Worldwide Olympic Partner, Samsung. Other 
              activities saw performances by youth entertainers including Singapore 
              Idol Sezairi Sezali.
              <br> <br> Samsung says it will also present a host of activities at city 
              celebrations in Berlin, Dakar, Mexico City, Auckland and Seoul to 
              welcome the Olympic Flame and to celebrate the Olympic movement.

              <p><strong>YOG torch arrives in Berlin</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Youth Olympic Flame has arrived in Berlin, Germany 
              on the first stop of its journey that will span five continents as a 
              prelude to the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games. </span></p>
              <p><span> The torch arrived in the German capital a day after it was lit in Ancient Olympia, Greece. </span></p>
              <p><span> It made a brief visit at Siemensstadt, a famous sports club in Berlin 
              built in 1984. Over 650,000 people visit the Siemensstadt sports club a 
              year, and when the Flame made its stop, it was greeted by youth engaging
               in basketball, tennis and volleyball. </span></p>
              <p><span> The torch then made its way by boat on the Spree River, through the Haus
               der Kulturen der Welt - one of the leading European centres of 
              contemporary art and culture - and towards Pariser Platz, where the 
              famous Brandenburg Gate is located, for a city celebration. </span></p>
              <p><span> On stage, two German athletes bound for the upcoming Youth Olympic Games
               in Singapore, together with Ronny Ziesmer, the former German gymnast, 
              ignited the celebration cauldron using the Flame. </span></p>
              <p><span>Other athletes present at the celebration included Dirk Nowitzki –
               flag bearer of German Olympic team in Beijing 2008, and Andre Lange – 
              flag bearer of German Olympic team in Vancouver 2010.
              <br> <br> "I am thrilled to see the level of enthusiasm for sports displayed by 
              youths here in Berlin as well as Germany. This is especially true of the
               70 German youth athletes present here today who will be competing at 
              the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games next month," said Mr Ng Ser 
              Miang, chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising 
              Committee and Vice-President of the International Olympic Committee. 
              <br> <br> "Their dedication to their chosen sport shows that they embrace the 
              Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect in their daily 
              lives."
              <br> <br> To bring a slice of Singapore life, culture and tradition to Berlin, the
               Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (SYOGOC) has 
              partnered Singapore's Ministry of Information, Communication and the 
              Arts (MICA) to present a Singapore Showcase at the city celebration.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Showcase comprised four segments. The dance segment by 
              "The Roses" saw a group of four spunky girls take to the stage with an 
              energetic performance of hip-hop dance. 
              <br> <br> The music segment featured singer Erick Guansing performing the 
              much-loved Singapore song Bunga Sayang (which means "Flowers of Love" in
               Malay). 
              <br> <br> The sport segment featured the "Urban Street Team", Singapore's own 
              "Football Freestylers" who displayed some nifty footwork combining dance
               and football.
              <br> <br> To heighten the festive mood, the Singapore Showcase also featured a 
              fourth segment - a music, dance and sporty extravaganza with singers 
              Erick Guansing and Gayle Marilyn Nerva performing the catchy favourite, 
              "Celebration" alongside pop-inspired moves by young male dancers and the
               spunky dance quartet, "The Roses" and the football juggling antics of 
              "Urban Street Team".
              <br> <br> After Berlin, the Youth Olympic Flame will travel to Dakar in Senegal 
              (representing Africa), Mexico City in Mexico (representing the 
              Americas),    Auckland in New Zealand (representing Oceania) and Seoul 
              in South Korea (representing Asia).
              <br> <br> The Flame will arrive in Singapore on 6 August for a traditional six-day torch relay around the island.
              <br> <br> The Youth Olympic Games will kick off in Singapore on August 14. Some 
              3,600 athletes, aged between 14 and 18, from more than 200 nations are 
              taking part.
              <br> <br> Altogether there will be 26 different sports categories.

              <p><strong>YOG torch arrives in Senegal from Berlin</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Youth Olympic Flame has arrived in Dakar, Senegal 
              on the second leg of its journey that will span five continents as a 
              prelude to the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games. </span></p>
              <p><span> The torch arrived in Dakar from the German capital of Berlin, two days after it was lit in Ancient Olympia, Greece on Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span> Upon its arrival, the Flame was  presented to Senegal's Prime Minister 
              Soulayeman Ndene Ndiaye by Mr Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore 
              Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Flame travelled around Dakar, visiting historical sites such as City Hall and the Presidential Palace.
              <br> <br> The YOG organising committee says the journey across Dakar brought 
              enthusiasm and excitement to the city with many Senegalese children and 
              adults following alongside the convoy. 
              <br> <br> The Flame was then transported to Goree Island, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

              <p><strong>Youth Olympic Flame arrives in Mexico City </strong></p>
              <p><span>Mexico City, Mexico: The Youth Olympic Flame has made its third 
              stop on a tour that spans five continents, arriving in Mexico City, one 
              of the most populous capital cities in the world. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame in Mexico City coincides with 
              celebrations to mark Mexico’s 200 years of independence, and signalled 
              the start of a two-day City Celebration. </span></p>
              <p><span> Together with Mexican athletes, sports and government officals, and 
              members of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, the 
              Flame went on parade through Mexico City. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Mexican leg of the Flame’s journey included a visit to a community 
              centre catering to less privileged youth in Iztapalapa; Ecoguarda Centre
               - a place dedicated to teaching Mexicans about protecting their 
              environment; and Hidalgo Garden in Coyoacán, a town that is popular with
               artists and musicians. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame climaxed at the Government 
              Palace of Mexico City, where the Flamewas lit and passed to Mexico City,
               representing the Americas. 
              <br> <br> The Flame then proceeded to Zocalo, the main square in the heart of the historic centre of Mexico City.
              <br> <br> “Mexico was the first Latin-American host of the Olympic Games in 1968. 
              Along with that, we saw the first female athlete, Enriqueta Basilio, to 
              light the Olympic cauldron" noted Mr Ser Miang NG, Chairman of the 
              Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, in his speech to 
              kick off celebrations.
              <br> <br> "Through the Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame, we hope to connect and 
              inspire the youth of the Americas to continue to embrace and live the 
              Olympic values of Excellence, Friendship and Respect” he added.
              <br> <br> Mexico's fiesta featured a Singapore Showcase extravaganza with a 
              line-up that included Ethnicity, an ethnic fusion pop band, singer Erick
               Guansing and Singapore Idol finalist Gayle Nerva.
              <br> <br> The crowd was also treated to fancy footwork by “The Roses”, a spunky 
              all-girl hip hop group and Singapore’s own “Football Freestylers” who 
              combine football and dance. 
              <br> <br> The Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame is a 13-day odyssey to 
              celebration cities, representing five continents, around the world. 
              <br> <br> The Flame arrives in Singapore on 6 August for a traditional six-day 
              torch relay around the island nation before the torch ignites the 
              cauldron of the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, during the Opening 
              Ceremony of the inaugural games. </span></p>

              <p><strong>YOG ticket sales picking up, with 70% sold</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : As the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) draws closer, ticket sales have picked up. </span></p>
              <p><span> So far, 70 per cent of the tickets have been sold. These cover the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the 26 sports. </span></p>
              <p><span> Organisers gave this update on Monday as they launched the public sale of tickets for the Opening Ceremony on August 14. </span></p>
              <p><span> The tickets for the Opening Ceremony, which promises to be a spectacular show, were offered through a ballot. </span></p>
              <p><span> However, some of the tickets were not collected by those who were successful, so they are now offered through public sale. </span></p>
              <p><span>That is great news for fans like Mdm Ho Siew Khim. She said: 
              "(I'm) so surprised - he told me got tickets for the Opening. I'm so 
              happy."
              <br> <br> She said she had asked around to see if those who were successful in getting the tickets would sell them to her.
              <br> <br> She added: "Today, I bought (them) myself. I am going to buy some more. I
               am coming back tomorrow because I don't have enough cash."
              <br> <br> She was among a steady stream of fans at the SISTIC counter at the Indoor Stadium.
              <br> <br> Besides the SISTIC counter, tickets can also be bought online at 
              www.singapore2010.sg/tickets and the hotline at +65-63482010. Tickets 
              are priced at S$200, S$120 and S$80.
              <br> <br> The most popular appeared to be tickets prized at S$80. Francis Huang, 
              who purchased tickets for the YOG Opening Ceremony, said: "I think it is
               within reasonable limits for such an international event."
              <br> <br> Others may be waiting until the YOG draws nearer before getting their tickets.
              <br> <br> But Teresa Teo Guttensohn, who was also at the SISTIC counter buying the
               tickets, said: "I think there will be a last-minute rush when they 
              realise it's in two weeks' time, so 'let's go get the tickets'."
              <br> <br> The YOG Torch Relay starts on Saturday and involves some 2,400 
              torchbearers from all walks of life, with the youngest only 11 years old
               and the oldest an 82-year-old former national hockey player, Ajit 
              Singh. 
              <br> <br> The island-wide relay will last for six days and is expected to generate more buzz and boost ticket sales.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The journey of the Youth Olympic Flame has officially started in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span> The torch relay started at CHIJ Toa Payoh where hundreds of students, teachers and parents gathered to celebrate the occasion. </span></p>
              <p><span> The torch was lit at exactly 8.35am. </span></p>
              <p><span> 16-year-old Tay Shi Pei was thrilled when she received the torch from Education Minister Ng Eng Hen. </span></p>
              <p><span>"When the Minister (Ng Eng Hen) passed me the torch I wasn't 
              thinking of anything because I just couldn't think; I just blanked out 
              by the flashes and stuff. But I could feel like it's really overwhelming
               and I feel the excitement just bursting out.
              <br> <br> "I didn't feel the rain when I was running, so only after that, somehow 
              the rain came and then I would say it went pretty well because like, I 
              think we ran as per normal and everyone adjusted really well, so a 
              spontaneous experience reaction."
              <br> <br> Despite the rain, many in the crowd stood on the open field in their 
              ponchos, trying to catch a glimpse of the eight torchbearers as they 
              made their way round the school track.
              <br> <br> At about 9am, the torch was brought to the Ministry of Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) where about 800 supporters, 
              including MCYS staff and family members, extended a warm welcome and 
              watched performances.
              <br> <br> The supporters packed the building as they welcomed deputy secretary of MCYS, Mr Chew Hock Yong, as he ran in with the torch.
              <br> <br> The torch relay continued along Thomson Road, MacRitchie Park, Marymount Road. 
              <br> <br> The morning leg of the relay ended at Raffles Institution at noon.
              <br> <br> MediaCorp personalities such as actress Joanne Peh and news presenter Steve Chia also pitched in.
              <br> <br> Over six days, 2,400 torch-bearers will bring the flame to different 
              corners of the island, covering a total distance of over 300 kilometres.
               
              <br> <br> Next Saturday, the Flame will be lit at the Marina Bay Floating Platform
               in the official opening of the world's first Youth Olympic Games.

              <p>Large crowds were seen lining the streets of Potong Pasir, 
              Serangoon and Marine Parade, cheering on the torchbearers who included 
              57-year-old ultra-marathoner Lim Nghee Huat and top Singaporeans 
              skateboarder Muhammad Firdaus.</p>
              <p>The torch's journey began at St Andrew's Village, where 
              1,000 students witnessed the lighting of the torch by the 
              guest-of-honour, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National
               Security Professor S Jayakumar.</p>
              <p>The flame will reach its destination this evening at ITE

              <p><strong>YOG goes paperless with 3-in-1 card for opening &amp; closing ceremonies</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in Singapore is going 
              paperless - in its opening and closing ceremonies on August 14 and 26 
              respectively. </span></p>
              <p><span> It is using a three-in-one prepaid card system, which is a "first" for any Olympic event. </span></p>
              <p><span> The lucky spectators who will be in Singapore for the opening or closing ceremonies have been promised a hassle-free experience. </span></p>
              <p><span>Each will be given a special card.
              <br> <br> With it, the user can do three things - get into the venue; enjoy free 
              public transport, which is strongly recommended by the organisers; and 
              pay for services and goods at selected outlets.
              <br> <br> This card system replaces the usual paper ticket system.
              <br> <br> "In the conventional days, we use tickets... and my guys will have to 
              use the pace counter to count. Now, it's all electronic," said Richard 
              Loong, operations director for the Opening &amp; Closing Ceremonies. 
              <br> <br> The back of the card is colour-coded to indicate the section the spectator should be seated in.
              <br> <br> The organisers also have added features to prevent people from sneaking in.
              <br> <br> "The cards have (noted that you've) accessed the compound, so it will 
              not allow you to access again. So our system will prompt the ticket 
              checker to disallow them entry," said Loong. 
              <br> <br> "When you go out, you will also have a wristband to signify that you've 
              gone out of the compound, so that's another measure put in place," he 
              added. 
              <br> <br> Besides being a collector's item, the card is still useful after the Games. It can be used as a regular transit card. 
              <br> <br> As for the individual events and matches, entry to the venues stays with the paper ticket. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><strong>YOG kicks off officially in spectacular opening ceremony</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) officially 
              opened Saturday in a spectacular blaze of colour, with International 
              Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge hailing it as a new chapter in
               the Olympic movement. </span></p>
              <p><span> With the Singapore skyline as an impressive backdrop, some 7,000 singers
               and dancers performed in an opening ceremony on a floating platform at 
              Marina Bay. </span></p>
              <p><span> "Tonight we open a new chapter in the history of the Olympic movement," 
              International Olympic Committee president Rogge told the 27,000-capacity
               crowd and a worldwide television audience in declaring the Games open. </span></p>
              <p><span> "From this moment on, young people around the world have a chance to 
              participate in a global forum that combines sport, education and 
              culture." </span></p>
              <p><span>The Games, which feature athletes aged 14 to 18, are a project 
              Rogge has championed since becoming IOC chief in 2001, with the event 
              designed as a stepping stone for youngsters striving to compete at an 
              Olympics proper.
              <br> <br> Some 3,600 athletes from 205 countries will take part in the 26 events 
              that make up the traditional Olympics, with a simultaneous cultural and 
              education programme running to teach them about Olympic values and 
              global issues.
              <br> <br> Some of the sports have been adapted, with new formats like street basketball and triathlon with mixed gender teams.
              <br> <br> There will even be competitions with mixed teams from different nationalities.
              <br> <br> Addressing the athletes, Dr Rogge said the Games would help them "learn the difference between winning and being a champion".
              <br> <br> "To win, you merely have to cross the finish line," he said. "To be a 
              champion, you have to inspire admiration for your character, as well as 
              for your physical talent."
              <br> <br> As well as Rogge, the ceremony was attended by Singapore Prime Minister 
              Lee Hsien Loong and Youth Olympic Games ambassador Yelena Isinbaeva, the
               Olympic pole-vault champion and world record-holder.
              <br> <br> Other Games ambassadors, swimming sensation Michael Phelps and sprint king Usain Bolt, sent messages of support.
              <br> <br> The golden moment came when the final torch-bearer - 15-year-old 
              Singapore national sailor Darren Choy - appeared to lit the Youth 
              Olympic Games cauldron.
              <br> <br> After two-and-a-half years, the country's dream has finally ignited - 
              along with the aspirations of the 3,600 participating youth athletes.
              <br> <br> The Games run from August 14 to 26.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Chinese female weightlifter Yuan Tian has won the Gold
               in the 48-kilogramme category of the Youth Olympic Games (YOG). </span></p>
              <p><span> On Sunday afternoon at the Toa Payoh Sports Hall, she lifted 85 kilogrammes in the Snatch, which was a new world youth record. </span></p>
              <p><span> And minutes later, Yuan Tian set another world record by lifting 105 
              kilogrammes in the Clean and Jerk, for a combined total of 190 
              kilogrammes. </span></p>
              <p><span> Sirivimon Pramongkol of Thailand took the silver with her combined lift 
              of 163 kilogrammes, while Genesis Rodriquez of Venezuela settled for the
               bronze medal. </span></p>
              <p><span>Over in Fencing, Singapore's Liane Wong was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Foil competition on Sunday afternoon. 
              <br> <br> The 16-year-old CHIJ Toa Payoh student lost 15-5 to her Russian opponent. 
              <br> <br> In the Boys' sabre competition, World Junior Champion Richard Hubers is 
              through to the semi-finals and is the favourite to add the YOG gold 
              medal to his resume.
              <br> <br> Switching to rowing, another German youth world champion, Felix Bach 
              clocked the fastest time of 3 minutes 22.25 seconds to go through to the
               semi-finals of the 1,000-metre single sculls event.
              <br> <br> Nadzrie finished fifth, the last in his group, with a timing of 3 
              minutes and 40 seconds - a good 9 seconds behind his personal best - in 
              the Men's Single Scull Heat. He will now take part in the repechage on 
              Monday at Marina Reservoir. 
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, the Republic's female rower Joanna Chan set a new personal 
              best of 4 minutes 4.54 seconds in the Women's Single Scull Heat. But her
               fourth place finish in the heats means that she will also take part in 
              Monday's repechage. 
              <br> <br> Team Singapore also got their 3-on-3 basketball campaign underway on Sunday, when the girls lost 33-22 to Germany. 
              <br> <br> And in the Boys Preliminary outing against the Central African Republic, Singapore lost 25-17. - CNA/ms
