              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: One in two young Singaporeans have little intention 
              of moving overseas. They are rooted by strong family ties, national 
              pride, and have confidence in the country's economic future.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This finding emerged
               from a study conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies, involving 
              more more than 2,013 Singaporeans between 19 and 30 years old.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The respondents were interviewed in door-to-door surveys over three months, from December 2009 to March 2010.<br><br>Friends,
               family and home ownership are the main reasons identified by young 
              Singaporeans when asked what keeps them rooted to the country.<br><br>The
               respondents were asked to pick the reasons from 26 items such as 
              quality of life, finance and career, social bonding and well-being and 
              socio-political considerations.<br><br>When Channel NewsAsia took to the streets, many cited similar considerations.<br><br>"I don't think I'm moving out of Singapore because of friends and family here," said a young Singaporean.<br><br>"Singapore
               is a good to live in, with a lot of opportunities to excel in 
              life...there's (also) no natural disaster in Singapore, like what 
              happened to Japan," said another.<br><br>But others felt emigration 
              represented a better life, citing Singapore's high cost of living and 
              hectic lifestyle as possible reasons for migrating.<br><br>The Institute
               of Policy Studies' survey found that young Singaporeans fell into four 
              broad categories. There is the "Heartland Stayer" - unlikely to emigrate
               and has strong ties and national pride. Similarly, the "Cosmopolitan 
              Stayer" has low intention of leaving and is rooted in Singapore. 
              However, this group views emigration favourably and has the ability to 
              leave.<br><br>There is also the "Explorer" group - the one most likely 
              to emigrate. They have strong family ties but doesn't feel connected to 
              Singapore. And then there is the "Disengaged" have the weakest family 
              bonds and lowest national pride. They also have no strong opinion on 
              emigration, and have a lower ability to migrate.<br><br>The Institute of
               Policy Studies said the survey findings showed that young Singaporeans 
              are not a homogenous group and a one-size-fits-all policy will not work.
               This makes it challenging for policymakers to engage them on the issue 
              of rootedness as different factors appeal to different segments. But one
               area that can be looked into is the issue of work-life balance, which 
              emerged as an important anchor.<br><br>Dr Leong Chan Hoong, lead 
              researcher and research fellow with the Institute of Policy Studies, 
              said: "They find that this work-life balance is lacking in Singapore. As
               a result, some of them consider migrating abroad to achieve that. So it
               is important for policymakers to pay attention to this area and more 
              importantly, to see whether that attitude, that perception changes over 
              time."<br><br>The institute hopes to conduct another survey in two to three years.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>1) Income tax: Spore is one of the lowest income tax compare to most of the countries. I have a friend station at Europe, 30% of the income tax (for expat) went to the govt (hope I did not heard wrongly)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Transportation: Spore transportation is consider best. Not talking about crowded, fares expensive, no air con etc.... When probe further, one of my friend told me : NO STRIKE.

              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: One in two young Singaporeans have little intention of moving overseas. They are rooted by strong family ties, national pride, and have confidence in the country's economic future.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>This finding emerged from a study conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies, involving more more than 2,013 Singaporeans between 19 and 30 years old.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>The respondents were interviewed in door-to-door surveys over three months, from December 2009 to March 2010.<br><br>Friends, family and home ownership are the main reasons identified by young Singaporeans when asked what keeps them rooted to the country.<br><br>The respondents were asked to pick the reasons from 26 items such as quality of life, finance and career, social bonding and well-being and socio-political considerations.<br><br>When Channel NewsAsia took to the streets, many cited similar considerations.<br><br>"I don't think I'm moving out of Singapore because of friends and family here," said a young Singaporean.<br><br>"Singapore is a good to live in, with a lot of opportunities to excel in life...there's (also) no natural disaster in Singapore, like what happened to Japan," said another.<br><br>But others felt emigration represented a better life, citing Singapore's high cost of living and hectic lifestyle as possible reasons for migrating.<br><br>The Institute of Policy Studies' survey found that young Singaporeans fell into four broad categories. There is the "Heartland Stayer" - unlikely to emigrate and has strong ties and national pride. Similarly, the "Cosmopolitan Stayer" has low intention of leaving and is rooted in Singapore. However, this group views emigration favourably and has the ability to leave.<br><br>There is also the "Explorer" group - the one most likely to emigrate. They have strong family ties but doesn't feel connected to Singapore. And then there is the "Disengaged" have the weakest family bonds and lowest national pride. They also have no strong opinion on emigration, and have a lower ability to migrate.<br><br>The Institute of Policy Studies said the survey findings showed that young Singaporeans are not a homogenous group and a one-size-fits-all policy will not work. This makes it challenging for policymakers to engage them on the issue of rootedness as different factors appeal to different segments. But one area that can be looked into is the issue of work-life balance, which emerged as an important anchor.<br><br>Dr Leong Chan Hoong, lead researcher and research fellow with the Institute of Policy Studies, said: "They find that this work-life balance is lacking in Singapore. As a result, some of them consider migrating abroad to achieve that. So it is important for policymakers to pay attention to this area and more importantly, to see whether that attitude, that perception changes over time."<br><br>The institute hopes to conduct another survey in two to three years.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
