              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says how well Singapore does in the long term depends on its policies and politics.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In his traditional 
              May Day message on Saturday, he said Singapore needs both the right 
              policies and the right politics to produce governments that pursue sound
               policies, a stable environment for growth and confidence in Singapore's
               long-term prospects.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singapore's good government and policies have led to better jobs and lives, said Prime Minister Lee.<br><br>The country has to keep this virtuous cycle going, he added.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said politics here have looked after the interests of workers, not 
              just in the sense of parties and elections but in the sense of 
              Singaporeans understanding what their future depends on and supporting 
              leaders who will work with them to secure their future. <br><br>It is 
              also about upholding key institutions like the tripartite partners so 
              that the country is resilient when confronted by challenges and to 
              emerge from crises tougher and more united.<br><br>On inflation, Mr Lee said it has been higher than the people wished and that hopefully it will moderate later this year.<br><br>The
               stronger Singapore dollar will help to mitigate imported inflation, and
               businesses too have responded well to the government's efforts to hold 
              down prices of basic essentials.<br><br>Meanwhile the S$3.2 billion "Grow &amp; Share" package will help homes cope with the higher cost of living. <br><br>Mr
               Lee believes that for most lower- and middle-income households, the 
              package should more than make up for the higher cost of living this 
              year.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "We aim to grow not for its own sake, but so 
              as to raise the standards of living of our people across the board. 
              Without growth, we would lack resources to invest in our future and to 
              help Singaporeans in need. <br><br>"But even with growth, we must make a
               concerted effort to enable all Singaporeans to benefit, through social 
              programmes like home ownership, education and affordable health care, as
               well as through special measures like the 'Grow &amp; Share' package 
              when the economy does exceptionally well."<br><br>2011 also marks 50 years of partnership between the People's Action Party and the labour movement, NTUC. <br><br>Mr
               Lee said this unique symbiotic relationship has produced successive PAP
               governments that have improved the lives of workers beyond recognition.<br><br>Mr
               Lee urged workers to continue working together to grow the economy, 
              create more good jobs and secure a brighter future together for many 
              years to come.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>The current political system in Singapore has exhausted its potentials.</p>
              <p>Singapore must reform its political system and society in order to move forward and survive in the 21st century.</p>
              <p>I don't think PAP can do it, that is why I support a shake up of political system by voting the PAP out on May 7.</p>
