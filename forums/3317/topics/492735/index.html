              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amos Yee pleads guilty to wounding religious feelings of Muslims</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Teenage blogger Amos Yee on Wednesday (Sep 28) pleaded guilty to three charges of wounding the religious feelings of Muslims.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The 17-year-old admitted to producing and uploading online a photograph and two videos that were deliberately intended to wound Muslim feelings. He will be sentenced on Thursday morning.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Last month, Yee pleaded guilty to three charges of wounding Muslim and Christian feelings and two charges for failing to show up at a police station. During his trial, the court heard that 24 police reports had been lodged against him, in relation to the total of six counts he faces for wounding religious feelings.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Yee left Singapore on Dec 13 last year, after he was served a notice requiring him to attend a police interview two days later. He travelled to Hong Kong, where he published several posts about being served the notice.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>After he returned in April this year, the police served another notice on Yee. He tried to leave the country the day before the interview and was arrested on May 11.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The blogger was convicted of similar charges last year and sentenced to four weeks' jail.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>For wounding religious feelings, Yee could be jailed up to three years, fined or both. For disobeying an order to appear at a police station for investigations, he could be jailed for a maximum of one month, fined a total of S$1,500, or both.  </div>

              <p>he is not even fit to be even siao. Siao lang are not like that. Crazy people are more genuine i know becasue i am one - though i know of siao lang who likes attention and keeps talking bull just like him, only don;t dare to produce contents like him only.</p>
              <p>Comon Amos, if you think christianity and Islam is bull, at least point out logically and specifically why it is so, so that they religious leaders can at least reflect and do more to improve the religions image.</p>
              <p>Like if you say some Christians are bad, quote the 6 people from CHC. And if Islam has some flaws, point it to people like the extremist who using a religion to commit crimes aginst humanity.</p>
              <p>these are facts and sure won't get youin trouble.</p>

              <p>Amos has a mental condition called narcisstic personality disorder - unfortunately the Internet allows such dickheads to proliferate their hate-filled rants - if u watch his videos his ramblings remind me of hitler speeches - illogical and ill informed arguments - littered with incoherent grammatically incorrect cliche - he should be put in a mental institute for everyone elses well being.....</p>

              <p>Thanks Pasty- for pointing out NPD - now that you mentioned it i do notice some mental patients and peer i know whom exhibits such behaviour.  </p>

              <p><em>Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for admiration and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of ultraconfidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.</em></p>
              <div id="adsmobileBottom"><em></em></div>
              <p><em>A narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, such as relationships, work, school or financial affairs. You may be generally unhappy and disappointed when you're not given the special favors or admiration you believe you deserve. Others may not enjoy being around you, and you may find your relationships unfulfilling.</em>              </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teen blogger Amos Yee granted US asylum</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: The United States has granted asylum to Singaporean blogger Amos Yee, according to the US law firm representing him in his application.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to a media update on Grossman Law's website, Immigration Judge Samuel Cole granted Yee asylum after he concluded that the Singapore Government "persecuted Yee on account of his political opinion". </div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>The judge also found Yee and his two witnesses, one of whom is Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam, leader of the opposition Reform Party, "credible" and that the applicant had established he "suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion". The Department of Homeland Security has not rebutted the presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future prosecution, he added. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Yee has met his burden of showing that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Singapore," according to the decision of the Immigration Judge, as posted on the law firm's website. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Department of Homeland Security has 30 days (until Apr 24) to file an appeal. If the government fails to appeal, the decision will become final, the law firm said, adding it has contacted the Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Chicago to secure Yee's release. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Yee's mother, Madam Mary Toh, confirmed last December that he was detained in the United States. According to US-based Singaporean civil activist Melissa Chen, the 18-year-old was detained after he landed at O'Hare Airport in Chicago.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Singaporean was sentenced in July 2015 to four weeks' jail for wounding the religious feelings of Christians and Muslims, and was sentenced to another six week's jail for the same offence last September. </div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amos Yee asylum: 'Prerogative of the US' to take in people who engage in hate speech, says MHA</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: It is the prerogative of the United States to take in people who engage in hate speech, but Singapore takes a very different approach, the Ministry of Home Affairs said on Saturday (Mar 25) evening, in response to media queries after teen blogger Amos Yee was granted asylum in the US.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Yee had been jailed in Singapore for hate speech against both Christians and Muslims.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He was granted asylum in the US after an immigration judge there concluded that the Singapore Government had "persecuted Yee on account of his political opinion".</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"There are many more such people, around the world, who deliberately engage in hate speech, and who may be prosecuted. Some of them, will no doubt take note of the US approach, and consider applying for asylum in the US," said MHA.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>SINGAPORE TAKES A 'VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH': MHA</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In 2015, Yee was jailed four weeks for hate speech against Christians, as well as for publishing an obscene image. The next year, Yee was jailed six weeks and fined S$2,000, this time for hate speech against Muslims and Christians.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"The US adopts a different standard, and allows such hate speech under the rubric of freedom of speech. The US for example, in the name of freedom of speech, allows the burning of the Quran," noted MHA.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Singapore takes a very different approach. Anyone who engages in hate speech or attempts to burn the Quran, Bible, or any religious text in Singapore, will be arrested and charged."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MHA also pointed out that the US Department of Homeland Security had opposed Yee’s asylum application on the basis that Yee had been legitimately prosecuted.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Department of Homeland Security has 30 days (until Apr 24) to file an appeal. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MHA's full statement, which references the statements made by Yee, is available on its website.</div>

              <p>Someday, he will regret what he has done, and would want to return to Singapore.</p>
