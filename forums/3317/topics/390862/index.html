              <p><span>PUNE, India - A bomb ripped through a restaurant popular with
              tourists in the western Indian city of Pune on Saturday, killing nine
              people and casting a shadow over the resumption of Indo-Pakistan peace
              talks.
              <br> <br>At least one foreigner -- believed to be a Taiwanese national --
              was among the dead, according to Pune Police Commissioner Satyapal
              Singh, who said 45 people had been injured, some of them seriously.
              <br> <br>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which
              India's Home Minister P. Chidambaram described as "a significant
              terrorist incident".
              <br> <br> "All the evidence points to a deliberate plot," Chidambaram said.
              <br> <br>It was the first major attack on Indian soil since the November
              2008 Mumbai massacre -- blamed on the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba
              militant group -- which had prompted New Delhi to suspend dialogue with
              Islamabad.
              <br> <br>The South Asian rivals had agreed just last week to resume talks,
              and the Pune blast triggered immediate opposition calls for that
              decision to be reviewed.
              <br> <br>The bomb went off in the German Bakery -- an established eatery in
              the Koregaon Park area of the city -- at about 7:30 pm (1400 GMT).
              <br> <br>"It appears that an unattended package was noticed... by one of the
              waiters who apparently went and attempted to open the package when the
              blast took place," Indian Home Secretary G.K. Pillai told reporters in
              New Delhi.
              <br> <br>An eyewitness interviewed by the CNN-IBN news channel described a
              scene of carnage, with body parts littered around the immediate site of
              the blast.
              <br> <br> "There is no German Bakery anymore," he said. "There were bodies everywhere. We tried to help carry them into the ambulances."
              <br> <br>Pune is about 100 kilometres (60 miles) southeast of Mumbai and the
              blast carried certain echoes of the 2008 attack on India's financial
              capital by 10 Islamist gunmen that killed 166 people.
              <br> <br>The German Bakery is only 200 yards (metres) from an ashram, or
              religious retreat, specialising in meditation courses run by a
              Swiss-based firm Osho International.
              <br> <br>Pillai noted that David Headley, a US-Pakistani national awaiting
              trial in the United States for allegedly scouting out possible targets
              in the Mumbai attacks, is believed to have stayed in the ashram on a
              trip to Pune.
              <br> <br> Headley, 49, has pleaded not guilty to 12 terrorism-related charges and remains in custody in Chicago.
              <br> <br>The bakery was also close to Chabad House, a Jewish cultural and
              religious centre run by the orthodox Chabad-Lubavitch movement whose
              members were targeted in the Mumbai attacks.
              <br> <br>Rabbi Betzalel Kupchik, from Pune Chabad House, told AFP: "Everyone
              here is OK. We are on the same street. We are some minutes walk away.
              We heard the bomb."
              <br> <br>The Mumbai assault was carried out by 10 Islamist extremists who
              stormed a number of high profile sites, including two luxury hotels,
              the city's main railway station and a popular restaurant.
              <br> <br> A total of 166 people were killed, including 25 foreigners, and more than 300 others injured in a 60-hour orgy of violence.
              <br> <br>The attacks' sole surviving gunman, Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab, is
              currently on trial at a high security prison court in Mumbai, charged
              with a raft of offences, including "waging war against India," murder
              and attempted murder.
              <br> <br>Prakash Jawadekar, a spokesman for the main opposition Hindu
              nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said the government should now
              reconsider the resumption of talks with Pakistan which has been
              scheduled for February 25.
              <br> <br> "Terror and talks cannot go together" Jawadekar told reporters after visiting the blast site in Pune.

              <p><strong>India says Pakistan talks on track despite Pune blast: sources</strong></p>
              <p><span>NEW DELHI : India and Pakistan will resume peace talks as
              planned, government sources said on Monday, despite a deadly restaurant
              bombing and questions over whether Islamist militants were involved. </span></p>
              <p><span>As police scoured security camera footage of Saturday's blast at
              the German Bakery in Pune, western India, a government source in New
              Delhi told AFP there was "no change" to a scheduled meeting of Indian
              and Pakistani foreign secretaries on February 25.
              <br> <br> It will mark the first official talks between the two South Asian rivals for 14 months.
              <br> <br>Another source said the government would refrain from any
              "knee-jerk reaction," amid calls from the main opposition Hindu
              nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that the meeting should be
              called off.
              <br> <br>India broke off all official dialogue with Pakistan following the
              November, 2008 Mumbai attacks which it blamed on the Pakistani-based
              militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
              <br> <br>Saturday's blast in Pune was the first major attack on Indian soil
              since then and came just a day after the two sides agreed to the
              foreign secretaries' meet.
              <br> <br>Two foreigners - an Italian woman and an Iranian man - were among
              the nine people killed. Twelve of the 57 people injured were foreign
              nationals.
              <br> <br>Indian media reports sought to link Saturday's bombing to previous
              attacks by an India-based Islamist movement, the Indian Mujahideen,
              fearing sleeper cells were now active and further strikes likely.
              <br> <br>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has called for swift action to bring
              the culprits to justice but police have refused to comment on
              speculation the blast was the work of the Indian Mujahideen.
              <br> <br>The group claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in New
              Delhi in September 2008 and reports have highlighted similarities
              between them and the Pune blast.
              <br> <br>A bomb hidden in an abandoned rucksack left under a table exploded
              at about 7.30 pm (1400 GMT) on Saturday while the restaurant was packed
              with mainly young Indians.
              <br> <br> Home Minister P Chidambaram has also refused to speculate on who was responsible.
              <br> <br>But on Sunday, he said they were keen to speak to David Coleman
              Headley, a US-Pakistani national currently awaiting trial in the United
              States on a string of terror charges.
              <br> <br> Headley, 49, is alleged to have scouted possible targets in India for the LeT before the Mumbai attacks. He denies the claims.
              <br> <br>Chidambaram said Headley stayed at the Osho Ashram - a religious
              retreat popular with foreigners - which is a stone's throw from the
              German Bakery.
              <br> <br>A religious and cultural centre run by the orthodox
              Chabad-Lubavitch movement is also nearby. A similar centre was one of
              the targets in the Mumbai attacks.
              <br> <br>The Times of India said on Monday that the bombing should be seen
              in the context of the resumption of the diplomatic talks and a major
              coalition offensive in southern Afghanistan.
              <br> <br>Pakistan-based Islamists "could well be trying to open up a
              conflict zone on Pakistan's eastern front, which would deflect
              attention from them," an editorial in the daily said.
              <br> <br>India's BJP has said the attack - which triggered heightened
              security across the country - underscored fears the government had
              acted rashly in agreeing to resume talks with Pakistan.
              <br> <br>Senior party leader Arun Jaitley said Pune was "a grim reminder
              about the fragility of our security system, and the adventurous track
              that we are walking.
              <br> <br>"The whole nation is wondering today as to what has changed that we
              decided to change our diplomatic position. When terror threatens India,
              then not talking is also a legitimate diplomatic option," he said. -
