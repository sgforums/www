              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">'Grave mistake' to assume racial violence will not happen in Singapore - DPM Wong</span></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's diversity in race and religion can be its strength but also its Achilles heel.</p>
              <p>And as more Singaporeans turn to religion in recent years, it is
              important that this increased religiosity does not in turn create fault
              lines in the society.</p>
              <p>These remarks were made by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng at the National Day Dinner in Bishan East.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong who is also the Minister for Home Affairs, says it would be
              a ' grave mistake ' to think that violence such as the recent
              inter-ethnic clashes in Xinjiang, China cannot happen in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Speaking in English, Malay and Mandarin , DPM Wong elaborated at
              length why Singapore needs to ' zealously guard ' its racial and
              religious harmony.</p>
              <p>The clashes in Xinjiang as well as various racial incidents around
              the world, serves as a ' grim reminder' of the importance of '
              sensitivity ' in handling potential tensions and misunderstandings.</p>
              <p>He pointed out how such tensions could also happen right here in Singapore</p>
              <p>" Some time ago a Chinese family held a wake at the void deck of a
              HDB flat. During the wake, there was a misunderstanding between the
              Chinese family and a Malay family. The Malay family objected to the
              buring of incense at the grass patch in front of the block. A scuffle
              broke out and Police was called to intervene. Grassroots leaders
              including members of the inter racial confidence circle visited the
              families to talk to them. both families realised that there was a
              misunderstanding . The MP subsequently met both families and they
              apologised to each other and the matter was settled amicably."<br> <br> And one channel the government has made use of in maintaining such
              social harmony is through common spaces, such as the school, work place
              and national service .</p>
              <p>DPM Wong says it is ' necessary ' that these common spaces remain secular.</p>
              <p>This even as more Singaporeans are reportedly turning to religion.</p>
              <p>"There is nothing wrong to be religions. But even as we turn towards
              religion to guide us, we have to be acutely mindful of the impact on
              the people around us in our multi racial and multi religious society.
              My ministry received a letter from a member of public last month . The
              writer received religious literature in his letterbox which he felt was
              critical of non-believers. And he wrote ' Religious beliefs are deeply
              personal. Their potential for incendiary contention is well known and
              they should be best confined to the private sphere ' . His reaction is
              not difficult to understand."</p>
              <p>As more seek out religion, Mr Wong says it is important that they do
              so in a way that does not lead to closed minds and exclusive groups.</p>
              <p>He stressed that racial and religious harmony is a 'valuable capital ' towards Singapore's future success.</p>
