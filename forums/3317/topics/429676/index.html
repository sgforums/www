              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Finance Minister and People's Action Party (PAP) 
              candidate for Jurong Group Representation Constituency (GRC), Tharman 
              Shanmugratnam, has emphasised that self-help groups like SINDA will only
               achieve a "win-win" solution when they work closely with the government
               and community.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He also stressed 
              that it is naive to think that a system which rests on race-blind 
              national initiatives can achieve the same level of improvement for the 
              different communities.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Tharman was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of his campaign in Jurong GRC on Thursday.<br><br>Mr
               Tharman, who is also the chairman of the SINDA Board of Trustees, said:
               "If it is purely race-based self-help groups, it will end up being a 
              little divisive. If it is purely a government, you miss out on a touch 
              that is necessary, the human touch and the emotional connection to 
              motivate people, especially those in the disadvantaged situation. That 
              is the reality.<br><br>"Working in partnership with the government and 
              working in partnership with the community and now increasingly working 
              in partnership with Narpani, and the grassroots organisations, we have 
              learnt a lot as to what works and what does not work. But one thing is 
              very clear - being Indian helps, being Indian is a tremendous advantage 
              when you approach an Indian family, when you want to motivate the kids, 
              because they see in you something that is possible.<br><br>"We get our 
              successful young people, those who are doing well in ITE, those who are 
              doing well in JC, we get them to join us and be the motivators. And it 
              would be different if they were not Indians.<br><br>"Likewise in the 
              Malay community, it would be different if we did not have Malay 
              volunteers there, showing the way as role models, and that is the human 
              reality all around the world, and to deny it is naive, and suggests that
               you are out of touch. I want to say this not because of politics, I 
              want to say this to make sure it succeeds."<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              i didnt read the rest but sounds like a last minute desperate act for votes or something.
              
              makes me suddenly think all the years they must have been practising win-lose situation.
              
              oppositions will get the votes.
