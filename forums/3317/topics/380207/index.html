              <p>ULAN BATOR (AFP) - â€“ Mongolia's
              parliament on Wednesday approved the resignation of Prime Minister
              Sanjaa Bayar, who was forced to step down due to ill health, state
              television reported.</p>
              <p>The 53-year-old Bayar, who was seen as an
              economic reformer when he first became premier of the poor but
              resource-rich Asian nation in November 2007, said he wished he could
              have seen out his term.</p>
              <p>"I regret that I couldn't finish what I
              planned to do," he told lawmakers, according to images of the
              parliamentary session broadcast live on state television. "The
              government still has a lot of work to do."</p>
              <p>Of the 63 MPs present at the session, 57 of them, or 90.5 percent, voted to approve his resignation.</p>
              <p>Health
              Minister Sambuu Lambaa, cited by local media, said last month that
              Bayar was suffering from hepatitis C, which causes liver problems, and
              had sought treatment in South Korea.</p>
              <p>Bayar took office after
              assuming the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
              (MPRP), which ruled the country for decades as a one-party communist
              state until a peaceful move to multi-party politics in the 1990s.</p>
              <p>Lawmakers
              again voted to keep him in his post in September 2008, two months after
              riots erupted in the capital Ulan Bator over a disputed June
              parliamentary election victory by the MPRP. Five people were killed.</p>
              <p>The
              MPRP still controls the 76-seat parliament, but Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj
              of the opposition Democratic Party won the presidency in May, creating
              a virtual coalition government.</p>
              <p>The MPRP later Wednesday
              nominated current Foreign Minister Sukhbaatar Batbold to replace Bayar,
              state media reported. The nomination of Batbold, who was educated in
              Moscow and London, was to be submitted to lawmakers for a vote.</p>
              <p>First deputy prime minister Altanhuyag Norov will carry out Bayar's duties in the interim.</p>
              <p>Mongolia shook off communist rule in 1990 without a shot being fired, and the first democratic elections were held in 1992.</p>
              <p>The
              landlocked country, which is wedged between China and Russia, has
              struggled to develop a sustainable economy since turning to capitalism
              two decades ago.</p>
              <p>But its rich deposits of copper, gold, uranium, silver and oil have caught the eye of foreign investors.</p>
              <p>Three
              weeks ago, the government sealed a multi-billion-dollar deal with
              Canada's Ivanhoe Mines and Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto to develop
              one of the world's richest copper deposits, after years of negotiations.</p>
