              <p><strong>Medisave contribution rate to rise and ElderShield payouts to increase - Health Minister</strong></p>
              <p>The shape of an elderly financing framework to better serve the
              healthcare needs of Singapore's ageing population is now clearer. <br> <br> To ensure people save money for their later years, the Ministry of
              Health (MOH) will be increasing the Medisave contribution rate. <br> <br> And payouts for ElderShield - a severe disability insurance scheme for
              long-term care - at $400 per month for six years, could be increased to
              around $800 per month over eight years. <br> <br> In an exclusive interview via email with MediaCorp, Health Minister
              Khaw Boon Wan gave a picture of what is to come as his ministry
              prepares to introduce the 3E framework - Eldersave, ElderShield and
              Elderfund - expected to be fully developed and bedded down over the
              next 15 to 20 years. <br> <br> Said Mr Khaw: "A few pieces are already in place: Medifund Silver, ElderShield. But we need to do more." <br> <br> One in five Singaporeans are expected to be over the age of 65 by 2030.
              Currently, those 65 and above make up 8.8 per cent of the resident
              population. <br> <br> Given the rapidly ageing population, MOH is considering increasing the
              Medisave contribution rate to enable the national medical savings
              scheme to cover long-term care. <br> <br> Currently, Singaporeans and permanent residents contribute 6.5 to 9 per cent of their monthly salary to their Medisave. <br> <br> However, this "is only adequate for acute hospital care", said Mr Khaw,
              who earlier this year had flagged the possibility of either increasing
              the Medisave contribution rate or creating a new scheme altogether. <br> <br> In Feburary, he said preliminary analysis of other countries'
              experience, such as the United States and Japan, showed that they spend
              less than 3 per cent of their gross domestic product on long-term care. <br> <br> ElderShield will also be enhanced, hopefully satisfying those who have been calling for higher payouts. <br> <br> "ElderShield today is still very basic ... I would like to increase the
              payout, to say $800 per month for eight years," revealed Mr Khaw. <br> <br> "But this would mean having to increase the premiums," added the Health
              Minister. "If we cannot do it in one step, we may have to phase it in
              over time." <br> <br> The changes are "necessary" as most patients will desire a higher level
              of nursing home or home nursing care, he explained. It could cost $800
              to more than $4,000 a month to stay in a private nursing home. <br> <br> What will not change is ElderShield's "philosophy of insuring only
              catastrophic needs", he said. "This will ensure low premiums and
              minimise abuses." <br> <br> He noted that long-term care insurance in the West and Japan has been
              "severely abused" and "overwhelmed" because they cover all kinds of
              disability. <br> <br> "This we must consciously avoid." <br> <br> The third safety-net will be Medifund-Silver. The Government will
              continue to increase the endowment fund "as and when there are budget
              surpluses". <br> <br> All said, the pace of these changes will depend on the health of
              economy. "When the economy has recovered, we will be in a position to
              do some of these," said Mr Khaw. <br> <br> There are other systems to learn from, with Mr Khaw citing the well-integrated out-of-hospital care in Hong Kong. <br> <br> He had spent an afternoon learning about this system when he attended
              the World Health Organization's Regional Meeting last week. "I will
              blog about it one day," he added.</p>
