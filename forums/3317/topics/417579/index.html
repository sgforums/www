              <p>Tell me how exactly does the US have a kill switch? the internet cannot be broken down, unless you actually do something to the land lines.</p>
              <p>and even at best, all they can do is to disconnect all of the US lines, resulting in their own isolation, while the rest of the world stays connected.</p>
              <p>the internet is essentially a giant intranet, and since a huge number of computers and servers lies outside US, the US has no control over the net.</p>
              <p>even China, wellknown for its Great Firewall, isn't able to control its own internet 100%.</p>
