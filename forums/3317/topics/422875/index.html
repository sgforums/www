              <p>A MARRIED couple are suing their younger son over a terrace house in Joo Chiat.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang Kim Sai and Madam Ang Gim Yen, both 86, said they are the 
              actual owners and that their son, Mr Ang Kok Beng, 57, is holding the 
              property in trust for them. But the son contended that it was given to 
              him when it was transferred to his name in 1983.</p>
              <p>The double-storey house in Langsat Road was bought for about $100,000 in 1974 and valued at $2.5 million in 2009.</p>
              <p>The 10-day hearing opened in the High Court on Monday.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang Kim Sai, a former Chinese physician, and his wife, a 
              former teacher, have four children, one of whom has died. The elder Mr 
              Ang also has a child with his mistress.</p>
              <p>At the time, the couple's understanding of the Housing Board
               policy was that they were prohibited from being registered as legal 
              owners of the house because they already owned an HDB flat.</p>

              <p>AN ELDERLY couple who are suing their younger son over a terrace 
              house in Joo Chiat arrived in court in wheelchairs yesterday, the second
               day of the hearing into the case.</p>
              <p>But only Madam Ang Gim Yen, 86, testified, and she appeared to have trouble recalling matters relating to the house.</p>
              <p>The case was adjourned with both parties going into settlement talks.</p>
              <p>Madam Ang and her husband, Mr Ang Kim Sai, also 86, are 
              suing their son Ang Kok Beng over the owner-ship of the two-storey house
               in Langsat Road.</p>
              <p>The 57-year-old, a subcontractor, is the youngest of the 
              couple's three surviving children. The elder Mr Ang also has a daughter 
              from another relationship.</p>
              <p>The house, bought in 1974 for about $100,000, was valued at $2.5 million in 2009.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Son and parents settle dispute over house</h1>
              <p>THE son said he was not angry that his parents had sued him over the ownership of a terrace house in Langsat Road in Joo Chiat.</p>
              <p>But speaking to reporters after both sides had reached an 
              out-of-court settlement yesterday, the parents - Mr Ang Kim Sai and 
              Madam Ang Gim Yen, both 86 - said they were disappointed with their 
              younger son Ang Kok Beng, 57.</p>
              <p>The terms of the settlement are confidential.</p>
              <p>The parents had bought the double- storey corner house in 
              1974 for about $100,000. Their older son and daughter were initially 
              registered as the owners because Housing Board regulations prohibited 
              the couple, who already had a flat, from owning the property.</p>
              <p>In 1983, the ownership of the house was transferred to their younger son, who is a sub-contractor.</p>
              <p>In their suit, the couple contended that they are the owners
               and that he was holding the house - valued at $2.5 million in 2009 - in
               trust for them. But the younger Mr Ang said it was a gift.</p>
