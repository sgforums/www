              <p><strong>PKMS rival factions clash violently over power transition dispute</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Violence broke out on Thursday between rival factions
              of one of Singapore's opposition parties - the Singapore Malay National
              Organisation or PKMS.
              <br> <br> PKMS is short for Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura.
              <br> <br>Five people were injured and admitted to hospital. Four have since
              been discharged, while one member is in intensive care. Twenty-one
              people were arrested for rioting.
              <br> <br>The fighting took place outside the PKMS headquarters in Eunos
              between two camps - the outgoing and incoming office bearers - who are
              feuding over power transition. <br> <br> The old guard accused a leader of the new committee of inciting
              violence by sending an SMS to its supporters to take over the party by
              force. The message had called the outgoing leaders "traitors" who
              allegedly used up party funds. <br> <br> Osman Hassan, PKMS president (2006-2009), said: "They came and so I
              asked my members to straight away call the police. But I'm surprised
              that by the time they arrived, the police were already here. So the
              fight broke out in front of the police."
              <br> <br>But the new guard said they were merely trying to change the lock
              to the building to prevent illegal immigrants from entering. They
              claimed the outgoing committee, headed by Osman, would not allow them
              to do so and attacked them.
              <br> <br>Nor Lella Mohamed, PKMS deputy president (2008-2010), said: "There
              are two legal office bearers here. We are fully aware that their term
              has expired on 2 September. Some of their Supreme Council members told
              us that they are not having any AGM, (which) they are supposed to (do
              so). So if they are not having it, we take it as their term has already
              expired. After we had a meeting with our own Supreme Council, they
              decided that we should go to PKMS and sort this thing out."
              <br> <br>Channel NewsAsia spoke to the family of the victim admitted to the
              intensive care unit in hospital. There was clearly some tension when
              the reporter mentioned Osman, suggesting there was quite a deep divide
              between the two sides. <br> <br> Family members said the victim, Ramlan, was conscious when they met him but both his eyes were swollen shut.
              <br> <br> This is not the first time violence has broken out between the two rival factions. 
              <br> <br> The new guard had claimed some of its members who had served on the
              previous committee were unlawfully terminated from their leadership
              positions. <br> <br> Both sides had also accused each other of misappropriating party funds and violating their party's constitution.

              <p>Police have brought in 21 people for questioning in relation to a
              fight that broke out today among members of the political party PKMS.</p>
              <p>At least three people were injured and were sent to the Changi General Hospital.</p>
              <p>One of them, Ramlan Mohamad, is now in the Intensive Care Unit.</p>
              <p>He suffered a fractured skull but is conscious.</p>
              <p>The fight broke out just after noon outside the party's headquarters at Changi Road.</p>
              <p>According to Mr Ramlan's twin brother, Ramli Mohamad, the two of
              them, along with five other members were there to physically take over
              the party's offices.</p>
              <p>Mr Ramli says they're part of the new Supreme council voted in, last November at an extraordinary general meeting.</p>
              <p>But the old guards never acknowledged them and refused to step down.</p>
              <p>Mr Ramli said while at the headquarters today, they tried to change the lock to the backdoor of the building.</p>
              <p>In: We need to...<br> Out: ...they put tent.<br> Dur: 22 secs<br> Title: 03/09 PKMS lock SOT</p>
              <p>We need to lock the back door because we found one of the Indonesia
              female, we ever came by, we saw they're illegal immigrants, they run
              when we ask for their permit and we want to call the Police. We also
              saw 3 Bangledeshis. I also call URA regarding they misuse the top
              level, level 5, they use for cooking, they put tent.</p>
              <p>While changing the lock, Mr Ramli said, they had dropped their tools including screwdrivers and hammers.</p>
              <p>About 15 members of the old guards then used the tools to attack Mr Ramli and his colleagues, a few of them on the head.</p>
              <p>But current party President Osman Hassan said it was Mr Ramli and his colleagues who attacked the old guards with the tools.</p>
              <p>Mr Osman maintains that he and his team are the rightful leaders of the party.</p>
              <p>The other two people injured and now warded in hospital are<br> Mohamed Salleh bin Mohamed Said, an Assistant to the Supreme Council, and,</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamad Yusof bin Jaffar, a council member.</p>

              <p><strong>Old guard, new team from PKMS insist they are rightful office bearers</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The rival factions of opposition party Singapore Malay
              National Organisation (PKMS) have insisted they are the rightful office
              bearers of PKMS, one day after party members fought outside the PKMS
              headquarters to take over the premises. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Osman Hassan, the current PKMS president, met the media with the old
              council at the PKMS building in Eunos on Friday evening. The party said
              it regretted the violence that broke out on Thursday. </span></p>
              <p><span> Meanwhile the other faction, led by Borhan Ariffin who was elected
              president in an extraordinary general meeting last November, said they
              will let the police investigate the matter before deciding what to do
              next. </span></p>
              <p><span> One member from the new team is still in intensive care at the Changi General Hospital. </span></p>
              <p><span> "He's still not responding very clearly... He tends to jerk in his
              sleep and yesterday during the bandage there was bleeding... and during
              the eye check-up just now, the doctor mentioned the possibility of
              another fracture on the left side (of his face)," said Nor Lella
              Mohamed, PKMS deputy president (2008-2010). </span></p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">PKMS infighting will hurt party's image</span></strong></p>
              <p>The ongoing leadership tussle within the Singapore Malay National
              Organisation or PKMS which escalated into a violent brawl on Thursday
              is another blow to the opposition political party.</p>
              <p>The rival factions admit this will hurt the image and credibility of the party in the eyes of the community.</p>
              <p><em>Saifulbahri Ismail</em> reports :</p>
              <p>Infighting within a political party is nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
              <p>Disputes arise when members don't see eye to eye.</p>
              <p>But when it spills violently onto the streets in public, and people get hurt, such conflicts start to raise eyebrows.</p>
              <p>Since 2006, PKMS has been split into two groups which have been at loggerheads with each other.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, they were involved in a bust-up outside their headquarters.</p>
              <p>Four men were taken to hospital, with one warded in intensive care with a fractured skull.</p>
              <p>Even before this, heated exchanges have occurred during their
              meetings -- to the point where insults were hurled and objects thrown.</p>
              <p>Current Secretary General of PKMS Malik Ismail maintained that it's not a violent party :</p>
              <p>"The impression of the community towards PKMS as in the past has
              been very bad. We try our level best to improve our image, to improve
              our community interaction in order to ensure that we are part of
              Singapore. We want to contribute as an organisation."</p>
              <p>PKMS is an opposition party that was established to look after the interests of the Malays in Singapore.</p>
              <p>However, its objectives have been blurred over the years.</p>
              <p>Ramli Mohamad, is the Secretary General of the group who's challenging the current leadership :</p>
              <p>"The image of the party of PKMS now is totally out of our objectives
              - to put our people back to politics. About 80s PKMS become worse and
              worse and now become not even worse become totally rubbish."</p>
              <p>PKMS is a constituent member of the Singapore Democratic Alliance
              set up to form a common opposition front against the ruling People's
              Action Party.</p>
              <p>According to political analyst Yang Razali Kassim, PKMS's contiunous
              internal conflicts could also have a negative effect on othe opposition
              parties in Singapore :</p>
              <p>"In the eyes of the public in Singapore, sometimes its not easy to
              separate the state of one opposition party with the state of opposition
              in general. Because of have a situation where political parties in the
              opposition tend to one to group together to face the ruling party. The
              adverse effect of coming together is that the fate of one party can
              have contagious effect on the other party in the alliance of coalition
              in the opposition."</p>
              <p>It's unclear if the rival factions within the PKMS will be able to
              reach an agreement and reconcile their differences anytime soon.</p>
              <p>The current team led by President Osman Hassan occupies a four-storey PKMS building at Changi Road.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle"> SDA: We don't get involved in PKMS' internal affairs </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Singapore Democratic Alliance will not interfere in the current
              controversy involving one of its member parties, the Singapore Malay
              National Organisation or PKMS</p>
              <p>One of SDA's founding members, Sin Kek Tong told 938LIVE that it doesn't get involved in other parties' internal affairs.<br> <br> "Even though SDA is a political party grouping in Singapore, we never
              get involved in each individual party's internal affairs at all. We
              will leave this internal affair for them to resolve by themselves
              altogether. This has been the practice all the while."</p>
              <p>Mr Sin, who's also the Chairman of the Singapore People's Party, is
              aware that the brawl which took place at the PKMS building on Thursday
              will affect public's perception of the Alliance.</p>
              <p>But he stresses that there is not much that SDA can do.<br> <br> "We do know they have some internal party power struggle which is a
              norm in any organisation. We just hope that the next time we meet up
              with them we will caution them again and say, 'Things like these should
              not happen at all'. "</p>
              <p>Mr Sin also says that SDA recognises Osman Hassan as the President of PKMS and Malik Ismail as its Secretary General.</p>
              <p>However, the leadership of PKMS is disputed by a group within the party led by former president Borhan Ariffin.</p>
              <p>Mr Borhan's team claimed that the leadership of Mr Osman had expired
              on 2nd September following the result of an Extraordinary General
              Meeting held on 30th November last year.</p>
              <p>But the current leadership doesn't recognise the result of the meeting.</p>
              <p>The move by Mr Borhan's team to take over the office led to the scuffle at Changi Road on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Twenty-one people were arrested in the brawl and all have been released on bail.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Why PKMS "new guard" didn't appeal </span></strong></p>
              <p>A court appeal would have been redundant and a waste of money.</p>
              <p>That's the reason given by a breakaway group that has been trying to
              gain control of the Singapore Malay National Organisation or PKMS for
              not making the appeal.</p>
              <p>This after the Supreme Court dismissed the group's summons in July,
              which questioned the validity of the position of the current president,
              Osman Hassan in the party.</p>
              <p>His leadership is disputed by the breakaway group within PKMS, led by former president Borhan Ariffin.</p>
              <p>The group's Secretary General is Ramli Mohamed.<br> <br> "Our lawyer advised us that it is no use to appeal. That's because the
              "old guards" will have to vacate their positions on 2nd September as
              their leadership terms would have ended by then. They were elected on
              2nd September 2007 and leaders are elected once every two years. We'd
              rather wait for a few months than spend $10,000 to appeal against the
              dismissal. So we decided to wait until the 3rd of September before
              claiming what is rightfully ours. If we can wait for two years, what's
              another two months?"</p>
              <p>Mr Ramli was indignant when 938LIVE informed him that the Singapore
              Democratic Alliance recognises Mr Osman as the president of PKMS and
              not Mr Borhan.</p>
              <p><br> "SDA can choose whoever it likes - it's their right. But the truth will
              surface soon. SDA should study the situation closely before making such
              a decision."</p>
              <p>Mr Ramli said, he would like to meet SDA members so that they could hear both sides of the story.</p>
              <p>However, SDA stressed it doesn't interfere in other parties' internal affairs.</p>
              <p>Mr Ramli's group went down to the PKMS building at Changi Road on Thursday to change its locks.</p>
              <p>But it was confronted by the incumbent group and a fight broke out.</p>
              <p>This resulted in the arrest of 21 people - all of whom were later released on bail.</p>

              <p><strong>No signs of resolution for PKMS dispute</strong></p>
              <p>The current dispute between the two rival factions of the Singapore
              Malay National Organisation or PKMS is showing no signs of resolution.</p>
              <p>The parties are now accusing each other of poor leadership skills,
              leading to possible failure in fulfilling one of the party's main
              obligations - to look after the interests of the Malays in Singapore.</p>
              <p>A bust-up took place near the PKMS headquarters off Changi Road last
              week after a breakaway group tried to regain control of the building by
              changing its locks.</p>
              <p>This resulted in a fight and four people were injured, with one ending up with a fractured skull.</p>
              <p>Police arrested 21 people who were allegedly involved in the brawl.</p>
              <p>PKMS' former President, Borhan Ariffin heads the group that's challenging the current leadership.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters at a dialogue at the Speakers' Corner, he
              claimed that the party's incumbent President, Osman Hassan hasn't done
              anything to help the Malay community.</p>
              <p>"When I was the President between 2000 and 2006, we organised a lot
              of activities to help the Malays in Singapore. You heard about a move
              in the past to push for a Malay President of Singapore? Whose idea was
              it? Mine! We also helped the community in Riau in areas such as
              education and IT. Mr Osman has done nothing for the community!"</p>
              <p>If his group were to regain control of the PKMS, Mr Borhan said, one
              of the first things that he'd do is to roll out initiatives to
              strengthen ties within the Malay community.</p>
              <p>His deputy, Nor Lella Mardiiiah Mohamed said, the group will also
              make use of the PKMS headquarters to organise activities such as
              tuition classes to students.</p>
              <p>"We are looking at the opportunities that PKMS can go further in
              helping the Malays. If they have any problems like family matters,
              education matters, tuition matters, feel free to come to us. The
              building is at a strategic location. There's a lot of room for
              improvement. But even though we do not get access to the building, we
              will still continue with our activities."</p>
              <p>Ms Nor Lella Mardiiiah however stressed that the breakaway group cannot provide financial help as it has no means of income.</p>
              <p>This, unlike its rival that collects rent from the tenants in the PKMS building.</p>
              <p>In response to the accusations made by the breakaway group, Mr Osman had this to say:</p>
              <p>"Actually, we have organised a lot of activities. Several cultural
              events like Hari Raya gatherings. We also celebrate religious festivals
              together."</p>
              <p>Apart from this, Mr Osman declined to reveal any more details about the organisation's future activities.</p>
