              <p>Trips to the bathroom turned into a nightmare for a STOMPer’s
              wife, who claims that a male staff from a massage store started
              harassing her a week ago, calling out to her and even tugging at her
              hair.<br><br>The first incident happened when the man offered the woman a massage for free if she went to his house.<br><br>Although
              she started to avoid him from then on, he still managed to traumatise
              her by mimicking the way she walked and even tugged at her hair from
              behind.<br><br>The infuriated STOMPer says in an email:<br><br>“Around
              a week ago, my wife was verbally harassed in a sexual manner by a staff
              working in a 10-dollar massage shop at Jurong Point, where she works.<br><br>“The male staff was outside the shop handing out pamphlets and when my wife walked past, he said: ‘Free massage!’.<br><br>“Because she did not see any promotions going on, she asked: ‘Huh? Free massage?’<br><br>“The staff told her sheepishly: ‘At my house’. She ignored him and walked away.<br><br>“Ever
              since that occasion, she would take a different route to get to the
              restroom whenever she saw that male staff standing outside the shop.<br><br>“Today
              (February 2), when she walked past the shop in the afternoon, the guy
              saw her and started to mock her by imitating the way she walked.<br><br>“Again
              at 8pm, she was walking back from the restroom when the male staff
              tugged at her hair from behind! She got a rude shock and scolded him
              but he just walked back to the shop without saying anything.<br><br>“When I arrived at 8:40pm, the supervisor informed me about what happened and I went over to confront the man immediately.<br><br>“He got a shock when I questioned him about what happened and he admitted to the things he did.<br><br>“He denied touching my wife at first but when I questioned him loudly he said: ‘Yes, but I just brushed her hair’.<br><br>"The store manager, Mr. A, stepped in and asked me what happened and watched me question his staff.<br><br>“He told me he would not side with his staff and asked me how I wanted to resolve it.<br><br>“He called the police and they came in approximately 10 minutes.<br><br>“After
              taking our statements, they advised me to file a magistrate’s complaint
              at the subordinate court. They couldn’t apprehend the male staff as he
              only admitted to touching her hair and not her body.<br><br>“After the
              police left, I approached Mr. A and asked him what is his take on this
              (he told the police he will give me an answer to this issue) and what
              are his actions?<br><br>“He said he would terminate his staff immediately.<br><br>“I said terminating a staff is as easy as ABC, what are the compensation or responsibilities he should bear?<br><br>“The male staff committed three offences:<br><br>“1: Soliciting female customers with ill intentions (verbal harassment)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2: Imitating her in the form of mockery (mental harassment)</p>
              <p>3: Tug her hair (physical harassment)<br><br>“After all this, he still HAD NOT MENTIONED A WORD OF SORRY TO MY WIFE!<br><br>“Since all this happened when the store was under his care, shouldn’t he offer some compensation?<br><br>“He
              replied that he had no control over his staff. He taught them what to
              say and how to behave but if they go astray, it’s their own private
              problem and I should deal with them personally.<br><br>“So can I say
              that he’s trying to shift responsibilities just by firing his staff on
              the spot, reliving him of all consequences caused by what his staff did?<br><br>“Future patrons of this massage shop better think twice about such irresponsible mentality of the people-in-charge.<br><br>“They have six outlets in SG, Novena; Dhoby Ghaut; AMK; Changi T2; Tanjong Pagar and of course,  Jurong Pt.<br><br>“The male staff is around 40 to 50-year-old Malaysian who holds Singapore PR.<br><br>“Do we need such ‘foreign talent’ around? To prey on would be victims, tormenting them mentally, verbally and physically!<br><br>“Such people have to be stopped before things go out of hand. I leave all readers to judge for themselves!"</p>
