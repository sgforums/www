              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said it is
              important for Singapore to understand the changes taking place in
              Japan. <br> <br> Mr Lee said this in a written interview with the Japanese media, ahead of his four-day visit to Japan starting on Monday.
              <br> <br> He is the first head of government to visit the country since Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama took office last month. 
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said he is looking forward to fruitful and substantive discussions with Prime Minister Hatoyama.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said he also wants to hear more about Mr Hatoyama's thoughts on a proposed East Asia Community.
              <br> <br> However Mr Lee said it is important to maintain the strong economic and
              security ties between Asia and the US across the Pacific.

              <p><strong>PM Lee the first Asian leader to visit the new Japanese government</strong></p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has become the first Asian leader to visit the new Japanese government. <br> <br> PM Lee met with his Japanese counterpart Yukio Hatoyama in Tokyo today. <br> <br> During their two hour discussion, Japanese Prime Minister Yukio
              Hatoyama briefed Mr Lee on his recent trip to the G20 Summit in
              Pittsburgh. <br> <br> They discussed how the momentum of that summit could be carried forward to APEC which Singapore will host in November. <br> <br> PM Lee explains. <br> <br> "We agreed that this was a long term development, the trend, because
              the links between the asian countries is strengthening. But of course
              asia has to remember that it is part of a global system. Therefore,
              regional cooperation in asia is always in the form of an open
              regionalism, that means to maintain our links with the rest of the
              world and not to close in on ourselves." <br> <br> Mr Lee said Mr Hatoyama agreed with his proposal. <br> <br> The Singapore leader also met Japanese politicians he's well acquainted with. <br> <br> He had tea with Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife and also
              met the newly elected president of the LDP, Mr Sadakazu Tanigaki.<br> <br> Mr Lee again. <br> <br> "Japan plays an important role in Asia. Whichever government in Japan
              the strategic relationships in Asia will not change. I think Japan's
              interest will not change that much. Of course, there's updating of
              their perspectives, but there's also continuity in terms of interests
              and we hope in terms of policies." <br> <br> Mr Lee will be meeting more politicians as well as business leaders tomorrow.</p>
