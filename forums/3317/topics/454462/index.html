              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government has dismissed allegations in
               the Malaysian media and some online reports that it is interfering in 
              the country's domestic politics.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry said such allegations are "baseless".</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This follows allegations that Singapore officials were involved in the recent Bersih 3.0 protests.<br><br>There
               were also reports that some youths were being trained in Singapore as 
              polling and counting agents for the upcoming Malaysian general election.<br><br>In a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said its officers were present at the Bersih 3.0 rally as impartial observers.  <br><br>The spokesperson added that's "part of their normal professional diplomatic duties."<br><br>He said the officers also did not wear yellow to avoid being mistaken as rally participants.  <br><br>They avoided Merdeka Square, which had been declared out of bounds by the Malaysian authorities.<br><br>The
               ministry said what its officers did were "legitimate duties of 
              diplomats to observe political developments in their countries of 
              posting".  <br><br>It explained that a diplomatic officer "is expected 
              to be updated on the host country developments and to understand 
              situations and sentiments on the ground".  <br><br>There is also a consular angle.  <br><br>The ministry said the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur received several queries from Singaporeans asking for advice.  <br><br>And having a first hand sense of the situation helped the High Commission offer effective consular advice and assistance.<br><br>"I
               reiterate that these are normal functions for a diplomat. Indeed, other
               foreign diplomats in KL were also observing the rally. Given this, it 
              is odd that some quarters of the Malaysian media seem to be singling out
               Singapore," said the ministry spokesperson.   <br><br>The ministry also rejected an allegation that Singapore contravened the Vienna Convention.<br><br>The
               spokesperson added: "This is utterly untrue. 'Article 41(1) of the 
              Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 reads: "Without prejudice
               to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons 
              enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and 
              regulations of the receiving State. They also have a duty not to 
              interfere in the internal affairs of that State'.<br><br>"I repeat that 
              our officers were not interfering in Malaysian domestic affairs. They 
              were observing. They were careful to follow all domestic laws and 
              regulations. Let me say clearly that the Singapore Government is 
              impartial and does not interfere in any country's domestic politics. 
              Likewise, we expect that others will not interfere in our domestic 
              politics."<br><br>Separately, the Bersih group has clarified (on its 
              Faceboook page) that the training of Polling and Counting agents in 
              Singapore was an event "organised by Malaysians for Malaysians only".<br><br>Singapore authorities are checking on these claims.<br><br>The ministry spokesperson said foreigners are not allowed to engage in political activity in Singapore.  <br><br>Singapore had also rejected Bersih 3.0's application to hold a simultaneous rally here.   <br><br>"Again,
               we have no interest in interfering in anybody's domestic politics. We 
              rejected Bersih 3.0's application to hold a simultaneous rally in 
              Singapore. Why would we do that if we wanted to meddle?" said the 
              spokesperson. <br><br>It said Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman had
               asked to meet Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia, Ong Keng Yong,
               on Friday afternoon. It added that High Commissioner Ong will also 
              clarify Singapore's position and address "these baseless allegations to 
              prevent misunderstandings".<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA: Supporters of the Malay rights group, 
              Perkasa, have staged a protest outside the Singapore High Commission in 
              Kuala Lumpur.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They insisted that 
              Singapore diplomatic staff had participated in the recent Bersih 3.0 
              rally in support of electoral reform on April 28.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They called for an official apology and for three Singapore officials to be recalled immediately.<br><br>Nearly 300 people took part in the half-hour demonstration led by Perkasa's president, Ibrahim Ali.<br><br>Singapore's
               Foreign Affairs Ministry (MFA) had said on 22 June that allegations 
              about its officers interfering in Malaysia's politics are "baseless".<br><br>The MFA said its officers were at the Bersih 3.0 rally as impartial observers.<br><br>It
               added that as part of their normal professional diplomatic duties, 
              officers are expected to be updated on the host country's developments 
              and to understand sentiments on the ground.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
