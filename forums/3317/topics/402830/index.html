              <p><span> MELBOURNE: Victims of Australia's deadly 2009 firestorm have launched 
              legal action against a Singapore power firm alleging poorly-maintained 
              electrical wires sparked the blaze, reports said Saturday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Lawyers representing almost 600 people lodged a class action in 
              Victoria's Supreme Court against Singapore Power for allegedly failing 
              to maintain an ageing line, which fell and started the February 7 fire 
              at Kilmore East.
              <br> <br> It was the deadliest blaze of "Black Saturday", Australia's worst 
              natural disaster, claiming 119 of the 173 lives lost. Legal firm Maurice
               Blackburn said the suit could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
                
              <br> <br> "We have heard strong evidence at the Royal Commission (into the fires) 
              that Singapore Power could have taken a number of steps to prevent the 
              devastating Kilmore East-Kinglake bushfire," firm chairman Bernard 
              Murphy told The Age newspaper.
              <br> <br> "Electricity distribution companies are commercial enterprises that have
               a responsibility to ensure that public safety is not compromised simply
               in order to keep costs down. Singapore Power's failures have had very 
              tragic consequences."
              <br> <br> The action currently has 598 plaintiffs but could grow to as many as 
              1,300, including people who lost family members in the fire, suffered 
              physical injuries and lost property, or had ongoing psychological 
              damage, The Age said.
              <br> <br> It will allege Singapore Power failed to fit a 10 dollar (8.70 US) 
              anti-vibration device to guard against metal fatigue and that the 
              circuit-breaker system was not adequate for a dry, windy, fire-prone 
              area.
              <br> <br> The 1.1-kilometre (0.7-mile) single-strand line, one of the longest in 
              Victoria, was only checked every five years and rust and wire 
              deterioration could not be detected by ground crews, the case will also 
              claim.
              <br> <br> Unusually for an Australian civil case, Maurice Blackburn has asked that
               it be decided by a jury instead of a judge.
              <br> <br> The Black Saturday fires rushed into small communities with little 
              warning, killing 173 residents as they sheltered in their homes, or fled
               in cars. Entire towns were razed, reducing more than 2,000 homes to 
              ash. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Power says it's not a defendant in lawsuit over Australian 
              bushfire</strong></p>
              <p><span>Singapore Power has clarified that it is not the defendant in a 
              lawsuit relating to the 2009 Kilmore East-Kinglake bushfire in 
              Australia. </span></p>
              <p><span>In a statement released on Saturday, SP AusNet, which is 51% owned
               by Singapore Power, said the defendant in the bushfire proceedings is 
              SPI Electricity Pty Ltd, its electricity distribution operating company.
              <br> <br> SP AusNet added that while court proceedings are in progress, it would 
              be inappropriate for it to discuss the matter.
              <br> <br> The Kilmore East-Kinglake bushfire was one of the bushfires which 
              affected the
              <br> Australian state of Victoria in February 2009. 
              <br> <br> Victims of deadly firestorm have launched legal action against SPI 
              Electricity, alleging poorly-maintained electrical wires sparked the 
              blaze, reports said.
              <br> <br> Lawyers representing almost 600 people lodged a class action in 
              Victoria's Supreme Court against SPI Electricity for allegedly failing 
              to maintain an ageing line, which fell and started the February 7 fire 
              at Kilmore East.
              <br> <br> It was the deadliest blaze of "Black Saturday", Australia's worst 
              natural disaster, claiming 119 of the 173 lives lost. 
              <br> <br> Legal firm Maurice Blackburn said the suit could be worth hundreds of 
              millions of dollars. </span></p>
