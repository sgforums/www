              <p><strong>Singapore holds anti-terror drill; simulates Mumbai attack</strong></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE, July 5 - Singapore will hold its biggest
              anti-terror drill on Monday, simulating the deadly Mumbai attacks that
              killed 166 people last year, ahead of hosting an Asia-Pacific summit in
              November. Exercise North Star VII will involve 2,000 participants from
              15 state agencies and media outlets and simulate situations such as
              concerted terror attacks on hotels, malls and an underground train
              station, the Singapore Police Force said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The exercise, based on November's Mumbai attacks, consists of 10
              incidents, from the hijack of a taxi cab in a raid on a hotel to a
              rampage at a train station, according to plans seen by Reuters.</p>
              <p>Singapore,
              home to regional offices of global firms, the world's busiest sea port
              and a top regional airport hub, has been safe from a militant sabotage
              so far, after it foiled a plot to hijack a plane and crash it into the
              Changi airport in 2002.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat Kastari, the alleged
              mastermind of the foiled plot and suspected leader of a Singapore
              radical Islamist group linked to the 2002 Bali bombings, was arrested
              in Malaysia in April after he escaped from a Singapore jail in February
              2008.</p>
              <p>The island-state will host an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November.</p>
              <p>The
              Singapore Police said the anti-terror drill was not related to the
              security preparation for the summit, which will host leaders of
              economic heavy-hitters as the United States, Japan, China and Russia.</p>
              <p>The
              exercise will be in two phases -- July 6-7 and July 15, in which Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong will preside over the finale at the resort
              island of Sentosa, the police said.</p>

              <p>aiyah......all planned. Whats to show? Even movie stars have performed so combat routines. It its all choreographed then it does not show the true capabilities of our 'force'. We need to see our forces in situations where all is not planned; where they have to really plan on the ground.</p>
              <p>As usual, its all wayang.</p>

              <p>I disagree.</p>
              <p>Plenty of things to learn from up and down the command chain. It gives the people a certain level of know how to handle the different situations.</p>
              <p>You should be glad that its planned. It shows the know how.</p>
              <p>Northstar has been based on several events that happened and could happen.</p>
              <p>It isnt just arrive on scene and bang bang bang.</p>

              <p>Cmon...you seriously believe they have this 'wayang' exercise to learn from it? It is to put on a show. If they really wanna learn something about hanlding different situations, then have 2 units engage in a simulated war game without any knowledge of what the other is gonna do. What can we learn from a staged exercise when we plan everything from start to finish?</p>
              <p>How does planned event shows our know all? Kindly do explain that logic to me.</p>
              <p>It is precisely 'arriving on scene, bang bang and thank you very much'. Like i said, its just like an action movie with all choreographed action scenes, where all errors and mistakes are ironed out before the big show.</p>
              <p>It's like playing a game with cheats where you can see what know where your enemies are, what capabilities they have, what they will do etc.</p>

              <p>These are chances to allow the various agencies to iron out and perfect their plans. You misunderstood me. I am not talking about their capabilities of taking down terrorists, those are the individual units/ agencies responsibilities which include rescue operations, firefighting, chem, bio and various other threats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The main purpose for the northstar exercises are to perfect the coordination of the various Home Team agencies. And to learn from the experiences of other agencies that handled pervious events such as the london, madrid and mumbai attacks.</p>

              <p>There are things to learn from everything; that much i agree. I agree we do need to conduct exercises to learn and understand our capabilities. But if this exercise is done to learn from it, i very much doubt so. It is just a big show for the Asian Summit or whatever event we'll be having. And whos paying for this big show? We know it'll eventually end up being the commoners who will pay. Roads will be closed and business affected jsut so that we can put on a big show to the foreigners and foreign media.</p>

              <p><strong>Ex Northstar VII tests agency response during simultaneous terror attacks</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Could Singapore cope if terrorists launched a series of coordinated assaults on the island?
              <br> <br> That's the question posed in this year's Exercise Northstar, an annual
              event to test the emergency response capabilities of the different
              agencies.
              <br> <br>This year's exercise - Northstar VII - simulated the attacks on
              India's Mumbai city last November, with terrorists launching
              simultaneous assaults on key public areas.
              <br> <br>There are two phases in Exercise Northstar VII. Phase one started
              on Monday and will continue on Tuesday with scenarios involving public
              transport and shopping malls.
              <br> <br> Phase 2, which takes place next week, will simulate a hostage situation at a hotel.
              <br> <br>Fifteen public and private sector organisations are taking part in
              the exercise this year, including the Defence Ministry, Singapore Civil
              Defence Force, Maritime and Port Authority, and public transport
              providers.
              <br> <br>On Monday, the simulated scenario started on Sentosa island, with
              police receiving reports of "gunfire" at a popular bar there. They
              arrived at the Cafe del Mar within minutes but by then it was a scene
              of ruins.
              <br> <br>10 people were "dead" and 20 more "injured". It was later
              established that the "attackers" had come in by the sea on small boats,
              and they were not alone. Other "gunmen" had quickly made their way to
              hotels in the busy Orchard Road shopping belt, leaving behind a trail
              of carnage.
              <br> <br>For the first time the media was involved as participants, to test
              how the police would manage and coordinate the dissemination of
              information in a crisis situation.
              <br> <br>Singapore Police Force's assistant director of operations planning,
              Devrajan Bala, said: "Drawing lessons from Mumbai, we realised that
              information management is critical as it can compromise our operations
              if not managed well.
              <br> <br>"We also want the media to understand our constraints as we run
              into an incident like this. We may not be able to give you updates in a
              very timely manner. Essentially, we're still running the operations so
              it's critical that you understand operations as they run on the
              ground."

              <p>The Cafe Del Mar beachfront club at Sentosa was a scene of carnage after terrorists swarmed it at dawn today.</p>
              <p>Fortunately it's not for real but a scene played out as 15 different
              agencies take part in Singapore's largest ever emergency simulation
              exercise.</p>
              <p>Exercise Northstar VII - led by the Singapore Police Force, aims to
              simulate a major terrorist assault at various locations across the
              island.</p>
              <p>It is similar to the coordinated attacks in Mumbai last year.</p>
              <p>For the first time, members of the media were roped in to become role players in Exercise Northstar.</p>
              <p>In the scenario, some were supposed to act as demanding journalists
              all trying their best to obtain as much information as possible about
              the so-called attack.</p>
              <p>Role-playing photographers tried to sneak past the police cordon to capture the best shots.</p>
              <p>At times, the simulation appeared too realistic when some members of
              the media were physically barred from venturing any closer to Cafe Del
              Mar.</p>
              <p>Superintendent Devrajan Bala is the Assistant Director of Operations Planning from the Singapore Police Force.</p>
              <p>"In a large scale exercise like this, it is important to bring the
              media on board, so they'll understand our processes and it's also
              important because the media will be the one who will bring out
              information to the public. We also want the media to understand our
              constraints. We may not be able to give them updates in a timely
              manner. Bringing them on board the exercise will give them the
              opportunity to see how we operate. So in a real incident, we could work
              very closely together."</p>
              <p>He said drawing lessons from Mumbai, information management is
              critical as it can compromise security operations if not managed well.</p>
              <p>During the Mumbai seige, some journalists revealed sensitive information to the public.</p>
              <p>Soon after this, India strongly discouraged the media from broadcasting footage that could reveal security operations.</p>
              <p>It also disallowed live contact with hostages during future rescue missions.</p>
              <p>Exercise Northstar VII will be held in places such as Sentosa, Orchard Road, Vivocity and Raffles Place.</p>
              <p>Two thousand exercise participants and 350 role players are taking part in it.<br> <br> During today's exercise, holiday makers near Cafe Del Mar appeared calm
              and collected even though Singapore's security forces were spotted in
              full gear, metres away from them.</p>
              <p>That's because Sentosa Development Corporation has informed them some five days in advance about Exercise Northstar VII.</p>
              <p>The company's Deputy Director of Communications, Suzanne Ho.</p>
              <p>"In preparation for this exercise, we kept out stakeholders informed
              such as the hotels, various attractions, our residents at Sentosa Cove
              as well as our golf club members. In any situation, our rangers or
              island security will work closely with the state agencies to manage a
              crisis. We will continue to provide updates to our island partners in
              order to ensure that the information flow is kept going."</p>
              <p>Ms Ho pointed out that the Corporation reached out to more than 1000
              guests in the island's six hotels as well as the some 2300 residents of
              Sentosa Cove.</p>
              <p>The first phase of the Exercise Northstar VII will be held over two days, starting today.</p>
              <p>Phase 2 will be held on Wednesday next week.</p>

              <p>To win the World Cup, Brazil also practice and practice. That's why they win and almost everyone knows that Brazilian soccer is the best. In the same way huh, it is good la that Sg government and all agencies are preparing and practising during the exercise northstar so that they will be ready to defend Singapore and protect Singapore when such a day comes. </p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Exercise Northstar VII : Day 2 - at Raffles Place MRT station</span></strong></p>
              <p>The sound of gun fire rang out at Raffles Place MRT station early this morning.</p>
              <p>This simulated attack by terrorists is part of Singapore's largest ever emergency exercise - Northstar VII.</p>
              <p>It is led by the Singapore Police Force and involves 14 other agencies.</p>
              <p>They include the Singapore Armed Forces, the Home Affairs Ministry and SMRT.</p>
              <p>The team of two terrorists meant business.</p>
              <p>They opened fire on other commuters as soon as they alighted from a Westbound train arriving from Marina Bay.</p>
              <p>The carnage didn't just stop there.</p>
              <p>The men went up an escalator and mowed down a group of curious onlookers in a hail of bullets.</p>
              <p>But their trail of destruction came to an end when police officers
              from the Special Operations Command arrived at the scene to neutralise
              the attack.</p>
              <p>This realistic test scenario aims to validate the operational readiness of emergency response plans.</p>
              <p>The site's Incident Commander was Superintendent Lee Ping Yue from the Central Police Division.</p>
              <p>She says, based on previous attacks in Mumbai and London, terrorists tend to target public transportation hubs.</p>
              <p>She gives her assurance that the force is ready to handle real life emergencies should they take place.</p>
              <p>"The first thing is of course, to evacuate the MRT station - to get
              the people out quickly. What the police will do is also to create a
              cordon outside the MRT station and prevent unauthorised persons from
              coming in."</p>
              <p>SMRT staff members are also trained to handle emergencies.</p>
              <p>Its Deputy Director of Security and Emergency Planning, Choy Kin Chong.</p>
              <p>"In a normal situation, our security personnel and staff will be
              able to, based on our training, recognise suspicious people, looking at
              people who carry backpacks and they would in all probability stop them
              for a bag check. We have an organisation comprising about 700 people
              who will be activated to respond to an incident like this."</p>
              <p>Exercise Northstar VII simulates a major terrorist assault at various locations islandwide.</p>
              <p>Two thousand exercise participants and 350 role players are taking part in it.</p>

              <p><strong>NorthStar anti-terror drill moves to Vivocity shopping centre</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The NorthStar exercise moved on Tuesday to Vivocity
              where security forces handled a major "terrorist attack" at a shopping
              centre.
              <br> <br>NorthStar is an annual event to test the emergency response
              capabilities of the different agencies. This year's drill, codenamed
              Exercise NorthStar VII, simulated the attacks on India's Mumbai city
              last November, with terrorists launching simultaneous assaults on key
              public areas. <br> <br> NorthStar VII is conducted over two phases. Phase one started on Monday
              where a terrorist scenario was enacted on Sentosa Island.
              <br> <br>The exercise continued on Tuesday where the focus was on how the
              authorities worked closely with community partners like shopping
              centres when tackling a terrorist attack on such premises.
              <br> <br>This time, the exercise scenario was at Vivocity with "terrorist"
              attacks on three fronts. The "terrorists" landed via speedboat at the
              Singapore Cruise Centre, moved on to the Cable Car Towers and advanced
              towards the Vivocity Shopping Centre through a link bridge from
              HarbourFront.
              <br> <br>The Jurong Police Headquarters received calls of "shooting
              incidents" at Vivocity. They swung into action, with the Special Police
              Forces mounting the operations.
              <br> <br>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cheang Keng Keong, Commander of
              Jurong Police Division, said: "One particular point we note is the
              involvement of the Project Guardian officers who are actually the
              security officers of Vivocity itself. <br> <br> "It is reassuring to note that the Vivocity management can effectively
              carry out their crisis management plans and assist the police in their
              role in this situation." <br> <br> One of the key units involved in the exercise at Vivocity was the
              Police STAR unit which has been specially trained to handle counter
              terrorism incidents in Singapore. <br> <br> According to the Police Force, those who serve in the STAR unit must
              have a high level of mental and physical resilience and courage. It was
              formed in November 1993 to provide the Police Force with the highest
              level of tactical armed response.
              <br> <br> Phase one of NorthStar VII ended with the exercise at Vivocity. Phase two of the drill will be conducted next week.

              <p><strong>New counter-terror SOC officers debut at Exercise Northstar</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Special Operations Command (SOC) division of the
              Singapore Police Force is well known for its anti-riot capabilities. <br> <br> But bystanders might have noticed something different about them during
              the anti-terrorism Exercise Northstar VII at various locations earlier
              this week. <br> <br> Instead of riot police emerging from the unit's signature red vans,
              members of the public saw heavily-armed troopers. That was because it
              was the first time the SOC was testing out its counter-terrorist
              capabilities.
              <br> <br>Since September 11 and the more recent Mumbai attacks, SOC has been
              upgrading its capabilities to match the most sophisticated terrorist.
              <br> <br>Arthur Law, head of operations, SOC, said: "The public security
              role of SOC has been beefed up with tactical skills and specialised
              equipment to enable the trooper of today to counter rampaging
              terrorists and engage in close quarter battle with armed subjects. <br> <br> "The SOC troop can also be easily reconfigured into smaller and more
              nimble fighting units to be deployed island wide." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Exercise Northstar tests Singapore response to terrorist attack</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's response to a simulated land and sea
              assault by terrorists on the resort hotel of Sentosa was tested out in
              the final phase of Exercise Northstar on Wednesday morning. <br> <br> This year's exercise attempted to re-create simultaneous terror attacks similar to the Mumbai incident last November.
              <br> <br> Witnessing the hour-long drill at the Rasa Sentosa Hotel and Beach
              Resort were Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and several cabinet
              ministers.
              <br> <br> The exercise involved multi agencies coordinating security matters.
              <br> <br> The simulated sea assault saw terrorists infiltrating Singapore's territorial waters in a motorised boat.
              <br> <br> They were intercepted by the Maritime Security Task Force and later defeated by the Police Coast Guard.
              <br> <br> On land, terrorists attempted to hold several guests hostage. 
              <br> <br>Special operations command troopers and the Singapore Armed Force's
              special operations task force were then deployed to defeat the
              terrorists.
              <br> <br>Said Prime Minister Lee: "On the one hand it depends on quick
              reflexes to an uncertain moving foggy situation. On the other hand it
              depends on many years of patient building up of the capabilities,
              building up of the units, training the people. <br> <br> "So when you see something happen today, when helicopters, the
              commandos, the police, it's just that they are alert and ready to go
              but we have spent a long time doing this. And that is what our safety
              and security and peace of mind and stability and prosperity depends on,
              and we are very grateful to the Home Team and the SAF for keeping us
              safe" <br> <br> - CNA/yb</span></p>
