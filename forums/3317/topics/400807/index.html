              <p class="MsoNormal">STOMPer Lim strongly believes while 
              there is a difference between Singlish and bad English, the usage of 
              both should be banned here.<br><br>She recounted two separate incidents 
              to illustrate her point.<br></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“This is indeed
               true and sad to find that there are still many people out there who 
              can’t distinguish ‘Singlish’ and ‘English’. <br><br>“Many people got it 
              wrong about Singlish when they thought that it is the accent that makes 
              it Singlish. <br><br>“It is actually the grammar and sentences 
              structure.  Many adult takes like lightly and not knowing that this 
              would hurt their kids in composition essays. <br><br>“Hence, I urge all 
              adults to be more mindful and alert in this area and stop imparting them
               to the next generation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> <br>“I was at a Clinic
               last night and there is a woman who said this to her son:”Ask your dad 
              to run fast, our number is going to be reached.”  Do you call this 
              English or Singlish? <br><br>“That is the first time I hear this 
              sentence.  I learned from the Americans to express in a more direct 
              manner.  I would say: ‘Get your daddy here now, it’s our turn’. <br><br>“I
               thought the issue is not about running to the door or running slowly or
               faster or the number going to be reached, it is our turn.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> <br>“After my turn was over, I went to the hawker 
              stalls and there was a family speaking Singlish saying: ‘What you want 
              to call?’ to his children. <br><br>“Why not say: ‘Go order your food’ if
               the kids are ordering themselves, or  ‘What is your pick tonight?’ if 
              the adult is ordering for them.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><br>“Both 
              incidents showed that many educated adults were speaking and teaching 
              Singlish to their children. <br><br>“They have difficulties in 
              compositing sentence that make good senses.<br><br>“This could also be a
               sign that their working environment is filled with people speaking 
              Singlish as well. <br><br>“If you were in an environment where people 
              speak English, you would have felt inferior and mend it and maintained 
              your language competency and also bring it home.<br><br>“The use of 
              Singlish should be banned."</p>

              <p>Singlish is our identity, and we derive a lot of humour from it.  We should embrace it and be proud that it's part of our culture.</p>
              <p>Of course, that does not mean Singaporeans don't need to learn proper English.  We should all learn to communicate in proper English as well, at least so that ang mohs can understand us when we speak.</p>
