              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The next time when you are torn between splurging on 
              an expensive bag and a getaway to a resort island, opt for the 
              experience. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>That's according to these speakers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Technology, Entertainment, Design (TEDxNTU).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Pursuing absolute rather than relative forms of happiness was one of the many ideas discussed at the TEDxNTU forum.<br><br>TED is a US-based, non-profit organisation that holds conferences aimed at sharing ideas and inspiring people.<br><br>Dr
               Nick Powdthavee, Assistant Professor at NTU School of Humanities and 
              Social Sciences, said: "No matter how well you do, it's a relative 
              thing. It's not just good enough to be good enough anymore. You have to 
              be better than other people. And that's really bad for our happiness.<br> <br>"Humans
               tend to pursue the relative kind of happiness, because in relative, 
              they're much scarcer. The friendships that we have at home, we take them
               for granted. But we know that we care about other people's status. If 
              someone moves up the ladder, we become unhappy if we stay still or move 
              down. What happens is we're stuck in a happiness treadmill - we will 
              never become happier because we cannot stop other people to pursue their
               own dreams." <br><br>Dr Powdthavee said this culture is evident even in Singapore and in particular, the Asian education system.<br><br>"I
               used to teach in England, and when we were asked to grade students, 
              everybody can get A's if they meet an absolute standard but not here, 
              not in Asia in general. There's a bell curve."<br><br>Attaining that elusive state of being happy could also be as simple as responding in the right way.<br><br>Associate
               Professor Maureen Frances Neihart, Head of NIE Psychological Studies, 
              said: "When people share good news with us, there's four ways in which 
              we can respond. We can ignore them; change the subject; acknowledge 
              them; or we can acknowledge, affirm, and invite them to say a little bit
               more about it. It turns out that the last kind of response is key to 
              building strong relationships. Relationships are one of the strongest 
              predictors of how happy people are.<br><br>Measuring happiness has 
              gained momentum in recent years, especially after Bhutan made headlines 
              for its focus on its Gross Happiness Index. And while experts say 
              determinants of happiness are similar throughout the world, there can be
               culture-specific ways of measuring it.<br><br>Dr Powdthavee said: "My 
              personal belief is that you can't really make inter-country comparisons 
              because culture has an impact. What we could do is within a given 
              country, there is a distribution of happiness that varies from country 
              to country and we can find the things that determine people's happiness 
              in each country."<br><br>The TEDxNTU is an independently organised series of biannual talks organised by the TED community of NTU.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              no doubt momentary happiness would not last long, but do not fall into the fallacy of absolute happiness as well.....there aren't any....life is a flux of changes
              
              we have all thrown away the long gone fairy tales of "happy ever afters"

              the only best hope for us is the continual engagement with the other side of reality..the much unsung or ugly reality hidden from the luxuries and comfort zones....
                  
              happiness should not stop at oneself when it arrives, but shared and engaged with others when they were denied...in so doing, greater truths and happiness are then found and created..

              its just a bunch of academics trying to quantify happiness to make it more predictable....like maths and science....
              
              eugenics is one such example.....and which i strongly oppose...
