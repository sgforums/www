              <p>i think singapore IR should hired those people with the handskill
              certificate. because some of my friend study the casino management
              course which include the handskills module which cost $100 but when he
              went for interview the interviewer say " i don't care whether you have
              and cert or not you still have to go for their training." but never
              mind my friend was hired in the end but my another classmate his sister
              don't even know how to shuffle the cards, cut the chips, don't the rule
              of the game, the IR also hired her. So what for those ppl study and
              practice the skill so hard at hm? and waste our parent $$$ ?</p>

              <p>I wanted to study the course too but feel that its not necessary espicially if I study already than the casino don't want to employ me than I will have wasted my time and money to study.</p>

              <p>don't worry lah...if the dealer lost too much money on the table each night i am sure he/she will be transferred to being a waiter.....You should check out what they have to do to be a card dealer in Vegas.</p>
              <p>AT the end of the day i can tell you 50% of the card dealers will be Foreigners from Macau and Genting casino.  </p>

              <p>Like it or not, Singapore's IR casinos would want their dealers to have top notch skills.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans dealers and croupiers must meet the high standards found at other casinos around the world. They can't smile apologically, and like rookie taxi drivers, say they are new. Not when money of seasoned gamblers is involved.</p>
