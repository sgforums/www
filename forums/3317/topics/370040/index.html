              <p><strong>Womenâ€™s group proposes new authority to make ex-spouses pay up</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>A Singapore Council of Women's Organisations
              taskforce is proposing that a new body be set up to enforce the payment
              of monthly maintenance sums from an ex-spouse to his or her family.</p>
              <p>Statistics show, even with a court-issued maintenance order, 1,700
              people, mainly women, had to apply for the orders to be enforced last
              year.</p>
              <p>Nearly half of the 1,700 had to apply at least twice - a process
              that could take months if ex-spouses keep on defaulting on payments.</p>
              <p>The new body - called the Maintenance Services Authority, would help to ease the recovery process in several ways.</p>
              <p>One is through powers the courts currently lack.</p>
              <p>For instance, the courts now leave it up to the claimnant to locate
              the ex-spouse to receive payments, failing which, there's little other
              substantial remedy.</p>
              <p>It is proposed that the new authority be given access to the
              databases of the HDB, CPF Board and income tax departments in order to
              trace the whearabouts of the paying party.</p>
              <p>The authority should also be able to search for all assets related to the paying party.</p>
              <p>It could also reduce the acrimony between both parties and the time taken for payments to be made, benefitting the claimnants.</p>
              <p>Ms Malathi Das, member of the taskforce and Vice President of the Law Society of Singapore:</p>
              <p>"Whenever you deal with a court system is that because it's an
              adversarial system you'll have the claimnant's side of the story and
              you'll also have the other party wanting to contest and the judge has
              then to come back and make decision. So it can end up being a very
              long-drawn process still. Whereas if you have the authority being the
              person in the middle, collecting and getting that information, not
              necessarily revealing the information to the other side, then you've a
              very comfortable intermediary that still achieves the purposes of
              getting that information, but balances that against the interests of
              the paying party with his needs for confidentiality and privacy."</p>
              <p>The proposals draw from focus groups discussions with counsellors,
              wives and ex-husbands among others, as well as the experiences of other
              jurisdictions like in Australia and Britain.</p>
