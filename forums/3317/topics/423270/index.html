              <p>An international dating agency has ranked Singaporean women as being the
               'most ideal' partner based on qualities like beauty, loyalty, adherence
               to tradition, initiative and fluency in English. While STOMPer SGman is proud of our girls, he wonders if Singaporean guys agree with this.</p>
              <p>This was reported in Lianhe Wanbao. The dating agency was not named, but
               according to the report, it had been quoted by Time magazine and BBC 
              news.</p>
              <p>STOMPer SGMan said:<br><br>"First and foremost, I'm proud of our girls for being ranked as the perfect partner.<br><br>"They are indeed beautiful and very appealing, even our SIA girls were ranked as the second hottest internationally. <br><br>But
               I wonder if the survey is accurate, since it was conducted by an 
              international dating agency, who might not have the best of experiences 
              with Singaporean women.<br><br>"I have had friends who complain that Singaporean girls are materialistic, high maintenance and very 'atas'.<br><br>"So what do you think, guys? Are Singaporean girls THE perfect partner?"</p>

              <p>I observed that local women are still quite satisfied with the status quo in Sinkapore, so most probably that feeling is reflected also in their actions and speech. They seemed to still have confidence in this country.</p>
              <p>Anyway I just find them also to be slowly going the way of dodo birds, even in schools, I see more foreigners than locals. In the youth and working adult age group, I find that they are a dimmishing group.</p>
              <p>SG women will be represented by new citizens in the future.</p>
              <p>In five to eight years, what I suspect is that the new citizens women will take a more traditional approach, more towards family, they will start family with their own origin countrymen and start at least a small family here, after which when the kids are closer to NS age, they will return to their own homeland.</p>
              <p>For all the economic advancement that this country, supposedly made, the country did not have her own children with laughing voices reaching the sky. Instead, in every segment of population, everyone is severely drained by the indiscriminate influx of foreigners.</p>
              <p>We are a sad little lot, with no future to show for because childrens are the future of this nation.</p>
              <p>Time have shown that not all surveys have their uses, having being top at some things are meaningless. It also does not give a true picture of what things are.</p>

              <p>I just think that maybe SG girls peaked at the wrong time, the country is in a mess, almost non-existence local population. I don't know what anyone can do anymore. Some will marry foreigners and leave with them because there's better environment for having kids and benefits so in the end we are dodo birds.</p>
              <p>I guess we are slowly becoming quite a legend, maybe like Atlantis.</p>
              <p>Maybe archaeologist can come and dig out stuffs and we will leave murals of what this place used to be.</p>

              <p><br>I guess that's really quite a difficult situation, because the other partner's family opinions will also be crucial on this matter.</p>

              <p>what is the point of answering you with that? Looking from your attitude in calling names already made me lost my respect for u, not to say the gals here, even if they are interested in you. From the way you express yourself just now, if sg gals is really a bitch, what makes you? Son of a bitch? Asshole? Do you like people to call you that? Think about it and talk like a mature adult next time.</p>
