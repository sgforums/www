              <p><strong>Unionised sector sees retrenchments fall in Q2: labour chief</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The second quarter of this year saw only one-third of
              the number of lay-offs experienced in the previous quarter for the
              unionised sector, said labour movement chief Lim Swee Say.
              <br> <br>And while this showed an improvement over the nearly 10,000
              retrenched in the first quarter, Mr Lim said Singaporeans must not
              assume the downturn is over. <br> <br> When the economic downturn hit Singapore, the labour movement set
              itself three targets, said NTUC Secretary-General Lim Swee Say. These
              were: to avoid record retrenchments, a high unemployment rate as in
              2003 when SARS hit, and to be among the first to bounce back when the
              upturn returns.
              <br> <br>Mr Lim said: "After six months of tripartite efforts, we believe we
              are on track. We cannot say for sure that by the end of this year,
              whether we would be able to succeed to achieve all these three targets.
              But we will continue to pursue our 'Upturn the Downturn' strategy." <br> <br> Mr Lim reminded Singaporeans that the downturn was not over yet despite recent reports that companies have started hiring.
              <br> <br> A survey by consultancy firm Hudson said that for the first time since 2007, hiring expectations are up across the board.
              <br> <br> The Singapore National Employers Federation also found from its regular
              quarterly surveys that the percentage of companies saying they were
              hiring had gone up from 20 to 25 per cent between March and June this
              year.
              <br> <br>Stephen Lee, president, Singapore National Employers Federation,
              said: "Certainly this is a positive sign, but the question is how long
              will we be bottom-bumpy and how long will we stay at the bottom. <br> <br> "Certainly there are no strong signs to indicate a fast recovery. So
              most companies are prepared that it will stay where it is and wait till
              the first quarter of next year to see whether it will pick up." <br> <br> Mr Lim added: "Let us remember that not all industries will recover at
              the same time and at the same pace. So when we see some companies
              starting to recover and starting to hire workers, we should be happy,
              but don't be too happy. <br> <br> "We cannot keep retrenchment down to zero. But we can make sure that
              when the worker is retrenched, he does not necessary become an
              unemployed worker."
              <br> <br> Hence the need to remain focused on the fundamentals, with cutting costs to save jobs being key.
              <br> <br>Although there may be some signs of improvement in hiring, the
              National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National
              Employers Federation said it is not time for companies and workers to
              rest on their laurels. <br> <br> They encourage both employers and workers to take full advantage of the
              various training and re-training schemes available to enhance the
              employability of their workers. </span></p>
