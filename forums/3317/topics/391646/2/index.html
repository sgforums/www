              <p><strong>Ideas on raising productivity</strong></p>
              <p>A NEW council tasked to make Singapore more productive and innovative
               will have no lack of ideas, following yesterday's Parliament sitting.</p>
              <p>Many of the 26 MPs who spoke about the 2010 Budget gave one 
              suggestion after another on how the National Productivity and Continuing
               Education Council can boost productivity.</p>
              <p>The ideas included setting specific productivity targets for
               individual industries, ways to help white-collar workers, and spending 
              more on research and innovation to turn small and medium-sized 
              enterprises (SMEs) into global giants.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean will head the new 
              council that will steer efforts in raising yearly productivity from 1 
              per cent to 2 to 3 per cent in the next decade. To achieve it, a $2 
              billion productivity fund and a productivity and innovation credit 
              scheme will be launched.</p>
              <p>However, Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) said the 
              national targets are too broad and suggested sectoral targets because 
              some sectors, such as construction, will need to improve more.</p>
              <p>The Government should also set specific targets for business
               associations, which are getting $100 million over the next five years 
              to help them drive the productivity campaign. This is to make sure the 
              money is put to good use, she added.</p>

              <p><strong>DPM Teo lists out two focus areas for National Productivity and 
              Continuing Education Council </strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's ongoing productivity drive may not see results in months or 
              even within the year. <br> <br> But it's an effort for the long haul, and is the basis for Singapore's 
              future economic competitiveness. <br> <br> Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said this in Parliament today, as he
               spoke for the first time about the new high-level National Productivity
               and Continuing Education Council, which he's chairing.<strong></strong> <br> <br> The new Council will focus on two main areas. <br> <br> First, it will drive efforts to raise productivity at the individual, 
              enterprise and sector-levels. <br> <br> And second, it will oversee efforts to develop a world-class national 
              Continuing Education and Training or CET system, and entrench a culture 
              of continuous learning and upgrading among Singaporeans. <br> <br> In listing these priorities out, Mr Teo also clarified that productivity
               is not about working harder or longer, or just about automating 
              existing processes. <br> <br> Instead, it encompasses factors like the quality of systems found within
               enterprises, the attractiveness of their products and the structure of 
              their sector and the economy as a whole.<strong> <br> <br> "Higher productivity enables us to generate the additional value that 
              can be shared between companies and workers, provide good jobs and 
              higher incomes for workers, and generate higher profits for companies. 
              Ultimately, productivity is the basis for our future economic 
              competitiveness."<br> </strong><br> But Mr Teo adds that improving productivity will require a concerted 
              tripartite effort involving enterprises, workers and the government. <br> <br> And he says the Council will identify government agencies that will work
               with industry partners and also the unions to develop strategies and 
              solutions to raise productivity in each sector. <br> <br> It will also direct funds towards developing infrastructure and tools 
              that enterprises can use to support their productivity efforts. <br> <br> These will include setting up sector-focused resource centers to do 
              applied research into productivity, and developing productivity 
              benchmarks. <br> <br> As for workers, Mr Teo says the Council will oversee the development of a
               world-class national CET system that caters to everyone, yet is 
              customised to the needs of different workers and companies. <br> <br> It will also identify and develop new focus areas of growth for the CET 
              system, in line with the skills needed to support the productivity 
              drive.<strong> <br> <br> "Lifelong learning is the means to an end, and that is to add value. The
               ability to add value will bring about better employability and better 
              income for workers."</strong><br> <br> The exact composition of the Council has not been announced. <br> <br> But Mr Teo says it will be an inclusive one reflecting the comprehensive
               nature of the productivity drive.</p>
