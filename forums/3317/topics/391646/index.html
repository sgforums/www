              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government will be committing S$1.1
              billion a year over the next five years to support the national bid to
              raise productivity. </span></p>
              <p><span>This will be in the form of tax benefits, grants and training subsidies to support the national bid to raise productivity. 
              <br> <br> To oversee that, a new high-level National Productivity and Continuing
              Education Council, to be chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee
              Hean, will be set up.
              <br> <br> The council will also include members from the government, business community and labour movement.
              <br> <br>Besides galvanizing the major national effort required to boost
              skills and enterprise productivity, the council will develop a
              comprehensive system for Continuing Education and Training (CET).
              <br> <br>It will also oversee the work of the different government agencies
              and promote close collaboration amongst the business sector, workers
              and unions, and the public sector.
              <br> <br>Announcing this in Parliament on Monday, Finance Minister Tharman
              Shanmugaratnam explained that the easy gains in productivity are over,
              following major strides in productivity growth in the past decades.
              <br> <br> He added that making the next leap in productivity will involve transformations at three levels.
              <br> <br>Firstly, Singapore will have to restructure its overall economy
              towards higher-value activities and exit from less efficient ones.
              <br> <br>Mr Tharman said this broad economic restructuring is how major
              improvements in productivity have been achieved in many of the advanced
              economies.
              <br> <br>As for which enterprises should succeed or phase out, the finance
              minister said it is for the market and not the government to decide.
              <br> <br> Secondly, Mr Tharman said there is a need to upgrade individual industries and enterprises.
              <br> <br> He said the Budget will extend strong support for them to do so, in every sector.
              <br> <br> For instance, the government will give significant tax reliefs to businesses that invest in skills and innovation.
              <br> <br> It will also provide grants for customized, industry-based initiatives.
              <br> <br> Thirdly, the finance minister said Singapore must raise the skills and creative potential of every worker.
              <br> <br>To do so, he said the government will progressively build up a
              first-class system for Continuing Education and Training (CET) over the
              next decade.
              <br> <br>Mr Tharman said: "This will be a major investment in our people, up
              and down the skills ladder. However, we can only make our next leap in
              productivity and incomes if every individual takes the initiative to
              develop his skills and expertise, and accomplish more in his job and
              career. Our employers must also empower their people to find new ways
              to add value and help unlock every worker's potential."
              <br> <br>To complement investments in productivity, Mr Tharman said
              Singapore must also manage the supply of foreign workers. The best way
              to do so, he said, is through the price mechanism. That is, by raising
              foreign worker levies rather than through imposing numerical limits.
              <br> <br>Mr Tharman said: "This allows the foreign workforce to fluctuate
              across the economic cycle, and enables employers who are doing well and
              need more foreign workers to continue to hire them rather than be
              constrained by fixed quotas."
              <br> <br>The finance minister said Singapore will phase in higher levies
              gradually over the next three years so that companies know well in
              advance what will happen and have time to adjust.
              <br> <br>Summing up, Mr Tharman said that the various initiatives to boost
              productivity will transform Singapore into an advanced economy with
              superior skills, <br> quality jobs and higher incomes for citizens.

              <p>remember
              last year when we redid the backyard ? .... we had 8 banglas and ah
              tiongs in the backyard for months, only two of them actually did work
              at any one time, all the banglas would just stand around and pose with
              towels on their heads texting and making calls to their phillipino
              booty calls and most of the ah tiongs would squat at one side in a row and
              smoke, the ah tiongs would only come alive after official working
              hours, when OT pay kicks in. I spoke to the contractor about this, and he could only shake his head and sigh. A bunch of lazier buggers I have never seen, is it any wonder that our productivity is falling ? </p>

              <p>and nowadays you'll see fillipina maids with their bangla boyfriends pitching tents away from the beach at east coast parks. Who would want to pitch a tent in the afternoon beside the carpark half hidden by bushes ? No wonder people lose their 5k disposits all the time.</p>

              <p><strong>DPM Teo to address Parliament on work of new council and challenges ahead</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has
              said the country's drive to improve its productivity levels by two to
              three per cent each year needs the whole nation's effort. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Teo chairs the newly-formed National Productivity and Continuing Education Council.
              <br> <br> Speaking to the media at a community event on Sunday, Mr Teo explained
              that companies need to take the lead, while workers too have to take
              ownership for their own upgrading.
              <br> <br> On its part, the government has a lot of work to do in the area of facilitation. 
              <br> <br> Mr Teo said he will speak on the matter next week during the Budget Debate.
              <br> <br>He said: "We have made good progress in the past in our
              productivity drive and that is why we have been able to move our
              economy forward and have good jobs for many Singaporeans. But this is a
              constant effort and we have to renew and re-double our efforts.
              <br> <br>"Our economy has changed and our workforce has moved up in terms of
              skills and productivity levels. And so we have to see how we can move
              even further up. While we have moved on, I must say the countries which
              are ahead of us have also moved on, and those countries behind us have
              also moved up.
              <br> <br>"There are many things that need to be done. Companies need to take
              the lead. Workers also need to take ownership for their own upgrading
              and the government has a lot of work to do in the facilitation. It
              requires the companies, unions and government to work together."
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, with Sunday being the 15th day of the Lunar New Year
              celebrations, 650 Pasir Ris residents joined their MPs for a lo hei
              session.
              <br> <br> They tried to get those taking part to wear aprons for the event held at Pasir Ris Community Club. - CNA/ms </span></p>
