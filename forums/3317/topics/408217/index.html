              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said Singapore's policies are not set in stone. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said the ability to improve on what has been done and basic values like meritocracy have led to Singapore's success. </span></p>
              <p><span> Addressing his constituents at the Tanjong Pagar National Day dinner on 
              Sunday evening, Mr Lee also spoke of the crucial need for succession. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Lee said the spectacular 45th anniversary National Day Parade 
              encapsulates the experience the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has gained 
              in 45 years. </span></p>
              <p><span> He said: "Every year, the SAF improves on what it has done. It is like 
              the rest of Singapore. It is the reason for our progress. Soldiers are 
              better trained and officers are of the quality to improve on last year's
               performance. And a new team of officers takes over, studies the past 
              and improves on it. This way, Singapore has ensured succession. </span></p>
              <p><span> "We defied the odds and got to where we are. However, we must never 
              forget our hard and harsh beginnings. If our national solidarity is 
              splintered by communal hostility, and our social cohesion is weakened, 
              we will regress. Then we will have a weak economy that cannot afford a 
              strong SAF. That will again make us vulnerable." </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Lee said the resources the SAF needs to mount such a superb performance require a strong and vibrant economy. </span></p>
              <p><span> And to build such a Singapore, the nation needs an exceptionally strong 
              government with the ablest, the toughest and the most dedicated leaders. </span></p>
              <p><span> Mr Lee said: "We headhunt for them, test them out in heavy 
              responsibilities. Only such leaders can keep the economy growing and 
              create good jobs and generate the revenue to pay for the equipment and 
              training of our 3-G SAF. </span></p>
              <p><span>"This 3-G SAF provides the security and confidence of our people 
              and of foreign investors, assured that we can more than defend 
              ourselves. If there is insecurity, there will be fewer investments. That
               means a poorer people and instability."
              <br> <br> Mr Lee added that Singapore's basic values - of ensuring leaders of high
               integrity; meritocracy; a level playing field for all citizens; and 
              English as the working language - have laid the foundation of 
              Singapore's success.  
              <br> <br> He said: "People get to where they are on merit - not nepotism, not 
              corruption. Hence, all are capable and competent. No policy is skewed as
               a result of personal benefit or profits. We have been rated as the 
              cleanest government in Asia, and amongst the first three cleanest in the
               world.
              <br> <br> "Third, we have a level playing field for all citizens. No one is 
              disadvantaged by our national policies whatever their race, language or 
              religion. 
              <br> <br> "Fourth, English is our working language. We did not choose Chinese, the
               language of the majority. English gives everyone an equal chance to 
              master the language. It is a language of the world of trade and 
              individuals, the Internet and new knowledge. It has made us the hub we 
              now are for businesses, industries, banking and financial services, and 
              communications."
              <br> <br> Minister Mentor Lee also pointed out that Singapore's policies are not 
              set in stone and the country is always re-examining old policies and 
              positions and changing them with changing world circumstances, like 
              deciding to allow the F1 race which has been a sparkling success.
              <br> <br> Similarly, Singapore was also against casinos for decades. But having 
              seen the industry develop in Las Vegas, the Republic allowed two 
              integrated resorts, which Mr Lee said are doing well.
              <br> <br> The facilities at the two hotels have drawn in hordes of tourists and 
              Singaporeans, with the country's tourist industry having grown by 30 per
               cent already.
              <br> <br> But Mr Lee pointed out that Singapore has done poorly in one sector - 
              Singaporeans are not replacing themselves. And with a fertility rate of 
              1.22, Singapore will nearly halve its population in one generation.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said: "So we have no choice - since we cannot encourage our 
              people with bonuses and incentives to have more children - (but) to get 
              immigrants from Malaysia, who are the easiest to assimilate, from China,
               from India and from the region. 
              <br> <br> "They will take time to adjust to our culture and ways of life, but they
               will adapt if they want to succeed, and learn English to be part of 
              Singapore."
              <br> <br> Mr Lee called on Singaporeans to help integrate the children of 
              immigrants into society so that these new citizens will make for a more 
              varied and dynamic society. 
              <br> <br> Minister Mentor Lee also spoke in Mandarin.
              <br> <br> He told his audience that Singapore's economic growth, expected to be at least 12 or 13 per cent for this year, was not bad.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said that such growth would allow for improvements such as schools and buildings.
              <br> <br> He said: "I am not saying all the HDB flats can be as nice as Pinnacle 
              (Pinnacle@Duxton), but so long as there is one main area that is just as
               pretty, just as luxurious."
              <br> <br> However, for Singapore to develop and prosper, and for its people to 
              live peacefully, the country must be united and citizens must feel they 
              are benefiting, he said. 
              <br> <br> Over 95 per cent of flat owners have taken possession of their flats at 
              Pinnacle@Duxton, while 70 to 80 per cent have moved in. </span></p>
