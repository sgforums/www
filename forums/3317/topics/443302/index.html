              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: With youth gangs and other gang-related activities a 
              concern, the authorities are considering imposing a minimum age for 
              getting tattooed.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Deputy 
              Superintendent Tan Yong Hong, head of the Singapore Police Force's 
              Secret Societies Branch on Friday said that his team was "very 
              concerned" about the tattoos on some of the teenaged boys arrested for 
              gang-related activities.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Said DSP Tan: "They 
              tattoo themselves to show off to others that they are tough and 
              'protected'. Imposing a minimum age will help prevent the at-risk teens 
              from associating and identifying themselves with hard-core criminals."<br><br>DSP
               Tan was leading Camp Ace IV, a two-day camp at Pulau Ubin organised by 
              the Criminal Investigation Department for at-risk boys aged between 13 
              and 18. It is part of the police's efforts to reach out to youths and 
              steer them away from crime and gang-related activities.<br><br>Currently,
               there is no minimum age requirement to get tattooed. But tattoo artist 
              Sumithra Debi stipulated a minimum age of 18 at her shop Exotic Tattoos 
              and Piercings when she started her business 15 years ago.<br><br>Said Ms
               Debi: "There have been boys as young as 12 coming in and wanting 
              tattoos. I think they are doing it to seek attention and do not fully 
              realise the consequences of putting something so permanent on their 
              bodies at such a young age."<br><br>Ms Debi said at least three teens 
              below 18 will try their luck at her shop once a week, looking to tattoo 
              outlines of dragons, but she turns them away.<br><br>In the United 
              Kingdom, the legal minimum age to get tattooed is 18, while several 
              states in the US such as California and New York have imposed similar 
              laws.<br><br>Invited by the CID to share his experiences with the youths on Friday was a reformed gangster who wanted to be known only as MC.<br><br>As he spoke of his regret in joining gangs, MC, 36, took off his sports jacket, revealing the tattoos he had from neck to wrist.<br><br>He
               said: "You think by putting tattoos on your body people will be afraid 
              of you? They may smile to avoid trouble but they think you're a fool, 
              because being a gangster means you end up either in jail or the 
              cemetery."<br><br>MC, who was released in 2009, was jailed for rioting. 
              His wife left him and his family did not want him there when his parents
               and elder sister passed away while he was in jail.<br><br>These incidents and turning to religion helped him turn his life around.<br><br>One
               camp participant, John (not his real name), 18, had his back tattooed 
              when he was 14 to rebel against his parents and to join a gang.<br><br>Said John: "I want to remove it but I think it will be too painful."<br><br>Fortunately,
               shedding his past was easier. "The StreetWise Programme and this camp, 
              especially the talk, made me realise that it's okay to say no. I was 
              asked to re-join the gang many times and I said no. They threatened to 
              beat me but when I did run into them, they did not do anything," he 
              said.</span></span></p>
