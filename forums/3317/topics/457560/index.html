              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's inflation rate dropped to 4.0 per cent 
              year-on-year in July from 5.3 per cent in June, according to a statement
               released by the Department of Statistics on Thursday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The decline in the 
              Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key gauge of inflation, was due to "more 
              moderate increases in the costs of accommodation, private road transport
               and oil-related items", the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and 
              the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a joint statement.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>On a year-on-year basis, accommodation cost inflation slowed from 10.8 per cent in June to 7.8 per cent in July.<br><br>This
               was due largely to the timing of disbursements of rebates for service 
              and conservancy charges to HDB households, as well as a slowdown in the 
              increase in imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation from 9.8 per
               cent in June to 9.0 per cent in July.<br><br>Private transport costs 
              added 0.8 per cent to the CPI, lower than the 1.3 per cent in the June 
              data, due to a slight moderation in car prices as COE premiums eased in 
              June. At the same time, petrol pump prices fell by 1.9 per cent on-year 
              in July.<br><br>Despite a slower rate of growth in the inflation, 
              accommodation and private road transport costs accounted for around 60 
              per cent of inflation on all items in July. <br><br>The year-on-year 
              increase in electricity tariffs slowed from 12.5 per cent in June to 2.9
               per cent in July, while food and services inflation remained stable at 
              2.3 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively. <br><br>Excluding the costs 
              of accommodation and private road transport, core inflation came in 
              lower at 2.4 per cent for July, falling from 2.7 per cent in June on 
              account of lower contribution from oil-related items.<br><br>On a month-on-month basis, overall CPI edged up 0.2 per cent after stabilising in the preceding month. <br><br>In
               the joint statement, MAS and MTI said that due to the "generally 
              sluggish economic environment", the forecast for core inflation will be 
              slightly lower over the next few months and average between 2.5 and 3.0 
              per cent for the whole of 2012.<br><br>It added that CPI-All Items inflation was expected to remain elevated and average 4.0 to 4.5 per cent for the whole year.<br><br>This
               is because of higher rental accommodation costs as leasing contracts 
              are renewed, especially in the HDB segment, and expectations that COE 
              premiums will remain sharply higher than in 2011 because of the low COE 
              supply.<br><br>- CNA/wm/al</span></span></p>
