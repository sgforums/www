              <p>WHEN businessman Ng Choon Beng moved into his terrace house in Upper 
              Serangoon Road three years ago, the neighbourhood was a quiet, leafy 
              residential area with great food.</p>
              <p>Then, Hotel 81 and Fragrance Hotel came up just a few doors away and 
              started offering hourly rates.</p>
              <p>'There wasn't much activity at first, but we see a lot more 
              illicit activities going on these days,' said Mr Ng, 38, of his estate, 
              which is next to Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, about 1km from Kovan 
              MRT station.</p>
              <p>'Sometimes cars drive up right outside our house and park 
              there, and then we see these girls and their clients walking towards the
               hotels; we've even witnessed money transactions taking place.'</p>
              <p>When his wife walks to a nearby provision shop to buy 
              groceries, men waiting around the hotels and KTV lounges would stare at 
              her or even proposition her. Mr Ng's neighbours are equally upset by the
               new people on the block. They are unwelcome in a residential area and 
              they have caused parking woes, said residents.</p>
              <p>Since budget hotels began springing up in residential areas 
              like Kovan, Tiong Bahru and Balestier in the past two years, sex workers
               have also started appearing.</p>

              <p><strong>Joo Chiat is now less sleazy</strong></p>
              <p>THE sleaze in Joo Chiat has shrivelled.</p>
              <p>The 'hundreds' of women who used to walk the street at night have 
              fallen to about 40 to 50, according to the area's MP Chan Soo Sen. 'I 
              make it a point to look at (the situation) every week and have a rough 
              count,' he told reporters on Monday.</p>
              <p>The vice problem is now confined to a 50m stretch along Joo 
              Chiat Road, he added, and more family-oriented and lifestyle businesses 
              such as food, fashion, advertising, and souvenirs have popped up in the 
              neighbourhood in the last couple of years.</p>
              <p>The MP was briefing reporters on the improvements made to 
              the heritage area, ahead of the May 9 ministerial walkabout by Law 
              Minister K. Shanmugam. In 2005, he said, 'hundreds' of women solicited 
              customers along a 1.3km stretch of Joo Chiat Road. Now, the road is 
              quieter and he sees 40 to 50 women on the street when he drives or walks
               in the area at night.</p>
              <p>Sleaze was a political issue in the intense campaign for Joo
               Chiat during the 2006 General Election. Mr Chan won 65 per cent of the 
              18,806 valid votes against Workers' Party veteran Tan Bin Seng.</p>
              <p>Asked whether he will contest in the next general election, 
              Mr Chan said the decision is up to the leaders of the People's Action 
              Party: 'If they want to field me, I will continue to try and do my best 
              till the last day.'</p>

              <p><strong>Hourly hotel rates and Vice, please 
                      Say NO. </strong></p>

                      the hourly hotel rate altogether, those who want affordable rest, stay 
                      in backpacker hostel cheaper, per day $&lt;40pax , sleep and bathe, 
                      share TV all U want, nobody watching, nobody care. If U wan to have 
                      luxury of 'hotel' den must pay FULL DAY rates. <br> If U cannot even afford Hostel den U shouldn't be coming here/ 
                      alternatively just sleep on airport sofa- the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallajokull volcano</a> 'victims' survived days at
                       Changi Airport, so can U. So not correct say no choice wat. Ditto for 
                      the hotel, if cannot 'make it' with daily rates, den U ought to review 
                      your market research, maybe 'en-block', become hostel/ residential/ 
                      shopping/ office/ warehouse is the way to go. After all if U claim 
                      clientele ish coming for 'studies'/ convention, den either way U still 
                      earn: cheap rates so they dun mind pay full day use 1/2. Everyone like 
                      dat, so focused on 'good work productivity' den U should sell by volume,
                       via cheap rates all year round and still profit some more. If by sheer 
                      demand U find that U cannot cope- den u can raise room rates and plan 
                      for retirement lor.<br> Sorry for the digression, me looking for job in hotel management <img class="inlineimg" title="Smile" src="http://forums.asiaone.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.<br> <br> Banning hourly rates makes society more stable- less neighborhood 
                      complaints, everybody happy (MPs more time relak jack). Moral of story, 
                      no free lunch here ok, hotels and their clientele must pay for the 
                      luxury they wan to enjoy, cannot have cake and eat it. If customer 
                      volume high budget low, open 'backpackers hostel' lah- more beds, 
                      cheaper rooms, earn by volume as I said. For mata mata/ SCDF check= 
                      easy, one look can tell no hanky panky, girl wan room, boy the other, 
                      ditto the toilets like parliament house like dat, everything clean and 
                      organized, they check until cannot be bothered to check again. <br> A hotel is NOT a brothel, and should never be mistaken for one. <br> Dis is Singapore,  we are totally focused on <a href="http://www.totaldefence.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/totaldefence/home.html">total defense</a>. <br> We are not in the business of operating ANY brother activities.<br> Thanks for your kind cooperation.<strong><br> <br> </strong>

(April 28).<br> The writer seems to believe that hourly rates at hotels are a major 
                      cause of social ills and banning them will somehow make Singapore a 
                      better place. However, if one understands the dynamics of Singapore, one
                       would realise that hourly rates at budget hotels do provide a necessary
                       social service.<br> <br> First, let's be clear that while hourly rates may be used for sexual 
                      activity, that's not always the case.<br> There are people working the late shift and in a city that hopes to 
                      develop a more vibrant "night life", the hourly rates at budget hotels 
                      provide an alternative resting place to people who work late - like 
                      musicians, waitresses and others in the entertainment industry.<br> <br> Some people in this industry, through the course of their work, drink 
                      heavily.<br> Some work for establishments that do not provide a transport service 
                      that takes them home.<br> <br> There are those who drive. Surely it is better for people in these 
                      situations to have a place to sober up before they drive home than to 
                      place them in situations where they feel it's necessary to drive when 
                      under the influence of alcohol?<br> And not all sexual activities that go on in such establishments are 
                      between prostitutes and clients.<br> <br> There are unmarried couples who use these hotels because they don't have
                       privacy in their own homes.<br> Having budget hotels that charge by the hour provide these couples with a
                       safe and private environment to engage in a private act between 
                      consenting adults.<br> <br> This then leads to the question of "vice". Prostitution is not a 
                      pleasant business. However, it has been around for as long as Singapore 
                      has.<br> Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew admits in his biography that prostitution 
                      is an industry that is impossible to ban and it is better to have it in 
                      the open than driven underground.<br> Thanks to his pragmatism, Singapore has avoided many of the social ills 
                      associated with the business.<br> <br> We may not like some of the activities that take place in budget hotels 
                      but they do provide society with a necessary outlet for certain 
                      activities.<br> So, let's be practical and leave budget hotels as they are and to charge
                       as they please.</td>

                   stop driving- rest- drive on, Singapore for ANY form of vehicular  
                  traffic is often a terminal destination. For those engaging in any  
                  decent restful activity, they have ample backpacker's hostels and daily 
                   rated budget hotels to choose from. In addition, backpacker's hostels  
                  serve a valid tourist niche and Singapore as a safe and healthy  
                  destination, should actively promote their proper development as they  
                  woo the young and trendy traveler. <br> <br> In regard to Budget Hotels (BH) running mostly hourly rates, these can  
                  at best be described as controversial businesses moving down a slippery 
                   slope and, predictably bringing down the morals of Singaporeans with 
                  it.<br> <br> I doubt and tourist inadvertently residing in any such hotel would  
                  return with in any way, a good impression Singapore. The streets filled 
                   with 'walkers', its 'ti kor pek' citizens- the main clientele.<br> <br> Romanian diplomat <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=2716225">Ionescu </a>undoubtedly went overboard whilst performing
                    his 'duties' here, both 'provider' and connoisseur of vice here, could
                    the conduciveness of the current local scene have played a part? <br> <br> Hourly rated BH have the commercial imperative towards creating sleazy  
                  districts, since by virtue of their business model, they become  
                  obligated to promote promiscuity, both nationally as well as  
                  internationally. One cannot have one's cake and eat it as the sleaze  
                  drives away genuine tourist, leaving the BH with no choice but to  
                  exploit the route of sleaze facilitation. <br> This stratagem also requires a covert means of silencing as well as  
                  dispersing dissenting existing residents; and to facilitate profit from 
                   the momentum of  vice, the compromise of government administration  
                  through bribery and other covert/ coercive means towards achieving  
                  social degradation.<br> <br> Government officials can also be expected to be often bribed as the  
                  visible viability and 'profitability' of such establishments tempt more 
                   to follow.<br> <br> NONE of the outcomes of such vice are of any social NOR economic benefit
                    to our society nor that of our surrounding neighbors.<br> <br> Whilst the banning of hourly rates would not preclude such vice from  
                  occurring, it would however enable the policing and regulation of such  
                  vices to be much done much more efficiently and cost effectively. <br> <br> The ultimate 'victims' of this current situation would be ultimately be 
                   Singaporeans/ 'Permanent residents' of Singapore since tourist on 
                  family  vacations are unlikely to patronize such services AND require 
                  hourly  accommodation in this respect.<br> Persons from neighboring countries might also, through the internet,  
                  make 'bookings' with popular girls, however, a host of other problems by
                    association accompany this breed of 'tourist'.<br> <br> The fiscal and social cost of continuing to allow hourly rated hotels is
                    estimated to be immense not perpetuated by many civil servants, whom I
                    feel are ill prepared to perform the currently onerous duties as  
                  'anti-vice' officers- a few of whom have been publicly admonished having
                    sought favours from charges whom they were employed to supervise/  
                  penalize [Dec 2, 2008:<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_309350.html"> 'ICA officer charged'</a>], [ST 17Nov 2009: <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Crime/Story/A1Story20091117-180543.html">'2 NEA officers charged over sexual bribe'</a>]. Has  
                  promiscuity entrenched itself as popular culture in Singapore such that 
                   civil servants are equally tempted. Our 'pay more to prevent 
                  corruption'  policies have indeed failed.<br> <br>

              I have NOT in this current thread, solely  premised my arguments 
                  upon the  problem of 'exploitation'. It is the  fabric of trust within

                  animals, no 'progress' is then possible  except regression towards 
                  extinction if U draw this arguement to its  logical conclusion that is.<br> Prostitution might be an 'ancient profession', yes, but it not be  
                  'facilitated' in the way it currently is in modern day Singapore.<br> <br>

              So heroin on the  streets- willing buyer/ seller is okay, if U 
                  indeed are Singaporean,  then i really don't blame U cos if U have 
                  paraphrased the 'noble' words  as quoted in the first post: <br> "... Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew admits in his biography that <span style="color: red;">prostitution</span> is an industry that is impossible to  
                  ban and it is better to have it in  the open than driven  
                  underground....", replacing the term 'prostitution' with any other vice 
                   for that matter, wouldn't be too far fetched an argument to ponder. <br> <br> Perhaps then it wouldn't be too unwise to leave when things get

              <p><strong>Joo Chiat's sleaze reduced substantially, says law minister</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Law Minister K Shanmugam said sleaze in the Joo Chiat 
              area has been substantially reduced over the last few years. </span></p>
              <p><span>And this can be seen from the dwindling number of vice activities 
              as well as establishments like pubs and massage parlours.
              <br> <br> Over the years, the number of pubs in the Joo Chiat area has gone down 
              from 46 to 28.
              <br> <br> And this is even more significant for massage parlours. While the area 
              used to have about 30 massage parlours, it is now down to only three.
              <br> <br> Responding to a query on what more the government is doing to clean up 
              the area, Mr Shanmugam said the various agencies have been working 
              together to control vice there.
              <br> <br> "A decision has been taken since January of 2009 by the STB (Singapore 
              Tourism Board), on the urging of the MP and the Joo Chiat task force, 
              that hotels will not be allowed to charge transit rates anymore, by the 
              hour. So that's in place now and that applies for newer as well as 
              current hotels," said Mr Shanmugam, who is also the Second Minister for 
              Home Affairs. 
              <br> <br> The number of women picked up for vice in the area has also dropped 
              drastically over the years - from 400 in 2007, to less than 40 last 
              year.
              <br> <br> Last year, the police arrested some 7,600 female foreigners for 
              vice-related activities, up from the 5,000 the year before - mainly 
              because of stepped-up enforcement action.
              <br> <br> During the dialogue session, a resident asked if the authority will be 
              doing more to curb vice in outdoor refreshment areas. 
              <br> <br> Mr Shanmugam said it is simply not possible to push all businesses 
              indoors because some just don't have the space.
              <br> <br> He added that a practical and fairly strict approach has been taken 
              towards the outdoor refreshment areas.
              <br> <br> "We have been refusing applications for putting tables and chairs 
              outside wherever it's feasible to do so. It cannot be done in every 
              single establishment, but wherever it's feasible to do so we've been 
              doing that," said Mr Shanmugam. 
              <br> <br> During the hour-long forum, Mr Shanmugam also touched on issues such as 
              traffic in the Joo Chiat area and foreign workers. </span></p>
