              unharmed, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The ministry said on
               Saturday morning that Mr Vincent Toh was leading a group of 20 
              Singaporean tourists when they were intercepted by armed men while 
              travelling from Sinai to Cairo.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>MFA said the gunmen abducted him but did not harm the other Singaporeans, who arrived safely in Cairo.<br><br>Mr Toh was released a few hours later, with the assistance of the Egyptian authorities.<br><br>MFA said he was unharmed and is now staying at a hotel in El Arish, which is on the Mediterranean coast of northern Sinai.<br><br>A
               member of the staff from the Singapore Embassy, who has been working 
              closely with the Egyptian authorities, has been sent to accompany Mr Toh
               from El Arish to Cairo.<br><br>Mr Toh will fly home from Cairo.<br><br>MFA has notified his next-of-kin and said it would continue to provide the necessary assistance.<br><br>The
               ministry said in view of the current situation in the Sinai peninsula, 
              Singaporeans should avoid any overland travel to and within the Sinai 
              area.<br><br>Reports quoted Egyptian security officials as saying that 
              the armed gunmen are Bedouins, demanding the release of one of their 
              tribesmen arrested for possessing drugs.<br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>
