              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: In previous years when the market was flush with jobs,
              Ms Nur Azizah Bte Abdul Wahab might have been able to enter the
              workplace right after she graduated from the polytechnic.
              <br> <br>But this year, after a fruitless hunt for a job in a tight job
              market, Ms Nur Azizah - who has a diploma in electronic and computer
              engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) - decided to gear up with
              more skills, but in a different sector.
              <br> <br>"I sent out endless resumes for many different jobs in engineering,
              admin, logistics ... but I didn't get any of them," said the
              21-year-old. <br> <br> "So, when I heard about Ngee Ann's programme to help graduates and the
              specialist diplomas they were offering, I decided to take them up."
              <br> <br>Such programmes offered by the polytechnics - which NP specially
              enhanced this year to include internships - have been a boon for
              students looking to enhance their qualifications and their chances of
              landing a job in this difficult year. <br> <br> "I think it's an opportunity for me to try an industry with better
              employment prospects, and the internship will give me some work
              experience to add to my resume," said Ms Nur Azizah, who decided to
              take up a specialist diploma in Pharma and Biopharmaceutical
              Manufacturing. <br> <br> "Hopefully, the job market will look better in six months when I've completed the course."
              <br> <br> The polytechnics have seen interest for such programmes surge this
              year, although this could also be due to interest from other adult
              learners, as the specialist diploma courses are also open for
              applications from the public. <br> <br> At Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP), applications for its specialist and
              advanced diploma programmes have gone up by about 20 per cent compared
              to last year. <br> <br> It was "possible" that this was due to students opting to enhance their
              qualifications in a recession, said an NYP spokesperson. <br> <br> There was a "significant" increase at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) - 266
              per cent - for its new specialist diploma programmes, but this was not
              necessarily due to students choosing to further their studies due to
              the recession, TP said.
              <br> <br> Recent graduates who applied for the programmes agreed that such courses are a bonus. 
              <br> <br>"It's definitely something I will consider if I still can't find a
              job soon," said Ms Amanda Wong, 21, who graduated from Republic
              Polytechnic. "At least I can also pick up skills in a field that might
              be a growth area in future."
              <br> <br> Internships, part-time jobs for students 
              <br> <br>The polytechnics' efforts in helping graduates through the downturn
              have continued. NYP will launch a scheme to employ students in the
              school for industry projects, research and development, IT, finance and
              administration this month. <br> <br> TP has employed about 100 graduates in various part-time positions so
              far, and is in the middle of talks with companies to offer jobs and
              internship positions for its graduates. <br> <br> NP, which has planned to spend $900,000 on 50 jobs for graduates at the
              school, has offered 37 places so far, and received 32 applications. <br> <br> Four graduates have also applied for its scholarships for overseas undergraduate programmes, and all have been successful.
              <br> <br> About 20 companies have signed up to offer internship programmes, 11 of
              which have opted to tap on the school's $600,000 fund for companies
              which are finding it difficult to provide internship allowances. <br> <br> Said an NP spokesperson: "Considering the current economic conditions,
              we have made good progress in securing internships from more than 20
              companies."
              <br> <br>Total asset management company UGL Premas is one such company
              tapping on the fund. It said that the internship programme is an
              "avenue to identify graduates who wish to consider a career in this
              field to join us".
              <br> <br>"We will offer full-time employment to the interns if we find them
              suitable for any vacancies," said chief executive officer Anthony Seah.
