              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>BEIJING - Chinese 
              Premier Wen Jiabao pledged on Sunday to tackle public concerns such as 
              inflation, runaway growth, and corruption in an apparent bid to defuse a
               call for weekly rallies in 13 cities.<br><br>Answering questions from 
              Internet users in a web chat, Wen addressed a range of top national 
              concerns worrying the government, which has watched as similar issues 
              touched off political convulsions in the Middle East and North Africa.<br><br>"The
               purpose of our economic development is to meet the people's growing 
              material and cultural needs, and make the lives of commoners better and 
              better," Wen said.<br><br>He spoke after a mysterious online appeal 
              urged people to come out and press China's one-party communist rulers 
              for government transparency, free expression and to address other public
               worries each Sunday at 2pm (0600GMT).<br><br>Citizens have been urged 
              to gather for subtle "strolling" protests at designated sites in 13 
              cities, but the appeal made no call for overt political action.<br><br>At
               least 300 uniformed police guarded the entrance to the nominated 
              protest site in central Beijing on Sunday, in the Wangfujing shopping 
              street, but there was no sign of demonstrations.<br><br>Half an hour after the appointed time, police started clearing the area.<br><br>An
               AFP reporter earlier saw a line of military-style transport trucks 
              heading in the direction of the area, emblazoned with banners calling 
              for the maintenance of stability.<br><br>Authorities also earlier 
              erected giant blue barricades in front of a McDonald's in Wangfujing, 
              apparently to block access to the designated site.<br><br>The area is a 
              short walk from heavily policed Tiananmen Square, the scene of huge 
              pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989 that were crushed by the army.<br><br>A
               week ago, a heavy police presence was put in place in several cities 
              including Beijing and Shanghai for the first so-called "Jasmine rally" 
              -- a reference to the Tunisian "Jasmine" revolution.<br><br>Last week's events also appeared lightly attended and free of major incident.<br><br>The
               online protest call seen on overseas Chinese-language websites -- but 
              blocked by censors within China -- demanded that citizens be empowered 
              to supervise the secretive government to prevent abuses.<br><br>Wen said
               the government would respect the people's supervisory rights but he and
               other officials have made similar comments before and he gave no 
              details.<br><br>Wen also said the government would ramp up supplies of 
              housing, crack down on property speculation, ensure output of grains and
               other key goods, and punish those who hoard goods.<br><br>"Rapid price rises have affected the lives of the people and even social stability," he said.<br><br>Chinese
               inflation remained near two-year highs in January at 4.9 percent 
              despite a series of measures taken to dampen price rises, including 
              three interest rate hikes in the past four months.<br><br>Soaring food and housing costs have grabbed the headlines in China, which has a history of inflation-triggered public unrest.<br><br>Wen offered no significant new policy measures.<br><br>However,
               decrying runaway growth that has fuelled price rises and ravaged 
              China's environment, Wen announced Beijing had set an annual economic 
              growth target of seven percent for each of the next five years.<br><br>The
               government target had previously been set each year at eight percent, 
              saying it was the minimum growth necessary to keep creating jobs and 
              staving off unrest.<br><br>China's economy grew 10.3 percent in 2010, 
              marking the fastest annual pace since the onset of the global financial 
              crisis in 2008.<br><br>At Wangfujing, two dozen police cars and vans 
              were stationed near the shopping street's entrance. At least one 
              armoured riot police vehicle was also present, and officers walked large
               police dogs.<br><br>The district was crowded with shoppers as it usually is on weekends.<br><br>A
               police officer stopped an AFP photographer from entering the area, 
              saying he could not do so with his camera. Reporters were also asked for
               their IDs, and some tourists who did not have their passports with them
               were turned away.<br><br>With the annual session of China's 
              rubber-stamp parliament set to open next Saturday, authorities have 
              launched a sharp crackdown in the wake of the Arab unrest and the 
              Chinese protest call.<br><br>Police have levelled subversion charges 
              against several top activists for spreading the appeal for protests in 
              China, and many others have been detained or are missing, rights groups 
              have said.<br><br>China's Internet censors have blocked discussion of 
              the unrest in the Middle East as well as mention of the Chinese "Jasmine
               rally" call.<br><br>- AFP</span></span></p>
