              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam has said that 
              both Singapore and Malaysia have no interest in undermining the good 
              relations between both sides.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Responding to recent
               allegations that Singapore diplomats had actively participated in 
              Malaysia's Bersih 3.0 Rally in April, he said that some quarters in 
              Malaysia are clearly uncomfortable by the current good state of 
              relations between the two countries.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Mr Shanmugam reiterated that the allegations are false.<br><br>He
               said the Singapore officers were at the Bersih rally as impartial 
              observers, just like diplomats from more than 10 other countries.<br><br>He
               added it's regrettable that some elements in the Malaysian media and 
              blogs have chosen to focus only on Singapore and have deliberately tried
               to misrepresent the issue.<br><br>Some articles were inflammatory with a racial slant.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said the Malaysian government does not seem to share the same views.<br><br>"These
               articles suggest that the Malay community here can be persuaded to vote
               in a certain way. It's laughable because we have every confidence in 
              our fellow citizens," said Mr Shanmugam.<br><br>"I believe (it) does not
               reflect the (Malaysian) government's views, shows a dangerous 
              inclination to inject a racial angle into bilateral relationships, and 
              shows a continuing belief in some quarters that our Malay population can
               be targeted from outside. That is a deliberate provocation but we will 
              not be baited by these negative elements," he added.   <br><br>Mr Shanmugam said he spoke with his Malaysian counterpart Anifah Aman, over two separate phone calls.<br><br>He
               added Singapore and Malaysia have every intention of preserving the 
              positive bilateral relationship that both sides have worked hard to 
              build.<br><br>"We should also not allow any negative elements 
              uncomfortable with the current excellent state of bilateral ties to 
              spoil our relations," he said.    <br><br>Mr Shanmugam added that 
              bilateral ties have always been bigger than any specific disagreements 
              or points of contention, and this is how both sides should move forward 
              together. <br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
