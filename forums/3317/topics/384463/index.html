              <p>One correspondent ponders why his working visa was not renewed by the city-state.</p>
              <div id="content">
              <div id="article-wrapper">
              <p>Unfriendly reporters are jailed, assaulted or assassinated by the governments of Burma, Iran and Sri Lanka. Singapore, with pretensions to being a global "media hub", prefers tools of
              repression that are more subtle, yet have the same chilling effect on
              free speech. After a year as an accredited correspondent in the
              southeast Asian city-state, I was unexpectedly told last month that my
              employment visa would not be renewed.</p>
              <p>The government refused to disclose its reasons despite repeated requests and an appeal from the British High Commission. The Committee to Protect Journalists <a title="The Committee to Protect Journalists" href="http://www.cpj.org/"></a>(CPJ), a New York-based press freedom group, condemned the decision, saying that it "shows the Singapore<a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Singapore" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/singapore"></a> government's intolerance of independent and critical reporting". CPJ
              added that I was merely "the latest on a long list of foreign
              journalists who have been targeted by the government for their news
              coverage".</p>
              <p>Although I reported on some sensitive issues such as
              rising crime, the ageing population and business links with Burma, I
              did not break any of the taboos that normally lead to a government
              reprisal – namely criticising Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding father, or his son, the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong<a title="Lee Hsien Loong" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/10/creditcrunch-marketturmoil1"></a>.
              International publications that dare to hold Singapore's ruling caste
              to account tend to find themselves on the wrong side of a costly libel
              suit. In recent years, the Economist, the International Herald Tribune,
              the Wall Street Journal and, most recently, the soon-to-close Far
              Eastern Economic Review have all been forced to pay out hundreds of
              thousands of pounds in damages to the Lee family.</p>
              <p>While the
              international press is silenced through the courts, Singaporean
              journalists are cowed by the government's ownership of key stakes in
              all the country's daily newspapers and news broadcasters. The insidious
              practice of self-censorship is all-pervasive. One senior editor at a
              major international newspaper in Asia admitted that he line-edits every
              single story about Singapore for fear of upsetting the powers-that-be.</p>
              <p>A
              veteran foreign correspondent in Singapore insisted that it was
              possible to criticise the government "if one takes a subtle rather than
              confrontational approach and focuses on policy issues rather than
              personalities". But, fearful of jeopardising his employment visa, he
              was not prepared to speak on the record.</p>
