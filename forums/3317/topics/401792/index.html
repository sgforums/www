              <p>A rise in sick leave and lower productivity.</p>
              <p>That’s what employers are told to expect during the two-and-a- half 
              weeks of World Cup competition. <br> <br> Recruitment &amp; HR services specialists, Randstad, said because many 
              Singaporeans are passionate about football, the World Cup is likely to 
              have an impact beyond tired faces at the office. <br> <br> It said employees are likely to watch replays on their computers in the 
              office, have post match discussions, as well as participate in online 
              forums - particularly as the final approaches. <br> <br> Its Regional Director (Singapore &amp; Malaysia), Karin Clarke, said 
              businesses, especially those which are tightly resourced and still 
              trying to recover from the recent financial crisis, may find World Cup 
              Fever irritating and a major distraction. <br> <br> Instead of dampening people’s spirits and expressing their frustration, 
              she said it’s an ideal time for bosses to embrace the spirit of the 
              sport, and build employee morale through celebration and a culture of 
              teamwork. <br> <br> She said meetings, projects and deadlines may require flexibility or 
              rescheduling, particularly if the staff working on these projects are 
              passionate football fans. <br> <br> Temporary staff can fill the gaps where needed.</p>

              <p><strong>Employers can ensure balance between work and play during World Cup 
              month</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The World Cup is upon us with football fever gripping 
              most fans. In some cases, the enthusiasm could mean more medical leave 
              and absenteeism among staff as they catch the late night action on 
              television. </span></p>
              <p><span>And that spells a red card for employers, as productivity is 
              likely to suffer.
              <br> <br> Several matches in South Africa will air at a late hour in Singapore.
              <br> <br> With the final whistle coming in the wee hours of the morning, fans may 
              not have enough sleep.
              <br> <br> Taking urgent or medical leave could be an option, but not so if 
              employers can help balance work and play.
              <br> <br> Adecco is one such company.
              <br> <br> It decided to put in measures, to minimise any disruption following 
              their experience during the 2008 Euro Championships.
              <br> <br> Foong Wei Liang, talent attraction manager, Adecco Personnel, said: "The
               company does not want us to call in at the last minute and say that 'I 
              cannot wake up' or 'sorry I am sick' but rather they let us plan ahead 
              our leave and make sure we are not having any big projects or our leave 
              doesn't clash with one another.
              <br> <br> "Everything is being well-planned and we will have our task covered by 
              someone else during this period."
              <br> <br> Being a HR consultancy, Adecco even has tips for other employers, like 
              having open communication channels.
              <br> <br> Network Courier has its own solutions.
              <br> <br> During the last World Cup, it arranged for staff to watch the matches in
               the office.
              <br> <br> This year, the company with 177 staff, is going a step further.
              <br> <br> V S Kumar, managing director, Network Courier, said: "I have subscribed 
              for this football channel and it will be recorded in the night in my 
              house and my despatch riders and drivers can come back to my house in 
              the evening, after their work to watch their games."
              <br> <br> Jeffrey Adinan, driver, Network Courier, said: "It's because of the 
              driver safety precaution. If we watch overnight it is not safe for us 
              because we have not enough sleep and rest."
              <br> <br> Besides catching the action, there will also be food and drinks and some
               staff-bonding.
              <br> <br> Employers are not the only ones who could suffer during the World Cup. 
              Stock markets are expected to be down and wives and girlfriends will see
               less of their boyfriends and husbands during this one-month period.  -
