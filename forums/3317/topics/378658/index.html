              <p>LONDON (AFP) - – The British government is
              to sell off 16 billion pounds (25.4 billion dollars, 17.2 billion
              euros) worth of state assets, Prime Minister Gordon Brown was to say on
              Monday in an attempt to reduce the national debt.</p>
              <p>The announcement is to be made in a keynote speech setting out Brown's vision for "enduring and sustainable growth."</p>
              <p>An
              initial sale of assets including the Channel Tunnel, the government's
              33 percent stake in European uranium consortium URENCO, the Tote
              bookmakers, the Dartford bridge and tunnel under the River Thames, and
              the Student Loans Company, was expected to raise some three billion
              pounds.</p>
              <p>The country is still mired in recession and has a forecast deficit this year of 175 billion pounds.</p>
              <p>The
              opposition Conservatives, who are well ahead in the opinion polls with
              a general election due by June, set out their plans last week for
              tackling the debt problem.</p>
              <p>Brown wants to halve Britain's deficit over the next four years and is bidding to reclaim the initiative for the Labour Party.</p>
              <p>"We
              also need a deficit reduction plan that supports growth and jobs, not
              one that snuffs out recovery before it has started," Brown was to say.</p>
              <p>The government will also sell off surplus real estate as market conditions improve.</p>
              <p>In a clear dig at the Conservatives, Brown was to attack their plans for dragging Britain out of recession.</p>
              <p>He
              was to say: "A vital contributor to sustainable public finances is
              growth. Restoring public finance sustainability must be done in a way
              that supports growth not destroys it. The failure to do so is the real
              risk of a lost decade of austerity.</p>
              <p>"A reduction in growth of
              one percent next year would raise the deficit by half a percent next
              year and even more in subsequent years, adding to the future debt
              burden.</p>
              <p>"The resulting impact on the debt burden could be more than five percent of gross domestic product after 10 years."</p>
              <p>A
              Conservative spokesman said: "As any family knows, selling off things
              helps in the short-term and, given the state the country is in, is
              probably necessary but it is no substitute for a long-term plan to get
              the country to live within its means."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Brown said he
              would propose a "new European strategy for growth and jobs" when
              European Union leaders meet in Brussels on 29-30 October, saying the
              continent's economies needed restructuring.</p>
              <p>"Britain will push
              to step up work on an EU-Indian trade deal and seek a rapid conclusion
              of talks on an EU-Korean trade deal -- which alongside our ambition to
              increase exports to China and the rest of Asia -- could be worth
              billions to the UK," he was to say.</p>
              <p>"We will also push for further action to reduce barriers to trade in services within the EU itself.</p>
              <p>"Britain
              must also use all its influence in Europe to ensure that an
              outward-looking EU is part of the solution to the world's economic
              challenges, not part of the problem."</p>
              <p>Brown was also to pledge
              to "intensify our attack on tax evasion and tax havens," and launch a
              new drive to boost apprenticeships in a bid to enhance the skills base
              of the workforce.</p>
