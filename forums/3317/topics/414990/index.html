              'indispensable elite' must have decreed that all Singaporeans below the 
              rank of 'Cabinet Minister' need COMPULSORY OBEDIENCE TRAINING.<br> They must be taught a stiff lessons for any non-compliance with 
              government directives any less then to the T; no mercy will be granted, 
              local MP appeals not withstanding.<br> They must never betray the govt line that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">'...  countries worldwide respect and admire Singapore's proven system'</a>,
               where all opposition (by commission or omission) to state agenda would 
              be severely 'fixed'; (for the politically obedient, they will continue 
              to be rewarded financially for their voluntary 'cooperation') <img class="inlineimg" title="Wink" src="http://forums.asiaone.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""> .<br> As Mr Brown rightly sings in 'Forever Young': <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Y_tfHOZT4&amp;#t=20s">"..

If 
              ICA was the least bit concerned about Mr Ogawa's citizenship status, it 
              would have made greater efforts at contacting him as well as liaise with
               the SAF about Mr Ogawa's service status and liabilities; in addition 
              ICA being Singapore's  principle immigration authority, ought to have 
              close ties with the embassies of all countries located here, not least 
              the <a href="http://www.sg.emb-japan.go.jp/events_ASPC_13-10-10.htm">Embassy of Japan</a>, with which it could have clarified with regarding the true status of Mr Ogawa's citizenship had he not performed his '<a href="http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=134">ORAL'</a> by age 22. It remains unfortunate that the ICA, being the operator of 
              checkpoints around Singapore, was unable to contact Mr Ogawa for over 1 
              year despite the significance of the issue at hand; besides dismaying 
              the poor lad with refused passport request also summarily dismissed his 
              local MP's appeal, the standard reply being:  <a href="http://kusokun.livejournal.com/2371.html">"rejected due to a no provision law"</a>.<br> - Mr Ogawa, having received his reservist NS posting letter in Aug2010 
              was after all an active NSman doing his part to defend this small 
              nation.<br> - Why weren't Mr Ogawa's 15yrs of residence in Singapore, his completed 
              2yrs of full time national service, his efforts at renouncing his 
              Japanese citizenship, his mother's Singapore citizenship, his currently 
              active NS-man commitments, the bouncing of ICA's 2nd reminder, (ditto 
              the first as Mr Ogawa alleges), the alleged wrongful advice given to Mr 
              Ogawa's and the mere 2 month delay in application taken into 
              consideration in Mr Ogawa's appeal to reinstate his Singaporean 
              citizenship?<br> - Why did ICA dismiss MP Mr Lee Boon Yang's, Mr Ogawa's local MP's appeal on behalf of his constituent with the standard reply: <a href="http://kusokun.livejournal.com/2371.html">"rejected due to a no provision law"</a>?<br> - Why then did Mr Ogawa get so desperate that he had to seek the help of
               a Ministerial level MP (the one who originally awarded him his 
              citizenship)- Mr Heng Chee How for the purpose of a second appeal to the
               ICA [through SM Goh CT(<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TNhcYEOlzKI/AAAAAAAAAPw/ZVgcFRml4eE/s1600/Gordonator-+Identity-+Response+by+Ogawa+Ryuju+%2825Oct2010,+10.14pm%29-box.JPG">see red box</a>)], with the revelation of his predicament hitting <a href="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs449.ash2/72248_104592306276881_100001783366425_28639_6971782_n.jpg">front page tabloid news</a>?<br> - Perhaps our 'puppet master' leaders might want to explain why a simple
               reminder phone call to Citizen Mr Ogawa from ICA would be too much to 
              expect, in lieu of bounced reminder letters, given the rights, roles and
               responsibilities that a Singapore citizenship entails; noting that  <a href="http://kusokun.livejournal.com/2371.html">"rejected due to a no provision law"</a> might sometimes happen?.<br> - Was Mr Ogawa's omission such a heinous crime that for lack of the <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TNhcYEOlzKI/AAAAAAAAAPw/ZVgcFRml4eE/s1600/Gordonator-+Identity-+Response+by+Ogawa+Ryuju+%2825Oct2010,+10.14pm%29-box.JPG">Senior Minister GohCT's direction</a>, a stateless but loyal Mr Ogawa would most probably have to <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20101108-246249.html">report annually to the ICA for a 'special pass' to be renewed</a>;
               continue NS and defending Singapore whilst his citizenship remains 
              hanging in the the balance at the mercy of the ICA administrative 
              rigmarole of:<a href="http://kusokun.livejournal.com/2371.html">"rejected due to a no provision law"</a>?<br> <br> Why the impenetrable red tape- a citizen's despair that that only the 
              directions of 'Senior Minister' (ranked 2nd highest in rank by cabinet <a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/misc/clippings/web/mstr0.jpg">remuneration</a>) can cut?<br> <br> Does the Singapore leadership really have the interest of the average citizen at heart, then where lies compassion?<br> <br> Perhaps Singaporeans need to be more convinced that the Singapore 
              citizenship besides being rigidly defined by roles and responsibilities,
