              <p>Hi all, I followed the thai teenager incident at our MRT station closely. The manner that the young soul reacted to her mishap was admirable. The way on how anonymous singaporeans stepped forward and donate generously was in no way less commendable. To see the case going to court however, is truly unfortunate.</p>
              <p>Many talked about the $5K that SMRT gave, and the subjectivity of the appropriateness of the sum caused many debates. Should we put things in perspective and examine the case objectively, since it is now a high court case, i cannot see how SMRT can be successfully sued for any negligence. I am eager to find out the findings from the CCTV, and I guess that will put an end to many emotional ranting. I believe the police have seen it, and I read from the papers that the father had seen it. Very soon, we will know the integrity of the whole incident. Personally I feel that we have a solid public transport system that has not improve enough over the last 5 years to meet the rise in population and commuting demand. This shows how effective the communication was between the ministries and hopefully with the recent cabinet shake-up, things can finally progress faster.</p>
              <p>coming back, I do understand from a Law term - occupiers' liability, that SMRT can be sued if it has not taken good care of its premises. People falling off from faulty escalators within the station, slipping over puddle of water that was left behind by the station cleaners, or hurt from spalling ceiling tiles can sue SMRT with valid reasons. IF the CCTV footage shows the thai dame falling over the yellow line like someone who suddenly lost consciousness, I'm afraid we do not have much of a case here.</p>

              <p>RAIL operator SMRT yesterday broke its silence on how it has helped 
              the Thai teenager who lost both her legs after landing on an MRT track 
              and being hit by a train.</p>
              <p>The father of 15-year-old Nitcharee Peneakchanasak, Mr Kittanesh Peneakchanasak, 56, is suing SMRT for negligence on her behalf.</p>
              <p>SMRT had earlier declined to comment on media reports that quoted Mr 
              Peneakchanasak as expressing disappointment over the $5,000 he said the 
              rail operator had offered as compensation. Relating what had happened so
               far, SMRT said that following the incident on April 3, it immediately 
              began looking at how it could help Nitcharee and her family.</p>
              <p>'We were mindful of the special circumstances surrounding 
              the case: A young girl who was alone in Singapore was seriously hurt, 
              and needed her family by her side as she sought to overcome the trauma 
              and recuperate.'</p>
              <p>To facilitate her family travelling to Singapore to be with 
              her, SMRT said it offered 'an initial financial support' of $10,000 to 
              cover the expenses incurred during their journey and stay here. 'Our 
              help was meant to be a goodwill gesture, not compensation,' it said. It 
              added that this was clearly indicated to the father in their meeting and
               he 'accepted our offers of help'.</p>
              <p>Following an appeal by him through the Thai Embassy for 
              further help, SMRT provided a further assistance of $5,000 at the end of
               last month, it said.</p>

              <p>In the past 24 years that the MRT has been in operation for the
              above ground stations, how many cases have there been of people
              accidentally falling into the path of incoming trains because the
              platform was overcrowded due to the fact there are no platform
              doors?</p>
              <p>There is a higher chance of people falling into the path of an
              incoming bus at any given bus stop because of the fact there are no
              yellow lines, and platform doors. Perhaps, the authorities should
              look into the possibility of erecting platform doors for bus
              stops.</p>
