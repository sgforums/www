                  <p>THE family of the Thai teenager who lost both legs following a
                  horrific accident at the Ang Mo Kio MRT station in April is suing
                  SMRT for $3.4 million.</p>
                  <p>The writ filed in the High Court here was served yesterday on
                  the transport operator, which confirmed that it had received
                  it.</p>

                  Great! Sue the pants off to this irresponsible and hypocrite company. I hope the family will win the lawsuit and get the money. 
                  SMRT can earn millions of dollars but so stingy to pay a victim who was permanently disabled due to their medicore operations. They think they can get away with just SGD5000 only and treat then like they are beggers. 
                  If can't successfully sue them in Singapore, sue them in the international court. Let the whole world know.

              Good, clean and efficient? I seriously doubt so, especially in their bus and cab operations. Not to mention the increasing number of breakdowns on MRT in the recent years. 
              Cheap, maybe because LTA and PTC set the prices, not SBST and SMRT. But SMRT is also very eager to ask for fare increases for the last few years, which luckily PTC had rejected.
              
              Tight on budget? They can pay millions to shareholders up there, but do not even want to pay enough to provide decent service standards. They are not tight on budget, they just don't know their priorities.

              But that doesn't mean that they can be so irresponsible for the tragedy and pay a measly 5k to the victim. 
              They may not be totally at fault but they are very slow in building these barricades. Moreover what are their service staffs doing at the platforms?

              If they really dare to bring their mistakes down to the commuters, then they have prepare to face more crtisims.
              If they are really sincere about the whole incident, shred a few millions from the shareholders' payouts to pay for this mistake. Else stop being being a hypocate in marketing their image.
