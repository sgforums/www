                      If this incident is put into your own shoes, won't you not be angry?
                      Firstly they only compensate a mere 5k for the victim which is barely not enough to cover the medical expenses. Looking at such stinginess, aren't you not angry as well, if you are the victim or the next of kin? Now they are only asking the payout that is sufficient enough for her wholelife expenses for the artificial legs and other related medical costs, and they are still not unreasonable to ask for more like damages charges, lifetime life expenses, etc. If SMRT initially had offered something more reasonable in the first place, would they reject and initiate a lawsuit for a more reasonable compensation? 
                      SMRT is very keen to pay millions of shareholders' shares every year but when it comes to mistakes like this, they only give a mere 5k for a crippled girl who has to live with it for the rest of her life. 3.4 million to compensate a mistake is nothing as compared to the millions they pay to shareholders. 
                  
                  This has certainly show what kind of company it is.

                  Go read in the internet. This is simply a reasonable case for such kind of injuries. They even stated how much they are going to spend for her medical fees for the nest few decades.
                  There are very extreme cases out in other countries. Some don't even come with injuries, yet have to compensate them with emotional and pshycological charges.

                 Go and laugh all you want. If this incident happens on you, see what you will be actually saying.
                  I think the father sues because he is unhappy with the mere 5k payout, not because he really want to sue initially. After the incident at first, the family didn't even ask for any compensations. SMRT is seriously not sincere in compensating. If they are really sincere, they should have given out a more reasonable sum at first,  even a sum good enough for 1 to 2 years of the medical costs will be good, no need for lifetime.

              If every company is to show such rigidness and uncompassions, sooner or later, the business will just go down the drain. Afterall, business is run by humans, not robots. 
              Such kinds of compensation don't require much from such big organisations. Afterall, it is the long term reputation that counts, not just about short term money and savings all the time. 
              Modern corporate environments don't just emphasize on profits and profits only anymore. They also have to be responsible to its people, environment and society. Hence the term, corporate responsibility, and something SMRT is seriously lack in.

              Yes - good point. The amount offered was probably given as a token of goodwill. Nothing in the world is risk free and we all accept some form of risk in our daily lives. With all the publicity of people falling onto mrt tracks, people should know to stand away from the tracks if they are unwell. Its not right that her father is demanding compensation.

              <p><br>SMRT knew that without the glass door it is a hazard to stand on the platform especially during peak hour when the train arrive. Yet they choose to take their own sweet time to erect the glass door so they are liable for the safety of the commuters.</p>
              <p>If erecting the glass door causes ventilation problem, SMRT can easily install some ventilator.</p>
              <p>If these happen to anyone in regardles of nationality, they will also sue SMRT and maybe more than $3.4 mil.</p>
              <p>SMRT need to wake up and provide better transportation service in term of safety, less conjestion and shorter waiting time for commuters. LTA also need to ensure all transportation company does the same for all commuters using public transport.</p>
