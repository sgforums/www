              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Rotary E-Club of Singapore presented on Wednesday
               a cheque for S$45,022 to Tan Tock Seng Hospital -- the amount racked up
               by 14-year-old Thai girl Nitcharee Peneakchanasak, who lost both her 
              legs in an MRT accident.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ms Nitcharee was hit by a train in April at Ang Mo Kio MRT station after she was believed to have fallen onto the tracks.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The cheque was handed over by the club's president Budi Soehardi, who was joined by various members of the club. <br><br>The money comes from a S$50,000 donation made by an anonymous Singaporean property tycoon based in Hong Kong.<br><br>The donor said he was impressed by Ms Nitcharee's cheerful disposition when he saw her story on Channel NewsAsia.<br><br>The balance of about S$5,000 will be donated to the girl on June 30.<br><br>Reports said the girl's family is suing SMRT for S$3.4 million and their lawyer has filed a writ in the High Court.<br><br>It
               is understood prosthetic legs cost more than S$100,000 and the girl

              <p><strong>Thai girl's accident: Dad asks more questions</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The father of the Thai girl who lost her legs in a 
              freak MRT accident in Singapore maintained he did not know the S$15,000 
              given to him by SMRT was meant as goodwill.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Kittanesh 
              Peneakchanasak, who is back in Thailand, told MediaCorp on Thursday he 
              learned he would receive S$10,000 initially. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He said he still does not know when he can receive this sum, which is with the Thai foreign affairs ministry.<br><br>Mr Kittanesh added he is unaware if compensation will be made after SMRT concluded its investigation. <br><br>He asked why investigation was still on-going despite the accident taking place almost three months ago.<br><br>Mr
               Kittanesh's daughter, 15-year-old Nitcharee Peneakchanasak, fell onto 
              the train tracks in Ang Mo Kio MRT station and was hit by a train in 
              April.<br><br>In a media statement on Monday, the SMRT said it had given
               S$10,000 as "initial financial support" and a subsequent S$5,000 as a 
              goodwill gesture to Mr Kittanesh. <br><br>It added it was "surprised" to learn Mr Kittanesh regarded the money as a form of compensation.<br><br>The Royal Thai Embassy here also said it has explained to Mr Kittanesh the money was not meant to be compensation.<br><br>Mr
               Kittanesh has, however, rejected the S$5,000 and has since filed a 
              lawsuit against the SMRT claiming S$3.4 million in damages. <br><br>Speaking
               to MediaCorp, he said the S$10,000 given to him is a very small amount 
              compared to how his daughter "lost her legs and her future".<br><br>During
               his recent trip here to visit her, Mr Kittanesh had said he chalked up 
              about 400,000 to 500,000 Thai baht (S$16,000 to S$20,000) in expenses.<br><br>Miss
               Nitcharee has since reportedly received more than S$400,000 from 
              donors, excluding a S$50,000 donation from an anonymous Singaporean 
              property tycoon based in Hong Kong. <br><br>The S$50,000 donation was used to offset her hospitalisation bills.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>If position is reserved, SG people were to fell into their Thailand skytrain, you think their garhmen or king will pay money?
