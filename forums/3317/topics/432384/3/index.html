              <p>My ang mo friends says more and more singaporeans have a "taji blame 
              and taji responsibility" mentality. This statement was proven by some of
               the posts in this thread. haiz....</p>
              <p>Everyone is responsible for 
              himself, be it career, health, safety, etc. It is no fault of SMRT that 
              the thai girl lose her leg. It is an accident, not through anyone's 
              neligence. If she had slip and fall and lose a leg when walking along 
              the pavement at a park, do she sue National Parks Board? If she had 
              fainted and fell off her bicycle and lost her leg while riding, do she 
              sue the bicycle company? In this issue, she lose her legs at SMRT. There
               were no neligence whatsoever on SMRT.</p>
              <p>Regards to installing 
              doors, it is an additional safety feature. It is not a legal 
              requirement. It is not a legal requirement if you were to start and 
              build a train station. It is only a recommendation made by the review 
              board after cases of injury/jumping off into the track.</p>
              <p>$5000 is a goodwill gesture to the thai gal. It's her father who got the picture wrong. </p>
              <p>Someone
               spoke about the law. I believe he or she is refering to the Law of 
              Torts aka on reasonable neligence. There is no neligence on SMRT.</p>
              <p>But
               the bigger story here is the number of singaporeans pushing blame to 
              larger organisations. I am saddened to see people complaining that SMRT 
              should have put in the doors, SMRT should have widen the yellow line 
              areas, etc. No wonder I keep hearing the line "Singaporeans are a 
              complaining lot".</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is the influence by the west on 
              interpreting and pushing legal obligations to the extreme. Perhaps it is
               the weakness of our newer generation whom are unable to accept 
              responbilities. Perhaps it is our style of governance or perhaps it is 
              our style of finding someone to accuse when something goes wrong.</p>
              <p>I
               have no idea what spore will become say 15 years from now when this 
              generation of kids, who are totally immersed in this taji mindset from 
              primary school, takes over the country.</p>

              <p>Everyone is responsible for himself, be it career, health, safety, etc. It is no fault of SMRT that the thai girl lose her leg. It is an accident, not through anyone's neligence. If she had slip and fall and lose a leg when walking along the pavement at a park, do she sue National Parks Board? If she had fainted and fell off her bicycle and lost her leg while riding, do she sue the bicycle company? In this issue, she lose her legs at SMRT. There were no neligence whatsoever on SMRT.</p>
              <p>Regards to installing doors, it is an additional safety feature. It is not a legal requirement. It is not a legal requirement if you were to start and build a train station. It is only a recommendation made by the review board after cases of injury/jumping off into the track.</p>
              <p>$5000 is a goodwill gesture to the thai gal. It's her father who got the picture wrong. </p>
              <p>Someone spoke about the law. I believe he or she is refering to the Law of Torts aka on reasonable neligence. There is no neligence on SMRT.</p>
              <p>But the bigger story here is the number of singaporeans pushing blame to larger organisations. I am saddened to see people complaining that SMRT should have put in the doors, SMRT should have widen the yellow line areas, etc. No wonder I keep hearing the line "Singaporeans are a complaining lot".</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is the influence by the west on interpreting and pushing legal obligations to the extreme. Perhaps it is the weakness of our newer generation whom are unable to accept responbilities. Perhaps it is our style of governance or perhaps it is our style of finding someone to accuse when something goes wrong.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what spore will become say 15 years from now when this generation of kids, who are totally immersed in this taji mindset from primary school, takes over the country.</p>

              <p>Blame is justified if its reasonable, which I understand can be subjective. Blame (unfortunately) can also make some people responsible in instances where they have not been and they should have.</p>
              <p>In this instance, I don't think any party is to be blamed. It was an accident...based on reports at least. I don't know anything about the legal side of things, but I think SMRT's $5K gesture was out of goodwill...which is better than a kick in the teeth. I dunno what the father plans to pursue with lawyers and I don't necessarily agree with the concept, but can understand why he is doing what he is given the events. Maybe its a case of finding any loop-holes and getting what they can out of it to 'soften' their financial situation?</p>
              <p>To cover their behinds, SMRT and other organisations should protect themselves from potential gold-diggers from a legal point of view if they haven't alreay done so. Its a sad neccessity.</p>
