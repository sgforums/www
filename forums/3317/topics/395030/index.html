              <p><strong>Sunshine Empire founder tells court he never intended to cheat</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Founder of the now-defunct multi-level marketing 
              company, Sunshine Empire, took the stand in court on Monday. </span></p>
              <p><span>James Phang Wah, who has been charged with fraud, falsifying 
              accounts and criminal breach of trust, told the court he never intended 
              to cheat anyone.
              <br> <br> He said he spent a long time studying how to make a multi-level 
              marketing company work.
              <br> <br> 49-year-old Phang said he had often tried to explain to his members that
               there are no guaranteed returns.
              <br> <br> He said they were determined by Sunshine Empire's profit.
              <br> <br> Phang faces 20 charges involving some S$3.5 million, while his wife Neo 
              Kuon Huay faces seven charges amounting to about S$700,000.
              <br> <br> The company's ex-director Jackie Hoo Choon Cheat faces 10 charges that 
              involve more than S$900,000.
              <br> <br> Phang said after he suffered a S$6-million loss in investments in 
              Indonesia, he went behind the scenes and worked as a consultant, helping
               students to set up multi-level marketing companies.
              <br> <br> Even though Phang is the founder of Sunshine Empire, he said his roles 
              in the company are as consultant and manager.
              <br> <br> However, the prosecution said Phang played a big role in setting the 
              direction of the company, as the top management paid great attention to 
              his words.

              <p><strong>'There was nothing sinister'</strong></p>
              <p>THE founder of Sunshine Empire, which allegedly operated a 
              multimillion-dollar scam, denied it was a fraudulent business.</p>
              <p>James Phang Wah, 49, maintained this when cross-examined by Deputy 
              Public Prosecutor Aedit Abdullah in court on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The prosecution had alleged that the firm's business was not
               sustainable as it had no substantial source of income except for the 
              sale of its lifestyle packages, which would increase the costs of 
              rebates as there would be more customers.</p>
              <p>Phang disagreed and said that the total costs did not amount
               to 50 per cent. He had also delayed payment of his consultancy fee for 1
               1/2 years until October 2007, and even then, the US$5 million (S$7 
              million) he received did not amount to the agreed 5 per cent of sales 
              turnover. He told the court that there was nothing sinister or illegal 
              about Sunshine's business.</p>
              <p>Also on trial with Phang are the firm's president Jackie Hoo
               Choon Cheat, 29, and Phang's wife Neo Kuon Huay, 46, who was described 
              as the group sales director.</p>
              <p>Hoo is also accused of receiving about $950,000 by abetting 
              Phang in criminal breach of trust, while Neo is said the have falsified 
              payment vouchers to receive nearly $1 million in commissions.</p>
              <p>Hoo is expected to testify next.</p>

              <p>In the Sunshine Empire thread in the MLM forum, I repeatedly asked a very simple question:</p>
              <p>'What does Sunshine Empire do to earn profits? Does it provide goods and services, or does it invest the money of its clients?'</p>
              <p>All I got was all sorts of weird answers that said a lot without answering my question.</p>
              <p>I sure would like the prosecution to ask that question in court during the cross-examination.</p>

              <p><strong>Sunshine Empire founder says wife entitled to profits</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The case involving multi-level marketing firm Sunshine 
              Empire continued in court on Tuesday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Its founder James Phang said his wife Neo Kuon Huay had rightful 
              claim over some S$1 million because she was the company's sales 
              director.
              <br> <br> Neo was allegedly unaware of this.
              <br> <br> Phang said he had not told her because he did not want to distract her 
              from her work. 
              <br> <br> Neo has been charged with falsifying payment vouchers, but Phang 
              testified that as sales director, she was entitled to one per cent of 
              the company's profits.
              <br> <br> The case resumes on Wednesday.
              <br> <br> James Phang and his business partner Jackie Hoo Choon Cheat have been 
              charged with fraud.
              <br> <br> Phang faces some 20 charges involving about S$3.5 million, while the 
              company's ex-director Hoo faces 10 charges involving over S$900,000.

              <p><strong>Sunshine Empire planned to develop online shopping site</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The ex-director of now-defunct multi-level marketing 
              company Sunshine Empire took the stand in court on Wednesday, and said 
              the company had intended to develop its online shopping platform e-mall 
              into a profit-making business like eBay. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, it was aborted after a raid by the Commercial Affairs 
              Department.
              <br> <br> 29-year-old Jackie Hoo said Sunshine Empire had long-term plans for its 
              e-mall.
              <br> <br> It was to be a single platform for shopping, auctions and advertising.
              <br> <br> He said Sunshine Empire was not worried the platform would be 
              under-used, as it had a large database of members' information, and sold
               thousands of products.
              <br> <br> When the defence counsel asked the number of members registered under 
              e-mall, Hoo said it was "in the thousands", but was unsure of the actual
               figure.
              <br> <br> Hoo faces 10 charges for fraud, failing to keep proper accounting 
              records and criminal breach of trust, involving about S$940,000.
              <br> <br> The trial continues Thursday.

              <p><strong>Ex-director says Sunshine Empire flourished with multi-level marketing</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The trial involving Sunshine Empire continued Thursday,
               with ex-director Jackie Hoo Choon Cheat telling the court that the 
              company struggled to survive after he was appointed director. </span></p>
              <p><span>He said after the company adopted a new client-to-client concept, 
              it had a large volume of transactions on its online portal E-mall.
              <br> <br> This brought in millions of US dollars.
              <br> <br> 29-year-old Hoo said in the first four months that he was with Sunshine 
              Empire, the company had to take loans from banks to continue operating.
              <br> <br> He said the wife of Sunshine Empire's founder, Neo Kuon Huay, had also 
              paid for the company's operating costs out of her own pocket, but he was
               unsure of the actual amount.
              <br> <br> Hoo said he did not receive any complaints from members, but some 
              members had asked for refunds.
              <br> <br> He admitted that their reported returns had helped to attract members, 
              but added that members should understand there are no guaranteed 
              returns.
              <br> <br> Hoo also altered his statement in court. He said he had actually told 
              managers of other companies that Neo was the group sales director, and 
              this was not only known to him and Sunshine Empire founder James Phang 
              Wah.
