              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manhunt for Standard Chartered bank robber at Holland Village</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: A manhunt is underway at Holland Village, as police investigate a robbery that took place at Standard Chartered Bank on Thursday (Jul 7) morning.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Channel NewsAsia understands that the suspect made off with S$30,000 from the Standard Chartered branch, and was not armed at the time.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The branch was closed after the incident. In a statement, a bank spokesperson said all employees and customers are safe. The bank said it filed a police report immediately, and is working with the police on investigations. Police earlier confirmed that they are investigating a robbery at the bank which took place at 11.25am. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>When Channel NewsAsia arrived at the scene at around 2pm, the area was cordoned off and police officers were seen inside the bank.</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>A Mediacorp hotline caller said police officers had stopped him and asked if he had seen a Caucasian male wearing a cap. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Eyewitnesses told Channel NewsAsia that as many as 15 police cars were outside the bank after the incident.</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>Ms Yolande Dick, a teacher, said she was turned away from the branch. "I came down to take some money out as I am going overseas," she said. "There was a man standing outside the gated-off area and he told me that the bank was closed. He didn't say till what time but I'm sure it's going to be a long process for them to investigate."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Security officer Benny Bek, who works across the road from Holland Village said he knew something was wrong when he saw "five or six" police cars. "I was going for my lunch break at around noon and wanted to buy a drink from the Holland Village market. I thought it was a terrorist attack at first but then I saw the news online and realised it was a robbery," he said. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>At about 3pm, officers were seen extending the cordon to the neighbouring HSBC bank branch and the Park @ Holland Village cafe.</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>Police presence was also seen along Jalan Rumia and Jalan Merah Saga in the Chip Bee Gardens estate across the road from the bank. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>An eyewitness, Dr Ang Seng Bin was on his way to Chip Bee Gardens for some dessert on his day off. He said he counted at least 10 police cars as he drove by the area. He said: "At 1.30pm, when I was walking over to the Holland Village side, I saw that the whole area (around Standard Chartered Bank) had been cordoned off. Shortly after that, when I went back to my car which was on the Chip Bee side, I saw the police knocking on the doors of the landed houses". </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Some plainclothes policemen were seen going through bins along Jalan Rumia. </div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>Bank robberies are rare in Singapore. In November 2008, a man dressed as a woman attempted to rob a United Overseas Bank branch at City Plaza on Geylang Road. </div>

              <p>1. This case very weird.</p>
                  <p>2. Have to check CCTVs along the roads.</p>
                  <p>2a. I guess got car waiting for the robber to help him escape.</p>
                  <p>2b. Otherwise, identify the bus or taxi that the robber used to escape.</p>
                  <p>3. Trace the bus/taxi/car.</p>
                  <p>and so on.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>It's likely that the police already found the robber. After all, today is 2016.</p>
                  <p>Who the fuck robs the bank in 2016? Stupid.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standard Chartered robber fled to Bangkok, stayed in budget hostel </span></strong></p>
              <p>The man who robbed a Standard Chartered Bank branch in Holland Village of $30,000 has been caught.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He had stayed three nights in a backpacker hostel in Bangkok before he was arrested by Royal Thai Police.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Canadian national David James Roach, 26, is believed to have taken a cab to Changi Airport and fled to Thailand after committing the crime at 11.30am on July 7, reported Shin Min Daily News.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Roach is believed to have purchased the airplane ticket prior to committing the crime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He arrived at a budget hostel in Bangkok before 10pm that same day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One day after the robbery, Singapore Police requested to extradite the suspect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On July 9, Thai police managed to locate his whereabouts and arrested him the next day, the Chinese daily reported. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During his stay, Roach opted to share a room with other backpackers, paying between $16 and $20 each day, Shin Min Daily News quoted a source as saying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He had to switch rooms daily as he did not have a reservation and rooms were limited.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Thai police questioned him, he did not say anything beyond demanding to meet an officer from the Canadian embassy, said Major General Apichart Suriboonya, who heads Thailand's Interpol unit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As his arrest took place on Sunday, the embassy was closed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maj-Gen Apichart told The Straits Times he was not sure whether an embassy representative had since got in touch with police.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Roach, who was born in Australia, is currently being detained at the Immigration Detention Centre. His tourist visa has been cancelled by Thai authorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore has requested to extradite the suspect to Singapore and is waiting for approval from Thai authorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While Roach has spent some of the money, the bulk of it was recovered.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standard Chartered robbery suspect refusing to cooperate: Thai police chief</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>BANGKOK: The man suspected of robbing Standard Chartered's Holland Village branch is refusing to cooperate, said Thai police chief Jaktip Chaijinda on Wednesday (Jul 13).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Speaking to the media after questioning the suspect, Mr Chaijinda said he refused to talk and requested for a lawyer to be present. He added that less than S$30,000, some notes and a notebook were found at the scene during the arrest of the Canadian, whose identity has been confirmed by Thai officials as 27-year-old David James Roach.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Based on investigations, Roach arrived in Bangkok alone and he was supposed to transfer the stolen money somewhere else, Mr Chaijinda said, adding that the suspect's right to stay has been revoked under the country's immigration law.  </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>On releasing the suspect into Singapore's custody, Mr Chaijinda said: "We have no extradition treaty with Singapore, Singapore may have to discuss with Canada."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>However, he also said that the police are liaising with Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General's Office and authorities in Singapore about extraditing Roach. </div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>The suspect, who is currently being detained in Bangkok's Suan Plu Immigration Detention Centre, allegedly robbed S$30,000 from the bank on Jul 7.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He fled to Bangkok on the same day shortly after the crime was reported, and he was arrested by Thai police on Jul 10 at a hostel in Bangkok's Pratunam district.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Interpol Bangkok head Police-Major General Apichat Suriboonya told Channel NewsAsia on Tuesday that Singapore had sent an extradition request to Thailand's Attorney General's Office and that the request is being processed.<br> </div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">StanChart robber looks 'relaxed', healthy at Thai detention centre: Officials</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>BANGKOK: The man suspected of robbing a Standard Chartered bank branch in Singapore - who is currently being held in Bangkok's Immigration Detention Centre - looks "relaxed" and has been taking his meals regularly, Thai officials at the centre told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday (Jul 14).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Superintendent of Suan Plu Immigration Detention Centre Wallop Kangtaratip said 27-year-old David James Roach has been assessed by a doctor and has been described as healthy.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>He is currently being detained in a first floor room that can accommodate up to 10 people.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to the superintendent, Roach is free to walk around in a confined area, watch television and has access to gym facilities. The Canadian is also allowed to make long-distance calls, but the superintendent stopped short of saying if Roach has contacted his family.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"If his family wants to visit him, they are allowed to do so. He also can call his family, we have telephones here," said superintendent Wallop.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Roach allegedly robbed S$30,000 from the Standard Chartered bank branch in Holland Village on Jul 7. He fled to Bangkok on the same day but was arrested by Thai police on Jul 10 at Boxpackers Hostel in central Bangkok.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Canadian's right to stay in Thailand has been revoked under the country's immigration law and he has been detained in Suan Plu Immigration Detention Centre.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Patrice Counsineau, the spokesperson for the Canadian embassy in Bangkok, told Channel NewsAsia the embassy was aware of the case and is providing assistance to Roach. He said that such assistance normally involves giving someone a list of lawyers to contact. However, neither Mr Counsineau nor staff at the detention centre could confirm if Roach has engaged any legal assistance.<br><br></div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">StanChart robbery suspect could be sent back to Canada: Thai authorities</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>BANGKOK: If Singapore fails to press charges against the alleged robber of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) via the Thai Attorney General within a week, the suspect could be extradited back to Canada, Deputy Commander of the Thai Tourist Police Nithithorn Chintakanon said on Wednesday (Jul 13).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“It depends on the Singapore (authorities) to send the documents in time. If there are no documents from Singapore, the Canadian embassy will send him back to Canada,” said Police Colonel Nithithorn.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The suspect, 27-year-old David James Roach, is currently being held in Bangkok's Suan Plu Immigration Detention Centre. Roach allegedly robbed SCB’s Holland Village branch of S$30,000 on Jul 7.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Pol Col Nithithorn said Thai authorities had managed to track him down after retrieving his picture taken at Don Muang airport. The suspect fled to Bangkok on the same day shortly after the crime was reported.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“It took us two days to find him, we got all the information from CCTV footage,” said Pol Col Nithithorn. The police managed to track down the suspect at Boxpackers Hostel in central Bangkok.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>About 700,000 baht (S$26,786) worth of cash and a notebook were among the many things seized by the police on Jul 10. In the notebook, Pol Col Nithithorn said Roach had the same phrases written on the note that was slipped to a teller at the bank, which reportedly stated: “I have a gun. Please give me the money. I don’t want to hurt you.”</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Pol Col Nithithorn also said Roach had planned to head to the Thai province of Chiang Mai then for Dubai.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>After questioning the suspect on Wednesday, Thai police chief Jaktip Chaijinda said Roach refused to cooperate with the police and he has requested for a lawyer to be present.<br><br></div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">StanChart robbery: Singapore requests for suspect to be repatriated from Thailand</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Authorities in Singapore have written to the Thai authorities to repatriate the man suspected of robbing a Standard Chartered branch here, the Singapore Police Force said on Tuesday (Jul 19).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In addition, Singapore has made a “mutual legal assistance request” to the Thai authorities to forward the evidence seized from the suspect, the police said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“If the Thai authorities are unable to return the suspect directly to Singapore we will pursue the suspect’s return from whichever country Thailand eventually decides to send the suspect to,” SPF added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The suspect, identified as Canadian David James Roach, allegedly robbed S$30,000 from the Standard Chartered branch in Holland Village on Jul 7. He fled to Bangkok on the same day but was arrested by Thai police on Jul 10 at a hostel, and is currently being held at Bangkok's Suan Plu Immigration Detention Centre.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In its statement on Tuesday, SPF also said the arrest was the result of strong cooperation between the law enforcement agencies of Singapore and Thailand.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Interpol Bangkok head Police-Major General Apichat Suriboonya told Channel NewsAsia last week that Singapore had sent an extradition request to Thailand's Attorney General's Office and that the request is being processed.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Thailand has no extradition treaty with Singapore.</div>

              <p>Joke I read somewhere: The sg stanchart robbery shows that:</p>
              <p>1. Singapore is secure (in general) - even bank security guards have no gun</p>
              <p>2. Singaporeans are very obedient - a note was all it took for the teller to hand over the money</p>
              <p>3. Singapore is very expensive - even a bank robber's loot cannot pay for COE...</p>
