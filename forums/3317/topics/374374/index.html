              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A foreign controversy, over a set of proposed
              international guidelines on sex education, threatens to reignite the
              debate that raged just six months ago over Singapore's own sexuality
              education programme in schools. </span></p>
              <p><span>The guidelines, scheduled to be released by UNESCO next week, are
              aimed at reducing HIV infections among the young, and will be
              distributed to education ministries and school systems around the
              world.
              <br> <br>But an earlier draft issued in June was attacked by conservative
              and religious groups, mainly in the United States, for recommending
              discussions of homosexuality, describing sexual abstinence as "only one
              of a range of choices available to young people" – and even suggesting
              a discussion of masturbation with children as young as five, reported
              the New York Times.
              <br> <br>When contacted by TODAY, a Ministry of Education (MOE) spokeswoman
              said: "We will be studying the revised guidelines to see how useful and
              relevant they are to the current review of Sexuality Education in our
              schools."
              <br> <br> Two civil society groups expressed contrasting views.
              <br> <br>Ms Dana Lam, president of the Association of Women for Action and
              Research (AWARE), felt UNESCO's guidelines affirmed AWARE's own
              Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) programme, which was suspended
              by the MOE in May.
              <br> <br>Ms Lam said the UNESCO guidelines, which took an "evidence-informed
              and rights-based" approach, offered "a sound, comprehensive approach to
              sexuality education". <br> <br> The emphasis "on relationships, values, attitudes, culture, human
              development, sexual and reproductive health exactly matches the
              emphasis" in AWARE's CSE programme, she added.
              <br> <br>The latter was suspended after parents objected to the programme's
              explicit content, and the MOE found it conveyed messages "which could
              promote homosexuality or suggest approval of pre-marital sex". <br> <br> Going forward, the ministry signalled that sexuality education should
              "adhere to social norms and values of our mainstream society"; while
              Education Minister Ng Eng Hen said it should encourage heterosexual
              married couples to have healthy relationships and stable families. <br> <br> Focus on the Family's senior vice-president, Mrs Chong Cheh Hoon, was opposed to the UNESCO guidelines.
              <br> <br> Apart from questioning their US-centrism and bias, she found some of
              the content "highly inappropriate", such as teaching children aged nine
              to 12 about basic contraception.
              <br> <br> "This is like telling our kids not to smoke and yet providing them with cigarette filters," she said. 
              <br> <br>In the material recommended for ages 12 to 15, the guidelines
              advise the youth to practise safe and consensual sex "if sexually
              active". But, Mrs Chong countered, this was inconsistent messaging –
              since countries like Singapore have statutory rape laws covering those
              up to age 14.
              <br> <br>UNESCO experts have been working on the guidelines for two years,
              reportedly drawing on more than 80 studies of sex education. But
              conservative flak has already caused one of the project's key
              participating agencies, the United Nations Population Fund, to pull
              back, said NYT.
              <br> <br>UNESCO has defended its guidelines as "evidence-informed and
              rights-based". Its guidelines also argue that sex education helps to
              delay the onset of sexual activity, reduce the number of sexual
              partners and unprotected sex.
              <br> <br>"In the absence of a vaccine for AIDS, education is the only
              vaccine we have," said Mr Mark Richmond, UNESCO's global coordinator
              for HIV and AIDS. <br> <br> He added that just 40 per cent of youth aged 15 to 24 "have accurate knowledge" of how the disease is transmitted.
