              <p><strong>Vandal strikes on New Year's Eve</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : As New Year revellers looked on - and walked on - he brazenly spray-painted a mailbox on Orchard Road. </span></p>
              <p><span>But that was not the only mailbox defaced.
              <br> <br> A vandal struck at SingPost mailboxes across the island over the New
              Year weekend, and his acts were caught on video by several passers-by
              who posted clips on YouTube and other websites.
              <br> <br> Although some eyewitnesses were angered, nobody seemed to have stopped him.
              <br> <br>"While on the way home from work, I came across this masked man
              vandalising the mailbox and getting away with it!" wrote netizen
              xxgunnerxx, who spotted the vandal at Bukit Batok interchange.
              <br> <br>"Although there (were) still people walking around the area, no one
              seemed brave enough to stop the guy from vandalising the mailbox,"
              wrote another eyewitness, T K Poh, who was at Holland Village.
              <br> <br>Masked, gloved and wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt and dark
              pants, the vandal also used a stencil to spray-paint the word "Inkman"
              on the side of the mailboxes.
              <br> <br> When contacted on Sunday, SingPost could not comment by press time.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, the police are urging anyone with more information on
              the incidents caught on video to lodge a police report at the nearest
              Neighbourhood Police Centre. </span></p>

              <p><strong>PR stunt gone wrong?</strong></p>
              <p>CALL it a publicity stunt gone wrong.</p>
              <p>Several 'acts of vandalism' carried out on SingPost mailboxes over
              the past few days, attracting public attention, now appear to be an
              attempt by SingPost to drum up publicity - and the police have stepped
              in.</p>
              <p>Responding to queries from The Straits Times
              about the stunt, which involved mailboxes being spray-painted by a
              shadowy figure dubbed the Inkman, police said last night they would be
              contacting SingPost about it.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman
              said: 'Police will be taking the matter up with SingPost as this whole
              episode has caused unnecessary public alarm and wasted valuable
              resources.'</p>
              <p>She said SingPost had sent an e-mail
              query to the police about the need for a permit for a possible
              advertising event. 'It, however, did not provide us the full picture
              and details of the publicity stunt.'</p>
              <p>The saga
              began with viral videos making the rounds on several websites,
              including The Straits Times' online portal Stomp and YouTube, of a
              masked man spray-painting the mailboxes before walking away or getting
              into a waiting car.</p>

              <p><strong>SingPost apologises for "acts of vandalism" on mailboxes</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: SingPost has apologised for the "acts of vandalism" on its mailboxes recently. </span></p>
              <p><span>At a news conference to announce a sponsorship deal with the
              Youth Olympic Games, SingPost said it had commissioned the graffiti as
              a viral marketing effort.
              <br> <br>The mailbox along Orchard Road appears to have been the target of
              vandals. But that is not the case. It was one of six spray-painted
              during the New Year period by SingPost itself, as part of its Singapore
              Youth Olympic Games sponsorship.
              <br> <br> The saga is a lead in to the STAMP 02 competition, which will see participants painting 40 mailboxes islandwide.
              <br> <br>Steve Ng, vice president, Marketing, SingPost, said: "As part of
              the YOG is also talking about self expressing, it's really about sports
              and arts. And sports and arts is really about expressing yourself and
              that's the core spirit of it."
              <br> <br>Good or bad, the spray-painted mailboxes certainly caught the eye
              of the public. Some even posted clips on YouTube and other websites.
              <br> <br> But has it worked as a marketing tool?
              <br> <br> Said one man in the street: "It doesn't send out the message. What's the purpose of the marketing?"
              <br> <br>The police is certainly not amused, saying it will take the matter
              up with SingPost as the episode had caused unnecessary public alarm and
              wasted valuable resources.
              <br> <br>They said the organiser did send an email query to one of their
              units about the need for a police permit for a possible advertising
              event they were holding. But the organiser did not provide the full
              picture and details of the publicity stunt. <br> <br> SingPost said it will be working closely with the police on the matter.
              <br> <br> Wilson Tan, group chief executive, SingPost, said: "I'll like to
              apologise to all the parties concerned for any inconveniences caused. I
              think that was never the intent."
              <br> <br>The YOG Organising Committee said it was not aware of SingPost's
              approach for the YOG-related viral marketing campaign, but said people
              should let the matter slide.
              <br> <br>Goh Kee Nguan, CEO, Singapore YOG Organising Committee, said: "The
              intent is right. They wanted to engage youths and wanted to link youths
              and sports and more importantly (provide) a platform for youths to
              express themselves."
              <br> <br>As the YOG's Official Postal Services sponsor, SingPost will
              provide local and overseas delivery of the Games tickets. It will also
              sell YOG merchandise through its post offices and online portal. </span></p>
