              <p><strong>Ancient mass grave found on Olympics site</strong></p>
              <p>LONDON - An ancient burial pit containing 45 severed skulls, that
              could be a mass war grave dating back to Roman times, has been found
              under a road being built for the 2012 British Olympics.</p>
              <p>Archaeologists, who have only just begun excavating the site, say they do not yet know who the bones might belong to.</p>
              <p>"We
              think that these dismembered bodies are likely to be native Iron Age
              Britons. The question is -- how did they die and who killed them," said
              dig head, David Score, of Oxford Archaeology.</p>
              <p>"Were they fighting amongst themselves? Were they executed by the Romans? Did they die in a battle with the Romans?</p>
              <p>"The
              exciting scenario for us possibly is that there were skirmishes with
              the invading Romans and that's how they ended up chopped up in a pit,"
              he told Reuters.</p>
              <p>When the main Roman invasion force landed in
              Britain in AD 43, Claudius' legions moved swiftly through western
              England to subdue fierce Celtic tribes.</p>
              <p>The skulls and other
              bones were unearthed at a place called Ridgeway Hill, on the
              construction site of a new major relief road to Weymouth, on the Dorset
              coast in southwest England.</p>
              <p>The seaside town -- in the heart of Thomas Hardy country -- is to host sailing events for the London Olympics.</p>
              <p>The
              grave site is close to Maiden Castle -- Europe's largest Iron Age hill
              fort where local tribes are said to have staged a last stand against
              the Roman legions after the invasion.</p>
              <p>Some historians believe the
              Romans sacked the site, butchering its population including women and
              children, before burning it to the ground.</p>
              <p>Score said they had
              counted 45 skulls so far in the 6-meter wide pit, together with a
              tangle of torsos, arms and legs, More could be found in the coming
              weeks.</p>
              <p>Most of the skulls were those of young men, supporting the theory they could have been killed in battle or executed en masse.</p>
              <p>"One
              of the things that we will be looking for is do they have sword cut
              marks on the bones, and how were the heads dismembered: prior to or
              after death in an act of victory," Score said.</p>
              <p>Archaeologists say they could also be Roman citizens or indigenous people who had died through disease or disaster.</p>
              <p>Few
              artifacts have so far been found with the bones, though pottery shards
              dating to the late Iron Age and early Roman period have been found
              scattered around the pit.</p>
              <p>"It is rare to find a burial site like
              this one," Score said. "There are lots of different types of burial
              where skeletons may be aligned along a compass axis or in a crouched
              position, but to find something like this is just incredible."</p>
