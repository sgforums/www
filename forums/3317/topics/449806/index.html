              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will launch a
               bumper crop of 8,000 flats in Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance 
              Flats (SBF) exercises on Wednesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The flats are in mature and non-mature estates, and cover a full range of flat types from three- to five-room flats.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>HDB is using the 
              ramped-up supply of new flats to help other buyer groups, now that the 
              queue of first-time flat applicants has been largely cleared, National 
              Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in his latest blog entry on 
              Tuesday.<br><br>Slightly more than half of the flats will consist of BTO
               flats, with about 1,200 flats in Bukit Batok, 860 in Bukit Panjang, 670
               in Clementi, 640 in Geylang, 410 in Bedok, 180 in Toa Payoh and 130 in 
              Bukit Timah.<br><br>Mr Khaw said that with the wide range of flats 
              offered in the launch on Wednesday, flat buyers will be able to apply 
              for one that best meets their needs, and in an estate of their choice.<br><br>As
               strong demand is expected for flats that are completed or nearly 
              completed in mature estates, Mr Khaw advised those who want to have a 
              better chance of success to widen their options and consider applying 
              for a BTO flat in non-mature estates.<br><br>Mr Khaw said he will be 
              monitoring the application rates to see how Singaporeans respond to the 
              new government initiatives, adding that nothing is cast in stone.<br><br>The results of the launch will help the HDB calibrate BTO rules for future launches to ensure that policy objectives are met.<br><br>The
               priority still lies with helping first-timers get their first HDB flat 
              as quickly as possible so they can start their families, Mr Khaw said.<br><br>In early March, Mr Khaw announced in Parliament a number of new measures to help various groups of home buyers.<br><br>The
               HDB is tripling the chances for second-timers to get BTO flats in 
              non-mature estates and enhancing the Married Child Priority Scheme.<br><br>It
               is also introducing a new Multi-Generation Priority Scheme to help 
              married children live with or near their parents, along with an 
              Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme and a Silver Housing Bonus Scheme to 
              help the elderly age in a familiar environment.<br><br>300 studio 
              apartments will also be offered in Bukit Timah and Toa Payoh to cater to
               elderly residents under the Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme.<br><br>- CNA/wm/al</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>HDB tweaks rules to protect serious buyers, will launch 4,640 flats in May</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has tweaked 
              its rules to discourage buyers who book a flat but subsequently cancel 
              their booking, in a move designed to better protect the interests of 
              serious home buyers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Such applicants who 
              cancel their booking cannot, within one year from the date of 
              cancellation, apply or be included as an essential occupier for a new 
              HDB flat, DBSS (Design, Build and Sell Scheme) unit, Executive 
              Condominium unit, or a resale flat with housing grants.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The requirement will be waived in exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the applicants.<br><br>The HDB hopes this will ensure that the flats are only allocated to serious buyers.<br><br>Currently,
               buyers only have to pay a non-refundable booking fee when they select a
               unit and a 10-per cent downpayment when they sign the agreement.<br><br>The
               HDB said it has seen a steady increase in the number of flat booking 
              cancellations over the last five years - from 309 in 2007 to 1,540 
              cancellations in 2011.<br><br>It said one of the reasons for the increase is the higher BTO supply in recent years.<br><br>The cancellations form five to six per cent of Build-to-Order (BTO) supply.<br><br>The applicants cite various reasons for cancellation, such as a change in housing plan and intention to buy another flat.<br><br>In
               order to help some families enjoy greater access to two-room flats, the
               HDB is also raising the income ceiling for two-room flats in mature 
              towns and estates from S$2,000 to S$5,000 per month.<br><br>The move 
              provides an additional housing option for households who prefer to live 
              in mature estates, but whose monthly income exceeds S$2,000. <br><br>The HDB also said it will be offering 4,640 BTO flats for sale in Choa Chu Kang, Kallang/Whampoa, Punggol and Sengkang in May.<br><br>It
               has ramped up flat supply substantially, to some 50,000 units in two 
              years, to meet housing needs and will continue to build more if demand 
              persists, the HDB said.<br><br>The HDB also launched on Wednesday 7,978 flats for sale under BTO and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises for March.<br><br>The public housing authority continues to place priority on first-time flat applicants.<br><br>In
               the March launch, 4,153 units are new flats in eight BTO projects and 
              3,825 are SBF flats in 26 towns and estates. Of these, 1,739 of the BTO 
              flats in mature estates and 3,609 SBF flats will render top priority for
               first-timers. <br><br>The HDB said 95 per cent of these flats will be reserved for them.<br><br>At
               the same time, the HDB is enhancing housing options for second-time 
              home-buyers, married children and parents wanting to live with or near 
              each other, as well as the elderly who want to age in a familiar 
              environment and families preferring two-room flats in mature estates.<br><br>For
               second-timers, the chances of securing a flat will be tripled from 5 
              per cent to 15 per cent for 2,094 BTO flats in non-mature estates. The 
              proportion of these flats reserved for first-timers will be reduced to 
              85 per cent.<br><br>The HDB said the chances of first-timers will not be
               too greatly affected, after successive massive BTO launches in the past
               one year.<br><br>The HDB also said there will be more housing options 
              in mature estates, with 3,174 flats in the March launch located in such 
              estates. These include 397 studio apartments and 366 units of two-room 
              flats.<br><br>More choices will be provided for married children wanting
               to stay near their parents, the elderly who want to remain in the same 
              town or estate, as well as families preferring two-room flats in mature 
              estates, the HDB added.<br><br>To help married children and parents live
               with or near each other, the HDB introduced the Multi-Generation 
              Priority Scheme (MGPS) at Ping Yi Greens in Bedok. <br><br>The scheme 
              gives priority allocation to married children and their parents who 
              jointly apply to live near each other. Married children can apply to buy
               a two-room, three-room or four-room flat at Ping Yi Greens, while their
               parents can apply to buy a two-room flat in the same project.<br><br>The
               HDB has also enhanced the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) to 
              increase the number of ballot chances a married child receives if he 
              applies to live with his parents. Such an applicant will now receive six
               ballot chances if he's a first-timer, and three ballot chances if he's a
               second-timer.<br><br>To help the elderly to age in a familiar 
              environment, the HDB has introduced Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme 
              (APPS) to give priority to seniors living in the same town/estate or 
              within two kilometres of the project they apply for.<br><br>Seniors 
              applying under the scheme will receive two ballot chances, instead of 
              one. If they are also applying to live near their married child under 
              MCPS, they will receive four balloting chances altogether.<br><br>- CNA/wm/fa</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Some 8,551 applications were received as of 5pm yesterday in only the second day of applications, said the HDB. The launch will carry on for five more days.</p>
