              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Inland Revenue 
              Authority of Singapore (IRAS) says more than 1.13 million, or nearly 60 
              per cent of the 1.92 million taxpayer base are eligible for the 
              No-Filing Service (NFS).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>First introduced in 2007 to 45,000 taxpayers, the NFS has grown in scale to benefit 25 times as many taxpayers this year. <br><br>Taxpayers
               who have been informed by IRAS of their eligibility for NFS this year 
              will not need to file a tax return, unless they have additional income 
              to declare or changes to make to their personal reliefs. <br><br>The 
              remaining 40 per cent of taxpayers who are not on NFS would have 
              received a letter or SMS notification informing them to file via </span><a class="path" href="http://myTax.iras.gov.sg">myTax.iras.gov.sg</a><span> by 18 April.<br><br>These
               taxpayers will have to file a tax return this year, even if their 
              employers have sent their salary details to IRAS under the 
              Auto-Inclusion of Employment Income Scheme.<br><br>In his 2013 Budget 
              Speech, Deputy prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman 
              Shanmugaratnam has announced that all individuals who are tax resident 
              in Singapore will enjoy a personal income tax rebate for Year of 
              Assessment (YA) 2013.<br><br>But they do not need to apply for the personal income tax rebate.<br><br>IRAS will automatically grant the rebate to all eligible taxpayers and reflect the amount in their tax bill.<br><br>The
               amount of personal income tax rebate will depend on the person's age as
               at 31 December 2012 - those aged below 60 will get a tax rebate of 30 
              per cent while those aged 60 and above enjoy a tax rebate of 50 per cent
               - both capped at S$1,500.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p>lhl in election campaign promised to do something to deal with widening income gap, now ?????    Lies, lies and nothing but lies.   Do we need a pm who lie just to get votes to stay in power?</p>
