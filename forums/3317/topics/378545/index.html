              <p>BANGKOK â€“ Thousands of
              supporters of deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, all in red
              shirts, rallied Sunday in Bangkok to demand the government step down
              and call fresh elections.</p>
              <p>Supporters of Thaksin have been
              staging sporadic protests that have threatened to rekindle the
              political turmoil that has gripped the country since before the former
              leader was ousted in a 2006 military coup.</p>
              <p>Sunday's protesters
              called for Parliament to reinstate the 1997 constitution that was
              abolished after the coup in addition to their demands that the
              government be dissolved.</p>
              <p>"If the government is sincere, why not
              return to the old constitution, which was written by the people and for
              the people, and return the power to the public?" asked one of the
              protest leaders, Nattawut Sai-kua, adding that the protesters are
              collecting signatures to call for the removal of Prime Minister Abhisit
              Vejjajiva.</p>
              <p>"Let's see who the majority vote for. I am sure it will not be this government," he said.</p>
              <p>At
              least 2,000 people had flocked to a square in the historic heart of the
              capital by late afternoon with more expected to arrive later in the
              evening. About 1,000 policemen were deployed in the area, said Deputy
              Metropolitan Police Commissioner Worasak Nopsittiporn.</p>
              <p>The protesters said they would disperse peacefully by midnight.</p>
              <p>The
              popularly dubbed "people's constitution" _ which was written with
              extensive public consultation and debate _ was abolished by the coup
              makers in 2006 and replaced with a military-backed charter approved in
              a national referendum in 2007.</p>
              <p>Critics say the 2007
              constitution weakened political parties and shifted several
              responsibilities to the judiciary from the executive branch.</p>
              <p>But
              anti-Thaksin activists say his supporters are only calling for the old
              charter _ and the strong executive it creates _ to rehabilitate the
              reputation of Thaksin who some accuse of installing a parliamentary
              dictatorship during his time in power.</p>
              <p>Although Abhisit has
              said his government is willing to support amendments to the
              constitution, parliamentarians have not been able to reach agreement on
              the issue.</p>
              <p>Few expect the protests to bring about immediate
              political changes, but the sporadic campaign has threatened to
              re-ignite tension between the pro- and anti-Thaksin factions.</p>
              <p>Rival
              political groups have staged several rounds of sometimes violent
              protests. The turmoil began more than three years ago with rallies by
              those who oppose Thaksin _ the "yellow shirts" _ that paved the way for
              his ouster. But when his allies were voted back into power, the yellow
              shirts protested again _ eventually occupying the seat of government
              and shutting down the capital's two airports.</p>
              <p>When court
              rulings did in two governments made up of Thaksin allies, Abhisit came
              to power. But now the "red shirts" periodically hold demonstrations.</p>
              <p>Thaksin
              was accused of corruption and abuse of power during his time in office,
              but he remains popular among the urban and rural poor. Last year, the
              billionaire politician was convicted in absentia of violating a
              conflict-of-interest law and sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
              <p>Much
              of his fortune remains frozen in Thai banks, his Thai passport has been
              revoked, and he has been barred from several countries following
              diplomatic pressure from Thailand.</p>
