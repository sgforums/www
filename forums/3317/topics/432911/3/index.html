              <h1 class="storyheadline">Bedok body may be missing China national's</h1>
              <p>THE father of a Chinese national missing here since late April was 
              yesterday called in by the police to identify the partial body found in 
              Bedok Reservoir.</p>
              <p>Mr Lin Zuliang, 48, had come to Singapore from China's Zhejiang 
              province to look for his son Lin Xiao, 23, who left for work at 8am on 
              April 28 and has not been seen since.</p>
              <p>He declined to speak to reporters at the mortuary yesterday, but it 
              is believed that he thinks the remains are those of his son, going by 
              the belt and jeans that the body was clad in.</p>
              <p>The younger Mr Lin, an apprentice at Lee Sheng Motor Works, 
              lived with his mother in Chai Chee, and was last seen wearing a dark 
              blue T-shirt with a red collar and faded jeans.</p>
              <p>The New Paper reported last month that his parents, who are 
              divorced, had come together to offer $10,000 to anyone who could tell 
              them where their missing son was.</p>
              <p>The older Mr Lin came here in the middle of last month to 
              scour the island for his missing son; his ex-wife Hu Ping Zhu, a 
              43-year-old hawker, also spent nights searching for him and putting up 
              30 flyers.</p>

              <p><strong>Body in Bedok Reservoir: PUB says water safe to drink</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: National water agency PUB says the water treatment 
              process at its Bedok plant is stringent, ensuring that its water is safe
               to drink.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The assurance comes after part of a decomposed body was found floating in the nearby Bedok Reservoir.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The water treatment 
              process at the Bedok facility takes six steps, two of which involve an 
              enhanced disinfecting technology called ozonation. <br><br>The treatment starts at four tanks, each containing high-voltage electricity. <br><br>Ozone - a gas converted from oxygen - is produced in the tanks. <br><br>When
               infused with water, ozone kills bacteria and micro-organisms like algae
               and plankton which float on the water surface initially.<br><br>A 
              coagulant called aluminium sulphate is then used to clump the dead 
              particles. Due to their combined weight, the dead particles sink to the 
              bottom of the tanks, leaving clarified water at the top.<br><br>At this point, the water looks relatively clean, but it will go through three more steps to ensure it is safe to drink.<br><br>Ozone
               is introduced to the process once more, this time as a disinfectant. 
              The ozonated water is then passed through filters to remove finer 
              particles. To sustain the disinfection, chlorine is added, together with
               lime and fluoride.<br><br>And in four hours, the process is complete.<br><br>PUB says this is all part of a robust water supply system.<br><br>Lee
               Mun Fong, deputy director at PUB's Water Supply (Plants) Department, 
              said: "We have a plant that is able to treat water with multiple 
              barriers and on top of that, we have a system that monitors from the 
              source all the way to our tap. So I want to assure our customers that 
              our water is safe to drink, even from the tap."<br><br>In its full 
              capacity, Bedok Waterworks supplies one-tenth of Singapore's demands, 
              distributing water to areas like Tampines, Simei and Bedok.<br><br>Bedok
               Waterworks is one of two plants that have been using ozonation for more
               than two decades, due to the environment of its catchments which 
              require more treatment.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>Forensic experts The Straits Times spoke to yesterday say there could be another explanation as to why only the lower half of the body was found.</p>
              <p>They said it could have decomposed more slowly than the upper half because of the jeans found on the corpse when it was recovered from the reservoir.</p>
              <p>'We would have to examine the remains to determine if the body had been purposely cut in half before it was dumped into the water,' said an Australia-based private pathologist who did not want to be named.</p>
              <p>'However, two months of decomposition could have resulted in the upper body simply disintegrating.' He added that the bottom half may appear intact only because the jeans held it together.</p>
              <p>As to why the body was not discovered for such a long time, experts said that it could have been weighed or held down, although dead bodies typically sink to the bottom first.</p>
              <p>Dr Ong Chin Choon, who teaches forensic courses at Singapore Polytechnic, said: 'Shortly after, it would go through a process of anaerobic decomposition wherein carbon dioxide and methane gases released would cause it to float up.'</p>
              <p>According to the experts, Singapore's hot weather would normally result in the body rising to the surface within two to four days.

              <p>He added that a typical mitochondrial DNA test to discover the victim's identity should take only one to two days to conduct if DNA is available from the mother. However, it is understood that the severe level of decomposition could extend the waiting time for DNA results.</p>

              <h1>Jeans may be reason why only lower body found</h1>
              <p>SEVERAL questions were raised when the lower half of a body was found floating in Bedok Reservoir on Monday.</p>
              <p>Could it have been severed in a gruesome murder? How long has it been in the water?</p>
              <p>The body is believed to be that of 23-year-old Chinese national Lin Xiao, who went missing two months ago.</p>
              <p>He was last seen by his mother, Madam Hu Ping Zhu, 43, a kitchen assistant, when they were leaving home for work together on April 28 at 8am.</p>
              <p>He lived with his mother in Chai Chee, which is near the reservoir.</p>

              <p>How is it possible that the body got severed at the waist? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Goodness.
              Just when you thought it's save to go back to drinking tap water...
              I so long haven't boiled water to drink liao. Only use filter.
              Now after the water tank case, and now the reservoir case, must start boiling again. Waste electric leh, and must wait so many hours for the water to cool down before can drink.
