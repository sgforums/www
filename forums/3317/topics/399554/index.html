              <p>A Factual Appraisal Of The 'Holocaust' By The Red Cross  :  The Jews And The Concentration Camps</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's a survey of German concentration camps which is honest and objective, Report of the
                  International Committee of the Red Cross on its Activities during 2nd World War, Geneva, 1948.</p>
              <p>The Red Cross ( ICRC ) applied the Geneva convention to
                  gain access to civilian internees held by German authorities but was unable to gain any access to Russian camps. The millions of civilian and military internees held in USSR, whose conditions were the worst, were cut off from
                  international contact or supervision.</p>
              <p> They distributed food parcels to concentration
                  camps in Germany. (Vol. 111, p. 78). The ICRC
                  established contact with camp commandants and a food relief programme.</p>
              <p>The Report states "9,000 parcels were packed daily. &gt;From the autumn
                  of 1943 until May 1945, about 1,112,000 parcels weighing 4,500 tons
                  were sent to concentration camps" (Vol. III, p. 80). 
                  In addition to food, there were clothing and pharmaceutical
                  supplies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### The ICRC complained that obstruction of their vast relief operation for
                  Jews came not from the Germans but from the tight Allied blockade.<br> <br>### The ICRC praised the liberal conditions at
                  Theresienstadt up to April 1945. This camp, "where
                  there were about 40,000 Jews was relatively privileged" (Vol. III, p. 75).</p>
              <p>### From information gathered by the Committee, this camp had started as an
                  experiment by leaders of the Reich ... These men wished to give the
                  Jews the means of communal life in a town under their own
                  administration with almost complete autonomy. . . two delegates were
                  able to visit the camp on April 6th, 1945." (Vol. I, p . 642).</p>
              <p>### The ICRC complained that it never succeeded "in sending anything to Russia" (Vol. II, p. 62). <br> <br>### The same situation applied to German camps after "liberation" by
                  the Russians. The ICRC received a flow of mail from
                  Auschwitz until Soviet occupation, when internees were evacuated
                  westward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>###The most important aspect of the Red Cross Report is that it clarifies
                  the true cause of those deaths that occurred in the camps. <br> <br>### Says the Report: "In the chaotic condition of Germany during the final
                  months of the war, the camps received no food supplies at all and
                  starvation claimed an increasing number of victims.</p>
              <p>### Alarmed by this, the German Government informed the ICRC and discussions
                  between the President of the ICRC and General of the S.S. Kaltenbrunner
                  gave decisive results. Relief could henceforth be distributed by the
                  ICRC, and one delegate was to stay in each camp ..." (Vol. III, p. 83).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### It is important to stress that delegates of Red Cross found no evidence
                  at camps in Axis occupied Europe of any policy to exterminate the Jews.
                  <br> <br>### In its 1,600 pages the Report does not mention a gas chamber. It admits
                  that Jews, like many other wartime nationalities, suffered rigours and
                  privations, but its complete silence on the planned extermination is
                  ample refutation of the Six Million legend.</p>
              <p>### So far as the genuine mortality rate is concerned, the Report points
                  out that most of the Jewish doctors from the camps were being used to
                  combat typhus on the eastern front, so that they were unavailable when
                  the typhus epidemics of 1945 broke out in the camps (Vol. I, p. 204 ff)</p>
              <p>### Claims that mass executions were carried out in gas chambers disguised
                  as shower facilities. The Report makes nonsense of this allegation.
                  "Not only the washing places, but installations for baths, showers and
                  laundry were inspected by the delegates. They often take action to have
                  fixtures repaired or enlarged" (Vol. III, p. 594).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### Volume III of the Red Cross Report, Chapter 3 (I. Jewish Civilian
                  Population) deals with the "aid given to the Jewish section of the free
                  population," and this chapter makes it plain that not all Jews were
                  placed in internment camps, but remained as part of the free civilian
                  population.</p>
              <p>### In Slovakia, where Eichmann's assistant Dieter Wisliceny was in charge,
                  the Report states that "A large proportion of the Jewish had permission
                  to stay in the country, and Slovakia was a comparative haven of refuge
                  for Jews. Those in Slovakia were in
                  comparative safety.</p>
              <p>### While the law of May 15th, 1942 brought the internment of several
                  thousand Jews, these people were held in camps where the conditions of
                  food and lodging were tolerable, the internees were allowed paid work
                  on terms almost equal to those of the free labour market" (Vol. I, p.
                  646).<br> <br>### Large numbers of the 3 million or so European Jews avoid internment
                  altogether and emigration of Jews continued throughout the war via
                  Hungary, Rumania and Turkey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### Many Germans died of typhus. One account of a
                  boy aged 12 described how he had typhus. He
                  was in a hospital ward with dozens of other typhus victims. He said a gas bottle was wheeled into the ward and Zyklon
                  gas was released in an effort to kill all lice, etc,
                  while the patients were in their beds.</p>
              <p>### Zyklon gas was supposedly claimed by the Jews to be used in the gas chambers.</p>

              <p>The Höss 'Confession'<br> <br> A key Holocaust document is the "confession" of former Auschwitz
              commandant Rudolf Höss  which was submitted by the
              U.S. prosecution at the Nuremberg trial. <br> <br> Although still widely cited as solid proof for the Auschwitz
              extermination story, it is a false statement obtained
              by torture.</p>
              <p>British military intelligence sergeant
              Bernard Clarke described how he and five British soldiers
              tortured the former commandant to obtain his "confession." Höss explained his ordeal : "Certainly, I signed a
              statement that I killed 2.5 million Jews. I could just as well
              have said that it was 5 million Jews. There are methods by
              which any confession can be obtained, whether it is true or not."</p>
              <p>The Höss "affidavit" alleges that Jews were being
              exterminated by gas at 3 other camps: Belzec,
              Treblinka and Wolzek. The "Wolzek" camp is a total
              invention and no longer mentioned in
              Holocaust literature.</p>

              <p>Anne Frank, who is known
              around the world for her famous diary. But few people know that
              thousands of Jews, including Anne and her father, Otto Frank,
              "survived" Auschwitz.</p>
              <p>The girl and her father were deported 
              to Auschwitz in September 1944. Weeks later, in the face of the
              advancing Soviet army, Anne was evacuated along with other Jews to
              the Bergen-Belsen camp, where she died of typhus in March 1945.</p>
              <p>Her diary was later found to be written with a ballpoint pen.................a POST-war invention !!!!</p>

              <p>As someone who has just came back touring Europe and been to both the Dachau Concentration Camp(Munich) and the Auschwitz I and II Camps(Oswiecim), I seriously do believe the numbers that is widely agreed on by many experts is correct.</p>

                  II Camps(Oswiecim), I seriously do believe the numbers that is
                  widely agreed on by many experts is correct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dachau and Auschwitz II camps were big enough for that figure of
                  Jews to be exterminated(by the size alone).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's just agree to disagree upon that.</p>

              <p>just becoz a place is big enough to house 100,000 corpses doesn't mean 100,000 people died there.........</p>
              <p>right after the war the jews claimed that 4.5 million jews died in Dachau or somewhere else.............that figure was then repeatedly reduced to around 1 million.................otherwise, the total figure would be over 9 million jews killed !!!!</p>

              <p>Absurd Cremation Claims<br> <br> Cremation specialists confirmed that thousands of corpses could
              not possibly have been cremated every day throughout the spring and
              summer of 1944 at Auschwitz, as commonly alleged.</p>
              <p>Mr. Ivan Lagace, manager of a large crematory in Calgary,
              Canada, testified in court in April 1988 that the Auschwitz cremation
              story is technically impossible. The allegation that 10,000 or even
              20,000 corpses were burned every day at Auschwitz in the summer of 1944
              in crematories and open pits is simply "preposterous" and "beyond the
              realm of reality," he declared under oath.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gassing Expert Refutes Extermination Story<br> <br> America's leading gas chamber expert, Boston engineer Fred A. Leuchter,
              carefully examined the supposed "gas chambers" in Poland and concluded
              that the Auschwitz gassing story is absurd and technically impossible.</p>
              <p>Leuchter is the foremost specialist on the design and installation of
              gas chambers used in the United States to execute convicted criminals. </p>
              <p>In February 1988 he carried out a detailed onsite examination of the
              "gas chambers" at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek in Poland. In sworn testimony to
              a Toronto court and in a technical report, Leuchter described every
              aspect of his investigation.</p>
              <p>He emphatically declared the alleged gassing
              facilities could not possibly have been used to kill people. Among
              other things, he pointed out that the so-called "gas chambers" were not
              properly sealed or vented to kill human beings without also killing
              German camp personnel.</p>
              <p>Dr. William B. Lindsey, a research chemist of 33 years at Dupont Corporation, testified in a 1985 court case that the
              Auschwitz gassing story is technically impossible. Based on a careful
              on-site examination of the "gas chambers" at Auschwitz, Birkenau and
              Majdanek, he declared: "I come to
              the conclusion that no one was willfully or purposefully killed with
              Zyklon B [hydrocyanic acid gas] in this manner. I consider it
              absolutely impossible."</p>

              <p>1. In 1939, official figure was 15.7 million Jews in the world.
              Post-WW2, there were over 18 million Jews. With 6 million allegedly
              gassed, the remaining 9 million-plus Jews doubled to over 18 million in
              less than 9 years - an astronomical feat.<br> <br> 2. The 'SIX MILLION' of which 4 million were allegedly gassed at
              Auschwitz. In 1990, it was declared only 1.5 million were supposedly
              gassed at Auschwitz, yet the Six Million figure remained though no
              replacement for the 2.5 million was ever found.</p>
              <p>3. Director of Auschwitz State Museum, Dr. Franciszek Piper, announced
              the gas chambers were fabricated by the Soviets AFTER the war. Dr.
              Piper's statement is on videotape.<br> <br>### 4. Red Cross officially reported less than 300,000 internees of ALL
              nationalities in German camps died of all causes, including old age.
              Barely more than half were Jews. Most died in typhoid epidemics which
              claimed many lives in Germany - including doctors, nurses and camp
              admin staff.  ###</p>
              <p>### 5. In German-occupied Europe there were 2.4 million Jews. After the
              war, 3.8 million Jews claimed "survivor" benefits from Germany.  ###</p>
              <p>6. Celebrated survivor Elie Wiesel recalled his liberation at
              Auschwitz. However, in a speech to the National Press Club in
              Washington D.C., reported by the Jewish Telegraph Agency he claimed he
              was liberated at Dachau on and became the only POW to hold the
              distinction of being liberated from two different camps in WW2.<br> <br> 7. Not to be outdone by The Wiesel, famous "Nazi-hunter" Simon
              Wiesenthal told BBC News, he had survived no fewer than 12 Nazi "death
              camps."</p>
              <p>8. So, where did this 'SIX MILLION' figure come from? Ilya Ehrenburg,
              chief Soviet propagandist during WW2 first coined the mystic number on
              Dec. 22, 1944 long before tens of thousands of Jewish internees chose
              to flee from the Communists with their German captors.</p>

              <p>A Factual Appraisal Of The 'Holocaust' By The Red Cross 
              :  The Jews And The Concentration Camps</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's a survey of German concentration camps which is honest
              and objective, Report of the International Committee of the Red
              Cross on its Activities during 2nd World War, Geneva, 1948.</p>
              <p>The Red Cross ( ICRC ) applied the Geneva convention to gain
              access to civilian internees held by German authorities but was
              unable to gain any access to Russian camps. The millions of
              civilian and military internees held in USSR, whose conditions were
              the worst, were cut off from international contact or
              supervision.</p>
              <p> They distributed food parcels to concentration camps in
              Germany. (Vol. 111, p. 78). The ICRC established contact with camp
              commandants and a food relief programme.</p>
              <p>The Report states "9,000 parcels were packed daily. &gt;From the
              autumn of 1943 until May 1945, about 1,112,000 parcels weighing
              4,500 tons were sent to concentration camps" (Vol. III, p. 80). In
              addition to food, there were clothing and pharmaceutical
              supplies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### The ICRC complained that obstruction of their vast relief
              operation for Jews came not from the Germans but from the tight
              Allied blockade.<br> <br> ### The ICRC praised the liberal conditions at Theresienstadt up to
              April 1945. This camp, "where there were about 40,000 Jews was
              relatively privileged" (Vol. III, p. 75).</p>
              <p>### From information gathered by the Committee, this camp had
              started as an experiment by leaders of the Reich ... These men
              wished to give the Jews the means of communal life in a town under
              their own administration with almost complete autonomy. . . two
              delegates were able to visit the camp on April 6th, 1945." (Vol. I,
              p . 642).</p>
              <p>### The ICRC complained that it never succeeded "in sending
              anything to Russia" (Vol. II, p. 62).<br> <br> ### The same situation applied to German camps after "liberation"
              by the Russians. The ICRC received a flow of mail from Auschwitz
              until Soviet occupation, when internees were evacuated
              westward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>###The most important aspect of the Red Cross Report is that it
              clarifies the true cause of those deaths that occurred in the
              camps.<br> <br> ### Says the Report: "In the chaotic condition of Germany during
              the final months of the war, the camps received no food supplies at
              all and starvation claimed an increasing number of victims.</p>
              <p>### Alarmed by this, the German Government informed the ICRC and
              discussions between the President of the ICRC and General of the
              S.S. Kaltenbrunner gave decisive results. Relief could henceforth
              be distributed by the ICRC, and one delegate was to stay in each
              camp ..." (Vol. III, p. 83).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### It is important to stress that delegates of Red Cross found
              no evidence at camps in Axis occupied Europe of any policy to
              exterminate the Jews.<br> <br> ### In its 1,600 pages the Report does not mention a gas chamber.
              It admits that Jews, like many other wartime nationalities,
              suffered rigours and privations, but its complete silence on the
              planned extermination is ample refutation of the Six Million
              legend.</p>
              <p>### So far as the genuine mortality rate is concerned, the
              Report points out that most of the Jewish doctors from the camps
              were being used to combat typhus on the eastern front, so that they
              were unavailable when the typhus epidemics of 1945 broke out in the
              camps (Vol. I, p. 204 ff)</p>
              <p>### Claims that mass executions were carried out in gas chambers
              disguised as shower facilities. The Report makes nonsense of this
              allegation. "Not only the washing places, but installations for
              baths, showers and laundry were inspected by the delegates. They
              often take action to have fixtures repaired or enlarged" (Vol. III,
              p. 594).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### Volume III of the Red Cross Report, Chapter 3 (I. Jewish
              Civilian Population) deals with the "aid given to the Jewish
              section of the free population," and this chapter makes it plain
              that not all Jews were placed in internment camps, but remained as
              part of the free civilian population.</p>
              <p>### In Slovakia, where Eichmann's assistant Dieter Wisliceny was
              in charge, the Report states that "A large proportion of the Jewish
              had permission to stay in the country, and Slovakia was a
              comparative haven of refuge for Jews. Those in Slovakia were in
              comparative safety.</p>
              <p>### While the law of May 15th, 1942 brought the internment of
              several thousand Jews, these people were held in camps where the
              conditions of food and lodging were tolerable, the internees were
              allowed paid work on terms almost equal to those of the free labour
              market" (Vol. I, p. 646).<br> <br> ### Large numbers of the 3 million or so European Jews avoid
              internment altogether and emigration of Jews continued throughout
              the war via Hungary, Rumania and Turkey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>### Many Germans died of typhus. One account of a boy aged 12
              described how he had typhus. He was in a hospital ward with dozens
              of other typhus victims. He said a gas bottle was wheeled into the
              ward and Zyklon gas was released in an effort to kill all lice,
              etc, while the patients were in their beds.</p>
              <p>### Zyklon gas was supposedly claimed by the Jews to be used in
              the gas chambers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Add the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red Cross</span> to the list of groups that have recently apologized 
              for remaining silent during the Holocaust.</strong></p>
              <p>" The director of archives for the International Red Cross, George 
              Willemin, acknowledged this week the organization's "moral failure" at a
               ceremony at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. He also 
              delivered 60,000 pages of Red Cross documents to be given to three 
              Jewish museums.</p>
              <p>As reports of extermination camps began to spread in 1944, the Red Cross
               visited the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia at the invitation 
              of the Nazis. The Nazis cleaned up the ghetto by lessening overcrowded 
              conditions by sending prisoners to Auschwitz and adding a bank, shops 
              and schools.</p>
              <p>The ruse worked. The Red Cross reported that allegations of 
              extermination camps were unfounded.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong></strong></span></p>
