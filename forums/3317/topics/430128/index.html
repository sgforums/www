              <p>A CHINESE national gambled with $250 in casino chips that did not 
              belong to him while an Indian national stole $12,180 worth of electrical
               cables meant for Marina Bay Sands so as to get some money to bet with.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, the two construction workers pleaded guilty. Ni Guo 
              Jian, 45, was jailed nine weeks for criminal breach of trust. Kakkayan 
              Govindarasan, 26, was jailed seven months.</p>
              <p>In both cases, it was closed-circuit television footage that led to 
              their arrests. A district court heard that the theft of the cables on 
              Feb 13, 2011 was discovered the next day. CCTV footage from cameras 
              installed in the basement where the storeroom was located, showed two 
              men wearing surgical masks taking the loot to a van manned by two other 
              accomplices. The registration plate number was visible and the group was
               arrested within days.</p>
              <p>Kakkayan's three accomplices - also construction workers 
              from India - were jailed seven months earlier. All had also admitted to 
              stealing $7,065 worth of cables on Jan 30. This charge was taken into 
              consideration by District Judge John Ng when passing sentence on 
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The same court had earlier heard that Ni - who has been here
               for nine years - had lost $400 at a dice table on March 22, 2011. He 
              had only $15 left and was waiting to place a bet when he noticed that a 
              woman did not realise that she had won and had walked away.</p>
              <p>Telling the croupier he would pass the winnings to its 
              owner, Ni collected the $250. However, CCTV footage showed him changing 
              the chips into cash and leaving the casino five minutes later, only to 
              return half an hour later, to gamble. Police were called and when 
              arrested, Ni had on him nine $5 chips and $205 in cash.</p>
