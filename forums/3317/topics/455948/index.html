              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Education Minister Heng Swee Keat said recent 
              incidents such as derogatory online posts reported in the media show 
              that racial and religious issues can be sensitive and emotional.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He warned that they 
              may result in tension and conflicts if not handled properly, and added 
              that these challenges to social cohesion will not go away anytime soon.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Heng said while 
              technology has enhanced communication among people, it also means that 
              there needs to be greater responsibility in the way they use social 
              media.<br><br>He also said building a strong network of trust within 
              Singapore's multi-ethnic and multi-religious society is an important 
              ongoing effort that should not be neglected. <br><br>Mr Heng made these points at the Racial Harmony Day celebrations at Innova Junior College.<br><br>The theme for this year's racial harmony celebrations is 'People.Places.Memories'.<br><br>Mr
               Heng said it aims to remind Singaporeans that as the environment they 
              live in changes and evolves, their shared memories and experiences of 
              living in Singapore bind them as a nation.<br><br>He said the racial and religious harmony Singapore enjoys today is not necessarily a natural state.<br><br>There
               are instances where communal and religious tensions have led to 
              violence in communities who have lived together. Singapore experienced 
              racial riots on July 21, 1964, and saw how quickly communal tensions 
              could escalate into violence.<br><br>Mr Heng pointed out that 
              Singaporeans learnt from this experience, and worked hard to build 
              mutual trust, respect and understanding between the different racial and
               religious groups.<br><br>"This will always be a work-in-progress, so we
               must continue to educate our young and our new immigrants about the 
              importance of maintaining social cohesion and harmony. This is why 
              schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21st July every year, to 
              remind ourselves that we do not want a repeat of the racial riots of 
              1964," he said.<br><br>Mr Heng said there has been much progress in 
              Singapore over the past decades. He cited findings from a recent survey 
              by the Institute of Policy Studies on 'What Makes Someone Singaporean'.<br><br>The
               survey showed that for both local and foreign-born citizens, respect 
              for multi-racial and multi-religious practices is the most important 
              characteristic of being Singaporean. This is closely followed by getting
               on well with neighbours.<br><br>Mr Heng said these findings reflect the
               good work of schools, parents and the community in reinforcing the 
              importance of social harmony.<br><br>Students at Innova Junior College 
              unveiled a "Mega Photo Montage" as part of the school's Racial Harmony 
              Day activities. The photo montage is a compilation of photos sent by 
              students from various schools in the North Zone.<br><br>They also used new media, a niche area for Innova students, to exchange views on racial harmony.<br><br>The
               students are taking the lead in promoting racial harmony with other 
              schools by sharing their experience on the junior college's online 
              portal.<br><br>Another project the school initiated is a virtual art 
              gallery modelled after the popular computer game "Second Life", where 
              users can view student-made artwork reflecting the theme of racial 
              harmony.<br><br>-CNA/ac/wm</span></span></p>
