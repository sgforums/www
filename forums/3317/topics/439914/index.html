              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Internal Security Act (ISA) and its provisions came up for debate in Parliament on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The MP for Pasir Ris
               Punggol GRC, Dr Janil Puthucheary said while he felt it inappropriate 
              to detain a citizen without trial, he is convinced by the hard logic 
              that the safety and security of Singapore must be paramount. That's 
              because there are threats that Singapore faces and which must be dealt 
              with swiftly and decisively. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But he wants to know what safeguards are in place to prevent the ISA from being abused.<br><br>Dr
               Janil said: "I believe I share this view with many Singaporeans; we 
              understand the need to ensure our security despite our misgivings, we 
              recognise the cold hard facts despite the uncomfortable feeling they 
              generate. However, we lack confidence and assurance that the 
              extraordinary power of a State to detain its own citizens without trial 
              will not be abused. <br><br>"The process of the safeguards around the 
              ISA needs to be discussed in a more transparent manner, even as the 
              facts associated with a given detainee need to be kept secret. We need 
              to know that the review process works and operates independently of 
              Cabinet. We need to see that the President exercises his authority on 
              this issue."<br><br>Dr Janil asked if the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
               will be introducing further measures to enhance these safeguards and to
               what extent can the decisions of Cabinet be challenged.<br><br>In his 
              maiden speech, the first-term MP also spoke on behalf of single unwed 
              parents who are not eligible for childcare leave and are not allowed to 
              apply for HDB flats.<br><br>He put forth a suggestion to examine the effects of these schemes on the health, development and social mobility of the child.<br><br>"The
               issues I have brought up will not affect our GDP, they will not affect 
              our foreign affairs, they will not affect the vast majority of 
              Singaporeans directly. Nevertheless I urge that we re-examine these 
              issues; how we deal with them reflects our aspirations for the type of 
              society we want to become," said Dr Janil. <br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>ISA still relevant in S'pore: DPM Teo</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs 
              Minister Teo Chee Hean has told Parliament that the Internal Security 
              Act continues to be relevant to the country.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He explained that 
              over the years, the government has used the ISA in good faith and in a 
              measured way, in the prevailing security situations it has had to face, 
              keeping Singapore safe and its people secure.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Teo said the 
              government has used the ISA as a last resort when there is a significant
               threat, and other laws are not adequate to deal with the situation.<br><br>He
               said: "The difficult decisions that a government has to make to protect
               its people must be made based on an individual country's context and 
              circumstances at the time.<br><br>"In Singapore, we have a law called 
              the ISA, which empowers the government to act, but it comes with a 
              system of safeguards and provides the detainee certain rights which must
               be accorded to him."<br><br>Since the Malaysian Prime Minister 
              announced that his country will be abolishing the Internal Security Act,
               there has been much debate as to the future of the preventive detention
               law in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Teo made it clear that determining what is a
               security threat to Singapore that requires the use of the ISA requires 
              judgement. That decision must be made by the elected government of the 
              day, at the given time and based on the situation at hand.<br><br>He 
              said the ISA allows the government to act quickly to prevent a threat 
              from developing into something very serious such as a bombing, or to 
              stem an organised pattern of subversion which promotes civil 
              disturbances and disorder.<br><br>Mr Teo told Parliament that the 
              government needed to use the ISA from the 1960s till the late 1980s to 
              counter the Communist Party of Malaya. In the 1990s, it was rarely used 
              except in a handful of espionage cases.<br><br>But it proved critical after September 11 to protect Singapore from global jihadist terrorism.<br><br>Mr
               Teo said with the ISA, the Singapore Government could take prompt 
              pre-emptive action to neutralise and disrupt the Jemaah Islamiyah 
              network.<br><br>Otherwise, there could have been several truck bombs targeted at embassies exploding in Singapore in 2002.  <br><br>Mr
               Teo also explained why a specific Terrorism Act would not be adequate. 
              He said that such an act would not allow pre-emptive action against 
              those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution 
              but nevertheless belong to a wider terrorist network, unless the act is 
              very broad in scope and provides for preventive detention just like the 
              ISA.<br><br>He said: "A Terrorism Act drafted, say in 2002, would 
              probably not have adequately anticipated new forms of the terror threat,
               like the self-radicalised lone-wolf which has emerged in recent years.<br><br>"A
               case in point is the full-time NS man who was self-radicalised through 
              the Internet. He had expressed intent to conduct jihad abroad and had 
              already made online contact with a suspected Al-Qaeda recruiter and 
              radical ideologue Anwar al-Awlaki. But that would not have been 
              sufficient grounds to charge him in court, as under normal criminal 
              legislation, he had not yet committed an offence.<br><br>"The ISA 
              enabled the government to detain him preventively, just before he 
              embarked on demolition training in his course. We now have time to 
              assess, counsel and rehabilitate him. This avoided exposing Singapore to
               a high, perhaps unacceptable degree of risk. The consequence may not 
              just be loss of innocent lives, but also serious damage to 
              inter-communal relations and trust."<br><br>Mr Teo added: "For the 
              foreseeable future, Singapore will need a law containing provisions like
               those in the ISA, including preventive detention, to empower the 
              government to preempt and prevent serious threats to our security. The 
              precise form the law takes may evolve with time and circumstances.<br><br>"But
               for the present, the ISA is a shield we need that protects us against 
              these threats, allowing us to deal with them swiftly and effectively 
              before they cause us serious and possibly permanent harm." <br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
