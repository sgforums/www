              <p><strong>Man charged with the murder of 6-year-old boy</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The murder of 6-year-old Muhammad Nor Rashidy Rahmat
              had apparently taken place last Friday at a flat at Block 151, Mei Ling
              Street. </span></p>
              <p><span>This was revealed in the Subordinate Court on Thursday when a
              31-year-old man, Mohammad Johan Rashid, was charged with the offence.
              <br> <br> The decomposed body of the boy was stuffed into a bag and was found in a canal along Bendemeer Road on Wednesday. 
              <br> <br> According to the charge read out in court, the suspect had allegedly committed the offence last Friday between 2pm and 4pm.
              <br> <br>A Mei Ling Street resident by the name of Nita, who lives in the
              same block as Mohammad Johan, said he does not mingle with them.
              <br> <br>"I used to see him at the ground floor. But I've never spoken to
              him. He has long hair and was always wearing a cap. He also has a dark
              complexion and has tattoos on both his arms," she said.
              <br> <br> "He seems to be quite proud as he never speaks to the neighbours. I've also seen his wife who is also tattooed."
              <br> <br> The suspect wore a white T shirt, brown shorts and looked dazed when the charges were read out to him in court.
              <br> <br>The accused has been remanded in the Central Police Station for
              further investigations and his case will be mentioned again on December
              3.
              <br> <br> If found guilty, he could face the death penalty.
