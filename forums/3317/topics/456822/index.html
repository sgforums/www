              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's economy grew 1.7% in the first half of 
              this year and is on track for 1.5% to 2.5% growth for 2012, said Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Message.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Prime Minister Lee said the country is doing well against the backdrop of an unsettled world.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But, while the country is a success story today, Mr Lee said the next 20 years will be very different.<br><br>And what Singapore becomes depends on what Singaporeans make of it.<br><br>He
               called on Singaporeans to work together so that their children can 
              always find hope of a better future, an inclusive society with a heart, 
              and the best home for themselves.<br><br>Which is why a younger group of
               ministers has been tasked to take a fresh look at policies and engage 
              Singaporeans in the process.<br><br>The reality is that the world is not
               standing still. Emerging economies in Asia are advancing rapidly. And 
              with it, come challenges and opportunities.<br><br>Hence, the need to review policies broadly, particularly social and education policies, said Mr Lee.<br><br>"To
               still be a shining red dot twenty years from now, we must rethink our 
              approaches, and reinvent ourselves. We must anticipate changes and 
              prepare for what lies ahead," he said.<br><br>"Singaporeans will remain 
              at the heart of all that we do, as we update our policies to best serve 
              our people. Core values such as meritocracy, multi-racialism and 
              financial prudence cannot change. But within these broad principles, we 
              should review what needs to change and where we should act more boldly."<br><br>Education Minister Heng Swee Keat will lead this charge with a team of younger ministers.<br><br>Mr Lee said they will engage Singaporeans in this review and build a broad consensus on the way forward.<br><br>And
               as Singapore tackles future challenges, one key strategy is to offer 
              hope for a better future for every new generation of Singaporeans. 
              Hence, the focus on meritocracy and education.<br><br>"We will equip 
              them with skills and knowledge to thrive in an uncertain world. We must 
              work with parents to bring their children to more equal starting points 
              for primary school, through good and affordable childcare and 
              kindergartens," said PM Lee. <br><br>"We will open up more pathways in 
              our education system, to fulfil the diverse aspirations of our young. 
              Let us prepare every child for the test of life, not just a life of 
              tests."<br><br>As well as building an inclusive society where the well 
              off take care of the less fortunate, on its part, the government has 
              started to enhance the country's social safety nets, said Mr Lee.<br><br>"As
               new needs have emerged over time, we have enhanced our social safety 
              nets. We introduced ComCare to help the needy, and Workfare for 
              low-income workers," he said. <br><br>"Low- and middle-income couples 
              now get Additional Housing Grants to buy HDB flats. In schools, 
              Opportunity Funds enable less well-off students to participate fully in 
              enrichment programmes and study trips."<br> <br>"This year's Budget was a
               further major step. We introduced new programmes. The Silver Housing 
              Bonus is benefiting our ageing population. Increased subsidies for 
              home-based care are helping more families with elderly parents. These 
              are not one-off gestures, but a carefully designed package which lays 
              the basis for stronger safety nets for the future," said Mr Lee.<br><br>The prime minister said the government will build on these initiatives in a sustainable way.  <br><br>Also important is the sense of belonging and identity especially in an open globalised world.<br><br>Mr Lee acknowledged that this will be harder to nurture with the presence of new immigrants and foreign workers.<br><br>"We
               are managing the inflow to minimise the strains on our infrastructure 
              and society. But Singaporeans must remain confident and open, and 
              welcome those who will strengthen our team and help us and our children 
              do better," he said.<br><br>"For their part, new immigrants must make 
              the effort to integrate into our community. They must acquire our social
               values, our cultural values, adopt our social norms and commit their 
              loyalty and love to Singapore."<br><br>Even as the country is open to 
              immigrants, Mr Lee pledged that Singaporeans will be the focus of 
              policies. "Even as we keep our society open to immigrants, we will bring
               up our own next generation," he said. <br><br>"Singaporeans do want to 
              grow their own families. Many couples do wish to have children, and we 
              will do more to support their family life and parenthood," said Mr Lee.<br><br>"I
               am happy that we expect more Dragon babies this year, but our fertility
               trend is still declining. We must go beyond the Chinese zodiac and 
              tackle the underlying causes of our low birth rates.<br><br>"If we can 
              create more supportive social attitudes and work environments, and 
              lighten the burdens of parenthood, we will help couples to have more 
              kids," he said.<br><br>For the full text of the Prime Minister's message, log on to </span><span class="path">www.channelnewsasia.com/nd2012</span><span><br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
