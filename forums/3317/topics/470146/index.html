              <p>Former Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) chief Peter Lim Sin Pang was found guilty on Friday of corruption in the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/i-received-tip-off-on-tender-process-but-didn%E2%80%99t-inform-my-company--star-witness---120155286.html"><span style="color: #005790;">sex-for-contracts trial</span></a> against him.<br><br>Lim was <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/ex-scdf-chief-peter-lim-claims-trial-over-corruption-charges.html"><span style="color: #005790;">accused</span></a> of corruptly obtaining oral sex from <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/who-are-the-3-women-linked-to-ex-scdf-chief-peter-lim-.html"><span style="color: #005790;">Angie <span>Pang Chor Mui</span></span></a>, 49, on 2 May 2010 in exchange for advancing the business interests of equipment supplier Nimrod Engineering, where she was then general manager.<br><br>Judge Hamidah Ibrahim said it was "downright bizarre and ridiculous" for Lim to say he did not know it was wrong to engage in oral sex with Pang considering he had worked as a public servant for 25 years.<br><br>The judge also questioned <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/personal-relationship-was-wrong--but-i-m-not-corrupt--peter-lim--090650535.html"><span style="color: #005790;">Lim's credibility</span></a>, noting that Lim's evidence in court was fraught with inconsistencies with his statements to officers from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).<br><br>Lim looked emotionless as the verdict was read out by the judge.<br><br>The prosecution had contended that Lim, 52, <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/former-scdf-chief-peter-lim-had-oral-sex-with-it-exec--prosecution-050809533.html"><span style="color: #005790;">gave instructions</span></a> to change the 6 April 2011 closed tender for radiation portal monitors to an open one to let Nimrod participate. <br><br>The ex-SCDF chief denied it and countered that he was not aware it was a conflict of interest because "nobody pointed it out to him" and that the evaluation process would already have gone though other directors before it came to him for final approval.<br><br>During the trial in March, Lim said he consented to oral sex with Pang after she <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/i-didn-t-stop-and-anlyse----i-liked-him-a-lot--woman-in-ex-scdf-chief-peter-lim-s-trial-062857460.html"><span style="color: #005790;">begged "pitifully"</span></a> and that he had met with Pang with the intention to catch up and chit chat. The oral sex, he said, was spontaneous.<br><br>In her decision Friday, the judge noted that Lim was undoubtedly the initiator of the oral sex as he had directed Pang to the spot where it occurred. Hamidah also did not believe there was depth or substance to the relationship between Lim and Pang.<br><br>Lim faces up to five years in jail, a maximum fine of $100,000, or both.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Former Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) chief Peter Lim Sin Pang who was found guilty of corruption last month, arrived in court just after 9am on Thursday morning for his sentencing hearing.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lim, 53, was convicted of one count of corruption for his sexual encounter with Ms Angie Pang Chor Mui, 49, on May 2, 2010, in exchange of furthering the business interests of her then-employer Nimrod Engineering.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But in a dramatic twist during his sentencing hearing last Friday, Lim admitted to seven other trysts with two other women - Ms Esther Goh Tok Mui and Ms Kelly Lee Wei Hoon, both in their 40s. They were working for information technology firm NCS and technology company Singapore Radiation Centre respectively, both of which were vendors of the SCDF.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lim faced ten charges of corruption - nine of which were initially stood down to a later date when he claimed trial. The prosecution agreed to have seven of those charges, which he confessed to, taken into consideration for sentencing, and the other two withdrawn.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi had pressed for a jail term of five months. He said: "As leader of the SCDF, he was expected to lead by example. Instead he had engaged in behaviour that brought SCDF into disrepute."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But defence lawyer Hamidul Haq argued in mitigation that Lim should not be jailed and should instead be given a "hefty fine". He said the SCDF had not suffered any losses since Lim's actions did not lead to the tender being awarded to Nimrod, and SCDF's procurement system had therefore not been compromised.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lim had also never explicitly told Ms Pang he could help her, said Mr Haq. "A lot of what happened is, to a certain extent, the impression in (Ms Pang's) mind of what (Lim) could do. It didn't come from his mouth."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The maximum punishment for each count of corruption is five years' jail and a fine of $100,000.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18.88888931274414px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The sentencing hearing comes two days after the Attorney-General's Chambers decided not to appeal against the Feb 14 acquittal of former anti-narcotics chief Ng Boon Gay, who had also faced corruption charges earlier.</p>
