              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Better communications and dialogue with citizens - 
              that's what the government will do more of, said Minister of Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He was speaking to the media at the sidelines of a graduation ceremony at Republic Polytechnic.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Dr Balakrishnan said
               the election has been a good learning journey and at the strategic 
              level, many PAP policies are right but their implementation and 
              communication can be improved.<br><br>He gave a medical analogy to illustrate his point.<br><br>He
               said: "It's not good enough just to do the right operation. We have to 
              take informed consent, which means especially when you are going into an
               uncertain future, especially when there may be more than one option, 
              and especially when there are trade offs, complications, implications 
              and consequences from different choices of procedure.<br><br>"It's very 
              very important to talk to the patient, to explain these choices and the 
              different trade offs and make sure the people of Singapore understand 
              this and participate more actively in the decision-making process."<br><br>At the same time, he said Singapore needs a strong government that can make tough decisions.<br><br>As
               for George Yeo's defeat in Aljunied GRC, Dr Balakrishnan said it is not
               the fault of the GRC system and that the people have made their choice.
               However, he added it is a loss for Singapore.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan 
              said: "George was one of the people who brought me into politics. I have
               served under him in MTI and he has been such an inspiration and a 
              mentor, so it was very disappointing but politics isn't fair and 
              politics is not predictable, so in a sense, these are the realities of 
              politics that all have us have to learn to live with."<br><br>He said Mr Yeo's defeat proved that no politician is "indispensable".<br><br>"It's
               an affirmation of a lesson in humility for all politicians and never 
              never take people for granted and never take people's feelings, hopes, 
              fears and pain for granted - and beyond policies and implementation, we 
              need to make sure people will trust us."<br><br>As for the Holland-Bukit
               Timah GRC, he said his team will find out why some 40 per cent voted 
              against them and sort out any issues residents may have.<br><br>At the 
              graduation ceremony at Republic Polytechnic, Dr Balakrishnan told 
              graduates of an uncertain future, with more challenges and opportunities
               ahead. He also told them that family was more important than money in 
              their pursuit of happiness.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
