              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Research is an imperative step in understanding the 
              extent of human trafficking in Singapore, said migrant welfare groups 
              and non-governmental organisations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They said studies on the nature and scale of the problem need to be done first.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The authorities 
              recently launched a National Plan of Action against Trafficking in 
              Persons to combat the issue in a more strategic way.<br><br>Forty-three 
              reports of sex trafficking were received by the Police, while 67 cases 
              of labour trafficking were detected by the Manpower Ministry last year.<br><br>However, these statistics alone may not be enough to fully understand the human trafficking situation.<br><br>Observers said more research is needed.<br><br>Siddharth
               Kara, who is a fellow at Carr Centre Programme on Human Trafficking 
              &amp; Modern Slavery, said: "What's going on with human trafficking, 
              who's being trafficked, in what numbers, for what purpose, by whom, etc.
               This broad base baseline research will be a very good foundational 
              piece to have."<br><br>Mr Kara added that sector-based research is also useful.<br><br>"Look
               at the construction sector, the domestic work sector, the maritime 
              sector and understand who's being trafficked into these sectors, by 
              whom, for what purpose, under what modes and means so that you can 
              design your response and your interventions specifically based on 
              knowledge generated by research."<br><br>The Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME) set up its Trafficking Resource Centre at the end of last year.<br><br>HOME believes it should be actively involved in the research work as it has day-to-day contact with the migrant community.<br><br>Libby
               Clarke, who is a consultant on Anti Human Trafficking at HOME, said: 
              "This is one which is building upon the services which HOME has long 
              provided to victims of both sex and labour exploitation. And to ensure 
              that we are tailoring those services very specifically to the needs of 
              victims of trafficking, we are also equipping ourselves with the 
              information we need in order to accurately identify those individuals."<br><br>For
               the first time, 16 NGOs met on March 28 to discuss the issue of 
              Trafficking in Persons. One of the objectives of the meeting was to set 
              out a map of who's doing what in the area of research. <br><br>In addition, the NGOs explored ways in which they could collaborate better and ensure synergies are being maximised.<br><br>As
               part of the National Plan of Action, the Inter-Agency taskforce on 
              Trafficking in Persons is also conducting research, with relevant third 
              parties.<br><br>HOME started a 24-hour hotline in November last year to 
              provide assistance to victims of trafficking in persons. They've been 
              receiving between 10 and 20 calls each day. 10 per cent of the calls 
              relate to the issue of sex exploitation.<br><br>Further investigations 
              will then be carried out after each hotline call is received. This is 
              done to find out exactly the whole ordeal of what the caller has gone 
              through.<br><br>Ms Clarke said this process is important in order to 
              establish the nature of the exploitation and whether they are a victim 
              of trafficking.<br><br>The Inter-Agency taskforce is also studying the 
              feasibility of setting up a toll-free hotline so that authorities are 
              alerted to possible trafficking cases. <br><br>Ms Clarke said: "We are 
              in discussions with the taskforce as to who is best placed to provide 
              this service moving forward. The feedback that we receive from the users
               of our hotline shows they far prefer to make a call to an NGO than to a
               government official.<br><br>"They need a line which they can access 
              which doesn't take them to an official who they perhaps fear because 
              they are concerned about what would happen to them as a result."<br><br>The taskforce expects to complete the joint research by 2015.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
