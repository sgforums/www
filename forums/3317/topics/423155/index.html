              reviewed when the time is right, said Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan 
              Seng.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Wong said this in
               response to a question in parliament from MPs, who wanted to know what 
              new strategies the government will pursue to increase the fertility rate
               among Singaporeans.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The country's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) hit an all-time low of 1.16 last year.<br><br>Mr
               Wong, who is also the minister in charge of population issues, said it 
              is too early to assess the effectiveness of the current schemes, as they
               have only been in place for two-and-a half years.<br><br>The schemes include the Baby Bonus package, increased maternity and childcare leave, as well as higher childcare subsidies.<br><br>"I think the issue is far more complex than putting in more money or encouraging people to have babies," Mr Wong said. <br><br>"And
               as Mr Hri Kumar pointed out, we have certainly seen a change in values 
              and mindset in the way people perceive marriage and having children.<br><br>"We
               know some people who can well afford to have many children, but they 
              have very few. And some who can't afford to have children, and they have
               many. So when we deal with human beings, talking about emotions and 
              peoples' needs, I don't think there's a single answer to deal with this 
              issue."<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>again, i like this statement...it seems to show that there is some acknowledgment that women charter alone will not resolve the fertility issue....there is a greater need to study and explore for more balanced solutions....at the social psychological levels for all ...it is a good start, though rather late....</p>
              <p>the faster the commitment towards that objective, the more sustainable and stable the social framework becomes...the realization of higher social capital could then be achieved.....</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Low birth rate cause: More singles, delayed childbearing</h1>
              <p>THE Government will look at ways to help single men and women find 
              partners, in a bid to tackle the problem of falling birth rates.</p>
              <p>More people are staying single and those who are married are putting 
              off having babies, said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports, on Sunday.</p>
              <p>It was announced last month that Singapore's total fertility rate hit a historic low of 1.16 last year.</p>
              <p>He did not provide details of the help that would be given 
              to singles, but said the issue would be a major area of focus when 
              Parliament meets next week to debate the details of the Budget.</p>
              <p>'We know the vast majority of people do want to get married;
               we need to help them find the right partner and also see what other 
              needs they feel need to be addressed so they can settle down early and 
              start a family,' he said at the sidelines of a community event at 
              Senja-Cashew community club.</p>
              <p>He noted that the total fertility rate of married couples is two and that is 'healthy'.</p>

              <p>Government is getting it wrong.</p>
              <p>Being able to afford a baby in 
              the monetary sense does not equate to having the time to take care of 
              the baby. Putting the baby into the hands of babysitter does not help 
              too because that is not really pro-family.</p>

              <p>exactly. i have heard of cases in low income families, that the mother went out to work fulltime for around $1.5k, only to pay childcare fees for close to $1k. In the end, she's left with peanuts after paying off the expenses incurred by the child.</p>
              <p>the more children one has, the costlier it becomes. e.g. for 2 children, childcare cost will be $2000, while the mother continues to make $1500/month. so logically speaking, these people will prefer to stay and home to look after their children since its cheaper as compared to placing them in fulltime childcare.</p>
              <p>but this created another problem of decreased household income due to the mother not working. even peanuts is better than having no income in today's context.</p>
              <p>no wonder that people are still not have children, or limiting themselves to only 1 child.</p>

              <p>The government fertility schemes are like insults to Singaporeans. Basically, it goes like this: "Here, take some money, and go make babies."</p>
              <p>Having high healthcare costs, expensive milk powder, coupled with insufficient time and money to spend with and on children, are some reasons that were not addressed by the schemes.</p>
              <p>And with so many foreigners, if you want to give more off days/childcare leaves to Singaporeans, this will make local labour less appealing to employers since non-Singaporeans do not get as much benefits.</p>
              <p>This can go on and on, and is definitely not a simple issue. But I do not think current schemes will work.</p>
              <p>Some suggestions could perhaps be<br>1) Substantially subisidise healthcare costs for babies who fall sick often<br>2) Remove GST for baby-related products<br>3) Education is expensive in terms of study materials. More can be looked into this area.</p>

              <p>according to ST, there's around 200,000 China workers on worker's permit in singapore. and that's a conservative estimate, excluding PRs and new citizens.</p>
              <p>they already outnumber our SAF standing forces of around 50k, 4 to 1.</p>
              <p>moral of the story is that in singapore, anyone could be replaced at any level, by cheap foreign imports.</p>
              <p>and its already sad that in spore,  Indians have overtaken the Chinese in household income, with the rise attributed to the influx of indian professionals, IT, engineers, lawyers, etc, into singapore.</p>

              <p>There is a book in the library. It is called 'the next hundred years' written by futurist george friedman. goerge friedman was a hungarian emigrant to the us and he sat up a research insitution researching into the future.<br><br>I dont agree with everything written in the book but he explained the phenomenon of disappearing babies - perfectly and clearly. It is like a veil has been cleared for one to see the picture - clearly.</p>
              <p>I will go as far as to say, any policy maker who reads it and grasps its implication and impliment the correct policy will then be able to solve the shortage of babies issue - properly. </p>

              <p><strong>More time needed to assess impact of past efforts to tackle problem of low fertility rate</strong></p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng says more time is needed to assess 
              the impact of past efforts to encourage marriage and parenthood in 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong, who's also is the Minister in-charge of the National Population
               and Talent Division, was responding to concerns raised by several 
              members of parliament about the low fertility rate and what can be done 
              to boost it up.</p>
              <p>Speaking the Committee of Supply debate for the Prime Minister's Office 
              in parliament today, he said the government has invested sizeable 
              resources to support Singaporeans in having children. <br> <br> And it is not time yet to make any further enhancements to Marriage and Parenthood package first introduced in 2001. <br> <br>"With the 2008 enhancements, we now have a broad-based package 
              of support measures, including maternity and childcare leave,increased 
              baby bonus.  We shall allow more time to assess these measures before 
              considering further adjustments,. NPTD will consider MR Zaqy's 
              suggestion on how to present the package more intuitively so that 
              Singaporeans, can understand and appreciate the various measures that 
              apply to them." <br> <br> Nominated member of Parliament, MP Viswa Sadasivan had asked if the cost
               of HDB flats could have deterred couples from getting married. <br> <br> But Mr Wong said the government is committed to making new flats affordable through generous subsidies. <br> <br> Mr Wong also elaborated on the reason behind Singapore's low total 
              fertility rate or TFR, which hit a new low of 1.16 last year. <br> <br> One reason is that married women are having fewer children and also marrying late. <br> <br> But the other contributing factor that has had the greatest impact on the TFR was that more people are now remaining single. <br> <br> 62% of females aged between 25 and 29 were singles, up from 45.5% in 2000. <br> <br> While for males in the same age group, 78.5% were singles in 2010, 66.4% in 2000. <br> <br> Single hood rates for those aged 30-34 also increased significantly. <br> <br> Ultimately, he said getting married is still a personal decision and 
              what can be done is to facilitate the process for singles to socialise. <br> <br>"I know from perception surveys that Singaporeans, do want to 
              get married, and they are just waiting for the partner and so are the 
              men. Getting married is a very personal decision, and what the 
              government can do, is to facilitate the process of providing 
              opportunities for singles to socialise."<br> <br> Mr Wong said what the government can do is to create an environment for Singaporeans to have and raise children. <br> <br> But couples must also continue to bear some responsibility. <br> <br>"For now I think we have done enough to encourage shared 
              parental responsibility through childcare leave. Married couples should 
              decide between themselves how to share their parenting 
              responsibilities."</p>

              <p>The government fertility schemes are like insults to
              Singaporeans. Basically, it goes like this: "Here, take some money,
              and go make babies."</p>
              <p>Having high healthcare costs, expensive milk powder, coupled
              with insufficient time and money to spend with and on children, are
              some reasons that were not addressed by the schemes.</p>
              <p>And with so many foreigners, if you want to give more off
              days/childcare leaves to Singaporeans, this will make local labour
              less appealing to employers since non-Singaporeans do not get as
              much benefits.</p>
              <p>This can go on and on, and is definitely not a simple issue. But
              I do not think current schemes will work.</p>
              <p>Some suggestions could perhaps be<br> 1) Substantially subisidise healthcare costs for babies who fall
              sick often<br> 2) Remove GST for baby-related products<br> 3) Education is expensive in terms of study materials. More can be

              <h1 class="storyheadline">3 MPs offer suggestions to boost birth rate</h1>
              <p>WHEN dangled a baby bonus in cash of $500,000 per child, with no 
              strings attached, some childless women would change their minds.</p>
              <p>This finding emerged from a straw poll conducted by MP Zaqy Mohamad 
              (Hong Kah GRC), who argued in Parliament on Wednesday that such 
              'in-your-face, upfront and simple' cash incentives would go further in 
              convincing women to have more children.</p>
              <p>'There is a tipping point, a price,' he said. 'Just that the 
              Government hasn't found it, or is finding the price too tough to 
              swallow.'</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamad was one of three MPs to offer suggestions on how to boost 
              the abysmal birth rate during the debate on the budget for the Prime 
              Minister's Office (PMO) in Parliament on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The other two were Nominated MPs Viswa Sadasivan and Paulin 
              Tay Straughan. All three argued that the current array of subsidies and 
              tax relief under the Government's $1.6 billion 'Marriage and Parenthood 
              Package' are insufficient in convincing Singaporeans to have more 
              children.</p>
              <p>However, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng, who heads the 
              National Talent and Population Division under the PMO, said that more 
              time was needed to assess the impact of the package, last enhanced in 
              2008.</p>
