              <h1 class="headline">Another SAF-related photo draws flak</h1>
              <p>A photograph of what seems to be an operationally-ready national serviceman pointing a SAR 21 rifle to his head is drawing huge flak online.</p>
              <p>The picture, which was first posted on citizen-journalism website <em>Stomp</em>, has garnered over 27,000 views as of Thursday since it was posted on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Engineer Jason Lee, 29, told <em><span id="lw_1302760979_6" class="yshortcuts">Yahoo! Singapore</span></em>,
               "This is a very stupid thing to do. Why point a dangerous weapon at 
              your own head? You never know when things might go wrong. And a second 
              question is: why was a camera phone allowed in camp?"</p>
              <p>Most netizens who have seen the photo also condemned the soldier's act.</p>
              <p><em>Getrealz</em>, a user on <em>Stomp</em>, said, "The image of SAF is finished yet again... so embarrassing especially when our neighbouring countries see this."</p>
              <p><em>mlyleo_69</em> added, "This is an unbecoming behaviour of an army
               personnel irregardless of what position he is. This is unacceptable and
               amounts to disrespect of discipline."</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1302760979_1" class="yshortcuts">Sin Boon Ann</span>, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs, took the matter seriously.</p>
              <p>"If it's meant to be a tongue-in-cheek thing, it's not funny," he told <em><span id="lw_1302760979_3" class="yshortcuts">The New Paper</span>.</em></p>
              <p>"When you are a soldier in uniform and bearing arms you should behave
               in a certain demeanour," he said. "The rifle is meant for you to save 
              lives, protect your fellow soldiers."</p>
              <p>It is unclear whether the soldier in the picture is currently serving
               his national service, but the old-style camouflage pants suggests that 
              he may be a reservist personnel.</p>
              <p>"First it was <span id="lw_1302760979_4" class="yshortcuts">the maid</span> carrying the soldier's bag pack, and now this. The public must be 
              wondering what is wrong with our soldiers these days," said 32 year-old <span id="lw_1302760979_5" class="yshortcuts">civil servant</span> Daryl Lim.</p>
              <p>Recently, a photograph of a <span id="lw_1302760979_7" class="yshortcuts">domestic worker</span> carrying the fieldpack of a full-time national serviceman surfaced, causing many Singaporeans to react angrily.</p>
              <p>The soldier, who was undergoing the Physical Training Preparatory 
              phase prior to starting his Basic Military Training, has since stepped 
              forward and admitted to his superiors that he was the one in the 
              picture.</p>
              <p>A spokesman from the <span id="lw_1302760979_2" class="yshortcuts">Ministry of Defence</span> (MINDEF) said, "He has been counselled and continues his training. The 
              SAF has reminded all servicemen to be mindful of their conduct in 
              public."</p>
              <p>MINDEF has made it clear that it does not condone acts wherein 
              soldiers behave inappropriately online or describe military activities 
              on blogs or social networking sites.</p>
              <p>Camera phones were banned in army camps in 2007 after photos of training activities appeared online.</p>
              <p>A former army officer, who only wanted to be known as Rahman, told <em>TNP</em>, Today's generation of 'fast-food' soldiers is different from soldiers in the 80s and 90s.</p>
              <p>"Now, it seems our soldiers, even if they know that some things are 
              wrong, would do it any way to show that they dare. They simply do not 
              respect the ranks and what the uniform stands for in the army."</p>
