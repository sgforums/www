              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Mr Chan Tai Pang, 66, is not your regular punter, but
               he hit the jackpot when the two Integrated Resorts (IRs) rolled into 
              town. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Mr Chan's company, 
              Laundry Network, has been providing services to Resorts World Sentosa 
              (RWS) and Marina Bay Sands (MBS) over the last two years or so after 
              clinching the contracts in 2009, months before the IRs opened their 
              doors the following year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Within the first 
              year, his company's revenue from providing laundry services for RWS hit 
              S$1 million. That figure has grown to S$6 million a year currently, 
              forming almost a third of its S$16 million total revenue.<br><br>The 
              company also made a combined S$9 million when it implemented a uniform 
              management system - which sends and collects uniforms for staff - for 
              both the IRs. Maintenance contracts with both, for this system, are 
              worth a total of S$500,000.<br><br>Correspondingly, Mr Chan grew his 
              staff by over 50 per cent, to more than 300 currently - with 
              Singaporeans making up six in 10 of his workers. About 80 employees are 
              dedicated to service RWS - its biggest client by far.<br><br>"It was a 
              big turning point for this company as we really grew... It is only 
              because of this demand that we could afford to implement the 
              technology," said Mr Chan. For instance, the company uses RFID (radio 
              frequency identification) to track the laundry.<br><br>It is estimated 
              that the IRs currently contribute about 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent of 
              Singapore's gross domestic product, a Ministry of Trade and Industry 
              (MTI) spokesperson said. The presence of the IRs also supports more than
               40,000 jobs throughout the economy, she added.<br><br>Experts TODAY 
              spoke to said that the IRs' economic performances have met all 
              expectations in terms of tourism growth and job creation for 
              Singaporeans. <br><br>But for all the economic benefits - tourist 
              arrivals, new jobs, bumper contracts for Singapore companies, spin-off 
              businesses - that the IRs have generated, the social costs their casino 
              operations have brought remains a minefield for policy-makers. <br><br>And
               after a blistering performance in the initial years - helping their 
              parent companies Genting Singapore (RWS) and Las Vegas Sands (MBS) to 
              record profits - the IRs' quarterly profits have shrunk in the past 
              months.<br><br>With or without the current economic uncertainties, the 
              IRs appear to have hit their peak in terms of generating economic 
              benefits to Singapore, experts said. <br><br>Las Vegas-based economist 
              Jonathan Galaviz of Galaviz &amp; Co - which provides economic analysis 
              and feasibility studies for clients in casino gaming - said: "We feel 
              that the IRs in Singapore are near their maximum economic output 
              capability - there is very little orange juice left to squeeze out of 
              these oranges."<br><br>He added: "Whether you look at GDP contribution, 
              employment, or tourism inducement, all these measures point to the IRs 
              as having already provided their maximum upward value to the economic 
              dynamic of the country."<br><br>An MTI spokesperson suggested as much 
              when she noted that while the IRs have opened more attractions since 
              their opening, "we also need to take into account the possibility of the
               IRs' novelty effect wearing off".<br><br></span><strong>Businesses rejoice</strong><span><br><br>Since MBS and RWS came to town, Singapore companies have clinched the bulk of the contracts awarded by the IRs.<br><br>To
               date, RWS said it has awarded some 750 contracts worth a total of S$800
               million to local firms, while MBS last year engaged Singapore-based 
              companies for nine out of 10 of its contracts with a combined value of 
              over S$350 million.<br><br>For just a single event at MBS, the orders 
              for Sing See Soon Florist &amp; Landscape can be as many as 456 table 
              flowers, said its Vice-President of Sales and Marketing Gracelyn Lin. <br><br>The
               90-year-old family-run business has dedicated one-eighth of its 55,000 
              sq ft office grounds in Punggol to store inventory for the IR. It has 
              also hired eight more workers (five are Singaporeans) and adopted a 
              computerised processing system after the company grew some 20 per cent 
              in its first year servicing MBS' contracts.<br><br>Transport company Sun
               Gee Travel runs MBS' airport shuttle service for guests and also sends 
              the IR's overnight shift workers home.<br><br>Its director, Mr Ethan 
              Neo, said the company has had to hire more than 20 new drivers after it 
              was engaged by MBS. The company also bought 10 customised luxury buses 
              specially for MBS' airport shuttle service. The image of his workers has
               also improved, said Mr Neo, adding that MBS required his drivers to don
               smart uniforms and look after the needs of its guests. <br><br></span><strong>Jobs for Singaporeans</strong><span><br><br>Close
               to three-quarters of RWS' 13,000 employees are Singaporeans and they 
              take up eight in 10 of its PME positions. For MBS, Singaporeans make up 
              more than three-fifths of the 9,400 full-time staff on its payroll.<br><br>Mr
               James Tan, 69, landed a job at the Pantages Theatre in RWS' Universal 
              Studios Singapore - after the former engineer was turned away by all 10 
              engineering firms he approached. He had retired for less than three 
              months when he got bored and decided to return to the workforce. <br><br>Mr
               Tan said: "Normally if you are over 50 years old, people say don't 
              bother going for interviews... I was quite surprised that RWS hired me."<br><br>For
               five days a week, nine-and-a-half hours each day, he makes sure the 
              premises are clean and orderly and equipment is working. He also does a 
              spot of ushering. Although his pay is not as high as he used to get at 
              his previous job, Mr Tan said the increments he got from RWS have been 
              "quite reasonable" and the bonus has also been "quite substantial".<br><br>The
               unique experience some jobs in the IRs offer was what made Ms Angeline 
              Foo, 33, leave the teaching profession after 13 years.<br><br>The 
              education manager at MBS' ArtScience Museum creates information material
               about exhibitions and customises tours and workshops to different 
              groups of visitors, such as schoolchildren.<br><br>For instance, she had
               to design a workshop for students that ties the Titanic exhibition the 
              IR had with the school's "English Language Week" - Ms Foo centred it 
              around the ship's postal services.<br><br>She said: "It's difficult to 
              find the same combination of work I do here elsewhere. It's really 
              exciting and challenging because there's more exposure - it's not just 
              physics and mathematics, there's Andy Warhol and Titanic - and you also 
              have to customise the experience for different visitors."<br><br></span><strong>Economic benefits vs social costs</strong><span><br><br>A
               gaming analyst, who declined to be named due to company policy, said 
              there is more room for the IRs to grow - if the government is inclined 
              to let the IRs expand.<br><br>Pointing out that the MBS is at 
              99.8-per-cent hotel occupancy, he said: "If Singapore's largest hotel is
               at the highest occupancy, then it means that if we want to grow the 
              business and create more jobs, more hotel rooms and facilities built 
              around the IRs can do it."<br><br>The analyst added that opening up the junket market "a lot more" is another possible way to grow the pie.<br><br>Any
               discussion on the economic benefits generated by the IRs has to involve
               the social costs of the presence of the casinos. There is no doubt that
               Singapore has experienced "higher levels of social costs" because of 
              the IRs, said Mr Galaviz.<br><br>"The question remains whether the 
              economic benefits of the IRs outweigh these social costs - it is a 
              question that probably can never be answered," he added. <br><br>Member 
              of Parliament Seah Kian Peng, who chairs the Government Parliamentary 
              Committee for Social and Family Development, stressed that economic 
              benefits are "just one part" of the equation. Adding that the social 
              costs need to be continually monitored, he nevertheless said: "The 
              non-casino business has been quite good and has created a lot of value. 
              If it can create jobs, without the ills, then they should bring in more 
              of that."<br><br>As the IRs become a mainstay of the Singapore economy -
               reaping the rewards as they provide another leg for the slowing economy
               - Mr Galaviz said: "It will be important for the citizens of Singapore 
              to put direct pressure on the executive management of the IRs to take 
              social responsibility to the Singaporean community more seriously, 
              rather than just pressuring the Government to do so on their behalf."<br><br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com">TODAY</a></span></p>
