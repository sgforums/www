              <p>European finance ministers ruled
              out efforts to spur the faltering economy and showed no signs of
              taking up a proposal by U.S. Treasury Secretary <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/timothy-geithner/">Timothy Geithner</a> to increase the firepower of the debt crisis rescue fund.</p>
              <p>Inviting Geithner to a euro meeting for the first time, the
              European finance chiefs said the 18-month debt crisis leaves no
              room for tax cuts or extra spending to spur an economy on the
              brink of stagnation.</p>
              <p>“We have slightly different views from time to time with
              our U.S. colleagues when it comes to fiscal-stimulus packages,”
              Luxembourg Prime Minister <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/jean--claude-juncker/">Jean-Claude Juncker</a> told reporters
              after chairing the meeting yesterday in Wroclaw, Poland. “We
              don’t see any room for maneuver in the euro area which could
              allow us to launch new fiscal stimulus packages. That will not
              be possible.”</p>
              <p>Europe’s economy will barely grow in the second half of
              2011, a casualty of the debt buildup that 256 billion euros
              ($353 billion) in aid for Greece, Ireland and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/portugal/">Portugal</a> has
              failed to extinguish.</p>
              <p>Geithner made little headway with a call for Europe to
              boost the capacity of the 440 billion-euro rescue fund, known as
              the European Financial Stability Facility, by enabling it to tap
              the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/european-central-bank/">European Central Bank</a>.</p>
              <h2>‘Non-Member’</h2>
              <p>Juncker said there was no discussion of expanding the fund
              today -- at least not while the American guest was in the room.</p>
              <p>“We are not discussing the increase or the expansion of
              the EFSF with a non-member of the euro area,” he said. German
              Finance Minister <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/wolfgang-schaeuble/">Wolfgang Schaeuble</a> spoke of a “very intensive
              but friendly discussion” and Austrian Finance Minister Maria
              Fekter found it “peculiar” to be lectured by the U.S., a
              country with higher aggregate debt than the euro area.</p>
              <p>Instead, the ministers recommitted to a July 21 decision to
              empower the fund to buy bonds in the primary and secondary
              market, offer precautionary credit lines and create a bank-
              recapitalization facility. The target for completing national
              approvals of the new powers slipped to mid-October.</p>
              <p>Geithner preached the lessons of the emergency banking
              support provided by the Treasury and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/federal-reserve/">Federal Reserve</a> in reaction
              to the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., mixing it with
              criticism of Europe’s crisis-management coordination.</p>
              <h2>‘Permanent Message’</h2>
              <p>Europe projects an image of “ongoing conflict” between
              national governments and the central bank, hampering efforts to
              put the economy on a sounder footing, Geithner said at a banking
              conference in between euro meetings.</p>
              <p>“Your financial challenges in Europe are eminently in your
              capacity to manage financially, you just have to choose to do
              it,” he said.</p>
              <p>Echoes of that appeal came from ECB President <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/jean--claude-trichet/">Jean-Claude
              Trichet</a>, six weeks from the end of an eight-year term as the
              overseer of euro <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/interest-rates/">interest rates</a>.</p>
              <p>“Our permanent message is of course to be ahead of the
              curve,” Trichet told reporters. “All that I heard goes in this
              direction. But the problems are not words, the problems are
              deeds.”</p>
              <p>The ECB was in the forefront again this week, joining other
              major central banks in offering dollar loans to ease a liquidity
              crunch that had confronted European banks with the highest costs
              for obtaining the U.S. currency in almost three years.</p>
              <p>Finance chiefs stuck by the view that commercial banks have
              enough capital to ride out the turbulence that has driven the
              bonds of <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/greece/">Greece</a>, the epicenter of the crisis, to less than half
              their nominal value.</p>
              <h2>‘Substantial Improvement’</h2>
              <p>Trichet hailed an accord between governments and the
              European Parliament that will tighten the euro area’s economic
              management and make it easier to impose sanctions on countries
              that overstep the budget-deficit limit of 3 percent of gross
              domestic product.</p>
              <p>The new rules, to take effect by Jan. 1, mark a
              “substantial improvement,” Trichet said.</p>
              <p>The debt overhang is taking its toll on the wider economy,
              the <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> says. It cut its growth forecast this
              week to 0.2 percent for the third quarter and 0.1 percent in the
              fourth, down from projections of 0.4 percent for both periods.</p>
              <p>“Recovery is stalling in the second half of the year, but
              we do not forecast a return to recession,” European Union
              Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said. “Uncertainty
              and stress in financial markets is now having negative
              ramifications in the real economy and is hampering our growth
              prospects.”</p>
              <h2>Greek Aid</h2>
              <p>Greece is now looking to the ministers’ next meeting, on
              Oct. 3, for a decision on the release of an 8 billion-euro aid
              installment. The loan would be disbursed by mid-October,
              enabling the government to pay its bills through the end of the
              year.</p>
              <p>The fate of future Greek loans remains tied up by a demand
              by <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/finland/">Finland</a>, one of <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/europe/">Europe</a>’s six AAA rated countries, that it
              receive collateral, potentially in the form of real estate or
              shares in nationalized Greek banks.</p>
              <p>While a final agreement eluded them, the ministers agreed
              on the principle that collateral must carry a cost, with the
              goal of limiting its use to Finland.</p>
              <p>“There is unity that collateral, first of all, must be
              open to all and, second, must cost something,” Austria’s Fekter
              said.</p>
              <p>On personnel matters, the officials set a Sept. 27 deadline
              for nominations to replace <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/germany/">Germany</a>’s Juergen Stark on the ECB’s
              Executive Board. Stark, an opponent of the bank’s bond-purchase
              program, said last week he will quit before his term ends in May
              2014.</p>
              <p>The only candidate so far is German Deputy Finance Minister
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/joerg-asmussen/">Joerg Asmussen</a>.</p>
