              <p>HE WAS their only child. And the parents of Second Lieutenant
                  Nicholas Chan Wei Kit, 21, are still unable to believe their son is
                  gone after his sudden death last Friday afternoon at Seletar Camp, in
                  which an army land rover rolled back, pinning him underneath.</p>
              <p>A recovery vehicle was dispatched, although the Defence Ministry
                  did not say how soon after the accident, to lift the vehicle off him.
                  But 2LT Chan died in hospital of his injuries - a little more than an
                  hour after he took over the vehicle.</p>
              <p>His mother, a housewife, received a call at their flat in Bukit
                  Batok, telling her that 'something had happened' to her son, and that
                  he was in hospital. Together with her husband, an engineer, they rushed
                  down. But by the time they got there, it was too late.</p>
              <p>The family is still questioning what led to 2LT Chan's death. After
                  all, he had been on military trips to Brunei and Taiwan, and had always
                  returned safely.</p>
              <p>His mother said she is still too distraught to probe much into the details of her son's death.</p>
              <p>But one thing they want to know is whether any other military
                  personnel were with their son at the time of the incident. The family
                  said Mindef has told them that it cannot reveal this now as the matter
                  is still under investigation.</p>
              <p>What little they know is that 2LT Chan - a newly commissioned
                  officer - was a Motor Transport Officer based in Jurong Camp. He had
                  gone to the Seletar camp that day to collect the vehicle.</p>
              <p>It is also not known if he was alone at the time but his mother
                  said he could not have gone to collect the vehicle alone because he did
                  not have a driving licence.</p>
              <p>In between sobs, she said that her son would come back almost every
                  night to the family home to have dinner before heading back to camp.
                  She had been expecting him as usual last Friday evening - but he never
                  showed up.</p>
              <p>2LT Chan's cousins described him as a 'happy-go-lucky' and
                  'playful' person, with a keen eye for fashion. He had a passion for
                  clothes, they said, and even chose to specialise in retail management
                  as a student at Temasek Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>Close friends also called him a 'cheeky and happy' man. Said his
                  former Basic Military Training platoon mate Audi Khalid, 21: 'He was
                  the life of the platoon.'</p>
