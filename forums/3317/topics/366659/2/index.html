              <p>errr according to the report, it was at the 30min mark when they tried to rescue him and by then, it was at that point when they "managed to lift the land rover". 1pm was when he actually was pronounced dead in the hospital.

              When life is concerned, I felt that they should just join force and lift the Land Rover just to get the victim out.  Why wait?  I am sure if the victim is your own brother you just dont care and will even use your own bare hand and seek the help of all there to just lift the Land Rover and  get him out immediately.  When earth quake strike, those relatives just act on impulse by using their bare hands to lift the rocks and manage to save the life of their love ones. NO TIME WASTED.  30 mins is very very long!
              
              So many life lost lately in the SAF... hope the the top authority  really look into it.
              
              Whats the point of always stating the SAF send their deepest condolence to the family members and we will honour and remembered  them.  
              
              You cant bring the victim  back to life!
              
              All of them  are precious sons of their parents and some one father or brother.  
              
              No wonder so many people think of migrating when they give birth to son.  So please dont blame them for making such decision.

              <p>Interesting. May I ask what's stopping you and NIkar3 from
                  leaving this country?</p>
              <p>I'm of the belief that SG will be a better place when all the
                  naturalised and natural residents who are dissatisfied leave the
                  country.</p>

              <p>umm.....what does a girl like you know about army things and politics? i suggest you play with that Hello kitty toy in your room. Anyone who isn't blind, and who has a mind of their own, will say without hesistation that SAF is full of crap and BS, and we all know that the gahmen love to screw things up here with their actions and policies.</p>
              <p>and btw, people like me and Xunni shouldn't leave SG.</p>
              <p>why? because we've done our NS and our fathers and forefathers didn't help the Japanese, unlike some guy by the name of Lee Kill You. If anyone should leave SG, it should be those guys.</p>
              <p>anyway, back to serious matters for us real men.</p>
              <p>what i find most disgusting about this incident is how those blardy by-stander soldiers can WAIT up to almost 1 hour and let the guy die slowly there while help arrives.</p>
              <p>HEY, SAF, SCREW YOU, OK???!!!!!</p>
              <p>somebody is pinned under the vehicle weighing more than 1 ton with his organs crushed and ribs all mashed, and blood flooding out of his mouth, and u guys all stand around there??!!! what were those guys doing back there? talking among themselves??!!!</p>
              <p>these blockheads......i wonder how our army can even survive a real war.</p>
              <p>in a situation like this, they don't even have common sense knn!!!!</p>
              <p>if someone is pinned under the vehicle, then gather all the guys out there and lift up the thing while another few guys quickly drag the injured person out.</p>
              <p>if they had done this, this 2LT won't have died.....he'll have serious injuries at most but won't die. and even if he did, he won't need to get tortured for 1+ hour before he finally die.</p>
              <p>all these red tape, bureacracy s*** is insane. SAF talks about giving the entire firepower of the SAF to the 3G soldier with the vast arrays of networks behind each soldier on the ground, but these clowns can't even save a single soldier.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">May I ask the SAF one question :</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In actual war, when a soldier is injured, or trapped under some vehicle but still save-able, will the SAF go through the 1+ hour of red tape, sign documents, do paperwork, before they finally despatch medical help to the victim????!!!</span></strong></p>
              <p>screw you farking clowns. I'm ashamed of even thinking of wearing some No 4 uninform after all this. Before SAF invest millions in equipment like hardware nerds and brag about how "each 3G soldier has the entire firepower of SAF behind him", they should learn some simple common sense which even a kid will know.</p>
              <p>at least if a kid sees his mother or sibling trapped under something, i'm sure they'll try their best to save them at the immediate moment.</p>
              <p>hey Xunni, i'm happy for you. At least now you're in a country with a real proper army with battle-hardened generals and troops, and not those full-of-brag, bulging-belly, spectacle-wearing nerdy paper armchair clowns we have over here.</p>
