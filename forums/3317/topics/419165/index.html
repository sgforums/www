              <p>THE parents of a teenage leukaemia patient, who died five days after he 
              was admitted into KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), are suing 
              the hospital and the attending doctor for alleged negligence.<br> <br> The couple are arguing that their son Cao Yuanchi, then 14, should have 
              received appropriate treatment sooner, given how gravely ill he was.<br> <br> The hospital and Dr Chan Mui Yoke, a senior consultant, are disputing the claims and mounting their defence.<br> <br> Yuanchi, a student at Raffles Institution (RI), was admitted to the 
              hospital on Jan 13 last year with bruises on his right ankle and knee, 
              rashes and fever.<br> <br> The diagnosis was confirmed two days later: He had a rare form of blood 
              cancer known as acute promyeloctic leukaemia (APL), and was slated for 
              chemotherapy and a treatment using all-trans retinoic acid (Atra).<br> <br> But the treatment plan, discussed with his parents on Jan 15 along with 
              the diagnosis, could not start immediately, because it emerged that the 
              boy was also battling a bacterial infection.<br> <br> That had to be treated first. The treatment for his leukaemia was thus pushed back to Jan 19.<br> <br> At the meeting with the doctor, his parents were told that Yuanchi faced a high risk of bleeding because of the APL.<br> <br> The boy never got started on chemotherapy on Jan 19 as scheduled. He 
              died the day before, from massive bleeding in the brain caused by the 
              leukaemia.<br> <br> His parents, Mr Cao Shengfa and Madam Ma Wenying, are now claiming that 
              they were not informed of the risks tied to withholding treatment for 
              APL for four days while their son was treated for the bacterial 
              infection.<br> <br> They said in court papers filed that the tests done by the hospital 
              should have made it clear that their son was a high- risk patient and 
              should have been appropriately treated.<br> <br> At issue in the case, therefore, is whether the teenager could have been treated earlier and his death avoided.<br> <br> Mr Cao and Madam Ma claimed through their lawyer Lee Mong Jen that the 
              standard textbook treatment for APL would have involved using Atra.<br> <br> The hospital and Dr Chan's position is that the case was a rare one and presented a number of challenges that had to be managed.<br> <br> The hospital, through its lawyer Kuah Boon Theng, said Dr Chan had taken
               into account the risk factors associated with the treatment, in setting
               up the treatment plan for Yuanchi.<br> <br> Dr Chan, according to defence papers filed by her lawyer Lek Siang 
              Pheng, has 15 years of experience with childhood cancers, and had 
              advised the parents of the risks.<br> <br> But Mr Cao and Madam Ma countered that the defendants did not arrange 
              for the Atra treatment, the standard medical treatment, until a private 
              paediatric oncologist the couple hired for a second opinion asked for it
               on Jan 18.<br> <br> The couple are seeking some $1.8 million in damages, including the loss of dependency claims.<br> <br> They pointed out that their only son was a scholarship student at RI and
               would have eventually supported them as a successful professional.<br> <br> A pre-trial conference was held at the High Court on Monday.<br> <br> The hospital's head of paediatric haematology and oncology, Associate 
              Professor Tan Ah Moy, said yesterday that all parties are considering 
              how the matter can be amicably resolved. Talks are on.<br> <br> Prof Tan, a senior consultant at the hospital, described APL as a rare, serious form of cancer which needs urgent tending to.<br> <br> But she added: 'Chemotherapy for all forms of leukaemia has its inherent
               risks. So it's important to stabilise the patient's condition before 
              starting treatment.'<br> <br> Source: Straits Times</p>

              <p>potential loss of income is very hard to ascertain . just like the hwachong scholar who went York university and get into trouble of child porn</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>the problem is ,is this very common in government hospital that they usually delay the treatment ,as the doctor usual response is "follow up within 3 weeks" ?</p>
              <p>even for malignant case</p>
              <p>i feel sorry for the child and the family but have to get to the bottom of matter at who is at fault ..</p>

              <p>it was the Edusave Scholarship for Independent Schools, dear. it's awarded for outstanding performance in the PSLE. there was no contract to begin with. even if there was, the death of the party receiving the scholarship would not amount to a breach of contract. check your facts before talking rubbish. thanks.</p>

              <p>i think that the parents is trying to claim some money over this incident. being mercenary as expected.</p>
              <p>people come and go, with some dying earlier than the rest.</p>
              <p>millions of people die from cancer every year, so what makes him so special for a multimillion dollar claim?</p>
              <p>usually, people who command that kind of money are the ones who have already "made it", that is, they are already top professionals in their field, and have established some sort of a reputation.</p>
              <p>this kid, even though he's a RI scholar, has not proved anything about his mettle.</p>
              <p>what qualifications does he has to back up the compensation claim? PSLE?</p>
              <p>he has not taken O lvl, or the equivilent for IP schools, A lvls nor secure a degree.</p>
              <p>his future is uncertain, just like any tom dick and harry of his age.</p>
              <p>so what if he's bright now, we have all seen late bloomers at some point of our life, and there are also people who flop in adulthood despite their achievements in childhood.</p>
              <p>for an average life insurance, you are only paid 100k upon death. and from observations rgding traffic accidents against students, the court usually order compensation of arnd 100k max for the victim.</p>
              <p>so does the parents think that just because their son is in RI, he's worth over 1 million, many times over the life of a non-elite school student?</p>

                  you the subject expert on his parents' intentions.</p>
              <p>I have PR friends who were convinced that he's settling in spore
                  for good. then one fine day, his family decided to uproot and move
                  to the US.</p>

              <p>paiseh, i typed wrongly - it should be "derogatory".</p>
              <p>yes, i do not deny that i might not know their true intentions, but i think you have misinterpreted the whole issue totally. you mentioned in an earlier post that millions of people die of cancer every year, so there is nothing that makes my friend so special. well, there is. in this case, the parents are not suing the hospital and the doctor not because he died, but because they feel that the doctor (and to a certain extent, the hospital) did not arrange the right treatment for their son, leading to his eventual death. in other words, they are of the opinion that it is malpractice on the part of the doctor. if he had died even after proper treatment was provided, im sure that they would not have sued the hospital and the doctor. i hope you can see the situation in a much clearer light now, and thanks for giving me an opportunity to clarify things.</p>

              <p>it was the Edusave Scholarship for Independent Schools, dear.
              it's awarded for outstanding performance in the PSLE. there was no

              receiving the scholarship would not amount to a breach of contract.
              check your facts before talking rubbish. thanks.</p>

              <p>there can be 3 cases:</p>
              <p>1) he go straight for chemo inspite of bacterial infection. he die from chemo, as his body's immune system is wrecked up.</p>
              <p>2) he go straight for chemo, but die from bacterial infection.</p>
              <p>3) he gets treatment for bacterial infection, but die of leukemia.</p>
              <p>in either of the 3 cases, you can argue for malpractice then, since the doctor is supposedly "delaying the administration of proper treatment"?</p>
              <p>imo, this is just an unfortunate case where the boy is too weak to fight his illness, and thus cannot be entirely the fault of the hospital and doctor.</p>
              <p>so what if the parents fail to win the lawsuit? Sue the school for sending the boy to OBS, which indirectly resulted in his death?</p>
