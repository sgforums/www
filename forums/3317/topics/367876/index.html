              <p><strong>Number of applications for financial assistance stabilises in Q2</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The number of Singaporeans seeking help to tide over
              the economic downturn seems to have stabilised in the second quarter of
              the year.
              <br> <br>Some Members of Parliament said on Sunday that applications for
              financial assistance have not gone up since a spike at the beginning of
              the year. But they also said this does not mean the worst is over.
              <br> <br>Dr Amy Khor, mayor of South West Community Development Council and
              Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Environment and Water Resources, is
              familiar with helping the needy, especially amid the current recession.
              <br> <br>She used to receive up to 1,200 applications for help in a month
              from Singaporeans affected by the downturn at the start of 2009. But
              this number has stabilised over the past two months.
              <br> <br>"The numbers are still high, but at least they are not
              increasing... Our additional programmes to help the retrenched workers
              and those who have suffered wage cuts will continue and we're also
              preparing ourselves, just in case there's a second wave of
              retrenchments if the economy does not improve," Dr Khor said.
              <br> <br>At the MacPherson Constituency, MP Matthias Yao has also seen a
              drop of 15 per cent in the number of needy cases asking for help,
              thanks to additional aid provided by welfare organisations.
              <br> <br>Mr Yao, who is the mayor of South East District, said: "On their
              own, (the organisations) have raised some funds and have been
              distributing a lot of benefits to the needy residents, so I would say
              that the needy residents in MacPherson are quite well taken care of."
              <br> <br>Union leaders said earlier that retrenchments in the second quarter
              are likely to be about a third of the 10,000 laid off in the first
              quarter. But the outlook for the rest of the year depends on the
              performance of companies in Singapore.
              <br> <br>Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong said: "A lot will depend on their
              abilities to secure orders for the third and fourth quarters. I think
              some of them have orders up to July, August or even September. But
              they're not able to see beyond that."
              <br> <br> The Manpower Ministry is expected to publish Singapore's second quarter employment data at the end of this month.
