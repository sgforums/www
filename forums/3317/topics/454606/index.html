              <p>After stiff competition of event space from Marina Bay Sands, Resorts World Sentosa and Expo (which is also upgraded recently) Suntec have no choice but to close their convention centre for necessary overhaul.</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE will temporarily lose a large amount of space for hosting events when Suntec Singapore's convention centre shuts for a major overhaul.<br><br>The six-month closure, which begins in October, aims to bring the 17-year-old venue up to date.<br><br>It will also mean less space for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions, otherwise known as Mice. Last year, it hosted 1,602 events, of which 40 per cent were international events.<br><br>Together with the three other major venues - Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Expo and Resorts World Sentosa - the four hosted more than 5,000 conventions last year.<br><br>But event organisers say the space crunch will be manageable, while competitors welcomed the business opportunity.<br><br>The $180 million overhaul is the 100,000 sq m centre's first major renovation since it opened in 1997. All seven floors will be spruced up, with a grand entrance added on Level Three, and restaurants and shops on Levels One and Two.<br><br>The number of meeting rooms will be boosted from 31 to 46, all of which will have Wi-Fi.<br><br>'We are mindful that cities around us are really upping the stakes,' said Suntec Singapore chief commercial officer Ong Wee Min. 'The building has served us very well, but needs refreshing in terms of layout and technology.'<br><br>Mr Kevin Tan of Cats Classified, which is part of Singapore Press Holdings, said he is worried that having one less convention centre could lead to higher prices in the industry.<br><br>But event organiser Singapore Exhibition Services said the space crunch should not be a problem as other venues can pick up the slack. The biggest events, such as the annual PC Show and the Natas travel fair, fall outside the six-month closure period.<br><br>Meanwhile, companies planning to hold events at Suntec were told of the closure at least a year in advance, giving them time to find alternative venues.<br><br>This August's Asia Oceania Geosciences Society exhibition will be held at Resorts World Sentosa instead.<br><br>Travel trade show ITB Asia will move to Marina Bay Sands, after being held at Suntec for the past four years. City Harvest Church, which holds its weekend services there, will be moving to the Singapore Expo.<br><br>Other events were brought forward to avoid the closure.<br><br>Asked if he thought the renovation would mean losing clients to competitors, Suntec's Mr Ong said: 'Of course we are worried. It would be overly arrogant if we said we didn't. But we are confident about our relationships.'<br><br>Resorts World Sentosa called the closure 'an excellent business opportunity', but pointed out that this was only short term.<br><br>'The mere transfer of events from one venue to another within the country does not grow the Mice pie for Singapore,' said assistant director of communications Robin Goh.<br><br>Meanwhile, Suntec City Mall is getting a $230 million facelift to provide about 15 per cent more retail space.<br><br>The mall, which is alongside the convention centre, is also set to have an outdoor dining and entertainment area on the third level, where the Sky Garden now is, new cafes and new-look atrium shops.<br><br>Swedish clothing line H&amp;M will be among the major brands at the revamped mall, said chief executive officer Yeo See Kiat of Suntec Reit, the mall's owner.</p>
