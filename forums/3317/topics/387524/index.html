              <p>A 26 year old Nigerian man, Amanchukwu Chukwuma has been charged for the muder of a 25 year old Singapore woman whose decomposed body was found abandoned in Bukit Panjang two weeks ago.</p>
              <p>Her identity was established on Tuesday through forensic DNA matching. She is Miss Liu Shujuan who worked as a casher at a Shop and Save supermarket at Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p>Amanchukwu came to Singapore at the end of 2007 on a “S” pass. It is not known what his previous occupation was. He did not leave Singapore after his pass expired in February 2008 and continued to live in Singapore where he met Miss Liu who became his girlfriend.</p>
              <p>According to neighbors, Miss Liu appeared to be passionately in love with her black boyfriend. The couple was often spotted chatting at Bukit Panjang Park till the middle of the night. However the relationship turned sour and ended in August last year.</p>
              <p>On 22 December 2009, Amanchukwu arranged to meet up with Miss Liu at Bukit Panjang park. A fight broke out between them and Amanchukwu allegedly beat Miss Liu to her death with his bare fists.</p>
              <p>For reasons yet to be revealed, he stripped her down to her panties and abandoned her corpse at the park. Amanchukwu did not leave the country after the murder and remained in Singapore where he was napped at his present girlfriend’s home in Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>An international drug syndicate run by Nigerians who preyed on Singapore women to serve as drug mules for them was busted last year in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Since 2005, at least 12 Singaporean women had been jailed in various countries for carrying drugs on behalf of their African boyfriends who vanished almost immediately when they got into trouble.</p>
              <p>Like Miss Liu, the 12 women share a similar profile: All hold Singapore passports, had no criminal record, were in their 20s or 30s, single and working in clerical, sales and service jobs.</p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, large number of foreigners have flocked to Singapore to find work including Africans especially from Nigeria.</p>
              <p>While in the past, foreigners are employed only in sectors shunned by Singaporeans, an increasingly number of “S” passes are given for “semi-skilled” workers like Amanchukwu whose jobs can be easily taken up by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>There are no statistics available on crimes committed in Singapore by foreigners including PRs. A few days ago, a 32 year old PRC lady was charged for operating brothels in two HDB estates.</p>
              <p>It is not known how they manage to get a permit to work in Singapore in the first place. Singapore’s octogenarian leader MM Lee Kuan Yew said recently that the ruling party is very “stringent” in picking only the “best” foreign “talents” to work and live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Despite rising resentment and anger among Singaporeans at the relentless influx of foreigners, the ruling party is adamant that Singapore needs foreigners to help boost its flagging birth rates.</p>
              <p>At the rate the ruling party is mass importing foreigners from elsewhere, Singaporeans may have to put up with newcomers from more “exotic” places like Nigeria and other African countries.</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The investigation of the double hit-and-run accident by a vehicle belonging to the Romanian embassy in Singapore by Romanian authorities which has already claimed the life of an innocent young man Mr Tong Kok Wai is likely to take “several years”.</p>
              <p>Romanian online news daily Click! quoted a statement from the Romania Jurse Court:</p>
              <p><em>“<span id="result_box"><span style="background-color: #fff;" title='„În toate aceste cazuri, pânÄƒ la formarea Comisiei rogatorii ÅŸi finalizarea anchetei vor trece luni dacÄƒ nu chiar ani", susÅ£in jurse judiciare.'>In all these cases involving letters of requests between two countries, the completion of the investigation will likely take several months, if not years.”</span></span></em></p>
              <p><span><span style="background-color: #fff;" title='„În toate aceste cazuri, pânÄƒ la formarea Comisiei rogatorii ÅŸi finalizarea anchetei vor trece luni dacÄƒ nu chiar ani", susÅ£in jurse judiciare.'>Romanian diplomat Dr Silviu Ionescu has emerged as the prime suspect in the accident with many eye-witnesses coming forward to describe the features of the driver.</span></span></p>
              <p>He repeatedly denied that he was involved in the accident. Speaking to Click!, he said:</p>
              <p><em>“The press is free to report on anything it wants. I do not have any co</em><em>mment and it is not important anyway. All that matters is to establish the truth. The fact remains that the embassy car was stolen and I was not in it at the time of the accident.”</em></p>
              <p>On the decision of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request the Romanian Prosecutor’s Office to investigate the accident in Singapore, Dr Silviu said it is a normal procedure in such cases.</p>
              <p><em>“We are all ready to support the investigations carried out by the Prosecutor’s Office,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Dr Silviu has since been recalled from his diplomatic position in Singapore by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to aid in the investigations. He now says he would “assist” in the accident investigations from Romania.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Dr Silviu was whisked to a “secret” location outside Romania’s capital Bucharest by agents from the Foreign Intelligence Service <span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" title="Silviu Ionescu, suspectat de lovirea mortalÄƒ a unui singaporez, a fost dus de un jeep oficial la o locaÅ£ie a SIE">or Serviciul de Informatii Externe (SIE)</span></span> for questioning. It is not known if he has returned home yet.</p>
              <p>With the case entirely in the hands of the Romanian prosecutors, it seems that Singapore no longer has the power or right to prosecute and punish the culprit though the crime was committed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Nearly a month after the fatal accident, Singapore police is still “investigating” the matter and the identity of the driver remains a mystery.</p>
              <p>There are no official statements from Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs either other than a laughable remark by Foreign Minister George Yeo describing the accident as “very bad”.</p>
              <p>The prosecutors in the Prosecutor-General Office in Romania has set up a commission rogatory to initiate investigations.</p>
              <p>This means that the statements of witnesses can be taken in Singapore and filed in Romania without them going all the way to Romania more than 10,000 kilometers away in the other half of the globe.</p>
              <p>It is also possible for Romanian officials to travel to Singapore to assist in the ongoing “investigations” by the unusually “efficient” Singapore police force which had strangely allowed Dr Silviu to leave the country three days after the accident without impounding his passport or informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply for a waiver of the suspect’s diplomatic immunity.</p>
              <p><em>(If Dr Silviu has criticized the ruling party or judged to have “interfered” in Singapore politics, his diplomatic immunity will probably be waived immediately and he will  be booted out of the country in double-quick time.)</em></p>
              <p>Due to the complexities and intricacies involved in going through the various diplomatic and official channels to conduct a proper investigation into the case, it is likely to take a long time to complete by the time which the culprit may already have died from natural causes.</p>
              <p><em>(Dr Silviu appears to be obese and being diabetic, there is a good chance he may suffer a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years)</em></p>
              <p>For example, the Romanian prosecutors will have to submit an official request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore police and other agencies to even come to Singapore to investigate the case.</p>
              <p>A lot of time will be wasted just on waiting for official replies from one party to another and going through all the bureaucratic red-tape while the Romania and Singapore governments play “Tai-Chi” together.</p>
              <p>Though Romania is a member of the European Union, there is no extradition treaty between Singapore and Romania which means that there is no way for Singapore to bring Dr Silviu Ionescu back here to be tried even if it wants to prosecute him.</p>
              <p>Given the rife corruption and messy politics in Romania, it is not impossible that the perpetrator of this hideous crime be let off the hook with a couple of thousands of euros.</p>
              <p>Furthermore it is strange that nobody from Singapore or Romania has come forward to reveal the identity of the culprit after so long when the evidence has been pretty obvious from the testimonies given by eye-witnesses.</p>
              <p>For the family of the deceased Mr Tong Kok Kai who have been hoping for a swift justice, they are likely to be disappointed.</p>
              <p>The case will drag on and on for years till it fade away completely from the collective consciousness of the public which will help negate the fallout for both the Romania and Singapore governments for their ineptitude to punish the culprit and deliver swift justice to the families of the victims.</p>
              <p><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p><em>It now appears increasingly likely that the case will not be solved soon and the culprit may not have to pay a price for his crime in his lifetime. Mr Tong’s family may like to seek legal advice to sue the Romania government in a EU court rather than to wait for several years to seek redress from Romania’s justice system which is a suspect given the prevailing circumstances in the country. Readers who are familiar with the EU Commission, please offer your frank views here.<br></em></p>

              <p>Four men were caught on camera openly molesting a bikini-clad woman at Sentosa's countdown party.</p>
              <p>The incident took place on a stage in front of a crowd. Many onlookers were captured filming and taking photographs of the incident.</p>
              <p>Yet no one helped her.</p>
              <p>The girl appears to be intoxicated and from her actions, it seems like she could not fend for herself.</p>
              <p>Several internet users highlighted this video which was posted on YouTube.com and said it occurred at the countdown beach party at Sentosa.</p>
              <p>Netizens are currently debating the incident. Some have expressed their anger towards those who did not help her but seemed content filming the incident.</p>
              <p>Netizen Thinkoutloud said "Its becoming sick that people are more concerned on watching and video taping rather to stand up and help.</p>
              <p>"A simple shout to call for police or asking them to stop seem suddenly an impossible task.</p>
              <p>In an email to citizen journalism website, STOMP, Veronica, said, "No one was there to help her but yet were taking photos and videos of the incident!"</p>

              <p>Four men were caught on camera openly molesting a bikini-clad
              woman at Sentosa's countdown party.</p>
              <p>The incident took place on a stage in front of a crowd. Many
              onlookers were captured filming and taking photographs of the
              incident.</p>
              <p>Yet no one helped her.</p>
              <p>The girl appears to be intoxicated and from her actions, it
              seems like she could not fend for herself.</p>
              <p>Several internet users highlighted this video which was posted
              on YouTube.com and said it occurred at the countdown beach party at
              Sentosa.</p>
              <p>Netizens are currently debating the incident. Some have
              expressed their anger towards those who did not help her but seemed
              content filming the incident.</p>
              <p>Netizen Thinkoutloud said "Its becoming sick that people are
              more concerned on watching and video taping rather to stand up and
              help.</p>
              <p>"A simple shout to call for police or asking them to stop seem
              suddenly an impossible task.</p>
              <p>In an email to citizen journalism website, STOMP, Veronica,
              said, "No one was there to help her but yet were taking photos and
              videos of the incident!"</p>
              <p>Others insist the girl is at fault for dressing in such a manner
              and getting drunk. Said netizen ryooiken74, "Do not put the blame
              on the man only, the women should shoulder some blame too.</p>
