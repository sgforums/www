            <div class='col-md body'>I woke up on the couch alone in the morning; Desmond, David and Angel were gone. I washed up and was about to leave when I saw the keys on the bar counter. The keys are for the apartment. I took it, looked the door, and drove home.<br><br>Packing my stuff as I tell my landlord that IÂ’ll be moving out the same day, she was astonished. Â“Why? I thought you loved the place here. You can see the sea from your living room window.Â” The lady asked. I smiled at her and told her I lost my job. Not wanting to impose any inconveniences that may occur, I decide to move out. She nodded and offered me to come back anytime I want to. I thank her for her kindness and she left.<br><br>As I pack my stuff into boxes, I recounted the events that happened in this small apartment. Steven and I were like a newly married couple when we rented this place. He would cook dinner every now and then, when I canÂ’t leave my job assignments. We would sit on the couch facing the sea, and talk about our future. I canÂ’t resist the tears from falling as I looked back. All this is history, I need to stand up on my feet again, I thought to myself.<br><br>I took all my stuff to the car and give the apartment keys to the landlady. As much as I canÂ’t bear to leave the place, I have to. This is the end of one chapter in my life.<br><br>Desmond wasnÂ’t home yet when I moved in. As usual I moved into the room that he had always reserved for me. We never slept in the same room, except when the Â“needÂ” arises. I unpacked my stuff and listen to the answering machine.<br><br>Â“Natty, IÂ’ll be home by seven, want to take you out for dinner. Be ready by then.Â” Desmond left me this message. I looked at the clock hanging on the wall above the plasma TV. It read 4.30pm. I have plenty of time left.<br><br>I went into the open kitchen and opened the fridge. There, I saw a bouquet of blue roses. My favorite. I took them out and saw a small card in it. Written was, Â“No matter what happens, IÂ’m always here for you. Yours, DesmondÂ”<br><br>I canÂ’t believe that after all IÂ’ve done to him, he still has feelings for me. I decided to brace myself and start afresh. I put the roses into a flask and placed them on the dressing table. I then took a shower and relax myself a little.<br><br>Looking around the apartment, I realized that photographs of us taken during holidays and short trips overseas were still in the study room. He had never once forgotten about me and never once gave up.<br><br>It was about 5.30pm when I start to think about what to wear for dinner. I opened my wardrobe and took out a white cotton dress, a white sleeveless knitted top, a mini skirt, and a pair of jeans. I decided on the white cotton dress and matched it with a shawl and a small handbag. I got dressed up and pulled my hair back into a sleek ponytail. Next was to put on light make up. At about 6.45pm, I was ready to go.<br><br>At about 6.55pm, Desmond came home. Â“Hey, I see you are ready to go.Â” He smiled at me. Â“Thank you for the roses and offering me a place to stay.Â” I said as I hugged him.<br><br>He left his briefcase on the bar stool and led me out of the apartment. Desmond is a gentleman, he never mistreats a lady and he is always that accommodating. Although in the past, we do have arguments, he was the one giving in to me. Allowing me to do whatever I want in my life. He seldom complains and at most, all he wants was me to listen to him, which I never did. I took him for granted and now I am not going to repeat my mistake.<br><br>As he drove into the restaurantÂ’s parking lot, he told me, Â“Natty, IÂ’m not going to say that things is going to be well in the future. I want you to be happy. Whatever the problem is, talk to me. IÂ’ll listen to you.Â” He is always that understanding to me. I smiled and replied, Â“Teddy, IÂ’m going to brave myself against all the problems that will be coming. IÂ’ve sort out my thinking. And I know that you will support me in whatever I do.Â” He nodded. Teddy, the name I used to call him, when we were together, just came out of my mouth so easily. I wonder if he will feel awkward. Â“IÂ’m sorry. I shouldnÂ’t have called you that.Â” I apologized, with glistering tears in my eyes. I regretted not treasuring him and I feel guilty seeing him. Â“Silly, donÂ’t be,Â” He took my hand in his. Â“You are always my Natty.Â” He wiped off my tears and gave me his signature wink, which always make me laugh.<br><br>Dinner was great. We had mindless chatter over what we did in the past and shared some personal jokes. It was good being with him. I just feel at ease with him. He gave me the security that I wanted all along. He still treats me like a little girl who needs to be protected.<br><br></div>
