            <div class='col-md body'>Just came back from a wedding dinner. It was the mom's youngest brother's big day.<br><br>I haven't been to one for a long time. The last one was held at the basketball court of a cummunity centre.<br><br>This time it was held at a hall in IMM, not that it matters much to me.<br>Seems that all wedding dinner starts with a video.<br><br>The video was very nicely shot. While watching, it suddenly dawned on me that those events could actually happen to me in the future.<br><br>Sitting in the bridal car going to the bride's house to win her over.<br>Briding her sister and friends in front of the locked grilled door. I think my uncle took out two more orange notes in addition to the hong baos to appease the angry sisters.<br><br>Oh no. That wasn't enough. The next thing they made him do sent a chill down my spine. They made him drink some unidentified substances. Good heavens. He could have been killed in action (KIA).<br><br>Of course after entering the house, entering the room would be the next task. This time he sang a song at the door. It worked. Must be the effects of the orange notes just now.<br><br>The video then moved on the clips showing the couple serving tea to their parents and siblings.<br><br>One thing to remember for wedding dinners is to get a good compere. Someone who can entertain the audience. The one today wasn't that bad. Well, he could talk, but he can't entertain that much.<br><br>The first dish served was a cold dish. One of the item was small octupus, red in colour. Somehow, the first dish wasn't that good. Maybe it's because it's cold.<br><br>The second was sharks' fins soup. A typical dish. poor sharks.<br>The dishes weren't actually that good. Probably because they weren't hot.<br><br>Another thing I learnt today is: Don't sit with small kids. They will entertain themselves using you. And being small kids they are, they are like super glue when you don't want them to.<br><br>Throughout the whole dinner, I can see kids running around amok, clocking high speeds. Following behind them are their parents.<br><br>Some are seen crawling on the carpet as if they are under crossfire or are doing some navy seal training.<br><br>One thing to note: Kids attract kids.<br><br>There was this group of kids that run from my right to my left. Then they came back, with one more new member added to their team. The cycle continues until all kids leave their seats.<br><br>I can also see parents holding their babies walking around while their babies are screaming their heads off.<br><br>If only babies could talk, then we will know what they want. But judging from the expression, I can estimate why they are crying. The soft drinks were too much of a temptation. Besides, is it a norm to serve Mirinda Orange during wedding dinners?<br><br>Of course, the bride and bridegroom would definitely have a chance to make a fool of themselves on the stage.<br><br>They played the old show-us-how-you-propose-to-your-wife game. Sad to say, they actually played that badly. Maybe next time, there should be a script and a better director.<br><br>The dinner ends at 1100pm. It was then that I noticed that all the male guest wore shirts. I wore a t-shirt. Next time, another time.<br>Wedding brings people to another phase in life. There would be more responsiblilties and a higher level of commitment from that day onwards.<br><br>Meanwhile, I'm still thinking of the torturous route to winning the bride over in the video.<br><br>I hope it's all worth it.<br></div>
