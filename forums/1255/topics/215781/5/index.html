The mind relates to the 3 sentiments at different situations and is triggered at different intensity. A photo easily triggers a thrill when a person who has never been to the Grand Canyon sees one shot for the first time. For anyone who has been there and taken photos of the scene it will take more than the Grand Canton to thrill him. It may even take more than the roller coastal ride for that person.<br><br>Point blue's work has earned his respect from many but not all are keen in going his path in photography. At this point i will not comment more since its obvious that you are<br><br>COMPARING AN APPLE WITH A DURIAN...comparing a snapshot with a work of art.<br><br>Its easy to comment on thrills, melancholy and joy. Like here i will write<br><br>"Point blue's art and work involving photography's superb, amazingly captured to provoke the feeling of the vast unknown and the joy of a curiosity fulfilled within a man."<br><br>However the true level of appreciation of an individual will only be known if shows his own work and photo. How can anyone who has never tried digital photography before comment on how good the work of an art is? How unfair to compare a durian with an apple?<br><br>Film photography is classic now though it will not be replaced entired soon.

You do not need to check the photo's properties tab. Its a very same 'don't care' attitude you have shown with my thread when i alreay knew how to take photos at different angles.<br><br>If you are still so self-centred and indulge in your own photos not wanting to accept comments on what they really are you can never improve.

If they aren't voyeurish what are they? An art? My fart!<br><br>What pm? Did you send to the wrong guy? There is nothing left to discuss in this thread and i have stopped posting photos, which is the main aim of any discussion here. Further comments shall be taken by the trhead starter as an initiation to cause more flaming.<br><br>You are not even fit to mention my names and my photos, let alone question about challenging me.<br><br>Seriously i feel that you have problem coming to terms with the fact that years of photography or so you choose to call are actually nothing. You have problems with anger management too. Its the photos any rookie with only 2 months of practice can take. An any rookie can take it better than you with a digital camera of a lower grade of specification than yours.<br><br>And see you keep coming back and i seriously think you missed my photos a lot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
