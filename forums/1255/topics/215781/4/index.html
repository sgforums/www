The shooter was standing near to the right of a lamp post probably on an overhead bridge so to give a lightened effect on the left of the photo. Photo looks grainy and was probably shot at 400 or higher or with a camera that is uable to cope with grains at higher ISO level. Its amazingly ignorant when one can actually accomplished the similar thing with lesser grains and at a lower ISO setting. For this photo, any rookie can do it with a tripod and a point and shoot digital camera.<br><br><a href="http://images.imagefap.com/images/full/19/155/1550732437.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.imagefap.com/images/full/19/155/1550732437.jpg</a><br>This is a macro shot of a public tap. Most probably taken in a public toilet on a bright day. I could use it for the poster on our next water conservation campaign.<br><br><a href="http://www.imagefap.com/image.php?id=730411801" rel="nofollow">http://www.imagefap.com/image.php?id=730411801</a><br>There is nothing jaring about this one. In full color its just like any other photo taken by a bunch of students during lunch or teabreak. Since there's nothing to do why not take out a camera and take a shot or two of our lunch packs? In full color the right side of the photo should have been very dark and underexposed. Photoshop or take it in B&amp;W should fool an average person into the artistic effeect the photographer's trying to bring out.<br><br>Now that you have finally shown your photos, welcome Pengiun no matter who u r in the real world, you have truely joined the ranks of the casual point-and-shoot digital photographers.<br><br>We had a good laugh this morning, a real good one indeed.

In fact i will tell him the same after seeing his photos. Besides amortified Penguin not only has this problem, he has problem with his attitude too. According to his posts he was expecting his own photos to be masterpieces and even dared to use it to bring forth his point in the discussion as if he is some genius. But to me the photos are nothing. The shots are so common taken on schools's sports day, during course work, teabreaks, on a late night home from school, in the school's toilet, on the way home from Tampines....<br><br>Why do you think that i will not know how to shoot at different angles? Have you read my postings on the very first page when i mentioned taking still life and scenery is my own recommendations for beginners since the objects tends to stay put and the shooter can take his time and take numerous shots of the same thing? What makes you think that i will not go read books and surf online for tips and sample photos of other photographers? A photo tells a lot so you can always learn from them. A photo tells a thousand words.<br><br>No one taught me how to sketch and i have enjoyed sketching for a period of time between 1990 ~1998 without attending any course or spent any money (except for the tools). I read books from other artists and look at their illustrations. A picture tells a lot and i can see very much of it will apply for a photographer at the beginner stage. The equipment will come later.<br><br>Perhaps the advices you guys have given are for intermediate and advance levels. Please save them for the intermediate and advance. I am a beginner for now and i am one who prefers to do it my own way. I am not rushed to reach any levels anytime soon.<br><br>All my snapshots have dates and photo datas so if you want to know how much i have progressed wait and see. Its too early at one photo a day to pass judgement.<br><br>For those of you who sincerely wish to help please start a thread of your own and post your photos and shooting tips there. Save the photo editing skills. I don't photoshop.<br><br>Why state the obvious when so many (as i can see now) were unable to see the unknown?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
