But I think need more colours.</div></blockquote>I hope i could, not until the haze clears i guess. It makes everything tinted and faded. I do not own any lighting photography hardware so in situations where the lighting is low it can be difficult to capture a colorful picture with my camera. I don't believe in photoshop unless its used to make a client or customer happy, sell it for money. My photos should be a representation of what the true object is- that's one of my very own protocol.</div>

Now you understand what happens when a musician shred a guitar? In my opinion only desperade photographers trying to sell their photographs photoshop. A true photographer capture a scene as it was.

If you are just an amateur or is taking up photography as a pastime hobby you should not have any stress with it. Why let it stress you out just because you can't take a photo that is superb or which someone commented to be bad? Just take your camera and go out there and shoot.</div>

Was it the side fins? Was it the wheel? Or was it the car body itself? I guess it should be the fins since it is in focus while the wheel is out of focus. If you have set the focusing distance anywhere up to 3.0m the wheel would have been in focus too. So what, its your call in the photo shoot, so just be it!<br><br>The lamp post look better in black and white. In a normal full color shoot it would have been dull, faded or even washed out if your were in an over or under exposed situation and you have no intention in using EV correction. In fact black and white for that lamp post photo should have masked out all other imperfections. So what. its your call in the photo shoot, so just let it be!</div></blockquote>The subject is the fins of the car...haix...<br>BTW for the flower,i didnt use the macro or auto mode,rather i switched to manual focus and put it to the minimium..hence like so..<br><br>Guess i have much to learn as well<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
