Enjoy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>"RRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG"<br>The alarm clock sounded vehemently despite putting it on snooze again.<br><br>"Damn! I am late yet again!"<br><br>Hurriedly, i took a quick shower and put on the clothes still on the laundry basket.Breakfast has been set and everyone appeared to have left the house.I hurriedly rushed to the carpark.<br><br>"What! No car again?How am i going to reach school for crying out loud?"<br><br>I took no chances and rushed to the bus stop hoping,praying and wishing that my bus would come soon.I thought i saw Dad in the car but i was too nervous to be having doubts.<br><br>My bus came and 2 hours later, i found myself sitting at the back of Accounting class half an hour late.<br><br>"Why am i the only late person here? Please let there be another latecomer"<br><br>True enough, someone knocked and the door creaked open. Under the shower of the sunlight rays, basked in the glow of her radiance, stood a girl beautiful enough to carry me off to Neverland.<br>The teacher,stunned yet surprised, introduced to us the new student she has been talking about the past week.<br><br>"Je mÂ’appelle Isabelle", she muttered in fluent French. (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">my name is Isabelle</span></span>)<br><br>"You can take a seat beside Andy here.You don't mind, do you?", the teacher snided to me with a wry smile.<br><br>"I'll be glad too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ", i replied with eagerness.<br><br>Her face was flawless with complexion of clay with stardust. Tall, slender yet maintained her elegant poise. I was too awed to be concentrating right now.<br><br>A million glances and an hour later, the class ended and i learnt nothing once again but the meaning of beauty.<br><br>My friends were busy asking me where to go to lunch but Isabelle just stood there, obviously clueless what she was supposed to do.<br><br>"Aimeriez-vous aller au dÃ©jeuner avec nous?" i asked her. (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Would you like to go to lunch with us</span></span>?)<br><br>She was obviously stunned that i spoke in her tongue but she cooly replied.<br><br>"Non remercie. Mon papa me choisit en haut"(<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">No thanks. My dad is picking me up</span></span>)<br><br>"Prendre le Soin et vous Voit" i told her with a wink in my eye. (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Take care and see you</span></span>)<br><br>As i entered the lift lobby, the sound of a car braking filled me. It must be her dad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The rest of the day with Isabelle went fine. Talked briefly about her life in France and her transition to Singapore. Little did i know that she owned a vineyard there.That struck a chord but i couldn't place where.A day with a beautiful girl like her makes me look forward to come to school early.<br><br>Thinking of sending her home, i called up my dad and asked  whether he will be picking me up later from work.<br><br>"Dad, will you be picking me up from school? My friend may need a lift home", i asked excitedly.<br><br>"Sorry son, i have an important appointment later from work. Where are you schooling again, Son?",he answered.<br><br>"Uhhh its ok, Dad", i replied dejectedly.<br><br>I was dejected.We hardly talked at home and he has his own life and i have mine.<br><br>"Je suis dÃ©solÃ© mais mon papa est un petit morceau occupÃ©", i told her sadly (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">I'm sorry but my dad is a little bit busy</span></span>)<br><br>"C'est bon.Je peux parler anglais un morceau Ã  propos", she told me. (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">its ok. I can speak english a little bit by the way</span></span>)<br><br>"Oh ok then. I see you tomorrow"<br><br>The whole evening, i was fidgety. I kept thinking about her and had feelings of missing her. I told myself whether she is my dream girl or not. Everywhere i looked lay a figment or a mirage of her face.<br><br>That evening, during dinner as usual, having dinner with my dad and brother. I cropped something up at the dinner table.<br><br>"Guys, I just met the most beautiful person in the whole world", i swooned.<br><br>"She spoke the language of love and i think i...", i wanted to continue but..<br><br>"Young man, don't you think you are too young to fall in love. Besides, i also saw the most beautiful girl in the world too", he interrupted.<br><br>"Again?", my brother and i remarked in unison.<br><br>Ever since, our mother passed away, we have grown accustomed to our dad's philandering ways but he has yet to remarry.<br><br>After dinner, we proceed to our own activities. My brother was busy chatting with his girl online. Dad went out to meet someone while here i am lying on my bed thinking of someone.<br><br>A few hours later, the phone rang.<br><br>"Hello?", i asked.<br><br>"Andy, i won't be coming home tonight but please remind your brother that i have reserved a table at the same restaurant for an important dinner and announcement", my dad told me.<br><br>"No problem at all", i replied.<br><br>Even while sleeping, i kept dreaming about her.<br><br>The next morning....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I made sure i woke up early and be on time today. My hair is combed and gelled up and i arrived early for class hoping to be the first to greet the belle of the class.<br><br>Surprisingly, my dad had left early for work today and took the car with him, leaving me no choice but to take the bus for 2 consecutive days.<br><br>Being half an hour early before a morning class may prove to be a costly mistake because no one would like to bask under the hot morning sun and beaded droplets of sweat cascading your face.<br>Still, i persisted to meet her first.<br><br>Seconds ticked by and the heat became intolerable, i decided to take a cool cup of Coke to quench my thirst and cool down my body.<br><br>"Ker-plunk. 10 cents. Ker-plunk. 20 cents. Ker-plunk. 30 cents."<br><br>"Damn! I am short of 10 cents,"i muttered silently as i search both the pockets of my jeans.<br><br>"Ker-plunk.Swoooooooosssshhhh"<br><br>"There you go.10 cents"<br><br>A familiar voice protruded heavenly to my tender eardrums as i was still searching for the much-needed 10 cents.<br><br>I turned around and there she was. The goddess of my love. The guardian of my dreams. The ink in my printer. The blood in my veins.It was Isabelle.<br><br>"Errr. Thanks. You just arrived?" i asked trying to mask the embarrasment earlier.<br><br>"Yeah. My dad sent me here before going to work. What about you?" she asked me temporary blinding me with the glow from her pearlies.<br><br>"My dad? Lets not talk about him. He doesn't care about my family. Hey! Thats the teacher. I think we better go in now" i answered rather emotionlessly."<br><br>It was fun having her as my classmate and new friend. We helped one another and even shared some secrets though we knew each other for only 2 days.<br><br>During lunch, i couldn't help but ask her if she had any plans tonight.<br><br>"Hey Isabelle. I'm just wondering whether you are free tonight? I kinda wanna ask you out for dinner", i asked after finally mustering enough courage.<br><br>"Sorry Andy. I have plans tonight with my family. Some other day perhaps", she replied.<br><br>"Its ok. Maybe you can treat me to dinner first. Haha.", i teased.<br><br>The whole day went great and alas, it was time for us to go our separate ways once again. I remembered about the dinner Dad had asked us to go and immediately called my brother so could  meet him first before going to La Creatuix De Pignon at Shenton Way.<br><br>We arrived at the restaurant rather early as there were not many patrons yet. I asked the waiter for the reservations made by my dad and was shocked to see him requesting for a table of 5 despite having only 3 people in our family.<br><br>We were ushered to our seats and waited rather patiently for my dad and his guests to appear. Never did we expect playing arm wrestling in a posh restaurant would be a great idea and a great time killer.<br><br>"ANDY!!!"<br><br>I turned around and i had the shock of my life to see Isabelle here as well.<br><br>"Having dinner Isabelle?" i asked excitedly.<br><br>"Yup. With my family. What about you?"she answered.<br><br>"Yeah! With my family too", i told her.<br><br>"There comes my dad!", i remarked.<br><br>"There comes my dad!", Isabelle remarked.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: red;">---to be continued----</span></strong></span></div>
