            <div class='col-md body'>I used to be from the hospitality industry (F&amp;B) but have switched to a desk-bound job. I never hated my job then and never felt that it was a 'low' class/status kind of job. So I served and I smiled at work.<br><br>NOW? I dread dinning out. Imagine the kind of price u got to pay for a meal in a restaurant. Of course there are reasons why people still choose to dine out. It could be a birthday celebration, Father's day, Mother's day, etc, etc,etc.....Whatever the reasons may be, we expect some kind of dinning experience and sad to say.....most of the time its a bad one, at least for me. I can't remember when was the last time I had truly enjoyed a dinner out in a restaurant, be it the food that was good or the service that was remarkable.<br><br>Just last night we decided to patronise Sakae Sushi at TPY after a movie. Could have just settle for Macdonalds or Long John Silver but since I haven't had a nice dinner out with my baby and my brudder so we decided to indulge ourselves this time. We ended up having a "mute and deaf" service. Hahah that's what my baby calls it. There was no welcome, no smile, no service except the food arrives at our table. In fact the food was not even up to standard. One particular order actually came cold (its not a sushi order). I rejected it and demanded for a new plate. Some might feel that I have over-reacted say think that, hey its just one dish why make a fuss out of it. But the point here is, this shouldn't have happened at all in the first place. The was no sorry and explanation why the dish came cold even though we didn't demand for one. What happened to even basic manners?<br><br>Anyway, bottomline is I rather eat at kopitiam lor. I think sometimes I get better service there and I'm serious. I am sure my brudder can vouch for me. If I patronise a particular coffee shop often enough, trust me, the kopi boy can remember what I usually drink lor and the drinks would come without me ordering.<br><br>I really dread the next dinner out in a restaurant. Not only the food may not be nice, the service would probably sucks too. Hey, bare in mind that I am not asking for a 5star service here. Just the basic manners and the smiles. Trust me, all these does make the dinning experience so much better. Of course this is just one area of customer service which many Singaporean failed in. Its the same in the retail market, Call Centre, Help Desk, etc, etc, etc.....Customer Service?.....<strong>NONE</strong>!</div>
