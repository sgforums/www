            <div class='col-md body'>Ramblings I<br><br>I wonder if I will ever be able to find the guy of my dreams, even if I do find him, would I be the girl of his dreams? I must strive to be the best in everything so that I can be his dream girl and not let anyone down again.  But it really is so difficult to be somebodyÂ’s dream girl.  It really takes a lot to be the perfect one. ThereÂ’s so much that I have to do and everything requires a lot of perseverance.<br><br>I really think going overseas will be good for me. Only then will I truly know whether I can make it by myself, and also where in my life I need to make improvements on.  I need to learn how to handle situations, how to control my own actions and emotions. I need to grow up, and not think only of myself.<br><br>Love, what is true love? Will I be able to find true love? Or will I be like the many who marry thinking that they are right for each other and yet in the end they split up? I really donÂ’t want my marriage to end up wrecked.  If that happens, it would probably be the end of me.<br><br>If only relationships grew stronger and not weaker. Why canÂ’t everything be simple? Why must relationships be so complicated? IÂ’m really sick of leading a complicated life in a complicated world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to add my 2 cents worth.. why don't you just relax, take a step back and look at things from a different perspective/angle? maybe that would help.. talking to your bf might also be a good thing since it would clear that out of the way and leave you fresh to handle other things like your deferred papers as well.. good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
