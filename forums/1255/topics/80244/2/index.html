            <div class='col-md body'>agree...among all the desaturated pics in this album, this is also the pic i like. Apart from the effects you wanted to create (which you've very nicely achieved it btw)...it's also the couple's pose and body language that attracted me. They oozed love, faith and cherish for each other in this pic. I actually thgt that the pic felt like as if they're looking back from a distance at their old self (ie. singlehood) and saying "Goodbye...Dun worry, we'll hold each other and build a beautiful life forever. This is a promise...our promise."

On this photo alone:<br><br>1) Composition - good, bride looked relax and sweet.<br>2) Exposure - a little too much contrast / over-exposed (could be due to the CPU screen).  The contrast on the veil took a little attention from the bride's face, not too sure if actual photo has this effect.<br>3) Lightings - reflector (if you are using) is not well balanced.  Could be due to the exposure again.<br><br>Overall - good (unless you are a professional!)<br><br>btw: wrong hair-do, or maybe a tiara would be better.</div>

The contrast on the veil took a little attention from the bride's face, not too sure if actual photo has this effect.<br>3) Lightings - reflector (if you are using) is not well balanced.
