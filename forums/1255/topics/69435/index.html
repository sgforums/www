            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>I'm new to this forum, having just joined yesterday, and am hoping to make some photography buddies.<br><br>I'm a Minolta faithful, started casually with a Yashica SLR in 1991, and to date I seriously use nothing else besides Minolta. I'm also into digital photography, but still prefer SLR shooting when shooting serious subjects.<br><br>In my opinion, I'm just an amteur and at best just intermediate. I do not join photography clubs as I believe in exploring on my own or within a circle of serious shutterbugs, and monthly magazines. I'm into landscape mostly, I use mostly wide angle lenses, and sometime delve into macro photography. I do also like streetshooting, candids, and a little abstract and still life.<br><br>I shoot mostly in negatives, and have been shooting slides in past years. Once I acquire a slide and film scanner, I will probably go back to slides again.<br><br>My equipment is as follows:<br><br>Bodies : Minolta Dynax 7 &amp; 800si / DiMage 7i<br>Lenses : SIGMA 15mm fisheye, 17-35mm, 15-30mm, 28-200mm,<br>&amp; a fixed 50mm Minolta f1.<br>Films Preferred : Kodak Negs / Fuji Provia or Velvia Slides<br>Tripod : Manfrotto<br>BackPack : LowePro Trekker<br><br></div>

(bear: soft just means "not sharp")<br><br>28-200 also the zoom range of the lens. it's approx the same as urs.. ur sony has an equivalent of i think 35-240mm thereabouts.<br><br>ok film, basically film comes in negatives (i'm sure u know wat they are) or "positives" which are called "slide film" that means after being processed, they are in the right colours, while normal negatives have inverted colours....<br><br>as for the diff between negs and slides.. that one i'm not too sure liow.. but i do know fuji velvia produces really nice and saturated colours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! Joho and the Bear,<br><br>I am NO pro, bros. I just love the hobby, even though it always burns a big hole in my shallow pockets. ehehehe<br><br>Yes, the SIGMA 17-35 EX DG ASP, is soft under certain focal lengths - especially wide open at 17mm. But if I set it at f5.6 or higher like f8, things sharpen up. But Still, there will be softness around the edge. What to do, cannot afford expensive lenses what. kekekeke<br><br>I love wideys ( wide angle lenses ), because it really sucks in everything within view, and depending on subjects, I often like the distortions.<br><br>Sorry guys, I don't mean to be braggy or showy, I just wanted people to know what I'm used to, my preferences, and of course extent of interest in photography, so therefore I listed my equipment. Still, I think I have a lot to learn still. In Singapore, 10 years of doing something, is only actually 5 year - because the other half of the 10 years actually devoted to trying to make a living in Singapore, heheheheheee.. so in fact, I just begun! Not like in the States where you can pretty darn do anything to get by....<br>Here we have to make sure our CPF keeps growing. ( ! )<br><br>In shooting, I like the use of natural or, available light. Hardly use flash. But if a flash is necessary, I will often bounce the flash, defuse it, or reduce output by about half to one stop depending on how I want the subject to turn out. Shadows and dark areas in my images are what I like to see. Especially shadows with visible details in them! But funny thing is, I can never get a grasp of black &amp; white photography. Just can't seem to see in black and white lah.<br>*sigh*<br><br>Thanks for the invite to join the outing, I will have to see my schedules. Preferrably, I was thinking of shooting Ubin island. This old rustic island is ideal for outdoor photography. I been there some few years back, and would like to go again amd see what else has changed and basically brush up on my shooting. It's a great stress reliever being there and peering through a camera's view finder.<br><br>I will be there over next weekend with some underwater photographer, one video editor, and a music media engineer to do some project exercise with them. So, next round, I wanna go free and easy.<br><br>Perhaps you guys can tell me more about your adventures and preferences in photography? I find shooting negs very forgiving, because of the negatives' tolerance for overs and unders, while slides gives great color rendition, it is less forgiving in metering errors - over it by a 3rd of a stop, and things will turn out white-washed. Under it likewise, and details will also be lost in dark areas. So, shooting slides requires spot on metering of subjects. But with a digital camera, one can first test exposure values by taking a shot with a digicam, before committing a shot in slide. Because the digicam's metering principle is same as slide - +EV brightens, -EV lightens, while in negs, it is opposite.<br><br>Well, hope to hear from you guys...<br></div>
