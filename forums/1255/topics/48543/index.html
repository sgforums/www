(of course with a non SLR, it's the ONLY way to add focal length range to ur cam). some are made with good quality, some pretty bad. it works if u need it to, but dun need to get unless u really need the extra zoom or wide focal lengths. eg my cam already has a 8x (about 280mm on 35mm equiv) which is already very big.<br><br>ok hope that helps! ehhe the part of the PL filter can be quite confusing, maybe i'll post pics to show u the difference.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
