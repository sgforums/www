            <div class='col-md body'>Besides FUJIFILM digi cameras with Natural Light mode for night photography w/o flash, can other camera models perform similar functions if i can set the cameras to ISO 1500-2000? (eg Nikon Coolpix?)<br><br>and any new digital camera models to recommmend for bus photography? (capture fast moving buses, compact in size, noise reduction, stabilizer to minimise handshake, capable of night photography w/o flash, low light conditions)<br><br>what about Nikon Coolpix S500??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think for night photography and with compact digitals, its not advisable to push beyond ISO800, as there is alot of noise unless there is noise reduction and so on...<br>Like DSLRs, they work better in noise reducion areas, but still prone to handshaking...<br>I did quite some night bus shots but mostly are noisy, although I use a DSLR...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you're looking for all of those qualities listed in your first post, you're going to have a hard time finding it.<br><br>First of all, compact cameras are almost always going to have shutter lag while they make up their minds about settings, so asking for almost-instant shutter release is a tall order.  On this condition itself you'd be looking at getting into DSLR country already.<br><br>Second, image stabilisation is good, but it has its limitations.  If your shutter speed is slow (as it would be for low light), you can still get shaky pictures.  No amount of technology is going to compensate for inadequate lighting.<br><br>As the other guys have said, the higher your film speed, the higher your noise.  Crank it up to 1600 and you'll end up with grainy shots.<br><br>Don't bother with a flash either.  For something the size of a bus, you'll get one part lit up and the rest in the dark - you've already seen that in your first photo, and it doesn't get much better than that.<br><br>The bottom line is that your best bet is to learn how to set up the shot properly.  Find the best-lit spot you can, take a few test shots with the largest possible aperture size (which often means minimal zoom) and work out the highest shutter speed you can use, get your white balance sorted out and find a stable spot to rest your camera on.  Also, to a limited extent, you don't have to worry about the shots coming out too dark.  Post-processing using programs like PhotoShop can make up for a couple of F-stops.</div>

Pressing in advance may mean some skill to learn...<br>I personally love compacts, they hold a sense of suspense and prediction is necessary. Although using a DSLR now, it not as exciting like the smaller brother...</div>

I do feel that even the best photographers, those who are professional making money or winning awards are masters only to the judges and customers or consumers. Their photos might earn praises from many but not always from all. Everyone has their own perception of what warms their heart.<br><br>As long as TS understands that bus photograpy is not just about buses he will go a long way.<br><br></div>
