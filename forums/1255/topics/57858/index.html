            <div class='col-md body'>"Hey, Watcha doing ? Watching tv huh?", the sweet voice echoed through the phone. "No lar, surfing the net, so tired today. You not tired meh?",  i replied. I found myself awakening from my sleepy state. This was one of our numerous daily phone conversations we had since the school term had begun. "Can you believe it? She wore her skirt so short today! You saw the cellulite on her legs?Oh my goodness...haha...opps!", her voice still sounding like a kid in a candy store. "Haha...you are...", my voice sounding as monotonous as ever. Maybe it has to do with the breaking of my voice pitch upon reaching puberty that contributed to that low and boring tone. No matter how excited i sound, it still sounds the same.<br><br>It has been close to a month and a half since we've met. I still remember the first day we met when we were designated into our respective classes. "John Chen, class 1A8, hello?John Chen?, queried the student councillor through the mic. Drats. No hot chicks in my class. I dragged my foot down the lecture theatre and promptly joined my new class. I had joined the Arts faculty due to my lack of interest in science subjects. Apparently, i had been looking forward to a new life in a new school, hoping to widen my social circle as well as to know more hot chicks. Hee. Hey, after all, i'm a guy.<br><br>Four pathetic guys in the whole class dominated mostly by girls. We proceeded into the fourth level and into the stuffy, dimly litted classroom. To maintain the cool image of mine, i aimed the corner seat of the last row of desks in the room without hesitation. "Good morning everyone, i am Ms Lim, your home tutor for this three months, and i will be looking forward to knowing each and everyone...yada...yada", she briefed us. Ms Lim stood upright with her heels and long flowing tresses. She was a bespectacled lady and in her late twenties, i assumed.<br><br>"Hey John, where shall we go after school?", asked Xinglee. "Hehe, Orchard lor...standard mar." i shot back sacarstically. "But hor, i quite broke liao, no coffee bean or starbucks ar!", i added pityfully. Fifty dollars pocket money seem to only last me two days throughout the whole week since i started hanging out with these group of girls daily after our lectures and tutorials. Hanging out at Orchard in the late afternoons has been a routine lately. Sadly, i  happened to be the only guy whose mroe outgoing in the whole class, and my close bunch of friends happen to be all girls. These group of girls consisting of Xinglee, Jer and Danielle are your usual typical  school girls who favours cute poster pinup boys, Roxy clothing line and ice blended frappucino. Xinglee happened to be the one in the group whom i had found a sense of closeness to....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"John, your phone!!Dont talk so long. Phone bill very high already. You think money alot ar?!!", yelled my mom. "Yar lar!", i screamed back. "Hey, wat you doing now?", shrieked Xinglee excitedly. "Hah, wat's the happy occassion?You sound so happy.", i enquired. "Nothing lar...so boring at home. Nothing to do.", she replied. Our conversation lasted three hours and into the wee hours of the morning. I found it so easy to talk to her. Topics flowed freely ranging from girly gossips to general issues of life. There was never a boring moment when you're with her. Her child like innocence and bubbly charisma just rubs on you. My first impression of her was that simply of a typical "ah lian" wannabe. Maybe her highlighted hair and little mannerisms further allowed me to derive at that first impression. Upon knowing her must has been one of the most pleasant experiences throughout the whole first three months period. It made going to school worth it and there was never a dull moment when you're with her.<br><br>"Hehe....so today got to see your mei nu not?", teased Xinglee. Being a typical guy, ogling at cute chicks are just part and parcel of life. "haha...no lar...admire only..nothing much." i defended myself. "Not bad huh, brother. she quite pretty leh. Very tall also." , affirming Xinglee. "Told you liao, i dont like her", sounding irritated. Our conversations carried through the night again. Slowly, i found myself noticing her more and more. *Beep Beep* the pager rang. I hurried to check the messages i've received. 'Good night, sweet dreams, sleep tight. See you tomolo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">' Upon seeing Xinglee's message, i retired for the night, feeling contented and happy...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Ring* I rubbed my eyes lazily only to realise i am going to be late for school. I took a quick shower, dressed up, never forgetting to spray a lil cologne for that added scent to smell nice throughout the day, and hurried to the bus stop. The school bell rang. Time for morning assembly. Hordes of students gathered in the quadrangle area to attend the assembly. There she was, giggling cheekily as she shared a joke with Danielle. Danielle was the smartest among all of us in the clique. Apparently she had not done well enough for the prelims to enter one of the top JCs in the east side. But she remained confident that she'l ace her Os and she did nevertheless. Danielle was also more outspoken and shrewd and can be quite a bitch to mess with if you step on her toes. Otherwise, she's generally nice. She was the auto defacto leader of our clique and was usually very focused and decisive. Her traits clearly reflected in her daily work and studies.<br><br>"Hey, Dan...how do you find Xinglee?", i prompted. "She's a very nice girl. So sweet. Y leh?", Dan questioned. "Nothing lar...we've known each other for sometime already. Just curious mar.", smoking myself out. "hmm...aha..u like her?", furthering questioning me. "Actually i dunno...but she's sweet and nice. I mean...", i relented after further probing. "Ok, tomolo i'l check for you on how she thinks of you." "Thanks Dan...hehe", i replied cheekily. The following day Dan and Xinglee proceeded home together as usual after school as they lived in the east plying the same route home.<br><br>"John, phone call!!!!", yelled my mom. She had been very agitated recently due to the rising number of phone calls. "Hey, dont be sad ar...", warning Dan. " huh?wat she said??", my curiousity piqued. "She said you're not her type...", replied Dan, sounding very short and concised in her reply. "But...but...was she joking?i mean...maybe...", not willing to take no for an answer. My conversation with Dan carried on through the night. I was deeply hit by the reply Dan had told me. My usual confidence hit an all time low. Xinglee wasnt the prettiest girl in the class, let alone the school. She was just your average girl next door, not the most sought after girl in the school. Even then, i could not win the heart of an ordinary girl. I seeked both Dan and Jer for advice. Jer was more consoling in her advises. She encouraged me to try for it.<br><br>One night over the irc, Jer , Xinglee and me were online. We chatted together as normal. Jer suggested confessing to her online as it would be less awkward than over the phone or face to face. I hesitated and Jer was getting irritated. She even offered to do teh dirty work for me. However, Dan happened to be online as well and somehow came to know of the situation. She chided me and Jer badly for trying to take things into our own hands. In a way , i was relieved as well as it would probably lead to a disastrous ending, even worse, not becoming friends anymore.<br><br>The next day, Xinglee acted strange and cold. I was worried sick and pretended acting normal. Seeing her just could not eased the pain of her not knowing my feelings for her. If she only knew how much i liked her. As the day proceeded, Xinglee was back to her normal self. I guess she probably did not have sufficient rest the night before, hence the black face. The days passed and soon the release of the O levels results. I had a nagging feeling that i would not do as well as i felt i had screwed up some of my better subjects. The day of the release of the results, i went back to my secondary school. I met up with some former classmates, chatted and joked before proceeding to the hall for the Dday(or rather for me). As the principal announced the overall statistical results of our batch of students who took the Os, i thought about Xinglee. Will i ever get to see her again? Thoughts just kept flowing through my mind. My turn came. I received the results only to confirm my fears. I had flunk my english. Never before had i flunk my english and of all time it has to happen now. My first thought was Xinglee. I could not face her. I was deeply hit with embarrassment and sadness. Part of my dream was to go to a jc. However, things were never meant to be.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our clique parted from the very day we received our results. I simply could not face Jer, Dan and Xinglee. Where could i hide my face. Jer stayed on in the same jc and Dan and Xinglee went on to different jcs. As expected, Dan aced her Os and got into the college of her dreams. Xinglee did fairly well. Over the next few days after the release of the results, my pager beeped furiously. All messages were concerns  of my well being. Somehow they knew of my predicament. I ignored and did not reply. Sad as i was, fact was nothing could change the results. I reappealed for a review of the results as well as to the jc i was attached to for the 1st 3 months. Nevertheless, both appeals were rejected. Life goes on for me and i went to a polytechnic. Life was a total 180 degrees change from jc. Friends and classmates i've made in poly just didnt click well. I reminiscenced the times i had in jc and of course, Xinglee. She was the sweetest girl i've ever known. The whole process of finding out me liking her just continues to leave me fond memories. Two years past and heard she's in the uni. She had done pretty well in her As. Congrats. Always knew you're a smart girl...Life still pretty suck for me and i wish her all the best in finding the right mate in her life.<br><br>*This story is a dedication to the girl that had left me fond memories of the times we spent together. I wish you neverending happiness in everything you do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
