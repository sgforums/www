            <div class='col-md body'>Memoire<br><br>Part Deux<br><br>I remember the day we met.<br><br>It had been an ordinary Saturday afternoon, I'd finished work and decided to go Christmas shopping, Papa could do with something for work. So I browsed and perused and scrutinized and inspected. But truth be told, my heart wasn't really in it.<br><br>I'd been feeling that way recently...numb.<br><br>"You need a holiday" my best friend Sarah had told me the night before.<br><br>"You think? I dunno Sare, I've got a great career. Volunteering at the deaf school is great. Financially I'm sound for the rest of my life. I have no lack of friends and I do feel like I've accomplished what I set out to do. So why am I so ...numb? "<br><br>"I take that back, you don't need a holiday, you need a man."<br><br>"What do you mean? I date guys." I had a feeling where she was going with this.<br><br>"Yes, you're a great hit with guys, your social calendar is full, but you don't get involved emotionally" Sarah was preaching again. "When someone shows interest in pursuing something more, you make it extra hard for them or drop them."<br><br>"Emotions are dangerous, I got burnt once remember?" I retorted.<br><br>"Yes, yes I remember but not all men are scum. There are guys out there who don't cheat on their girlfriends you know?"<br><br>"That's only cause they're too unattractive to do so!" I giggled. I could hear her sniggering too.<br><br>I probably came across as hardened and cynical to Sarah but it was only because I was frightened to let my guard down.<br><br>Until I met him.<br><br>Robinson's.<br><br>I'd noticed him looking progressively more frustrated as he flustered around. Cute, I thought to myself, but probably married if he's getting lost in the women's department alone. All the good ones are usually taken.<br><br>"Would you mind telling me where I can find the bath robes?"<br><br>I near-jumped when he looked straight at me. I didn't think he was heading this way to talk to me. Wow! He wasn't just cute, he was.......... sexy. Something churned in my tummy and I felt like a star-struck teenageer.  My brain went blank and my pulse raced.<br><br>"Why don't I bring you to that department?" I garbled. He must have thought I worked there.<br>"Maybe I can help you select a suitable one. Is it for your wife?" I played along. Sneaky. But I wanted to know.<br><br>I turned around and led him to the right corner of the store. I hoped he didn't realise I was a little shaky on my feet. It surprised me how much I wanted him to say that he wasn't married. It had been a long time I was so taken with someone. Much less someone I had just met.<br><br></div>
