(m i getting u the reader confused?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>ok..... this entry is getting too long.... but the gist of wat i'm trying to say is that i'm also like joho, not sure of where exactly i think/feel is home..... and i'm sure the problem will be further worsened if i get married n move overseas......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>well, jus my thoughts..........</div>

Frankly though I'm a S'porean, I dun have such worries, but I do have the urge to run away from S'pore. HAHA.. talking about stress and the pace in S'pore, it's killing me...
