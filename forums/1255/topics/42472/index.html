Just in case the sars make its way to the rice mill. And don't think I'm joking." I heard my mum drumming all these to my dad.<br><br>That was after the news at 6.30pm announced that Pasir Panjang market would be closed after 2 people there turned into sars suspects.<br><br>"Tomorrow, I'm going to tell all my friends to stock up on rice also." That's not a joke, I know she's going to do it.<br><br>"What are you laughing at?"<br><br>I supposed that was directed at me since I was laughing.<br><br>"It's very possible hor." She sat down beside me at the dinner table.<br>I suppose in a few days time, there would be headines across the papers reporting the rise in the sale of rice.<br><br>Well. Of course it's possible. Anyway, the fact that there are people suspected with sars at Pasir Panjang market pretty much says it all.<br>From all the sars related articles on the papers, I have deduced that it's actually very safe to be walking around in Singapore except two places.<br><br>Singapore General Hospital and of course, Ground Zero, Tan Tock Seng Hospital.<br><br>And so, when the news broke out at 6.30pm. I was a bit sad: Sars has made its way out of the containment area.<br><br>"There eat more veggies. Good for boosting your immune system."<br>If it's really that case, the sars task force would already have had advertisements flashing on every channel telling us to eat our veggies.<br><br>Right now, I waiting for tomorrow's papers to come out. And hope that there are less news on sars, for they say," No news is good news."</span></div>
