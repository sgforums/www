            <div class='col-md body'>"Excuse me is this your stop?"<br><br>Confused and bleary-eyed, Desmond looked up into the face of an angel. "Out of this world" was the first thought that came to his mind, but he soon decided that "out of this country" would be a little more appropriate. She didn't look like a pure Chinese.<br><br>All these thoughts were running through his head while he sat there with eyes bulging and mouth agape for all of two seconds. The infamous Desmond Goldfish Stance. The girl returned his look with a raised eyebrow.<br><br>"You know? School? Do you still remember?"<br><br>"Oh yesÂ… right! School!" Desmond struggled with his bag and tried to follow her as she turned and walked toward the exit. The sling clung stubbornly to the seat as Desmond tugged at it frantically. Embarrassingly, the bus driver noticed, and waited patiently till Desmond finally won the titanic struggle and stumbled off the bus before driving off.<br><br>He could feel his face burning up as he trudged off towards the direction of school, not daring to look at anything except his Adidas shoes.<br><br>"So I guess you forgot to tap your EZ-Link card too eh?" A distantly familiar voice startled Desmond, who up till then was kicking himself repeatedly in the proverbial ass for falling asleep on the bus.<br><br>"Huh? Oh yah hor. Dammit!"<br><br>"Haha well treat it is as the price to pay for your morning call."<br><br>If the laughter was unabashed, and the smile was mesmerising, then the fragrance she used was intoxicating. He couldn't resist closing his eyes and taking a deep breath.<br><br>"Hey you need to pay for aromatherapy okay."<br><br>"Huh er sorryÂ…" Desmond didn't know what to say. His senses had been mercilessly assaulted and his brain was still trying to cope with the information overload after being jolted awake (albeit pleasurably) from slumberland only a few minutes ago.<br><br>"Relax lah I'm just teasing! HahahaÂ…"<br><br>Again that laughter. Was it the tranquil peace of walking into school at 6.30 in the morning with a cute girl, or was this same girl's voice especially melodious? Not many girls laugh like that. The girls he knew only giggle with delicate hands over lips. Never was there an ordinary girl who would dare laugh so heartily without any concern for her image. This was no ordinary girl.<br><br>"Good morning bi<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>tch!"<br><br>"Aaahh Tammy!" The girl joyfully crushed herself into the embrace of another girl. Seeming to remember Desmond, she turned around and waved her goodbye, "Seeya around yah?" And she walked off toward the direction of the canteen with her friend, arms locked.<br><br>Desmond just stood rooted to the spot. He didn't really know where to go anyway. Today was only the second day of JC.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the rest of that week, Desmond kept an eye out for his dream girl whenever he was walking around in school. Every time he saw a girl in a dark blue pinafore, he would take a few moments to see if it was her.<br><br>Whenever he saw her, she would be surrounded by friends and laughing away. She really knew how to enjoy herself. How he wished he could talk to her, hold her in his arms, kiss herÂ…<br><br>"Woah check out the babe!"<br><br>It was Kevin, just one of the many new friends Desmond met since coming into JC. Kevin was tall and athletic, and he signed up for close to ten CCAs during orientation.<br><br>"How do you expect to handle ten CCAs??" In comparison, Desmond didn't sign up for a single one. He never really had much interest in anything except computer games, and there was definitely no computer games playing club.<br><br>"I'll go for everyone of them at first, then I'll only stay at those with the most number of chio bus." Chao buaya.<br><br>"Maybe I should make friends with herÂ…" Desmond realised Kevin was talking about his dream girl.<br><br>"Yes go make friends with her in front of all her friends." Desmond turned his attention back to his homework. He was sure Kevin wasn't going to do anything like that. He didn't have the guts.<br><br>Desmond sensed a sudden movement beside him and was startled to find Kevin walking toward the girl's direction, only the girl was no longer in the safety of her group. She had walked toward the toilet alone and Kevin intercepted her right before Desmond's disbelieving eyes.<br><br>He couldnÂ’t hear what they were saying but his heart soon got stuck in his throat when he saw his dream girl accepting Kevin's phone and keying her number into it.<br><br>That thick-skinned bastard! What does he think he's doing?!<br><br>Kevin walked back toward Desmond with more than a smirk on his face. "Easier than I thought."<br><br>"How the hell did you do that? What did you say to her?"<br><br>"I just said 'Hi I'm Kevin.' and stuck out my hand. Then I asked her for her number loh."<br><br>"Just like that?!"<br><br>"Just like that."<br><br>"That's ridiculous! How can you get a number so easily?"<br><br>"Haha well you'll never know unless you try, right buddy? Anyway her name's Rie."<br><br>"Rie? She's Japanese?"<br><br>"Only her father. Her mum's Chinese."<br><br>At that moment, Rie walked past them from the toilet. Kevin waved and she waved back with a smile. Desmond just sat there dumbfounded.<br><br>Rie.<br><br>He finally knew her name, but he didn't like the way he found that out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Desmond saw Rie almost everyday on the bus now. She would be on it, sitting near the exit, even before he boarded, and she always gave a friendly smile when she saw him. He did smile back on occasions, but he just couldn't gather enough courage to plop himself down next to her. Instead, he would walk all the way to the back of the bus and sit himself there.<br><br>He never fell asleep on the bus again. The entire journey was kept interesting by just her presence. He would stare at her jet black hair, flowing without encumbrance past her shoulders, as the dim fluorescent lighting of the bus and the evanescent darkness on the other side of the windows played with it. Sometimes he caught a glimpse of the side of her face, and he decided even half her face was alluring. This half-hour bus ride to school was something that he looked forward to every time he was jolted awake by the incessant ringing of his alarm. Desmond felt truly happy and contented every morning.<br><br>When they reached school, they would alight and walk in together, but rarely did he attempt to strike up a conversation. It wasn't that he didn't want to. It's just that his mind was a blank when he came within 5 metres of his dream girl.<br><br>Everyday he would tell himself, "Today is the day". He imagined the scenario when the moment he got on the bus, he would say hi and sit next to her, and they would talk all the way to school.<br><br>Everyday he mentally slapped himself for squandering the opportunity, "I must do it tomorrow!"<br><br>It didn't help matters much that Kevin was visibly getting closer to Rie everyday. They always stopped to chat when they ran into each other in the corridors, most of the time right in front of Desmond, who still couldn't comprehend how his friend had so coolly obtained the school belle's number under 10 seconds flat.<br><br>He finally couldn't take it anymore, "Would you stop it."<br><br>"Stop what?" Kevin was too busy checking out a couple of TK girls to understand what Desmond was trying to say.<br><br>"Flirting with Rie of course! Com'on you know you're only talking to her because she's pretty."<br><br>"Er wellÂ… so what if I am? It's just some harmless fun."<br><br>"It's not harmless. She could think she's falling in love with you, and her happiness would be ruined for the rest of her life!"<br><br>"Please lah why can't I give her happiness? I have hands. I have legs. I can work to support a family."<br><br>"But you're not serious about it! You would get sick of her and then go find some other girl to fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ckÂ… orÂ… or somethingÂ…"<br><br>"Oh yeah that's true. Then too bad lah."<br><br>"What the fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck how dare you even think about doing something like that to my Rie?" Oops.<br><br>"Oh YOUR Rie? I see what's going on. You don't want me to do all those things to her cos you wanna do them to her yourself!"<br><br>"Oh cut it out that's not what I meant. It's just thatÂ… It's just thatÂ…"<br><br>"It's just thatÂ… It's just thatÂ… It's just that you're too chicken to make friends with her yourself."<br><br>"That's not true. I mean - "<br><br>"Ah save it. If you really like her, I'll give you her number. I don't flirt with girls whom my friends are interested in. There is so much fish in the ocean. What's the point of ruining a friendship just for one girl." Kevin threw his handphone over to Desmond.<br><br>"Her number? I don't think that's really a good idea."<br><br>"Look either you take her number, or I'll continue flirting with her, okay? Your choice. Just quit whining please. Jeez you're worse than my sister."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Ring ring*<br><br>"Hello who's this? Hello? Hello?"<br><br>*Click*<br><br>Desmond put back the receiver once again, hands trembling. This was the third time he dialed Rie's number, but he still couldn't gather enough courage to actually say anything. He jumped down from his study table and paced around the room excitedly, adrenaline pumping. He was getting really frustrated with himself, and yet feeling faint with anticipation that he would be talking to the most beautiful girl in school in awhile. As soon as he mustered enough courage to say something that is.<br><br>*Ring ring*<br><br>"Hello!" Desmond grabbed his phone.<br><br>"Look I don't know who this is, nor do I care, but if you don't stop harassing me, I'll call the police."<br><br>*Click*<br><br>Oh my god. Was that Rie? Oh sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it. She thinks I'm a pervert!<br><br>The phone stayed in his hand, the dial tone busy, but he couldn't seem to find enough strength to press the 'off' button.<br><br>***<br><br>Desmond went to bed early that night, certain that his 'relationship' with the girl of his dreams could only remain that way - in his dreams. He lied awake in the dark for a long time, staring at the ceiling that captured dim, unmoving lights reflected from the still-active night outside. The occasional sounds of an illegally modified engine speeding by on the main road echo up the side of the neighbouring 25-storey HDB block.<br><br>I don't want to think about her anymore. What was I thinking? She'll never like me. I stand no chance with her. I'm not good enough for her. Oh Rie. If you only know how much I think about you everyday. WhyÂ… Why can't I just have one chance? HaiÂ… Never againÂ…<br><br>By the time Desmond finally closed his eyes, a tear had already rolled past his cheek onto his pillow.<br><br>***<br><br>The sudden release of compressed air told Desmond that he could start climbing up the steps, even before the door of the bus was fully open.<br><br>HmmÂ… chilly. I hate air-con buses in the morning.<br><br>*Toot*<br><br>$3.40 left in my EZ-Link. Gotta remember to top-up soon.<br><br>As usual, Desmond trudged to the end of the bus. This time, he resisted the urge to look in the direction where Rie usually sat.<br><br>I'm not gonna look. I want a new beginning. If I don't have any expectations, I won't have any disappointments. I need to get on with my life!<br><br>He looked down on the floor as he walked, holding onto the seats to keep his balance when the bus started to move off. When he finally reached the seat he usually sat in, he realised somebody was already sitting in it.<br><br>"I don't know why you like to sit at the back so much. It feels so lonely and isolated, and it's such a long walk to the exit."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"ErÂ… hiÂ…" Her eyes were really big. Bulging even. So mesmerising that Desmond seemed to get lost in them.<br><br>"Aren't you going to sit down?"<br><br>"ErÂ… yahÂ…" He sat down next to her. That smell again. For awhile, her perfume was the only thing he could smell. He thought he was going to asphyxiate, and he knew he would have died happy. All thoughts about this girl sitting beside him rushed back into his head again. He stole a glance at her from the corner of his eyes, and realised she was looking at him too.<br><br>"I see you on the bus everyday but we hardly ever talk. I know you're Kevin's friend. Desmond right? My name is Rie." She stuck out her hand to shake his.<br><br>"ErÂ… yahÂ… I ermÂ… thought it would be rude to talk to you out of the blue." Her hand is so soft! He was sure she would melt if he gripped any harder.<br><br>"Don't be silly it would be great to make more friends. ErmÂ… actually you can let go of my hand now."<br><br>"What? Oh sorryÂ… I didn't mean toÂ…" Desmond felt his face boiling up, flustered at his own clumsiness.<br><br>"Haha don't worry about it. So what subjects are you taking?"<br><br>And so on it went. Desmond felt more and more at ease as the conversation went on, though the bus seemed to reach school much faster than usual. They continued talking even as they walked into school and finally, it was time for them to part and look for their own friends.<br><br>"Well, it was nice talking to you Des. I'll see you around!" Rie spun around and walked away while her hair, still wet from her morning shower, seemed to wave goodbye to him.<br><br>Desmond felt his heart thumping hard and fast. He wondered if he was dreaming, even as his eyes followed her receding figure. Suddenly, JC life seemed so much more enjoyable, despite the ridiculous workload and extended schooling hours.<br><br>He never felt more alive in his life.<br><br>***<br><br>It was Friday. The past week was the happiest days of Desmond's life. He was so ecstatic, he even had trouble falling asleep at night. Everyday he would talk to Rie on the way to school. They couldn't go home together because their lessons always ended at different times, but it was ok. It was enough. He didn't dare to ask for more.<br><br>"Desmond!"<br><br>"Hi Rie. What are you doing here?"<br><br>"Nothing much. I'm just sick of working on my 87th Maths C problem of the day, so now I'm just taking a break. You?"<br><br>"My classes have ended for the day. I was just getting ready to leave."<br><br>"Lucky guy. Do you mind accompanying me till my next lesson starts? It'll only be 15 mins."<br><br>Ha do I mind? "Sure, no problem. Let's go."<br><br>They started walking and talked a little about school. They reached the sports complex soon and sat down side by side at the grandstand. Both were silent for awhile, staring at the mostly empty field and running track, letting the gentle breeze refresh them.<br><br>Desmond turned to look at Rie, and saw a fringe out of place. He had this sudden urge to brush it gently from her face, but he didn't dare to. He wasn't sure how she would react. After awhile, she caught him staring at her.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Oh nothingÂ… I was just thinkingÂ…"<br><br>"Thinking about what?"<br><br>"No lahÂ… I was just thinkingÂ… wellÂ… if you would like to go out with me tomorrow since it's SaturdayÂ… but if you don't want it's ok lahÂ… I know you're very busyÂ… hahaÂ… what am I thinkingÂ… I must have used up too much brain cells on that Econs essayÂ…"<br><br>"OkÂ… where should we meetÂ…?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Desmond tried to calm his fraying nerves. He couldn't remember when was the last time he went out with a girl alone, if ever. He looked at his own reflection on a nearby polished wall panel, and tried to push his gelled fringe even higher. His eyes darted around furtively, occasionally pushing his spectacles back into position after it slipped down the bridge of his nose. Sweaty palms wiped on his Quicksilver shirt, at the same time trying to flatten the creases that have appeared after his twenty minute train ride.<br><br>If you want to abandon a child, this was the place to do it. City Hall MRT Station was packed. People were either standing around waiting for friends, or they were trying to squeeze their way through the weekend crowd to whatever shopping delights that await them at their intended destination. As wave after wave of commuters exit the station, so did wave after wave of panic and disappointment wash over Desmond.<br><br>She's late. Is she even coming?<br><br>He craned his neck. He stood on tiptoe. He checked his handphone. Nothing.<br><br>Did she back out at the last minute? God I knew things won't go so smoothly. She must be too tired yesterday and didn't think properly before accepting my date, and now she's having second thoughts! AHHHHHHH RIE WHERE ARE YOU?<br><br>He was shouting so loud mentally, he barely heard the soft greeting from beside him.<br><br>"Hey been waiting long?" Rie looked stunning in a pale yellow spaghetti top and a pair of hipster jeans, which had the effect of baring her mid-riff.<br><br>Heart in throat, "OhÂ… hey! Not really lahÂ… Fifteen minutes only."<br><br>"Sorry I could have came earlier but my parents called from abroad just when I was about to leave my home." They started walking.<br><br>"Your parents not in Singapore?"<br><br>"Nope. Most of the time they're jet-setting around the globe due to work. I've gotten used to it by now. I barely see them for more than three days a month sometimes."<br><br>"Woah so you live alone? That's so cool."<br><br>"Ha you should try it yourself. Then you'll know how cool it is. In fact it's not just cool. It's downright cold." She stared in front and continued, "Sometimes I really get the feeling that no one cares. It's a terrible feeling to go home everyday after school only to face the four walls. Nobody to take care of you when you're sick. Nobody to talk to when you're down. It's like I'm not living, just existing."<br><br>Desmond didn't know what to say in response to that. He wanted so badly to wrap his arms over her shoulders and tell her it's okay. That he would take care of her when she's sick. That he would talk to her when she's down. But his arms stuck to his sides, and the words didn't make it past his tongue.<br><br>"But I guess I would prefer this than to be harassed by some psycho." She turned back to look at him, smiling again. "I mean could you believe it? A few days ago some idiot kept calling me but didn't say anything at all! Some people have too much time on their hands."<br><br>"Yea those sickosÂ…" He laughed nervously.<br><br>"Aiyah don't talk about these things anymore lah. Where are we going?"<br><br>"How about Suntec to catch a movie? Or are you hungry? Do you want to eat something first?"<br><br>"No I'm fine let's go."<br><br>***<br><br>"Hope you don't mind watching action flicks. This is the only watchable show right now." The cinema was filling rapidly, even after the lights start to dim.<br><br>"I don't usually watch this type of shows but it's okay lah. I heard it's not too bad. The only problem now is that this place is damn cold! I should have brought a sweater." Rie hugged herself, rubbing her hands against her arms to warm herself.<br><br>"HuhÂ… I think it might be because of your Sprite. Got ice mah. Try not to drink it for awhile."<br><br>"Kay."<br><br>The cinema went dark and the show began.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"I think that show wasn't too bad," Rie mused, in between mouthfuls of a mushroom swiss.<br><br>"No leh I think it's sub par. Zhang Yimou usually does artistic type of films, but this one has too much commercial elements in it. End up it's neither here nor there."<br><br>"Hiyoh people already say it's an action flick liao. What more do you want? HahaÂ…"<br><br>"How exciting can an action flick be when the same guy keeps getting killed repeatedly? Lol."<br><br>"Huh? What lol?"<br><br>"Laugh out loud lah. It's a short-form on the net."<br><br>"Oh I'm a computer idiot."<br><br>"Rofl."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Roll on floor laughing. Hahaha!"<br><br>"That's stupid! HahaÂ…"<br><br>"What? HahaÂ… Hey you not going to eat anymore right? Come take your drink I bring you to a special place."<br><br>"Okay. What special place?" They got out of their seats and started walking.<br><br>"Some place quiet and can see stars one."<br><br>"If you're talking about the rooftop garden, no thanks. There are so many smokers there!"<br><br>"No lah that place everybody knows liao. Where will quiet?"<br><br>"Then where?"<br><br>"Follow me." Desmond strode forward with a twinkle in his eyes.<br><br>***<br><br>"Well? Special enough bah?"<br><br>"Oh my god I didn't know such a place existed!"<br><br>The place was dark, the only light coming from the center of the rooftop, where a swimming pool was illuminated by the full moon under a cloudless sky. The surroundings were just brick walls, nothing spectacular, but the knowledge of the bustling city just a few feet away made this place a sanctuary in comparison.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"How did you find out about this place?" It took awhile before Rie found her voice again.<br><br>"One of my friends told me about it. His mum patronises this place often. It's actually a facility for the spa downstairs."<br><br>"It's amazing. Eh. So how many girls you brought up here already?" She sat down on the floor with a cheeky grin.<br><br>"No lah where got so many girls to bring. You're the first one."<br><br>"Your ex-girlfriends?"<br><br>"Ha I've never been in a relationship before."<br><br>"Huh how come? You're from a mixed school what! Why still no gf?"<br><br>"Doesn't mean mixed school definitely will have girlfriend what! I did fall in love with a couple of girls, but I was damn short in secondary school, so they're kind of out of my league. Just like now. I'm interested in a girl, but she's just out of my league lah."<br><br>"Aiyah no such thing. If you have sincerity, you'll definitely stand a chance."<br><br>"Cannot be just sincerity right? So easy?"<br><br>"Well yeah. So let me teach you. Apart from sincerity, also must give her three things. A rose, a piece of chocolate, and a letter declaring your undying love for her. HahahaÂ…"<br><br>"Huh you sure or not?"<br><br>"Hey take it from a girl man. You do all those things, her heart will melt. I know mine did."<br><br>"Oh someone gave them to you before?"<br><br>"Yup. My ex. I practically swooned that time haha. Silly right."<br><br>"Why did you break up?"<br><br>"Well people change. He changed. I changed. We keep meeting new friends, new hobbiesÂ… It's only a matter of time before our lives start to move off  in different directions, and we had lesser and lesser time for each other due to other commitments. Trust me man. At our age, no point talking about serious relationships."<br><br>"Then you still tell me to chase the girl I like?"<br><br>"If you like then chase lah! All I'm saying is don't think too far. The future is too uncertain at this point of our lives."<br><br>They were silent for awhile.<br><br>"I don't believe."<br><br>"Huh? Don't believe what?"<br><br>"I don't believe that we can't have a serious relationship during our teenage years. It's all up to the individual. If both parties are serious, then they'll have a shot."<br><br>"But such happy endings are rareÂ…"<br><br>"As long as there's a chance, why give up?"<br><br>"Because it takes courage to accept the truth. When you're in a relationship, then you'll know. It's really tiring to give whatever you have to offer, only to find out it wasn't meant to be, and then you have to get to know someone else all over again."<br><br>"But it's all for the sake of true love! Isn't that worth it?"<br><br>Rie just smiled and shook her head. She once believed as hard as Desmond did, but that was a long time ago. Was this what they call the loss of innocence? She didn't know. It was a long time ago.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Thanks for sending me home. I enjoyed myself today."<br><br>Desmond just smiled. No words could describe how he felt. He only knew he would never forget the 25th of January, 2003. This day would forever be etched in memory.<br><br>"If you're not in a rush, wanna come in and sit for awhile?"<br><br>"Is it ok? I don't want to trouble you."<br><br>"Aiyah come in lah." She giggled and pulled him through the door by his arm.<br><br>The place was small, but if what Rie said was true, there was no need for big spaces anyway. Nobody would be there to make use of it. The walls were bare and lacked decoration. The lighting was a dull white, and there was minimal furniture. Desmond shuddered a little when he remembered the pain in her voice when she talked about her family and her home.<br><br>"Nah." She handed him a cup of water.<br><br>"Thanks." He followed her into her room.<br><br>"Play around with my comp or something. I go bathe first." She closed the door linking the bathroom to her bedroom.<br><br>At least the computer was fast, thought Desmond. Guess her parents tried to make up for their lack of attention to their daughter by giving her a large allowance. Hardly a substitute, but better than nothing. He saw a photo frame next to the monitor. Probably a picture of happier times. He turned back to look at the screen and was taken aback by what he saw. Her Windows System Tray was flooded with the ICQ flower icon.<br><br>Navidad virus? thought Desmond. Sigh. I don't think you have any Antivirus software, do you?<br><br>He had a look through her Start Menu.<br><br>Nope, afraid not.<br><br>He logged onto the net and searched the Symantec website for information on how to remove the virus. The sound of the opening door distracted him momentarily and he turned to see Rie walking out of the bathroom, accompanied by the rush of hot air and the smell of shampoo.<br><br>"There's a virus in your comp. I'm trying to fix it for you."<br><br>"Really? Thanks. I didn't even know there was a virus." She jumped on her bed and leaned forward to look at the screen.<br><br>"You mean you didn't even notice that whole chunk of ICQ flowers on your System Tray?"<br><br>"What's a System Tray?"<br><br>***<br><br>It was 1 a.m. and Rie's room was quiet, save for the drone of the fan and the clacking sounds of the keyboard.<br><br>Finally got that dumb thing out of the system, Desmond exhaled.<br><br>He turned to see Rie sound asleep, a picture of peace and innocence. She was clad in only singlets and shorts, so he tried not to let his eyes linger too much on places where he knew he shouldn't be looking.<br><br>"Rie. Rie." No response.<br><br>"Rie." He shook her shoulder and she finally stirred.<br><br>"Huh?" She looked so cute when she gave that blur look.<br><br>"I removed the virus but the last bus has left already so I can't go home. Do you have a bicycle I can borrow?"<br><br>"Forget about the bicycle lah. Sleep here then catch the bus in the morning." Rie shifted herself to one side of her bed and offered half her pillow to him. "And off the damn lights it's so bright." With that, she turned her back to him and went back to sleep.<br><br>Desmond shut down the computer and stood up to switch off the lights. He felt his way back to the bed, but instead of sleeping in it, he sat down on the floor with the side of the bed against his back. For awhile, he stared into the darkness, but finally, sleep overcame him and he closed his eyes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Ouch!" Desmond woke up to something whacking him on the head.<br><br>It was day now. Rays of sunlight filtered into the room through the window grills, blinding him temporarily. There was still a throbbing pain where he had been attacked. Desmond looked around for possible causes, and saw Rie's foot on the part of the bed where his head used to be.<br><br>She kicked me in her sleep! he thought. Quite an effective wake up call though, come to think about it.<br><br>Yawning, he slowly made his way to the adjoining bathroom, sneaking a few peeks at the still sleeping Rie. He raised the toilet seat and proceeded to piss, all the while smiling to himself. He couldn't believe he just spent a night alone with his love. The sound of the flushing toilet roared in his ears while he dipped his face under the running tap.<br><br>Hoping to find something to quench his parched throat, Desmond let himself out of the room and headed for the kitchen. The fridge was more or less bare. It had no life, no memories of it's owners. It almost looked sad. He closed it and poured himself some water from a jar, taking small sips and amusing himself by staring at Rie's underwear hanging from the bamboo poles.<br><br>"You're up early." The voice, hoarse from disuse, startled him.<br><br>"It's not early anymore sleepyhead. It's 9 a.m. We usually wake up at 6 remember?"<br><br>PleaseÂ… please don't let her notice that I was staring at her stuff.<br><br>"I usually sleep in on Sundays." She poured herself a glass of water.<br><br>"If I sleep in on Sundays, I'll never be able to wake up in time on Monday."<br><br>She grunted, too lazy to even phrase a reply. They finished their drinks and walked back to her room.<br><br>"So what are you planning to do today?"<br><br>Desmond was too fascinated by what he was seeing to reply. There she sat, cross-legged on her bed, holding onto a wooden pointy stick, and proceeded to wrap her long tresses on it. Within seconds, she had her hair in a tight bun, with nothing holding it in place except for that stick.<br><br>"How did you do that?"<br><br>"I can do this with a fork too. Want to see? HahahaÂ…"<br><br>To Desmond, it was like digging something out of a treasure chest. Everyday, he discovered something about this girl that made him stare in amazement or sigh in wonderment.<br><br>"Want to go cycling at East Coast? We can have breakfast at Mac."<br><br>"Yah let's do it! I'm hungry!"<br><br>"Okay I'll take the bus home to get my bike, then I'll meet you back here outside the security checkpoint in half an hour."<br><br>"On! Come I'll walk you to the busstop."</div>
