            <div class='col-md body'>yup.. to all those who had doubt that this is in Singapore..<br><br>this is indeed in kranji. Kranji Reservoir for those who are interested. its very deserted.. compared to the seletar dam<br><br>i was working late from saturday night all the way to sunday morning.. but my desire/ inspiration to come here was sparked off from a trip earlier in the month when i drove past the place mid morning and saw that the sun actually would have come up in that direction. i was driving from Neo Tiew from Lim Chu Kang Rd towards Kranji Road. I stop before crossing the dam and just waited for the time..<br><br>i was dogged tired then.. but i guess its worth it.. really made my day although i had to go back to catch some sleep after that..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I see peace and serenity in the photo and that is the intention in my opinion. To me the photos are very original and has not been touched. Its something possible with his dSLR.<br><br>I guess we have our own opinions but i have submitted photos to stock so its funny when one accepts a photo while the other rejects the similar photo that i submitted. All looked for composition in a photo but mine was rejected for it and accepted by the other without compositional issues.<br><br>Maybe point blue can show us some photos of the the same location shot by himeself sometime. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
