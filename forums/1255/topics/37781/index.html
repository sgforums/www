            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>This is a piece that I wrote while in Sec sch.. kinda immature.. but anyway... juz wanna share.. </strong></span><br><br>It was another day in the University for Ray, Brenda, Amanda, and James. They were gathering in the sidewalk cafÃ© for a quick lunch before rushing to another lecture.<br><br>Brenda and James were the first to reach the cafÃ©. James is BrendaÂ’s boyfriend and both of them in the business faculty. Next to enter the cafÃ© is Ray, a law faculty student. The person who is always late as usual is Amanda, an arts student. Four of them were friends since they were kids.<br><br>Â“Hi guys, sorry IÂ’m late. I was asking the professor some questions.Â” Amanda explained apologetically. Â“Hey itÂ’s okay, you arenÂ’t late for the first time!Â” Ray teased. Amanda threw her sweater at him as an act of protest.<br><br>As it was time for Brenda and James to go for their lecture, they left hurriedly and arranged to meet after school for dinner over at BrendaÂ’s place.<br><br>Â“So howÂ’s your fashion designing going?Â” Ray asked. Â“Oh, it was cool, I came up with a splendid design that the professor decided to send it to a competition against other universities!Â” Amanda exclaimed. Â“Good for you, my studies are driving me nuts.Â” Ray sad. Â“Ray, I know you can do it. Everyone knows you can do it.Â” Amanda encouraged with a pat on his shoulder. Ray smiled. ThatÂ’s what he needed, an encouragement from the girl he secretly admired.<br><br>After school, Brenda and James were waiting for Ray and Amanda at the parking lot. They will be going to BrendaÂ’s place in JamesÂ’s Honda Civic.<br><br>Meanwhile, Amanda was rushing to her locker to put away her books when Kenny, a nerdy in her class, bought her some flowers. Â“Thanks Kenny, but IÂ’m in a hurry and IÂ’m attached,Â” She said. Fortunately for her, Ray passed by the corridor. Â“Kenny, this is Ray, my boyfriend.Â” Amanda said, pulling Ray closer to her. Kenny nodded and walked away disappointed.<br><br>Â“So girlfriend, BrendaÂ’s waiting for us,Â” Ray teased, trying to kiss her. Amanda pushed him away playfully. Â“DonÂ’t ever think about it! Besides I do really feel bad lying to Kenny.Â” Ray smiled to her and together they walked to the parking lot.<br><br>At BrendaÂ’s house, James parked his car in the empty garage as BrendaÂ’s parents are away for a holiday. The girls start to do the cooking and instructed the guys to lay the table. James went into the kitchen for some glasses while he direct Ray to the cabinet for the crockery.<br><br>While the guys were laying the table, Brenda asked Amanda, Â“Have you ever given a thought about Ray? HeÂ’s a nice guy.Â” Â“I know but weÂ’re good friends and good friends donÂ’t date each other romantically.Â” Amanda reasoned.<br><br>The dinner was enjoyed with endless chatter and jokes. After they cleared the table, they sat around the fireplace and start planning for BrendaÂ’s birthday, which will be due in another two weeks. Â“Are you going to invite the whole university?Â” James teased. Â“Of course not, only those that we know.Â” Brenda corrected. Once they decided on the guest list, next would be the food. Amanda suggested catering and it was decided.<br><br>The day before the party, Ray and Amanda were leaving the university after school. Â“Ray, can you fetch me to BrendaÂ’s place tomorrow? My mum used the car for her trip to my grandmaÂ’s. Â“Sure, it will be my pleasure, IÂ’ll come by around seven?Â” Ray smiled. Amanda nodded. Â“Thanks.Â”<br><br>On the big day, Amanda was choosing her clothes when Brenda called. Â“Amanda, Brenda here. What are you wearing tonight?Â” Â“Well, a black tube dress with heels.Â” Â“Great and IÂ’ll lend you my pajamas.Â” Brenda said and hung up.<br><br>Amanda got dressed and put on some natural make up. Her long hair was tied up in a sleek ponytail. By the time sheÂ’s done, it was already seven fifteen. Ray was waiting patiently across the road. Â“Sorry Ray,Â” Amanda apologized, rushing towards the car. Â“ItÂ’s okay, you look stunning tonight.Â” Ray complimented, scanning her from head to toe. She smiled and got into the car. Ray was dressed in a blue long sleeved shirt and black pants. Sitting on the rear seat, was the present for Brenda.<br><br>When they reached BrendaÂ’s place, everyone was already there. They greeted a few friends and proceeded to find Brenda in her room upstairs. They knocked on the door and James opened it. Amanda found Brenda sitting at her dressing table, doing her make up. Â“Wow! You are so beautiful tonight.Â” Amanda exclaimed. Â“Thanks Amanda, you looked great too.Â” Brenda smiled happily. She wore a silver spaghetti long dress and matching heels.<br><br>The party was a success. Brenda cut the cake and received presents from everyone. Ray and Amanda went to the porch and got themselves seated on the rattan chairs. They were looking at the starry sky when someone accidentally knocked into Ray, resulting a peck on AmandaÂ’s cheek. Both of them blushed.<br><br>Â“Amanda. I like you. I know it sound weird but you donÂ’t have to say anything, I just want to tell you how I feel and IÂ’ll always be there for you,Â” Ray confessed. Amanda was shocked that her mouth was opened wide. Â“Ray, I know. I like you too. We are good friends.Â” She said, refusing to admit that she too, likes Ray a lot.<br><br>For the next few days in school, Amanda avoided Ray. She didnÂ’t know how to face Ray. When she got home one day, she got a call from the police, saying that her mother was killed in a highway car accident. She didnÂ’t know what to do and couldnÂ’t find Brenda. She decided to call Ray. Ray rushed over to her side, consoled her and accompanied her to the morgue. She was too sad to handle the funeral and Ray took over the duties. He made sure that he never leaves her alone. She realized that and knew that she loved him. Â“Amanda, be strong, remember IÂ’m always here.Â” Ray said, giving her a hug. She cried.<br><br>After making all the funeral arrangements, Ray took Amanda home and conveyed the news to James and Brenda. They were shocked and offered their condolences to Amanda.  Â“DonÂ’t be too sad, life has to go on.Â” James consoled. Â“Amanda, if you need anything, remember to call me.Â” Brenda offered. Amanda said thanks and kept quiet. She looked around the house and relived all the events that had happened. She canÂ’t help but broke down again. Ray could see that Amanda needs someone to be there for her, to love and care for her.<br><br>It was a month later and Amanda is still grieving over her motherÂ’s death. ItÂ’s time Amanda face the reality, Ray thought. Since then Ray spent almost all his time with Amanda. Gradually, Amanda realized that she canÂ’t lose Ray and she loved him. She started to brace herself and to star anew in her life. Â“I canÂ’t give up life, when Ray didnÂ’t give me up.Â” Amanda said to herself. She didnÂ’t want Ray to worry about her anymore. Ray saw the changed in her and was overwhelmed. Â“Life has to go on and I didnÂ’t want to lose all the people who love and care for me. And I do love you, Ray.Â” Amanda declared and hugged Ray.<br><br>When Brenda and James heard about the news, they canÂ’t hide another happy news to their friends. Â“We are getting engaged.Â” The couple declared. Ray and Amanda were happy for the couple.<br><br>It was an ending that everyone had wanted.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> The description part wasn't tat good.. pai seh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Amatuer work la.. hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></strong><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
