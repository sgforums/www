Perhaps our story will always remain unfinished~~ that's why you stood up so much in my heart~~<br><br>we met~~ 2 years ago~~ I remember that we were not very familiar with each other~~ all I knew is your name and your face~~<br><br>Year 2 of poly~~ the beginning of our story~~<br>we started seeing each other more often because we entered the same elective and will often sit together in the lecture theatre~<br><br>I remember the nigth when we started to chat on icq~ you told me you had a crush on me~~ but I had my bf then~~ I did not avoid you~~ cos all I thought what you had was just merely a crush~~ and remembered...you told me you will never forget X~~ you had liked her since your secondary school and you were so upset that you were not given any chance to proceed the relationship further~~<br><br>There were times when we go out together for a movie~Rumours started to spread in school~~ about you and me~~ Some said you were after me, some said we were a couple but we didn't care~~ the fact we were just merely close pals~<br><br>a few months later, relationship between my bf and I went rocky~~ not because of you~~ but we were unable to communicate~~ there were times when I wanted to break off with him~~ but due to responsibility towards him~~ I didn't~~ even though I know we were deceiving each other~~<br><br>But then I couldn't deny any longer that I have fallen for you~~<br>It was difficult~~ I kept it~~ until the day we both confessed~~<br><br>We started going out more often then we do despite the fact that I am still with my bf~Meanwhile when I'm trying to sort thing out with him~~ I couldn't care less i just wished to be with you~~ but we were like any normal friends but we knew exactly that we liked each other~~<br><br>Nov 7 2002, we dated each other out to East Coast Park~~ and that was a happy day for me~~ It was a one day love story for us~~ we were like a couple~~ and how we whispered sweet nothings~~ I told even it's only a day~~ I treasured this day forever~~ I will never be able to forget this day~~ and the way you told me how much you loved me~~<br><br>I knew you couldn't wait any longer you wished to possess me and have me by your side~~ you asked me for a choice between you and my bf~~ I was so angry by your selfishness when you promised me that you were willing to give me time~~ and I just spited out words that it's all over between us~~ I regretted it~~ but it's beyond repair~~ it's all over~~<br><br>We no longer talked anymore~~ nor even have the chance to see each other~~<br><br>I'm still with my bf~~ still the same old reason that I had once given you~~ I didn't mention any break up again~~ It's unfair to him~~ But at least I can repay all the gratitude from him~~ and for you~~ perhaps you had got yourself a better girl~~<br><br>It will be very soon, I'll be engaging with him~~~<br>Perhaps at least I know when you are happy I will be happy too~~ I no longer wished to persue any more of my dreams with you~~<br><br>Thank you~~<br><br>lastly~~this is what I always wanted to sing to you~~~<br>" Thank you for loving me baby~<br>I treasured all your love and all the things we shared~~~<br>and I wanna tell you how much I love you~~~"<br></div>

[May 12, 2003 - 09:13:06 AM]<br><br>really confused: Erm. Is all this "~~" really necessary? Is it taught in anyone's Literature class that ~~ will enhance the flavoir of your writing? And if not I take it that your ~~ denotes sighing and perhaps moaning? And frankly it's real hard to make out whether this is free verse or a story or just senseless rambling. And Sausalito maybe a movie starring your favourite HK stars, but in the context of this piece, the name only confounds your reader (if you intent for there to be any). Because out of the context of the movie, Sausalito remains a place in California.   [May 07, 2003 - 11:51:39 PM]<br><br>Idiot: Fu*k you guy~~ People post her story here for people to read! Not for you to scold her bitch. Lame guy..   [April 28, 2003 - 03:27:42 PM]<br><br>girl: I do pity you.. can understand what you are going through but you have no obligation that you must be with your bf...why dun follow your heart and choose to be with the guy you love. It is also unfair to your bf that you are staying with him because of responsiblilty.   [April 28, 2003 - 03:25:29 PM]<br><br>guy: you bitch !!! you have bf but fool arround with another guy..??!!
