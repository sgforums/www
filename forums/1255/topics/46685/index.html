            <div class='col-md body'>Â“Morning gentlemen.Â”<br><br>The eight generals and admirals within the command tent saluted briskly. Every one were a seasoned veteran and experienced tactician, their purple uniform with gold trimmings were decorated with medals of many campaigns. The insignia of the emerald phoenix decorated the right breast of their uniforms.<br><br>Kaiser, in his green velvet robes politely bowed his head to acknowledge the Emperor of the Imperium before turning his attention back to a replicate model of terrain on the western frontier of the Imperium, the so called Ravaged Lands. An ancient artifact of the Golden Era, it recorded topographic maps of the continent. One could easily call up a miniature topographic map of any area on the continent using the floating runes that hovered above the table.<br><br>Â“What is the current situation?Â”<br><br>Not looking up from the tactical model, Kaiser spoke in his usual dull voice that makes one strain to hear what heÂ’s saying. Â“The Federation has launched multiple incursions into our side of the Ravaged Lands, already weÂ’ve lost the sentry forts at these points.Â” Kaiser tapped on several areas and a small red spot appeared on each point. Â“WeÂ’ve lost contact with the few soldiers sent to warn the border villages and settlements of the attack, so they are presumed lost. Current enemy numbers are unknown. We are also receiving reports that the NanÂ’ti are advancing on the coastal ports of Clev, Mantris and Orin. Some villagers from the North are also coming in with stories of the tribes gathering on the Northern peaks.Â”<br><br>Ruger rubbed his cheeks thoughtfully. Â“Assessments?Â”<br><br>Â“The NanÂ’ti are sea people, their ships are far more sturdier than ours and they are far more skilled with naval warfare than we are. But they dislike fighting on lands since itÂ’s too dry for them. Our main worry should be the army coming through the Ravaged Lands, if my intelligence is correct all the tribes of the Plains are gathering for an all out offensive. Optimistic estimates that we outnumber them three to one.Â”<br><br>Zhaldren Farland, an veteran that stood six feet tall and built of raw muscles spoke in his thick voice, Â“The Plains people are far more tougher than our troops, and not to mention we have a lot more territory to defend. They can easily concentrate their attacks on any points and our defense will shatter.Â”<br><br>Â“Correct General Farland, but since the establishment of the Imperium IÂ’ve predicted that the Plains people will give us the most problems and begun a project of constructing a series of forts starting from the edge of the Ravaged Lands through the Canyon of Claws to the township of Saint Catrin. Each fort is placed in various choke points where the Plains People will inevitably try to pass through.Â”<br><br>Kaiser touched a rune to bring up the tactical model of the Canyon of Claws, the grains that formed the Ravaged Lands immediately reformed itself to display a canyon full of zig zags. The tactician swiftly brought his fingers across several intersections within the canyon, a green flag popping up after each tap.<br><br>General Celina, a war magi with several arcane runes decorated her alabaster like face immediately spoke up. Â“You want to give up the Ravaged Lands?Â”<br><br>Kaiser shrugged and shook his head helplessly. Â“The Ravaged Lands are too thick with jungles and there are still numerous creatures left over from the Golden Era still lurking within it. Our troops may be well trained, but they are still low on experience and would never stand a chance against the more hardened Plains People in that place. The Plains People generally prefer striking hard and fast to demoralize the enemy, it is better we slow their momentum down and cut them down in the Canyons then confront them at Saint Catrin.Â”<br><br>The assessment completed, the generals looked at their Emperor and waited for his orders. Rugen pondered for a minute before giving his reply.<br><br>Â“I concur with Tactician KaiserÂ’s assessment. Here are my orders.<br>First, General Celina is to bring her Manticore units to Mantris to reinforce the coastal defenses. She is also to provide troops to evacuate the civilian population of Orin and Clev and escort them to Mantris. Admiral Cromwell and Admiral Jefferson, your tasks are to keep the shipping lanes along the Sea Lion Straits and the eastern seaboard clear of piracy and NanÂ’ti activities.Â”<br><br>The general and admirals made a quick salute and march out of the command tent.<br><br>Â“General Farland, you are to take your Salamander units and station them at Cold Howl Castle to guard against any possible intrusions from the Northern peaks.Â”<br><br>Zhaldren stood at attention and saluted Rugen. Â“As you wish, my Emperor,.Â” and marched out.<br><br>Â“General Belgrano,Â” indicate a man with an eye patch over his left eye. Â“ You are to proceed at best speed with your Desert Wolves units and secure the forts in the Canyon of Claws. However, you are to fall back the moment the fort you are holding is in danger of falling. Your objective is to weaken and hinder the enemy.Â”<br><br>The Desert Wolves general voiced a firm acknowledgement and left the tent.<br>Rugen swept his eyes at the remaining three generals. Â“The rest of you are to bring your Grey Cougar, Iron Eagle and Dragoon units and meet up with the Imperial Guard at Saint Catrin.Â”<br><br>A quick salute, and they too left the tent. Leaving only Kaiser looking intently at the tactical model. It took Kaiser a while to realize that Rugen hadnÂ’t left the tent and looked up.<br><br>Â“I am to assume that the Black Guard has already been deployed?Â”<br><br>Kaiser looked at his Emperor without emotions for a few moments before responding. Â“They are in positions to be used at a momentÂ’s notice.Â”<br><br>Â“You will not have problems with the FederationÂ’s chief tactician I am to assume?Â”<br>The Imperial Tactician frowned slightly. Â“Assume that I am first and forth most a soldier and winning is the only thing that matters.Â”<br><br>Â“Very well.Â” And the Emperor of the Imperium left the tent.<br><br>Scanning the tactical model, running through thousands of possibilities Kaiser could feel himself slowly grinding his teeth. Â“So what are you going to pull CassandraÂ…?Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow.. i kinda admire your creativity for writing such fantasy, something which i probably can't do, possibly becos the interest isn't there. but i dun see why u can't work on this alone? take ur time to write as inspirations flow, and develop the story.<br><br>and besides, how can anyone "help"? two pple writing  and combining them together? or maybe u want us to brainstorm for you?<br><br>btw, maybe u could leave a line after each paragraph, just for easier reading.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

(non division sized warfare, calvary, guerilla , political intrigues, the all famous romance, history, magic, religious) I type around 10+ pages and i'd start realising i left out a lot of stuff or forget it totally. Read a lot of Warhammer, so i can tell that there's a lot i'm missing out.<br><br>But yes, i could use a lot of help with brain storming. It's difficult to keep it all in my head alone. :\</div>
