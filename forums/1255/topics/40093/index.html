            <div class='col-md body'>My 1st attempt to post something here.. It's secondary sch standard, one of my old essays... A short story<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I was roused from my sleep by a servant boy. Â“His highness demands your presence in the courtyard immediately!Â”, he whispered meekly, emphasizing on the word Â‘ immediatelyÂ’.<br><br>I jumped out of my bed and hastily made my way to the courtyard where the Prince was expecting me. He stormed angrily towards me, his handsome face twisted in anger. He grabbed my wrist, and dragged me along with him. I struggled but to no avail.<br><br>We soon reached the Town Square where executions were conducted at the public gallows. I was surprised to see that a huge crowd has gathered there. Murmurs could be heard from every corner of the Town Square, the uneasiness in me grew stronger.<br>My heart almost stopped when I saw an almost naked Anthony being pushed roughly up the steps. Anthony was the PrinceÂ’s most trusted assistant and also a dear friend of mine.<br><br>The PrinceÂ’s grip on me tightened and he growled fiercely into my ear,Â” Abigail, my dear. If I ever catch you betraying me, you shall suffer the same fate as Anthony!Â” He paused, Â”Death befalls those who are disloyal to me!Â”<br><br>The crowd grew eerily silent when Anthony reached the top of the platform. I had a clear view of him now. His body was covered with open sores and whip marks, evidence of the unimaginable torture that he was made to suffer. His eyes were hollow and expressionless.<br><br>It seemed like eternity before the Prince gave the order for Anthony to be executed. Anthony was positioned on a plank in such a manner that when the blade was released, it would sever his head at the neck cleanly. I was already choking with tears, dreading that fateful moment when it finally arrived. The masked executioner released the rusty blade, which was covered with dried blood from past victims. Anthony was decapitated within a split second. Â“Nooooooooooooooo!!!!Â” I screamed and collapsed to the ground but the PrinceÂ’s grip on me never loosens and he roughly pulled me up to my feet.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was sick to my stomach at the grotesque sight of AnthonyÂ’s head rolling off onto the platform. The air smelled of fresh blood. There were gasps and whispers from the crowd. I watched in disgust as AnthonyÂ’s head finally landed at the bottom of the gallows, leaving a trail of bright, red blood. His eyes were wide open but only the whites of his eyes could be seen. His mouth was open in a silent scream. Blood trickled from his nostrils, staining his teeth.<br><br>I stood rooted to the ground. Terror robbed me of my speech. I was drenched in sweat and paralyzed with fear. I felt dizzy and nauseated, as though I was going to faint. The entire scene swirled before my eyes.<br><br>When I woke up, I was back in my chamber. Scenes of the execution flashed back in my mind like a silent black and white movie. I almost threw up when I remembered the grotesque look on AnthonyÂ’s face. Tears trickled down my cheeks.<br><br>Â“would I suffer the same fate as him?Â”, I asked myself, surprised that I had said it aloud even though I had not intended to.<br><br>I knew that only time would tell my fateÂ….<br></div>
