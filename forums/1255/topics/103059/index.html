'He was printing out all 100 of them on Friday morning.'<br><br>The next morning, however, he was felled by a stroke. After a brain operation, he went into a coma from which he never awoke.<br><br>Mr Goh's youngest son, Dr Patrick Goh, 44, said his father had been diagnosed with myeloid dysplastic syndrome - a condition where blood cells in the bone marrow are not normal - in September and had a growing blood clot in his brain.<br><br>Earlier this year, his 65-story Walk Like A Dragon was on bestseller's lists.<br><br>In it, he writes about how he had a hole drilled into his skull to drain another blood clot last year.<br><br>He worked in the education and social affairs ministries, reaching the post of deputy secretary to the health ministry before he joined the banking sector. As a property management director, he handled projects such as the construction of OCBC Centre, the Tangs shopping complex and UOB Plaza.<br><br>But in 1986, after retiring as general manager of UOB Property, 'he wanted to do only three things - help build St Joseph's Institution, see its transition into an independent school and to write', said Mrs Goh.<br><br>Writer Suchen Christine Lim called Mr Goh 'a great storehouse of stories about our colonial past and the Japanese Occupation, stories which he retold with compassion and understanding'.<br><br>Said Mr Chacko: 'I guess he was aware that he didn't have much time, so he worked as hard as he possibly could.'<br><br>Second son, publisher John Goh, 45, focused on another side of the man: 'He would probably want to be known most for his work with SJI.<br><br>'He came from a Hokkien working-class family and was always very grateful for the education he got in and from the school.'<br><br>The couple have another son, Austin, 48, who works in the IT sector.<br><br>Mr Goh was the first chairman of the SJI Board of Governors, holding the post for 25 years. When the school went independent and moved from Bras Basah to Malcolm Road, he raised more than $45,000 for SJI through sales of his book, Battle Of The Bands.<br><br>For his contributions to education, he received a Public Service Star.<br><br>Last night, his family were in mourning at his bungalow.<br><br>The wake will be held there - 1, Padang Chancery Road - until Friday. Mass will be said at the Holy Spirit church at 3.30pm before the cortege leaves for the Mandai Crematorium.</div>
