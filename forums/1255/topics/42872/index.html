            <div class='col-md body'>hey sunrise!~ thanx for the efforts eheh.. i'm pretty crap at poetry and well don't really read much either.<br><br>i was thinking if anyone that posts a favourite poem of theirs here could give a little short commentary on what means to them, why it's close to their heart, or just simply why they think it's good? rather then just cut and paste and be done with it.<br><br>just some personal thoughts, becos really, if someone slaps a lengthy poem in front of me i would be less inclined to read it, unless there was some commentary telling me why that person decided to slap it on my screen. another way of putting it is that i'm not that interested in reading OTHER pple's work (as in those famous poets etc - we did that in school and can do it at the library!) but more interested to know how the poster thinks and feels with respect to the poem. i'm more interested in the person posting then the poet (best if both are the same person!), and would be more inclined to read, and understand, the poem that way.<br><br>just my 2c, thanx again sunrise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
