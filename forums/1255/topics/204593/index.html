"<br><br>Ah Boy: "That will be 300 bucks please! "<br><br>After paying Ah Boy, Justin donned his Zeus open-faced helmet and rode off into the direction of Yishun Ring Road.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kopitiam, Yishun Ring Road, 10pm</span><br><br>The cool rain droplets dripped down Justin's helmet visor and his Honda jacket.<br>Justin flicked on the left turn indicator light and turned into the carpark... the street lamps reflecting the surface of his Probation Plate - he had just gotten his Class 2B license a week ago.<br><br>"Oi, siao eh! Why so late? " a shrill voice rang out.<br><br>It was Terry, a member of the Ang Soon Tong (AST ) biker division.<br><br>"Sorry la, I've lost my way!" blushed Justin.<br><br>"Kanina...Yishun also you  dunno how to come! You Singaporean or not, brother?"<br><br>This comment was accompanied by rowdy laughter and jeers by the guys.<br><br>"Eh, give the boy a break la! He's a new bike owner mah!"  grinned Johnson, the "Zhong" of the biker gang as he pulled out a chair for Justin.<br><br>"Marlboro menthol lights jik pao, Hard Pack!" called out Justin to the Kopi kia.<br><br>"Eh, Bang, how's your bike now? Zhng already right?" asked Ridwan , a Malay<br><br>Kawasaki Kipps rider.<br><br>Justin: " Ok la...  I've changed the exhause pipe liao, the air flow is much better now!"<br><br>Ridwan: " Power la! Practice more, and u will soon be a full fledge AST biker boy!<br><br>Gang members: "Ho SAY  AH!!!!!!!"<br><br>Johnson: " zi tiam ,ng ( 2 )  tiam , sar ( 3 ) tiam ang!!!!!"<br><br>Gang Members: "  Sar Puay jee yoh  (3821 )wo si ang!!<br><br>Johnson: " soon soon lee lee ki soon tong!!!<br><br>Gang Members: " pai ki sam chuam ang soon tong!"<br><br>Johnson: "tong ar tong..."<br><br>"AW AR AW!!!!

(looking at u dogs la, Kuntong dogs! )<br><br>"Nah bei, buay song si boh!" yelled an angry Kuntong Biker.<br><br>"Lai la! One to one la!

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mandai Road, 11pm </span><br><br>"Boom!" A clap of thunder rang out as a flash of lightning lighted up the stormy<br>sky for a split second.  The 2 biker gangs have gathered for the race!<br><br>Johnson shifted to neutral gear and parked his bike on its side stand.<br><br>The Carbon fibre body gleamed menancingly in the dim glow of the street<br>lamp. In the garage of Ah Boy, the once simple R1 had been modified to<br>become the beast that it is today. Titanium straight flow exhaust pipe, ultra<br>lightweight alloy racing wheels and Dunlop racing slicks. With these expensive mods, Johnson was able to defeat his oponents with ease!<br><br>"Erngggg!!!!"<br><br>The roar of Donny's Fireblade died out as he parked his bike and walked towards Johnson. The Fireblade too, was not just some biker wannabe's bike.<br>Many an opponent had been terrorized by this fibreglass clad monster.<br><br>Donny : "Last chance, Johnson! Admit defeat now and I'll spare you the humilation of beating you in front of all these AST losers!"<br><br>Johnson: " Cut the crap, kid! Let's get this over with! "<br><br>Donny:" As you wish! "<br><br>Donny walked towards the Fireblade and started the engine, his girl, Jessie riding pillion.<br><br>Johnson: " Hey, where are you going?"<br><br>Donny rode up to the starting line.<br><br>Donny: " Boy, let's make this more interesting! We shall race with a pillion tonight!"<br><br>Everyone gasped- Donny must be crazy!<br><br>"Come on Donny, cut the B.S and let's race! " Johnson laughed.<br><br>Racing in the rain is bad enough....racing in the rain WITH a pillion is suicide!<br><br>"Getting cold feet, coward? " Donny taunted and Jessie laughed.<br><br>"Alright! If this is the way you want it to be, so be it! Let's settle our score on the tarmac! " Johnson mounted the R1 and motioned for Ridwan to be his pillion.<br><br>"No, Johnson, I'll be riding with you tonight"<br><br>"Fanny, it's too dangerous! You stay here with the others! " protested Johnson.<br><br>Fanny ignored him and sat behind him .<br><br>Fanny : "It's either me or nothing."<br><br>Johnson gritted his teeth in frustration and gave in.<br><br>He too rode up to the starting line, next to Donny.<br><br>Kelvin , a member of Kuntong Bikers stood in front of the line.<br><br>Kelvin: "alright guys, this shall be a one time race! You are to ride towards the Shell station at avenue 6, U-turn, and come back here via the opposite road!<br>The loser shall go down to his hands and knees and apologize to the winner!<br>Are you ready?"<br><br>Both boys nodded.<br><br>"5! "<br><br>Johnson pulled in the clutch and kicked the gear down to 1st.<br><br>"4!"<br><br>"Vrrrrooomm!"<br><br>Johnson maintained the clutch at biting point and held the throttle at 4000RPM.<br><br>"3!"<br><br>"2!"<br><br>Johnson said a prayer and released the front brake, keeping the rear brake engaged at the same time.<br><br>"1!"<br><br>Both racers tensed up and stared at the darkness ahead.<br><br>"Go!"<br><br>Johnson released the rear brakes, let go of the clutch and twisted the throttle violently!<br><br>"eeeeeeeeegggkkk! VROOOM!"<br><br>The tires of the R1 screeched sharply on the slippery tarmac floor trying to find traction and when it did, the bike was thrusted forward by it's powerful engine.<br><br>"Let's rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!" yelled Donny as he popped a wheelie off the line.<br><br>"Wah! He's really nuts!" marvelled a spectator as the Fireblade shot forward like a rocket.<br><br>Johnson pulled in the clutch and shifted to 2nd. He could really feel the tension in this race. Donny was a dangerous rider and would stop at nothing at winning. The headwind chilled him to the bones as the bike charged forward. Ignoring his discomfort, Johnson picked up speed and shifted to 3rd.<br><br>All along, Donny had been hot on Johnson's heels. Donny had an advantage over Johnson as he was more familiar with the race route.<br><br>"Let's see what this baby can do!" smiled Donny as he twisted the Fireblade's throttle even futher. The Fireblade's engine had just been overhauled at a bike shop at Sims Drive and Donny was eager to show the opponent who's boss.<br><br>"WhoooHoooooooooo!" screamed Donny as he swerved into Johnson's path agressively, causing him to jam his brakes.<br><br>"errmmgh!" The R1's tires squelled and lost traction for a second. What a close shave! Furious, Johnson sped up and chased after Donny. Within seconds, Johnson was beside the Fireblade.<br><br>Suddenly, the Fireblade's brake lamp flashed brightly and the bike slowed down. Looking infront, Johnson saw a sharp corner approaching!<br>Quickly, he applied the brakes and downshifted twice to  2nd gear.<br>Fortunately, the bike slowed down for him to take the corner safely.<br>However, he had taken a wrong line, and that cost him his exiting speed.<br>Looking to the right, he expected to see the Fireblade shooting past him but was greeted by the empty road instead. Donny was delibrately holding back!<br><br>"Pon! Pon! "<br><br>Looking in his rear view mirror, Johnson saw Donny showing him the finger.<br><br>"I'll show him!" muttered Johnson as he dived into the following right corner at high speed. Shifting his weight to the right, he banked his bike lowly and ripped through the corner.<br><br>Donny chuckled- Johnson is screwed!<br><br>Donny's right! Unknown to Johnson, he had just entered the 1st half of a S-Curve and there's a left turn immediately after it!<br><br>Johnson's eyes flashed in panic as he saw the guardrails suddenly curve towards the left.  Slowing down , he attempted to shift his weight to the left when the roar of the Fireblade came closer to him....<br><br>"Thud!"<br><br>Donny reached out his right leg and gave the R1 a hard kick!<br><br>As the R1 was slanted, it lost its balance and slammed to the road.<br><br>"See you later, loser!" bellowed Donny as he rode off into the night.<br><br>As the bike was about to impact the ground, Fanny was thrown off by the momentum and landed head-first onto the unforgiving tarmac. The force was so strong that her helmet came off upon impact.<br><br>"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!" Johnson screamed.<br><br>He was trapped under the R1 as it dragged across the road.<br><br>When the bike finally came to a halt, Johnson laid in a bloody mess, his shredded jacket exposing parts of raw human tissues.<br><br>"Johnson!" screamed Justin as he witnessed what happened to his mentor.<br><br>Starting their engines, the Kuntong bikers laughed and rode off, leaving the scene victorious.<br><br>By the time the AST Bikers had arrived by Johnson's side, he was already dellirious.<br><br>"Fanny...is...is...s..she...alright...? " uttered Johnson before he blacked out...<br><br>(to be continued...)</div>
