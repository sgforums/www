            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">11.40 PM, Tan Tock Seng Hospital , Emergency Room</span><br><br>Chief Surgeon: Â“Pass me the X-Ray report, Â“<br><br>A black, translucent sheet of paper was passed to the Surgeon and he studied it in detail. He shook his head and sighed.<br><br>Â“We have to do thisÂ… prepare the procedure! Â“<br><br>Â“Yes, Sir!Â” answered his assistant as he prepared the necessary equiptments.<br><br>All this while, Johnson had been lying unconscious on the operating table, oblivious to what was going on.<br><br>The Chief Surgeon looked at Johnson whose eyes are shut, deep in  an anesthetic Â– induced slumber.<br><br>Â“Such a pityÂ…poor young soulÂ….Â”<br><br>Â“We are ready, Sir! Awaiting your instructions!Â” interrupted a nurse.<br><br>The experienced Chief looked grimly at his staff.<br>Â“LetÂ’s begin,Â”<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>2.40 AM, Tan Tock Seng Hospital , Emergency Room</span><br><br>Â“HowÂ’s the situation? Â“ asked the Chief Surgeon anxiously.<br><br>Surgeon 1:Â”His breathing has stabilized, sir!Â”<br><br>Surgeon 2: Â“No internal bleeding anymore, and no threat is found to the organs or brain!Â”<br><br>Surgeon 3: Â“The wounds are all disinfected and stitched up, Sir! Â“<br><br>The chief Surgeon heaved a sigh of relief and wiped his brows.<br><br>Â“Good job, people! Nurse, bring the patient to a ward to recoverÂ”<br><br>The Operating TableÂ’s lights went offÂ….<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">11.50 AM, Tan Tock Seng Hospital , Block 3, level 7</span><br><br>Â“17Â…. 17Â…. ah! Here it is! Ward 17!Â” Justin Â‘s eyes lit up as he rushed into the ward.<br><br>Â“Johnson!Â”<br><br>Johnson turned his head to the right and mustered a weak smile as the nurse recorded down his temperature.<br><br>Â“How are you feeling now, buddy?Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’m fineÂ…. I wonÂ’t die so easilyÂ…Â”grunted Johnson. Â“ HowÂ’s Fanny?Â”<br><br>Johnson reached out and grabbed the nurseÂ’s arm.<br><br>Â“HowÂ’s Fanny? Is she alright?Â”  Asked Johnson, his heart in his mouth.<br><br>Â“The girl who came in yesterday? ErmÂ…ahÂ….Â” Stammered the poor nurse.<br><br>Â“What is it? Spit it out! NOW!!!Â” demanded Johnson as he tightened his grip on the nurseÂ’s arm, his fingernails burrowing into the terrified girlÂ’s tender flesh.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sorry sirÂ… the girl had passed awayÂ…the doctorsÂ…Â”<br><br>A ghastly shade of white washed over JohnsonÂ’s face.<br><br>Â“NO!! You are lying!!! God Damn it!!!! You are Lying!!! LYING!!!!!!Â” shrieked Johnson hysterically as tears streamed down his face.<br><br>Â“Let her go, Johnson! Let her go!Â” Justin pried apart JohnsonÂ’s fingers and the nurse took a step back at once, relieved to be free from his grip.<br><br>Â“Sir, the girl had severely damaged her brain during the accident! The doctors had tried their very best to save her. ButÂ….butÂ….Â” stuttered the Nurse, at a lost of words.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sorryÂ…Â” whispered the nurse, her voice filled with sympathy.<br><br>Â“What! I donÂ’t believe this! I want to see Fanny! Right now!Â” yelled Johnson as he struggled to get to his feet.<br><br>Â“Sir, please calm down, Â“ begged the nurse as she held his shoulders firmly.<br><br>Â“Get lost! DonÂ’t stop me!Â” snarled Johnson as he attempted to kick the Nurse.<br><br>Suddenly, Johnson froze in shock. Something is not right!<br><br>Instinctively, he threw aside his blanketÂ…..<br><br>Â“AUGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! What the F*uck!!!Â” cried Johnson, his body quaking with fear. Â“ What happened to my right leg!Â”<br><br>Â“Please calm down, sir! The doctors could not save your right leg Â…they had no choice but to amputate itÂ….Â” Gulped the Nurse.<br><br>Â“This is not happening! ItÂ’s impossible! IMPOSIBLE!!!!Â” screeched Johnson as he beat his chest violently, his sorrow knowing no bounds.<br><br>Â“Nurse! Get the doctor! Hurry!Â” commanded Justin as he held on to his friend tightly.<br><br>Within minutes, a doctor and 2 male nurses hurried in.<br><br>The burly nurses held on to the struggling Johnson as the doctor pushed a syringe into his arm.<br><br>Within seconds, the struggling died down and Johnson fell into a deep sleep.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4 PM, Sims Drive , Seng Bee motorbike shop</span><br><br>Â“Ha! We sure had a good time last night!Â” gloated Donny as he smoked his<br>Cigarette smugly.<br><br>Â“Yeah!Â” agreed Tommy, a Kuntong biker as he glanced at DonnyÂ’s<br>FireBlade with admiration. The Kuntong Bikers had gathered at Seng BeeÂ’s to do some tunings on their bikes.<br><br>Out of the blue, the hum of a 150cc 2-stroke engine could be heard.<br><br>Â“Look whoÂ’s here? ItÂ’s the little boy!Â” mocked Donny as Justin got off his bike and stormed towards him.<br><br>Â“You Bast@rd!Â” roared Justin as he swung his fist at Donny.<br><br>Quick as a flash, Donny dodged the attack and landed a jab on JustinÂ’s kidney.<br><br>Doubling over in pain, Justin fell to his knees as searing pain shot though him. The Kuntong Bikers were about to hit him when Donny held up his hand and stopped them.<br><br>Â“You Murderer! Do you know that JohnsonÂ’s girl died in the accident?Â” began Justin as he glared fiercely at Donny. Â“ WhatÂ’s more, he had lost his right leg! He has his aged parents to feed, for ChristÂ’s sake!Â”<br><br>Â“Really?Â” taunted Donny in mock concern. Â“Well too bad! He could go beg at Orchard Road for all I care!Â”<br><br>The Kuntong Bikers laughed.<br><br>Â“Ya! He used to be a dispatch rider, right? He can be a wheelchair rider now!Â” commented Tommy, without a tinge of pity for Johnson.<br><br>Enraged, Justin made a move for Tommy but was kicked in the gut by the bigger man. Face contorted in agony, Justin seized the edge of a chair and pulled himself up.<br><br>Â“Just you wait! I am going to avenge Johnson!Â” vowed Justin. Â“I challenge you to a race! 10PM tomorrow night at Mandai Road! Are you man enough to accept?Â”<br><br>Donny stopped smiling and folded his arms.<br>Â“So, little boy wants to play the hero now? I accept your challenge! You can cry to your mama when I beat your sorry @ss!Â”<br><br>Â“Talk is cheap! WeÂ’ll settle this tomorrow night!Â” retorted Justin.<br><br>Slipping on his helmet, Justin kick started his SP and rode off.<br><br>He swore to win this race, no matter what!<br><br>(to be continuedÂ…)<br></div>
