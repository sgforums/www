Jews follow old testament. Christians (whether jews or non-jews) follow new testament. Why aren't Christians asked to go to temple to offer an animal sacrifice like Jews was commanded to in old testament? Because the new testament says Christians do not need to do that. Same, when Jews were leaving Egypt they in hurry so no time to wait for bread to rise. So they were asked to do repeat this during some of their festivals in order to remember to obey the God who brought them out of Egypt. Christians are not asked to do this (for those who say they are, ask them why they don't go temple?). To hear what Jesus said about what Christians can eat, read Mk 7:18-19. Anyone reading bible online can cut and paste this for us? But we do have parallel requirements: just as Jews were delivered from slavery in Egypt in order to gather before God at Mt Sinai as they prepare to enter the promised land, so we Christians were delivered from slavery to sin to be gathered as a Church before Jesus, as we prepare to enter Heaven. Application: Christians are not bothered about being defiled by food, but should be bothered about being defiled by a lifestyle that is indistinguishable from when they were still slaves to sin.....</div>
