            <div class='col-md body'>Mooncake Festival is breezing closer and closer.<br><br>This year, I have a slight affinity with it, not to say that I want it. I mean, I haven't celebrated mooncake festival for many years.<br><br>I was asked to sell mooncakes as a fund raising effort for the ECA I joined. Mind you, I only joined them to help them with their website.<br><br>Only sold, like 5 so far.<br><br>There was this day, last Friday, where nim nim(names have been changed to protect the innocent) was talking about her enjoying the festival every year. "It's good to celebrate this every year. What happens if we lived a short life?" I heard her going.<br><br>She was recounting her beautiful memories of dragging her friend down at 4am to look at the long swan(pardon my translation), and how everytime she turn those lanterns into ash.<br><br>My friend, eijnah(names have be changed to protect the innocent), was triggered by her joyous exploits, added," Yah Yah. Especially when everyone starts gathering twigs, candles and everything they can find to burn."<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>I can barely remember how I celebrated mine.<br><br>There used to be staged events, held by the GRC, at the open field down my block.<br><br>Singers and jokers(is there a better term for this?) were invited to perform for the night.<br><br>There was one year I won 3 prizes from the lucky draw. Wow. You can almost see the jealous looks from the ground everytime I walked up to claim them.<br><br>I would go down with my childhood friend of years, Vincent, of whom I have lost contact with, to prowl the fields. We don't normally stay long, carrying lanterns ain't meant for destructive kids like us. We are born to kill sand worms in computers. Yeah, I was a poor kid then who would always go to his home and play Dune.<br><br>He has moved away, to somewhere. Hope we'll meet again.<br><br>Come back to the recent years, maybe it's got to do with the age, I no longer find mooncake festival that alluring anymore. But it's still good to think back to the good old days.</div>
