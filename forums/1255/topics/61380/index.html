(90 degrees plane from direction of sun) if the sky is cloudy, then go shoot urself or something  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>now, be careful with the polarizer when using wide angles, becos with WAs u can catch ALOT of sky in ur frame, so there will be some parts of the sky that are REALLY blue, and other parts that are not (as in not part of the "fingers" when u open and close ur palm). this might result in a very unnatural photo becos of a very contrasty sky (very deep blue vs very light blue)<br><br>of course some photographers have made use of this effect to their advantage, it depends on what u're after.<br><br>also, NEVER use a polariser with flash, firstly u lose 2 stops of light, secondly some of the light will be filtered away.<br><br>and if u must stack filters, put the polarizer last, but be careful of vignetting.<br><br>eh.. i think that's enuff for polarizers from me for now. to be honest, i can't remember the last time i used mine. prob in australia. in sg, the sky is either too sh[/i]it or too cloudy, i rather not lose my 2 stops of light and get more contrast with photoshop!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess u are using film cam hor?<br>A note to remember, if u are shooting on slides and not negative, please remember to take out the UV filter b4 u attach ur polariser.<br>Otherwise, if u put on both, u get wat is called the vignetting effect. Means, the four corners of ur photo will have this black shadows.<br><br>As for the intensity of the blue, I think somestimes experience count. When u shoot more, u will get the hang of it and sooner or later, u will be able to use aga-rations to roughly guess how much to turn. It is all about the photographer's approach and experience. Equipments are jus there for pple to use. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I am using a EOS 300...entry level SLR...but I heck care wat.<br>Later in the noon still going to shoot at myanmar with a bunch of S2 Pro DSLR pple. But is the most impt is, to enjoy photography. To love the feeling of pressing the shutter button and see the output. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Best of lucks!<br>I see yah guys n gals in forum next friday then</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>vignetting occurs regardless of the medium you use.. it occurs when the additional attachments  such as filters or lens hood obstructs the lens' field of view <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
