However, i will not penalize you on your lack of contrast in focus and failure to capture my attention to your subject. To me everything in your photos including the skater are the subjects. Without anyone of them this photo can never be taken and presented.<br><br>Maybe i sketch so the first thing that caught my attention is the spray paint art. For a viewer into sports he may be more interested in the skater. For a photographer he may be looking for the depth of field and subject, color, correct or desirable exposure, composition and depth of field of the photo. To sell the photo there are even more constraints. Trademarks and copyrights logo, signed model release for faces etc.<br><br>Rush into it and you will never be one. There are photographers who are born under the signs of luck with wealth enought to buy all the equipments, books and air tickets to shoot at different location when there's a chance. Generally most people opened to these opportunities can progress at a faster pace. With photoshop, a quick artist can be made.<br><br>Do you know that before the early camera's were invented people paint and sketch and scribble on the walls to express an Art, a feeling and to keep (archive) memories?<br><br>Now the true meaning of Art has turned to the gray. Art for money to please the people paying for it or art for the pleasure of the soul. Don't worry. A person can take a normal photo with pieces of good equipment while another who work hard enough can take great photos with an avergae camera. Also, professionals take crappy phhotos too, just that they don't show it to the mass viewers.</div>

However doing this may also result in a blurred subject when your camera shake, shutter lag etc. Usually if you have a camera with burst (continuous) shooting modes you can take a few shoots with the press of the shutter and pick the best or bests for printout. A very similar photo in concept to yours was posted in a thread started by Haoz30. In my personal humble opinion shooting fast action sports is a real challenge for a PnS. Night shoots are alright with most PnS with the aid of a tripod. dSLR with selective high power zooming lens are preferred for fast action sports.</div>

However if you go manual you will have full control over the shutter too. You 4th photo [url]http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o193/sphure/P1010205copy.jpg[url] has a shutter of 1/500 sec and f/3.5 - small aperture yet a reasonably high (fast) shutter speed. It freezes the subject in motion without making the photo appear too dark. I suggest you go manual. If its a dark cloudy day with overcast you can try using some flash. i also notice that those photos with blurred motion were shot with slower shutter speeds. Why? was your cam on auto or either priority modes? Apparently 1/500 sec worked well in freezing the motion at that scenario. Shooting fast motion shots relies mostly on the shutter speeds. As for lighting you just have to shoot from a location that enables you to draw in the most light possible or use forced illumination on the subject.<br><br>Some (in fact most i think) PnS have zoom lenses and wide angle lens available as add-ons to the basic cam unit to bring up the overall zooming specs and bring down the overall wide angle specs. My Sony-DSCP73 have .7x wide angle lenses and 1.7x telephoto lens. However i feel that a combination of 2 assembly of lens may not be as reliable as the single zoom/ wide angle lens assembly for DSLR in terms of QC and testing methods. With an assembled lens the whole unit are tested for performance while for the default lens and add-on lenses with PnS, they were tested separately.<br><br>Anti-shake are as effective as it can be to arrest common handshake from normal shots. Yes for night shooting and when the shutter lag increases, it is recommended to use atripod or some support for your camera.<br><br>If you zoom you lens to capture something from far, the focus falls on the subject and more light will be reflected back to your lens from the subject as compared to the backdrop or surrounding. However depending on the lights of every situation your camera now may suffer from inablility to focus. Check you camera's LCD since most should have a green dot to inform you of focusing issue if its flashing. However if you were to use a telephoto lens, the default focal len is already very long so what you see though the lens is what you get. you are not zooming optically nor digitally. You will not have a focus or hand shake problem in daylight situation. thus you can use such high power lenses with fast shutter speed to capture subjects in fast motion.<br></div>
