            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rainy day.. This <span style="font-style: italic;">girl</span></span><br><br>Cold now.. In my office... Reminds me of this rainy day... Dizzling actually..?<br><br>I was back in school.. Ngee Ann.. To catch some information from the library... I was already a graduate back then... The night was cold.. Like now... My hands are usually the 1st to feel the chill? Then I noticed her... This pretty girl... Alone.. Holding a computer laptop... This <span style="font-style: italic;">unique</span> girl.. So close.. Yet so far away.. SO CLOSE.. Yet not a single physical touch... That's why I still remember her quite well up till today and often thinks of this night...<br><br>We went up the same bus.. She was just sitting infront of me.. She was seated with her body facing the side of the bus... It was a cold smooth... Quiet ride...<br><br>Was wondering a little about her.. And such it happens that we lighted at the same bus stop... Rain was getting pretty heavy by then... She was sat there.. At the bus-stop.. Just me and her... I said "Hi..." Couldn't remember what was the rest which followed, but she was friendly... Then we started chatted... I can't remember the contents but it was good... Never really felt so close to a stranger at all... I'd always wanted this kinda complete offguard trust from a complete stranger? And there she was giving it to me... We chatted, she smiled... With her pretty face.. Just like an old friend..<br><br>Time really flies when you're enjoying it.. Without a moment too soon, it was about 2 hours passed... The rain had long stopped by then.. She apologised and politely admitted that she had to leave... Not being too disappointed like most departures, I just knew this moment had to come.. I was so fully contented that I so gladly sent her off up her bus... Smiling.. The bus left..<br><br>I stood by the bus-stop. Realising that I actually didn't get her contact number from her... At 1st a little frustrated with my own slip of mind... Then I smiled.. Realising that perhaps it's just better this way..? What if she already had a bf? What if she really isn't as nice as I thought of her to be...?<br><br>I continued to stand on the spot.. Smiling silly at my own mistake and how it turned out to be so... Not so bad afterall..? Leaving much of the rest to my imagination.. And having had such a simple yet wonderful 'dream'... What more can I ask for?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net meet up - <span style="font-style: italic;">fast</span> <strong>fling</strong></span><br><br>"Okie, see you at Marina MRT then?" We hung up the phone...<br><br>I was at the destinated MRT station... LATE. I can't remember was it 15 mins or 30 mins late.. But I was in a panic... She don't have a mobile phone.. Nor a pager.. Nothing.. If I MISS her, I would have MISSED her completely.. This girl who so very much captured my attention over the net...<br><br>I eyed every corner of the station.. Good thing was.. The place's pretty empty.. There stood this young lady before me... Very fair with BIG BRIGHT eyes... Blue buttoned jeans material wear with a collar.. Buttoned from her bosom to her calf...<br><br>She looked at me. Such an adorable creature.. For the rest of the night we were walking all over the place at Marina... The parks.. The playground.. Arcade... Bowling centre...<br><br>She simply had such beautiful eyes.. And her conversation despite her young age back then... 19... Was so much of intelligence and yet so pure like a child's... Witty was the way she reacts.. Lovely was her smile...<br><br>We simply spent the whole night talking about EVERYTHING and ANYTHING which is under the heavens.. And above? Hehheh...<br><br>Time quickly passed... It was getting late... At one point of our strolls she slowed down... Drawn her body nears me, leaning a bit against my chest... I held her.. I <span style="font-style: italic;">felt</span> her.... Somehow we just felt so close... I started to kiss her down her neck despite the fact that we were just standing by the side of the road... I tasted her powder... Eek.. I stopped. Looked at her. She eyed me from the corner of her eyes... I looked at her.. Such a lovely pair of eyes... So 'pure', yet such wanting looks on her... I started to taste her again... Ear lobes.. Held her close... Wondering if I should unbuttoned her from the top or the bottom up?<br><br>Then I simply stopped... Turned her around and looked at her... She was so young... What was I doing? I mean... I really enjoyed my time with her... Her company and our conversations... I simply stared at her... I can tell she's already pretty 'warmed up'... Her face was flushing.. Can even tell from the dim light from the street lamps.. And her body heat.. I felt sorry. For starting.. For stopping... She started to look frustrated... She asked me to get her a cab and send her home.. In the end I didn't...<br><br>I was a NSF back then. Limited spending power and it just happened that it was at the end of the salary pay.. Only could have got the allowance the next day.. She hinted a couple more times (Once or twice?) before I previously stopped my act... Come to think of it, I was actually quite young myself..? 21... Probably didn't felt like 21 back then..? Damn NS... Anyway, by the time I told her that I don't have any money to send her back home on a cab, she was pretty pissed already.. As you could have imagined, we never contacted each other again ever since that day.. The 1st day we met...<br><br>Yeah... She was REAL GOOD... From the LOOKS to her intelligence... To the level of communication we were having.. But I simply couldn't bring myself to do it.... Hmm... She's too young? What was I thinking about...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In Memories</span> - The 'wonder' girl</span><br><br>I figured that if I'm gonna be writing this, she should have easily figured out who I am by reading its content? And probably as easily recognises herself...<br><br>My <span style="font-style: italic;">Ex</span>... Not just ANY one... I've had countless EXs that I simply don't bother to keep the figure running on my mind anymore... But THIS ONE... The DEEPEST one...<br><br>She's not those pretty type of girl... She's witty and streets smart.. VERY CARING.. (Most of my gfs are quiet caring to me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>The 1st day (or rather night?) I met her was our plan to go SPARKS... She had a friend along.. Quite a pretty friend, but somehow I just don't have any interest in her... Instead my attention was all on J...<br><br>She's bubbly and talks alot...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  She shown interest in me in the disco and I was pretty much feeling the same... There were simply so many 'magical' things which happened between me and her which I couldn't quite explain... After that was supper.. And called it a night.. But... Not the end of story yet...<br><br>Our 2nd meet up... We went East Coast Park... She told me that she and her ex often goes there for hanky panky stuffs... But DON'T try anything funny on her... She said it was only a normal meet up and she felt like going to the beach again... I rogered that told her I kinda miss the beach and sea too...<br><br>We reached... Walked along the beach.. Came to this spot where couples were kissing (and such?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).. We got seated on a beach... She was staring into the sea straight up front... So I was staring to my side... Along the beach with the sea waves... So beautiful was the moonlight which baths on the scenery... Then she hugged me. Started to taste my neck... BOY, was she HOT or what? Not to mention FAST??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  I can sense that she was all HEATED UP... VERY 'hungry'... I was a little CONFUSED.. For it all happened TOO FAST... As fast as she started off, she quickly moved to unzip me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Then she was TASING ME... YEAH... UP FRONT... My feeling back then was MORE of STUNNED than anything else...? Then I guess both of us were pretty heated up... Then the RA stuffs just kicked in.... Dot dot dot dot....<br><br>When we were done, I looked at her. She seems witty... Bubbly.. But never did I expect her to be SO HOT? She told me she don't just 'do it' with anybody else.. Especially to start off just like that.... It was a kinda 'special feeling'... I told her "Okie.. I believe you.." In fact I really do...<br><br>After a while of chatting, we took strolls along ECP again... Very long quiet night... Along a certain path, strangely enough fog from nowhere started to pour in.... Within a short moment, we were like in a mist of dream... Along this concrete path... Suddenly, all the people around us just seemed to disappear... And we were just walking.. And the path simply looked so familar... The scene.. Like we had done this together before.. Which obviously can't be it as we were only meeting for the 2nd time...<br><br>The rest of the night was followed by passionate kisses which lasted for around 4 hours or so...? YEAH... You heard it RIGHT... How time passes when you are kissing? Hehheh... And YES... It was NOTHING but just KISSES... Strangely enough, if you ask me now to simply just kiss for one hour... I would really wonder if I can do it??<br><br>We had a couple more of those 'flashback' things... Where suddenly there were simply no sound and no one seemed to be around us at all... The scene appeared blurrish white according to both of us... Twice in CLUBBING SCENES and ONCE at a foodcourt... There were other 'strange' things which happened during our being together which really made me believe that it was a VERY UNUSUAL relationship... I don't really believe in karmas and stuffs... But if there really is one? I guess this should be the CLOSEST I ever got to...?</div>

Because it was fated to be... Because he believes that it should be... And because he wants it to be... CHAOS...<br><br>No more spicy stuffs... Haha... This is about my current girl.. The one who I'm with MOST of the time...<br><br>It started off as a SIMPLE relationship... This SIMPLE girl... Everything was ALL SO SIMPLE... But as SIMPLE as she looks... She is one of the FEW (if any at all) of my gfs to TRULY EARN my RESPECT...<br><br>No doubt she's not perfect... I can see flaws over her.. (hey, isn't a difficult thing to pick out flaws from someone yeah?) But she's INDEED VERY STRONG.. And she's such an UNDERSTANDING girl... I'm simply loss for words when it comes to describing her...<br><br>She's my 'little devil girl'... When she 1st introduced herself as that, I just passed it off as a casual remark... But as I got to know her better and more.. I realised that she INDEED can understand me as a 'Devil'... Not just who I am... But also aspects of me...<br><br>Understanding and tolerating me... Then to UNDERSTANDING me AGAIN... She REALLY AMAZES me...<br><br>Though I really don't know how long I would last with her... But I just know I REALLY LOVE her for now...<br><br>Silly me...

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SICK</span></span></strong><br><br>I remember there was this once when I wasn't feeling very well... Sort of like mild fever.. So being the usual me, I tried not to take any medication.. And I was thinking... Perhaps I should go perspire a little with some exercises..? Maybe it'll make me feel more healthy..?<br><br>So OFF I went to join my friends for a group of basketball... By the time I was playing my game, my condition was already sort of getting worse.. Just that it don't really show as I was all heated up and perspiring with the game...<br><br>Then I couldn't take it anymore.. Feeling weak, I just bid them goodbye.. Walked to the bus-stop to take a direct bus home... By then my body was already feeling VERY COLD.. And the CHILL up against my body as the wind blows against the perspiration drying up on me... Arrghrr... SICK. Which was what I was already.. I simply HATE to be SICK... Guess nobody would?<br><br>Waiting for what seemed like ENDLESS HOURS, my bus FINALLY arrived... While I barely made out the bus figures (somehow I just managed to tell that's my bus??)... The rest which followed I can't even recall a bit... Oh yeah... The AIR-CON on the bus... WAS KILLING me... DAMN.. Why do they have SUCH STRONG AIR-CONs at night?? As my mind went to a distal blank... The next moment I just realised that I've managed to get back home... I just laid down on my sofa... Can't even move a bit... Shivering away.. My mum asked me what happened... I just looked at her while my body continued to withdraw... Realising that I was having a fever, she just popped the panadols into my mouth... DAMN... One of the most awful taste.. Yucks.. Never like them... My eyes closed.. My eyes opened... Next medication dosage popped in...<br><br>Cannot imagine what could have happened if I was all alone at home...? Hmm... Makes me think of how some elderly died while they're staying alone at home..?</div>

I was quite good in Maths (for my school's standard) and was in of the few chosen ones to represent the school for the Olympics Maths competition.. When I was there, I realised that alot of things have not been taught by our teacher yet... The paper was testing things way ahead of our schedule... In the end, most of us just left many of the questions (almost half?) BLANK...<br><br>Discussing.. We were saying why didn't our teacher taught us beforehand or even told us that we would be tested on such..? No preparations.. Nothings... I thought.. Was our teacher was lazy or busy..? And to think that I actually respected him so much... He's always SO KEEN in teaching us MATHS... SO MANY ADDITIONAL stuffs he taught us... And his PASSION for MATHS... Why was he like that?<br><br>Years gone by... I thought... Perhaps our teacher know that we probably won't stand a good chance in winning... Meaning he looked down on us? Why kill our chance..? At least he could have told us..??<br><br>But well.. He didn't... I think he fully understand that we're already very busy trying to cope with our subjects... Which are mostly examinable... I remember him telling us to just go and have an 'experience' of it... He's always smiling.. So kind..<br><br>I guess it's really for our good? We probably won't win anyway... If we're to try and take up all the last min studying, we probably won't be doing any better... Might even affect our other subjects... Might even lose our passion for Maths...<br><br>I guess he's always him... His PASSION... His commitment... Conviction... He made me understand... 'Winning' is not everything... Yes... HE - I STILL RESPECT...</div>

This <span style="font-style: italic;">girl</span></span><br><br>Cold now.. In my office... Reminds me of this rainy day... Dizzling actually..?<br><br>I was back in school.. Ngee Ann.. To catch some information from the library... I was already a graduate back then... The night was cold.. Like now... My hands are usually the 1st to feel the chill? Then I noticed her... This pretty girl... Alone.. Holding a computer laptop... This <span style="font-style: italic;">unique</span> girl.. So close.. Yet so far away.. SO CLOSE.. Yet not a single physical touch... That's why I still remember her quite well up till today and often thinks of this night...<br><br>We went up the same bus.. She was just sitting infront of me.. She was seated with her body facing the side of the bus... It was a cold smooth... Quiet ride...<br><br>Was wondering a little about her.. And such it happens that we lighted at the same bus stop... Rain was getting pretty heavy by then... She was sat there.. At the bus-stop.. Just me and her... I said "Hi..." Couldn't remember what was the rest which followed, but she was friendly... Then we started chatted... I can't remember the contents but it was good... Never really felt so close to a stranger at all... I'd always wanted this kinda complete offguard trust from a complete stranger? And there she was giving it to me... We chatted, she smiled... With her pretty face.. Just like an old friend..<br><br>Time really flies when you're enjoying it.. Without a moment too soon, it was about 2 hours passed... The rain had long stopped by then.. She apologised and politely admitted that she had to leave... Not being too disappointed like most departures, I just knew this moment had to come.. I was so fully contented that I so gladly sent her off up her bus... Smiling.. The bus left..<br><br>I stood by the bus-stop. Realising that I actually didn't get her contact number from her... At 1st a little frustrated with my own slip of mind... Then I smiled.. Realising that perhaps it's just better this way..? What if she already had a bf? What if she really isn't as nice as I thought of her to be...?<br><br>I continued to stand on the spot.. Smiling silly at my own mistake and how it turned out to be so... Not so bad afterall..? Leaving much of the rest to my imagination.. And having had such a simple yet wonderful 'dream'... What more can I ask for?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>BRAVO..!!!

When I 1st knew what sex was... A great pleasurable feeling... Guys going out with beautiful pretty girls... Sexy ones... I thought to myself... I want to be an expert in sex one day...<br><br>So I've learned... Got 'better'...? And still is LEARNING... Till some points of my life, things got rather BLUR in my life... Women in my life... Are they really for me or just the SEX?<br><br>I think sometimes life really have its ways to make you LAUGH... When at the end of the road, you realise what you've always been after might not really be what you wanted all along... It just makes you think ALOT.... About what you've done... What you could have done alternatively... And still it might not turn out the way you thought it would....?<br><br>It makes me think... So what if I can enjoy sex...? So what if my partner could...? I guess some sex are just so 'empty'...? After all the sweat and heat... It just makes you wonder where you've gone to... Where you've been...<br><br>Don't misunderstand me, I LOVE SEX... Yeah... SEX is GREAT and sex can be COOL... Especially when it's done the RIGHT WAY... Especially when it's appreciated and there's MEANING to it....<br><br>But I guess I also like sweets, ice-creams and candies equally....? And...
