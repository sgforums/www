            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter TWENTY-THREE<br><br>Sung Hoon leaned over his bedroom window. He saw Kyung Hee changing her clothes. Just then she glanced over and saw Sung Hoon watching her. She threw a shirt at him. "What do you think you're doing you Peeping Tom?" He blocked her shirt. "Can you come over?" Kyung Hee looked at him. 'He looks so sad.' She nodded. "Okay."<br>Sung Hoon pulled her across from her house and into his room. She sat down and started to look around. She never had been in Sung Hoon's room before but he was always in hers. "Well what do you want to talk about?" Sung Hoon looked at her with sad eyes. "Umm...is it true you're going to the U.S. in two days?"<br>"Oh you heard about it already?"<br>"Why didn't you tell me?"<br>"Why do you care anyways?"<br>Sung Hoon got mad. "Why do you always assume that if there's something involving you that I don't care?" Sung Hoon started to front her as she backed up into a corner. She was shocked. She never saw Sung Hoon this mad before. "Because you never seemed to care before." Sung Hoon grabbed her wrists and held them up. "Well you know what? I DO care." He began to let her go. "It's just that you don't care about me enough to realize it." He sat down on his bed.<br>Kyung Hee sat down next to him. "Sung Hoon...what's wrong?"<br>"Nothing."<br>"Please tell me." Sung Hoon looked at Kyung Hee. His mind kept telling him that this will be the last time he will ever see her. 'It's now or never.' Sung Hoon took a deep breath and told her exactly how he felt.<br>"I love you."<br>Kyung Hee stood up in shock. "What?!"<br>Sung Hoon stood up with her. "I love you." Kyung Hee couldn't believe her ears. "Wait...do you know what you're saying?" He nodded his head. "Yes and I do mean it. I love you So Kyung Hee." She moved away from him.<br>"Do you know what you're saying? I'm going to leave Korea in just two more days with Ji Won. I'm planning to be with him forever."<br>Sung Hoon nodded his head sadly. "I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that." Kyung Hee sighed in relief. "It's okay." But then it hit Sung Hoon. "NO!" Kyung Hee looked at him surprised. "What do you mean 'No'"? He looked at her directly. "Why should I be sorry for saying that I love you? It's the truth!"<br>Kyung Hee backed up again and then she began to cry. Sung Hoon tried to move near her to comfort her but she pushed him away. "No! After all this time you say that you love me?" He looked at her sadly.<br>Kyung Hee looked at him through her tears. "I'm sorry Sung Hoon. I want to be with the one I love."<br>Sung Hoon looked at her back. "But do you really love him?" She paused. She thought about it and couldn't find the answer herself. So she didn't answer and looked away. Sung Hoon thought that was the answer. "It's okay because if I do truly love you then all I can wish for is for you to be happy." He leaned over to hold her shoulders and kissed her on the forehead. "Goodbye."<br>Kyung Hee looked at him as he walked away. "Sung Hoon...wait."<br>He felt hope go through him. "Yes?"<br>"Is it okay if I take something of yours as a memory?"<br>That flicker of hope instantly died. He bowed his head down. "Go ahead. Take anything you want." Then he left his room and Kyung Hee left too. Sung Hoon didn't know it but his journal was gone.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter TWENTY-FOUR / Final<br><br>"Boarding Flight Number 637! All passengers please come aboard at this time."<br>Kyung Hee looked out the window of her airplane seat, looking at Korea for the last time. Ji Won sat down next to her. He held her hand and gave her a little smile. "Don't worry sweetie. It'll be okay just as long as we're together." Kyung Hee gave him a weak smile and nodded. Ji Won looked at her carefully.<br>"You sure are pretty today. Remember back then when you were so much like a guy? I mean I couldn't believe that I had dated you back then."<br>Kyung Hee was taken aback. 'Does look always have to matter?' she thought. She sighed and didn't listen to Ji Won as he continued talking. She pulled out of her handbag the book she took from Sung Hoon. She didn't know exactly what it was except that it had Sung Hoon's name on it.<br>She opened it up. 'Oh my gosh! I took his journal!' She closed the book instantly. Her curiosity got the best of her. She opened it up. The book was held in place by something. She took it out and saw the it was a little bundle strand of hair tied together by an ivory ribbon. She realized it was her hair and the ribbon was the same one Sung Hoon took from her when he pulled on her pigtails.<br>Tears fell down her face as she held onto her hair. 'Sung Hoon...you had loved me so long ago?' She began reading his entries.<br>October 20<br>Too close. I can't believe it. It had all happened so fast that I didn't have time to think. I would have lost Kyung Hee if I hadn't seen that fan falling. If it did fall and kill Kyung Hee...what would become of me? She'll be gone forever, leaving me in this cruel and lonely world. You would have thought that I would have told her that I loved her right then because I came so close to losing her. But I didn't. When I pushed her out of the way in time, I also chopped off her beautiful long hair. I know it was her prized possession. I said something really stupid and now she hates me forever. Why must I always hurt the one I love the most?<br>Kyung Hee paused in shock. After all these years, she had blamed Sung Hoon for cutting off her hair when all he did was risk his own life to save hers. More tears slipped down her face as she continued reading.<br>February 14<br>Ha Ha! Hey, today I was teasing Kyung Hee in the cafeteria again. She was so mad. She hated it when I called her Macho Man. Is it my fault she looks so much like a guy? Hmm...but underneath all that she was the still same So Kyung Hee that I love. It's so hard telling her how I feel cuz every time we talk, we end up arguing or dissing each other about something. It's Valentine's Day today and I don't even have the guts to give her the dozen roses I have right here. I hope she's not out with some other guy though...<br>Kyung Hee let out a little laugh. It figured Sung Hoon would write something like that. She flipped the book all the way to the last entry.<br>July 7<br>I love camping. Yesterday I was out camping with everyone and the most important of all, Kyung Hee. That stupid jerk Ji Won made me fall into a pit but like always, Kyung Hee was there for me. I don't know what to do without her. We talked about our past together and of course, she reminded me of how I tortured her. Underneath the moonlight, she looked so pretty. I began to realize that my childhood happiness was all because of her. She didn't laugh at me when she found out my fear. And you know what? Since Kyung Hee was down in that dark hole with me I'm not afraid of the dark anymore. But I'm still afraid to admit to Kyung Hee that I love her. What if she rejects me? All I know is that I can't live without her....<br>Kyung Hee shut the journal. She began to do some thinking of her own. She looked over at Ji Won, who was sleeping. Then she realized it. All her tears and happiness were all because of Sung Hoon. He was the only one who was able to make her laugh or cry. She knew right then she couldn't leave.<br>"Flight 637 is prepared for take-off."<br>Sung Hoon watched the plane for Flight 637 take off. He walked away form the fence when the plane was no longer seen. Tears fell down his cheeks as he started to head home. 'It's over.' Sung Hoon got into his car. He leaned against his seat and sighed. 'If we were meant to be together, then Kyung Hee will show up right now.'<br>"Kang Sung Hoon!"<br>Sung Hoon sat up instantly. He recognized that voice. "Kyung Hee? Can't be!" He looked up and saw her running towards him. He was so happy he couldn't speak. He got out of his car right away and ran towards her. She ended up in his arms. He spun her around. He gently placed her down and said, "I don't get it! Your plane left already! I mean how?"<br>Kyung Hee smiled. "I got off the plane before it took off. Ji Won wasn't exactly happy about it but it's okay." Sung Hoon looked at her shyly. "But I thought you want to spend the rest of your life with someone you fell in love with first?" Kyung Hee gazed into the face of the person she knew she wanted to see every day. She leaned over to kiss him. Then she whispered,<br>"It was you all along."<br></div>
