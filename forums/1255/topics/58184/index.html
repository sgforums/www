            <div class='col-md body'>A story i got from my fren, sharing with you guys.. got 24 chapters.. Enjoy..<br><br>Chapter ONE<br><br>"Let me out!" screamed a terrified eight year old Sung Hoon. He was trapped in total darkness with four walls closing in on him. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he remembered what had happen.<br>He was playing hide and seek with two boys from his school. Their names were Eun Ji Won and Chu Tae Won. Sung Hoon was so happy when they invited him to join them. In school Sung Hoon was the most popular kid because his aunt was the famous actress Jung Yeh Ja but when all the excitement about her was over, he was lonely all over again. In real life, Sung Hoon doesn't have any friends because all the other kids assumed he was too good to play with them.<br>"Okay," said Ji Won. "I''ll seek and you guys hide. 10...15...20...25..."<br>Sung Hoon jumped with excitement and started running to find a place to hide. He saw a refrigerator near his house. He wondered where it came from but then didn't care because it would make a great hiding place. Sung Hoon hid for a while and then he heard Ji Won's and Tae Won's voices. He wondered what was going on and then he heard a noise.<br>"I hope you like it in there Sung Hoon!"<br>'What?' thought Sung Hoon. He tried to push open the door but it wouldn't budge. He felt trap and started to gasp for air. He pounded on the door and screamed, "Let me out you guys!"<br>Ji Won just laughed. "Why don't you ask your aunt Yeh Ja to help you? Act like you're better than us just because she is famous."<br>Sung Hoon's heart sank. He couldn't believe it. He thought Ji Won and Tae Won were his friends but they had tricked him. He began to cry. "I don't act like I'm better. Please let me out."<br>Tae Won began to laugh. "This will teach you to mess with us." Then he and Ji Won left.<br>In the dark Sung Hoon sat and curled himself into a little ball. He was terrified. He was scared of the dark and worse, he was afraid of being alone. Then he heard a knocking.<br>A little girly voice called out, "Is someone in there?"<br>Sung Hoon stood up and banged his fists against the door. "Hurry up and let me out!"<br>"Wait!"<br>He heard the noise of wood sliding and the door suddenly opened. Just as he saw light coming he pushed his way out. He bent over and began breathing fast because he almost ran out of air when he was inside the refrigerator. Then a pair of Mary Janes came into his view. When he looked up he saw a pair of big brown eyes staring back at him. It was a little girl in pig tails that saved him.<br>They looked at each other for a while and didn't say anything. Then the girl looked down and kicked her foot into the dirt.<br>"Umm...what were you doing in my fridge?"<br>Sung Hoon looked at her and then he turned away and ran into his house, leaving the little girl staring after him.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter TWO<br><br>'Huh? What just happened here?' Kyung Hee thought. "Aye! I'll never understand boys!" she screamed out loud. She was watching Sung Hoon as he ran into the house next door.<br>"What don't you understand sweetie?" her grandpa asked as he came out the front porch to look for her.<br>"Oh nothing grampie."<br>"Come here."<br>He waved for Kyung Hee to come sit with him on the porch swing. She walked over to him and sat on his lap.<br>"Yes grampie?"<br>"Do you like it here?"<br>She nodded her head. "Ah huh. I get to be with you all the time but I'm still mad at mommy and daddy for leaving me." She frowned and crossed her arms.<br>Her grandpa let out a little laugh. "Silly girl, your parents are geologists. They have to travel around the world. They can't take you with them because you have school. Besides they'll send you presents."<br>Kyung Hee's eyes got wide. "Presents? A lot?"<br>"Yes."<br>She clapped her hands. "Yay!"<br>Back at home Sung Hoon buried his face into his pillow and cried. Then he heard a knock on his door.<br>"Sung Hoonee?"<br>Sung Hoon quickly wiped his nose on his sleeve.<br>"Yes? Come in."<br>Then his mother came in. "What's wrong honey? Why are you crying?"<br>He shook his head. "Oh it's nothing mommy."<br>His mom looked around his room. "Where are your friends?"<br>Sung Hoon tried his best not to cry. "They....they went home." His mom hugged him. "Oh, you're sad that they had to go home so early?" Sung Hoon held onto his mom tighter and didn't answer. His mom thought for a while.<br>"Hey I know. A new family just moved in next door. An old man and a little girl. You can go play with her. Do you want to?"<br>"Okay mommy."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter THREE<br><br>~Ding dong~<br>Kyung Hee stopped putting her toys away and looked up at the front door. 'Hmm...I wonder who it could be?'<br>"Kyung Hee! Answer the door!"<br>"Okay grampie."<br>When she opened the door she saw a pretty lady and the boy she helped earlier. "Hi!" She grabbed Sung Hoon's hand. "Are you okay?" Sung Hoon just looked at her and didn't answer.<br>"Oh you two already met?"<br>"Not really. I don't even know his name."<br>"I see. You can call me Mrs. Kang and this is my boy Sung Hoon. Is your grandfather home?"<br>"Ah huh. My name is So Kyung Hee. Come in."<br>Kyung Hee closed the door behind them. Then she ran upstairs to get her grandpa. Then the grandpa told her, "Why don't you and Sung Hoon go outside while Mrs. Kang and I have a talk?" "Okay grampie. Come on Sung Hoon," she said as she pulled him out of the house with her.<br>When they got outside Kyung Hee felt a hard shove behind her back. She fell on the grass but something there cut her leg and made her bleed. She looked up and saw Sung Hoon glaring at her with the coldest eyes she has ever seen.<br>'Don't pretend you want to be my friend,' thought Sung Hoon. He was going to make Kyung Hee pay for what Ji Won and Tae Won did to him.<br>"Why did you push me?"<br>"I hate ugly girls! And you are really damn oogly!"<br>Kyung Hee opened her mouth in shock. She began to cry. Sung H felt bad but he was still mad at what those guys did to him so he wasn't going to stop.<br>"What? Oh, are you crying? You are such a baby!"<br>That made Kyung Hee instantly stop. She stood up. "I'm not a baby!"<br>"Yes you are!" Sung Hoon yelled back.<br>Then he yanked on one of her braids and pulled the ivory ribbon out. "Ow!" She yanked back her hair and then replied, "You're the baby! Who was crying inside my fridge huh?" That made Sung Hoon really mad. He pushed her hard. She fell down and cried really loud. Her grandpa and Mrs. Kang ran out.<br>"What happened Kyung Hee?"<br>Kyung Hee pointed her finger at Sung Hoon. She began to sob again. "He...he-"<br>"I accidentally made her fall," cut in Sung Hoon.<br>Kyung Hee looked up at Sung Hoon in shock. 'That liar!' she thought. "I'm sorry," said Sung Hoon as he began to bawl. He looked at Kyung Hee with his puppyish eyes.<br>"I didn't mean to make you fall."<br>Mrs. Kang held Sung Hoon. "I know you didn't mean to make Kyung Hee fall."<br>Then her grandpa asked, "Are you okay Kyung Hee?"<br>Kyung Hee looked up and saw Sung Hoon's lips move. "Baby," he said loud enough just for her to hear. Kyung Hee bit her lip. "I'm okay grampie. It was an accident."<br>"I'm sorry Mr. So but I have to be home and prepare dinner for my husband.It was a pleasure meeting you. Bye Kyung Hee!"<br>"Bye," said Sung Hoon and he gave Kyung Hee a wave. Kyung Hee watched them as they left. Then she saw Sung Hoon turn around and giver her a little smirk. She glared back at him.<br>'It's war. I'm going to hurt you one of these days Kang Sung Hoon,' she promised herself.<br>This was the beginning of a NOT so beautiful friendship...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter FOUR<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Five years later...<br>During these years Sung Hoon and Kyung Hee went to school together everyday. Kyung Hee was the target of Sung Hoon's tortures every single day. He would call her names and hit her. He would push her around in school but in front of adults, he would act like he was her best friend. It was a nightmare for Kyung Hee because Sung Hoon requested to have every single class with her and he was her partner in every single project. What's worse was Sung Hoon became the most popular boy in school so she couldn't get anyone on her side to help her avoid him. Also during this time, Sung Hoon met Kim Jae Duc and Lee Jae Jin. It took them a while before Sung Hoon would trust them. Eventually they became Sung Hoon's best friends as they hang out together more often. He let them in on the fun of teasing Kyung Hee but he would never let them physically harm her. And so it begins...Junior High...</span><br><br>"Heads up!"<br>Kyung Hee glanced up and saw a blurry object headed her way. Before she could block it, it hit her right smack on the head and gave her a bruise. "Ow!" she yelled and began to rub the spot where it hit her head. Sung Hoon began to walk towards her. He was the one who threw the football.<br>"Aww...did it hurt?"<br>Kyung Hee glared at him but he just smiled at her. She clenched her teeth and answered, "No." Right behind Sung Hoon was Jae Duc and Jae Jin. They were laughing.<br>"Hope you didn't make her cry man!" said Jae Jin.<br>Jae Duc shook his head. "Naw...her head has too many bones in it."<br>"Maybe that's why they call her 'BoneHead!'" yelled Sung Hoon.<br>All three of them started busting out laughing and gave each other high-fives. Kyung Hee stood up.<br>"You idiots! There are no bones in the head! You don't know anything! No wonder all of you are so dumb to make that stupid joke. I hope all three of you fail and repeat eighth grade!"<br>Jae Jin looked at her. "Aww...you don't mean that Kyung Hee. Cuz that means you'll graduate before Sung Hoon."<br>"Yeah," added Jae Duc. "You don't want to leave your Sung Hooney, do you?"<br>Kyung Hee's face turned red. "Shut up Jae Jin and Jae Duc! Kang Sung Hoon is nothing of mine!" She points a finger at Sung Hoon. "I hate you!"<br>Sung Hoon just gave her a smile and said, "No you don't."<br>"Ahhh!" she screamed and then stomped off to class.<br>'Those jerks,' Kyung Hee thought. 'Damn you Sung Hoon. Act like you're King of the school. I hope you get kicked off your throne Your Majesty!' She began to imagine herself choking Sung Hoon and she wasn't watching where she was going. Then she felt herself bump into someone.<br>"Ow!" said a voice.<br>"Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. I wasn't watching where I was going. Here let me help you up."<br>Kyung Hee bent down to help the guy up. She noticed he had a long neck and really beautiful eyes. Then she cursed herself for staring at him. He was cute!<br>"Sorry about that."<br>"It's okay."<br>He gave her a really sweet smile. "By the way, my name is Ko Ji Yong. And you are?"<br>"I'm So Kyung Hee. Nice to meet you Ji Yong oppa. Are you new here?"<br>"Yeah. First day."<br>"Let me see your schedule."<br>Kyung Hee looked at the list Ji Yong gave her. "Hey you take Tae Kwon Doe?"<br>"Yeah. I'm the Junior Champion back at my old school. So do we have any classes together?"<br>"Really? That's tight! Hmm...we have four classes together."<br>'He has four out of six classes with me,' she thought. 'Damn and that monster Sung Hoon has all six with me. Maybe Ji Yong will be the only guy here who won't listen to Sung Hoon and pick on me. Who knows? He might even kick Sung Hoon's butt in Tae Kwon Doe!' Just the thought of Sung Hoon getting beat up made Kyung Hee yelled out, "Yay!"<br>Ji Yong looked at her surprised. "Why are you so happy?"<br>"Oh nothing. Come on Ji Yong oppa. Let me take you to your first class with me."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter FIVE<br><br>Sung Hoon tapped his foot impatiently against his desk. 'Where the hell is Kyung Hee? She should have been back here before me and the others.' He sent Jae Duc and Jae Jin to go out and find her. He began to worry but then he heard Kyung Hee's voice. He watched her talking to a strange guy. They both sat down in a corner and then that guy handed Kyung Hee back her back pack. 'This does not look good,' thought Sung Hoon.<br>Kyung Hee looked over at Ji Yong's shoulder and saw Sung Hoon looking at them. 'Eat your heart out Sung Hoon.' Ji Yong had been so sweet to her. 'I wish Ji Yong was my older brother,' she thought. 'That way he can protect me from that animal Sung Hoon.' And just then Sung Hoon walked up to them.<br>"Hi. I'm Kang Sung Hoon the school's representative. And you are?" he looked at Ji Yong.<br>Ji Yong started to analyze Sung Hoon. 'So this is the guy who's picking on Kyung Hee.' Then Kyung Hee's words came back to him.<br>Sigh...Ji Yong looked at Kyung Hee. "What's the sigh for?" She looked down at the floor.<br>"Oh nothing."<br>"Come on Kyung Hee. If you called me oppa, that means you can tell me anything."<br>"Well...I'm afraid I'm going to get beaten up today."<br>"Huh? What do you mean?"<br>Kyung Hee lifted up the sleeve of her uniform. "Take a look at this." Ji Yong glanced at her arms. Both of them had dark purple bruises. "And this too," she added and pointed to her head. There was also a dark purple bruise there. Ji Yong looked at her in shock.<br>"Who did this to you?"<br>"A psycho by the name of Kang Sung Hoon."<br>"Why? Doesn't he know guys aren't supposed to hit girls?"<br>Kyung Hee glanced up at Ji Yong. "Human guys don't hit girls. Kang Sung Hoon is an animal." She sighed again. "But it's okay...I'm used to it by now." Ji Yong squeezed her shoulder.<br>"Well stop getting use to it. This torture is going to end today."<br>"What do you mean?"<br>"I mean, I'm going to teach this Sung Hoon guy a lesson."<br>Kyung Hee grabbed Ji Yong and hugged him. "Really?" He nodded. "Yay!" she screamed. "You can do it in P.E. today. His Highness is the champion here but not anymore now that you're here Ji Yong oppa.." Ji Yong gave her a smile and nodded.<br>"Let's get to class before we're late."<br>Ji Yong looked at Sung Hoon who had just approached him. "I'm Ko Ji Yong. And I know who you are."<br>Sung Hoon looked at Kyung Hee. 'Must have told him about me,' he thought. Sung Hoon shrugged his shoulders. "Fame spreads."<br>Ji Yong looked at him. 'Kyung Hee was right. That conceited bastard!"<br>Sung Hoon let out a fake cough. "Excuse me, Mr. Ko. I believe you're in my seat." Ji Yong gave him a look.<br>"I don't think so."<br>Sung Hoon gave Ji Yong a glare that could freeze an entire ocean. Just then Jae Jin and Jae Duc came in. Sung Hoon waved for them to come over. "Hey guys come over here and meet my new friend." Jae Jin and Jae Duc walked over. "Hey guys," said Sung Hoon. "This is Ko Ji Yong. Apparently, he doesn't know where he's sitting."<br>Jae Duc gave a little smirk. "Aww...he's new Sung Hoon. He don't know that he's sitting in your place."<br>Jae Jin nodded and told Ji Yong, "You better move boy. You're sitting with my friend's wife."<br>Kyung Hee opened her mouth in shock. "He's lying!" Ji Yong looked at all of them. He could tell that Sung Hoon and the other two were lying. He turned around to face Sung Hoon.<br>"No I don't want to move. I like sitting here."<br>Sung Hoon was ticked but didn't say anything. He had to stop Jae Jin and Jae Duc from fronting Ji Yong. Sung Hoon just gave a fake smile and said, "I'll see how long you will like sitting there." Then he and the boys left.<br>Kyung Hee let out a sigh of relief. "Thanks Ji Yong oppa. Everyday that Sung Hoon and his buddies will sit next to me so they could torture me. But now that you're here, they can't do it anymore."<br>"It's nothing," said Ji Yong. "I'll try my best to stop him from torturing you."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter SIX<br><br>~Ring~ It was the last bell of the day.<br>"Come on Ji Yong oppa! Time for P.E.!"<br>Kyung Hee and Ji Yong walked to the gym together. When they looked up they saw the janitor fixing the ceiling. Kyung Hee walked up to him. "What are you doing Mr. Seo?"<br>"Just fixing the ceiling fans Kyung Hee. These things are sharp and could cut somebody up! You two kids better get to class now. I have a lot to work to do today."<br>Kyung Hee and Ji Yong waved bye to Mr. Seo. Then they both went their own separate ways to the locker rooms to change for class.<br>Sung Hoon sat down on the mat and waited for Kyung Hee and Ji Yong to both come out. Jae Jin sat down next to him while Jae Duc had another class to go to.<br>"So you gonna kick the crap outta the new guy Sung Hoon?"<br>"Yeah. That'll teach him to mess with me."<br>Jae Jin scrached his head. "Dude, I don't get it. The only thing he did was sit next to Kyung Hee. So why you tripping for? You in love with her or something?"<br>Sugn Hoon glared at him. "Hell no! I don't like her. I just don't want anyone messing with my stuff alright?<br>"Okay okay. Chill. Hey here they come."<br>Ji Yong found a place to sit on the mat while Kyung Hee sat next to him. A guy from their P.E. class named Jang Su Won shouted out,<br>"Hey Kyung Hee! You dump Sugn Hoon for the new guy?"<br>She yelled back, "Shut up dork!"<br>Everyone in class, including Ji Yong and Sung Hoon stared at her. Kyung Hee just looked away and pretended not to notice. Then she leaned over and whispered in Ji Yong's ear. "Kick Sung Hoon's butt hard."<br>Sung Hoon looked at Kyung Hee leaning near Ji Yong. 'Damn you Kyung Hee. Is it so terrible to be known as my girlfriend?' he thought fuming. 'You're going down pretty boy.' He glared at Ji Yong who was also glaring at him back.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter SEVEN<br><br>~TWEET~<br>The whistle blew and class began. Sensei Shim called roll and made everyone sat down.<br>"Alright now you spineless wimps. Let's see what you've learned these past few weeks. Class will begin with a match. Who are my volunteers?"<br>Sung Hoon raised his hand. "I will Sensei."<br>"Ah...Sung Hoon, my number one student. Who else? Hmm...how about Kyung Hee?"<br>Kyung Hee shook her head so hard that her hair fell out of her ponytail. Sung Hoon rolled his eyes. "Not today Sensei. How about Ji Yong?"<br>"Ji Yong?"<br>Sensei Shim looked at Ji Yong. "Are you the new boy Ko Ji Yong?"<br>"Yes Sensei," answered Ji Yong.<br>Sensei Shim rubbed his chin. "Hmm...I don't know Sung Hoon. It might not be fair for Ji Yong to fight against an advanced student like you." Ji Yong stood up. "It's okay. I learned Tae Kwon Doe back at my old school too."<br>"Really?" asked Sensei Shim. "Then this should be a good match. Alright everybody. In your places."<br>Ji Yong and Sung Hoon got in their fighting stances. 'I'm going to wipe that smile off your face,' thought Ji Yong. 'You're going down punk,' Sung Hoon thought back.<br>"Fight!"<br>Sung Hoon moved forward. 'I'm going to punch him so hard-' but before he knew it, he had fallen down on his back. He was surprised. "How? What?" Ji Yong had sweep kicked him and made Sung Hoon fall.<br>"Winner Ko Ji Yong!"<br>"Yay!" shouted Kyung Hee. She ran up and hugged Ji Yong. "You were great! You took him down in less than five seconds!"<br>"Wait a second!" yelled Sung Hoon. "There are three rounds in a match. It ain't over yet!"<br>"Oh yeah," said the Sensei. "Hold on everyone. We have two more rounds left."<br>Sung Hoon looked over at where Kyung Hee was sitting. She was massaging Ji Yong's shoulders. He opened his mouth in shock. 'That traitor!' he thought to himself. 'She's on the enemy's side!' His images of choking Kyung Hee was interrupted by Jae Jin calling him.<br>"Hey Sung Hoon."<br>"What is it Jae Jin?"<br>"The new guy Ji Yong is pretty good but by the way he fights, I know you can beat him. Just don't underestimate him and don't let your guard down. You can win."<br>Sung Hoon slapped Jae Jin on the back. "Thanks hyung. I was kind of spacing out there." Jae Jin nodded and understood. 'You'll see that I'm the better guy Kyung Hee,' Sung Hoon mentally tried to tell her.<br>"You were great Ji Yong oppa!" Kyung Hee said excitedly.<br>"Thanks. Umm...Kyung Hee?"<br>"Yeah?"<br>"You sure Sung Hoon is the best fighter here? He didn't seem to last very long."<br>Kyung Hee nodded her head. "He is the best fighter here. I think he didn't last long because you're so much better than him.<br>"Maybe," said Ji Yong with doubt.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter EIGHT<br><br>"Okay Round Two!" yelled Sensei Shim as he pulled his arm down. "Fight!" Sung Hoon and Ji Yong got into their positions. Ji Yong let out a punch but Sung Hoon caught his arm and flipped him over. During that time Sung Hoon whispered in Ji Yong's ear, "You stay away from my Kyung Hee." Ji Yong fell down surprised at what he had just heard.<br>"Winner Kang Sung Hoon!" yelled Sensei Shim as he held up Sung Hoon's arm.<br>Kyung Hee opened her mouth in shock. 'That bastard Sung Hoon won!' She began to tear away at her gi with her teeth. Sung Hoon saw her looking at him. He crossed his eyes and stuck his tongue out at her. 'That jerk is so immature!' "Wait Sensei!" she yelled. "Three rounds remember? One more to go!"<br>Sensei Shim called for attention. "Okay you losers watching on the sidelines. We have one more round."<br>Sung Hoon walked up to Kyung Hee. "Don't worry about it. Get ready to kiss my feet when I win Kyung Hee honey."<br>"Get bent and die Kang Sung Hoon."<br>Sung Hoon flashed her one of his trademark smiles and went back to take his place. Then he heard Kyung Hee yell out,<br>"You can do it Ji Yong oppa!"<br>'Ji Yong oppa?' thought Sung Hoon. 'She never called me oppa!' Sung Hoon knew that he couldn't lose his concentration or he'll lose for sure. 'Win the match first and deal with it later."<br>'Wow' thought Ji Yong. 'Sung Hoon is good. Hmm...I wonder if he'll be my friend if he does end up beating me. He don't hate Kyung Hee. I think he might even be in love with her! Heh heh...well well..Mr. Tough Guy must be thinking about 'Kisado.' Besides, I haven't met a good match like this in a long time."<br>"Round Three. Fight!"<br>This time Sung Hoon let out a punch and Ji Yong caught his arm. He flipped Sung Hoon over but he didn't fall down. Sung Hoon twisted his body back so he fell upright. He sent out a round house kick and knocked Ji Yong down. 'Victory is mine.' Sung Hoon smiled.<br>"Winner is Kang Sung Hoon!" yelled Sensei Shim. "You were excellent too Ji Yong" he said as he helped Ji Yong up. Ji Yong looked at Sung Hoon and smiled. "You were great. You should show me your moves sometimes." Sung Hoon looked at Ji Yong surprised. He didn't expect Ji Yong to say that. Ji Yong extended out his hand. "Truce? Except don't pick on my dongsang Kyung Hee anymore okay?"<br>'Dongsang?' thought Sung Hoon. 'That means there's nothing going on between them. I guess this Ji Yong guy ain't so bad after all.' He shook Ji Yong's hand.<br>"Truce."<br>Kyung Hee couldn't believe her eyes. Both of them are shaking hands and acting like each other's buddy! She ran up to Ji Yong's side. "Why are you being friends with this jock strap?" Ji Yong placed a hand on her shoulder.<br>"Come on Kyung Hee. Let's all be friends."<br>Then Jae Jin had to add his two cents in. "Yeah. Isn't that why you came up here Kyung Hee? To give Sung Hoon his victory kiss?" She looked over at Sung Hoon who was giving her this stupid smile and he was shaking his eyebrows up and down. She brushed off Ji Yong's hand.<br>"No! And I hate you too Ji Yong!" Then she stomped off.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter NINE<br><br>As Kyung Hee walked by the gym door, her hair got caught in the door's hinges. 'Oh great,' she thought. 'It's not like I'm not embarrassed enough already and now this. I bet they're all laughing now.' She began to tug at her hair to pull it loose. However, unsuspecting by anyone, just above Kyung Hee's head was a loose fan's sharp blade. And it was about to fall.<br>It all just happened so fast.<br>Something instinctly made Sung Hoon look up. There it was. Just a few more cracks and the heavy twirling fan would fall. Right onto an unsuspecting Kyung Hee. Sung Hoon felt as though time had stopped and everything had frozen in place. But time did not stop. And he was moving.<br>Images flashed before Sung Hoon's eyes. Kyung Hee would be crushed and killed. Then there will be no more Kyung Hee. How lonely and empty his life would be.<br>When Kyung Hee turned around to see if anyone was laughing, she saw Sung Hoon's cocky smiling face end in a face of horror. She began to wonder what he was doing. There he was running as fast as he could towards her. It was so fast. She heard a loud crash and felt her body slam against the wall. She blacked out for a second before she realized what was happening.<br>Too close. That was way way too close. Sung Hoon felt his heart beat so loud that it was pounding in his ears. When he grabbed Kyung Hee he didn't stop running until he made it outside the gym and the wall stopped him. It took him a second to realize that his lips were pressed against something soft. He opened his eyes. 'Oh my GOD!' His eyes got even wider. 'I'm kissing Kyung Hee! She's gonna kill me!' He began to think really fast. 'I'll just close my eyes and pretend like I know nothing.'<br>It took a while but Kyung Hee finally came back to her senses. She felt something pressed against her entire body. 'Oh my gosh! Sung Hoon is kissing me!' She pushed him off of her. "You pervert!" she yelled as she balled her fists up until her knuckles turn white. Then there was that look on Sung Hoon's face again.<br>Kyung Hee knew something was wrong. Her hand slowly felt the back of her head. Her long hair was gone. The front was still long but the back was severed all the way up to her shoulders. She was in shock. "How could you do this to me?" she cried out. Sung Hoon shrugged his shoulders.<br>"Umm....Victory Kiss?"<br>'I can't believe I said that!' Too late. Sung Hoon saw Kyung Hee turn even angrier. Then he felt a painful slap across his cheek. He turned his head back just in time to see her run away. Then slowly, he went over to the gym doors to pick up what was left of Kyung Hee's hair. Slowly his tears fell upon the shiny black hair he was holding.<br>Sung Hoon was hurting and it wasn't from the slap. It was a different kind of pain.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter TEN<br><br>Kyung Hee didn't stop running until she made it home. Tears were streaming down her cheeks. 'That jerk kissed me!' she repeated to herself over and over. 'That was my first kiss too! It was supposed to be for the guy of my dreams. Not a walking nightmare like Sung Hoon!' "Why does Kang Sung Hoon hate me so much?" she asked herself out loud. "What did I ever do to him?"<br>Kyung Hee touched the back of her head. Her hair really is gone.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Five more years later....<br>During this time changes both happen for Kyung Hee and Sung Hoon. (*They're 18 and in high school)<br>Kyung Hee became more distant towards everyone. Everybody assumed it was because of her hair. She was no longer the sociable, bubbly girlie but now she became a silent aggressive jock. She traded in her baby tees, hair bows, skirts, and platforms for sweatshirts, baseball caps, tennis shoes, and baggy jeans. She would hang out with the nerds and jocks and just about anybody except for the popular girls (who are all stuck up). No one dared to mess with Kyung Hee though. She developed a reputation for herself as a fighter when she managed to beat up the biggest girl bully in school. Kyung Hee is a really small and skinny person but no one could really tell underneath all of her clothes (so she seems bulky).<br>Jae Jin and Jae Duc stopped teasing Kyung Hee as time passed too. They've gotten more mature and dated around too. Kyung Hee still talks to Ji Yong but she had stopped calling him oppa.<br>Ever since that incident, Sung Hoon knew that Kyung Hee had changed. He had toned down on picking on her but he didn't stop. He knew it was the only way and excuse he had if he wanted to talk to her. When he entered high school, he brought along his popularity and good looks with him. Sung Hoon became every girl's dream guy. Well-built body, styling hair, seductive eyes, and a killer smile. He dated every girl that every guy in his school want to date.<br>But sadly no matter how many girls he dated, they all mean nothing to him. He was never able to tell Kyung Hee how he really felt about her so he planned on keeping it silent forever.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter ELEVEN<br><br>"Heads up!"<br>Kyung Hee looked up and caught the ball that was aimed towards her.<br>Sung Hoon started jumping around and yelling, "For the honor of football, Kyung Hee is She-Man!"<br>"Go back into the cave where you crawled from Porcupine," she snapped back, referring to his hair. She threw the ball back at him.<br>'Porcupine? It took me an hour to get my hair like this!' Sung Hoon thought. 'Damn why does her words have to get on my nerves so much. No one else can ever do that!' "Aww...you grouchy because everytime you look at me you know you can only look but can't touch?"<br>"Puh-lease...If I touch you I might get a disease."<br>"Poor Kyung Hee. Gonna die a single, lonely old nun."<br>Kyung Hee gave him a secretive smile. "Just because I don't date around like you do doesn't mean anything. And beside....how do you know I'm single?" Sung Hoon looked at her. 'Is she dating someone I don't know?' He was about to ask but just then Shin Chun Ok (Sung Hoon's latest girlfriend) walked up and interrupted their disses.<br>"Sung Hoonee!"<br>She ran up to squeeze him. Sung Hoon rolled his eyes. 'Damn Chun Ok. Why did she have to be here? She's so annoying!' But he gave her a smile anyways.<br>"So what are you doing here?"<br>"I want you to take a look at my dress!"<br>It was a tight little black V-neck dress that showed plenty. And Chun Ok was a little chubby too.<br>"It's nice."<br>Sung Hoon really didn't care anyways. He planned to break up with her soon. Kyung Hee was watching them the whole time. She rolled her eyes. Chun Ok caught Kyung Hee watching them. She began to talk to Kyung Hee in her fake sugary voice.<br>"I know what you're thinking. But sorry this dress doesn't come in a large."<br>Kyung Hee gave her a fake smile. "No but your mouth sure does." Then she walked away. Chun Ok rolled her eyes behind Kyung Hee's back. "Whatever." Sung Hoon glared at her. He didn't like it when other people made fun of Kyung Hee just because she dressed like a guy.<br>"You didn't have to say that you know."<br>Chun Ok stomped her feet. "Why do you always take her side?" she whined.<br>Sung Hoon just walked away.<br>"Sung Hoonee!"<br></div>
