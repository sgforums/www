            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter EIGHTEEN<br><br>[School, the Next Day]<br>Sung Hoon stopped by Kyung Hee's locker. He forgot to discuss with her if they were going to pretend to be a couple in school or not. 'I hope so. Maybe I'll get to kiss her again,' he thought with a smile. Then he saw Ji Won walking up to him. "What are you doing here?" Ji Won gave him a smirk. "I transferred here. I just want to know for sure if you and Kyung Hee have been dating."<br>Sung Hoon began to sweat. 'Uh oh.' "Of course we have and it's been for a long time too." Ji Won gave him a look that showed Sung Hoon that he didn't believe a word he said. "Oh really? Then let me ask someone." Ji Won grabbed Su Won as he was walking by. "Hey you. Who is So Kyung Hee's boyfriend?"<br>Sung Hoon looked at Su Won. "Oh that's easy! It's Kang Sung Hoon."<br>"It is?"<br>"Yeah," said Su Won. "They've been together forever. They're like a married couple!" Ji Won let Su Won go. "See?" said Sung Hoon with a cocky smile. "So what?" Ji Won snapped back. "She acts and looks like a guy anyways."<br>"Sung Hoon honey!"<br>Sung Hoon and Ji Won turned around to see who was calling Sung Hoon. Both of them did a double take. It was Kyung Hee and she looked damn fine. Her hair was put up but strands fell down layering her face. She was wearing a light blue slip dress that emphasized her great figure and matching platforms. The school's tomboy had just turned into the school's prom queen. She looked like an angel. Sung Hoon couldn't take his eyes off of her. Neither could Ji Won.<br>"Sung Hoon!" She went up and kissed him on the cheek. "Are you waiting for me?"<br>Sung Hoon finally snapped out of it. "Uh...yeah." Then he leaned over to give her a real kiss. 'I can kiss her anytime I want to now that she's my girlfriend,' he thought. Heh heh. Kyung Hee turned around. "Oh hi Ji Won. What are you doing here?" Ji Won looked at her awkwardly. "Um...hi Kyung Hee. I just transferred here. You sure look pretty today." Kyung Hee gave him a smile. "Thanks. Well nice seeing you. Sung Hoon and I have to go to class now. Bye.." Sung Hoon wrapped his arm around her waist and led her to class, leaving Ji Won looking after them.<br>As they entered the door, Jae Jin and Jae Duc ran up to Sung Hoon. But then they saw Kyung Hee. Jae Jin gave her a little smile. "Hi. I'm Lee Jae Jin. I'm single and ready to mingle. And you are?" Kyung Hee rolled her eyes. Then it was Jae Duc's turn. "Can I check your dress to see if you were made in heaven?"<br>"It's me Kyung Hee. And those were the lamest lines I've ever heard."<br>Jae Jin and Jae Duc opened their mouths in shock. "No way!" yelled Jae Jin. "But you're a girl!"<br>"I've always been a girl!"<br>"You know what Kyung Hee? I've always had a crush on you," Jae Duc said to her sweetly. "Back off guys," said Sung Hoon. "She's my girl." Jae Duc pouted his lips. "Damn it figures."<br>Then Ji Won came in. 'Damn,' he thought. 'She never looked this good before.' He wanted her back an he always gets his way...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter NINETEEN<br><br>The next two weeks went by fast. Sung Hoon acted like the perfect boyfriend. He treated her nice and was always there by her side with flowers. Her parents like him a lot. Before Sung Hoon knew it, his dating charade with Kyung Hee was over and so was school. Her parents stayed until their graduation and then afterwards they took a plane back to the U.S. Then entire graduated class decided to go on a campout because it will be the last time they will see each other since everyone is going their separate way to college.<br>[The Camping Trip]<br>Everyone was sitting around the campfire and talking. Chun Ok had sat herself between Sung Hoon and Kyung Hee. Ji Won was watching Kyung Hee the whole time. Jae Duc was telling a scary story about a psycho killer in the woods.<br>"He goes around chopping of peoples' heads and he especially likes girls. Heh heh..."<br>Jae Jin threw a stick at him. "That's a stupid story Duc-ee."<br>Ji Yong threw in more wood into the fire. "But I heard it's true though."<br>Su Won widened his eyes. "For real?"<br>Sung Hoon laughed. "Oh come on. It's a bunch of bull. Even if it is for real, he'll just be after the girls." He gave Kyung Hee a supposedly scary face but it turned out so goofy she ended up laughing. Chun Ok grabbed onto Sung Hoon though. "Sung Hoonee! I'm scared. Hold me."<br>Sung Hoon was taken by surprise. He tried to pry Chun Ok off of him but she held on tight. Kyung Hee glared at them both. 'That Casanova. Just because every time he smiles his eyes would light up and his hair is so soft he thinks he's-' Kyung Hee stopped herself. 'What am I thinking? It sounds like I want him or something.' She stood up. "Excuse me but I think I'll got for a walk." Then she left.<br>Ji Won stood up too. "I think I'll take a walk too."<br>That alarmed Sung Hoon. 'He is not going to take a walk with my Kyung Hee.' He ended up having to force Chun Ok off of him and ran where he saw Kyung Hee disappeared. Chun Ok was mad. "Kang Sung Hoon, you come back here!" Everyone at the campfire started giggling.<br>[Somewhere in the woods]<br>Kyung Hee looked all around her. 'It figures. Sung Hoon wouldn't come after me,' she thought sadly. 'I mean why would he?' Then she heard a voice. "Kyung Hee!" She smiled and turned around. It was only Ji Won. Her face fell. "Oh hi Ji Won."<br>He sat down on a rock next to her. "Aren't you going to come back to take Sung Hoon away from the Chun Ok girl?" She shook her head. "No...I guess they're mean to be together." Ji Won looked at her. "Kind of like you and me?" Kyung Hee scooted herself away as her eyes widened. "Uh, Ji Won. It's over between us." Ji Won grabbed her hands. "But you can give me a second chance!" She pulled her hands away. Then Ji Won asked her, "Remember what you told me what you wished for a long time ago?"<br>"What?"<br>"You said you wanted to find your first true love and be with him forever." Kyung Hee stood still. She did say that. Ji Won was her first love. But then she thought of Sung Hoon. Or is it Sung Hoon? "I don't know!" she yelled as she took off running. Ji Won smiled. 'She's coming back to me.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter TWENTY<br><br>As Ji Won walked back to camp he heard a voice calling for Kyung Hee. He recognized Sung Hoon's voice. In the middle of the road Ji Won looked down. He saw a huge hole that was about ten feet deep. Ji Won gave an evil smile. He had a plan. He began to rustle the leaves near the hole.<br>Sung Hoon heard a noise. 'Is it Kyung Hee?' "Kyung Hee is that you?" No answer. "Come out come out wherever you are." The leaves continue to rustle. 'What if she's hurt and couldn't answer?' Sung Hoon started to walk towards the noise and ended up falling into the trap. It was so cold and dark in there. Sung Hoon began to panic.<br>"Help!"<br>Ji Won came out from where he was hiding. "Hey Sung Hoon. Looking for something?"<br>Sung Hoon looked up and saw Ji Won's face. "Damn you Eun Ji Won! Get me out!" Ji Won just smiled. "This all seems so familiar. You know, it took me a while but then I remembered. Didn't I do this to you before ten years ago?"<br>Sung Hoon started to tremble. Because of what Ji Won did to him, he had a fear of the dark and being trapped alone. But he wasn't going to show it. Sung Hoon glared at Ji Won. "So what? I don't give a damn. Just get me out!"<br>Ji Won laughed. "I guess history repeats itself when you mess with me or anything of mine. This time I mean Kyung Hee. She is my girlfriend and I want you out of the way. And I guess this solves my problem."<br>"Kyung Hee don't like you! She's with me."<br>"Oh really? Didn't seem like it when your ex held you like that. I guess you can't let your first love go and I think you know that I'm Kyung Hee's first. She'll come back to me."<br>Sung Hoon sat down on the cold ground. Kyung Hee did say that before. 'Is she going to go back to him?' As he was thinking, Ji Won had left already. Sung Hoon looked up. "Hey!" His worst nightmare had came back and this time Kyung Hee was not there to save him. He was stuck here all alone in the dark. "Kyung Hee...where are you?"<br>After a while Kyung Hee headed back to camp. She took out her flashlight to shine her way back on the main path.<br>[Down in the pit]<br>Sung Hoon looked up and saw a beam of light. He stood up. "Help!"<br>Kyung Hee looked around. 'Was someone calling for help?' "Hello? Is someone out there?"<br>"HELP!"<br>Kyung Hee ran to where the voice came from. She saw Sung Hoon jumping up and down in a hole. "Sung Hoon! What are you doing down there?"<br>"I fell in. Help me out!"<br>"Okay." She placed her flashlight on the ground. Then she reached over and tried to pull Sung Hoon up but he was too heavy for her. "I can't"<br>"What do you mean you can't? Use those puny muscles you have!"<br>"You're too heavy! Let me go back to camp for help."<br>"Hell no! What if you leave me here?"<br>"What? I'm not like that!"<br>"How do I know?"<br>"Sung Hoon. Let go!"<br>"No!"<br>Sung Hoon ended up pulling Kyung Hee into the pit with him. She landed on top of him. She got up and started yelling at him. "You selfish jerk! Now we're both stuck down here!" Sung Hoon backed up against the wall. Then he started yelling. "Damn! Not again! Why me? Why does it have to be so dark?" Kyung Hee looked at him. "You're afraid of the dark?"<br>"Yeah! You got a problem?"<br>Kyung Hee looked at him surprised. "No." She started to look at the real Kang Sung Hoon for the first time in a long time. The smart-aleck tough guy was gone. And there he was. The innocent and vulnerable Sung Hoon she first fell in love with when she was eight. But she still hasn't realized it yet....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter TWENTY-ONE<br><br>Sung Hoon started to gasp for air. That scared Kyung Hee. "Sung Hoon....are you okay?" He shook his head. Then suddenly, he leaned over and hugged her hard. He buried his face into her neck and didn't let go. Kyung Hee stood still. She didn't know what to do. "Sung Hoon...are you okay?" Still no answer.<br>She continued to hold him as he shivered in her arms. She ran her fingers through his hair and whispered in his ear like he was a little child that needed comforting. Sung Hoon began to breathe easier and calmed down. Then he realized he was holding onto Kyung Hee a little too hard. He let go, his face blushing. "Uh, sorry about that. I didn't mean to."<br>"It's okay."<br>Sung Hoon gazed at Kyung Hee from the light that the moon shone on her. Her eyes were closed. She was like a sleeping angel. She looked like it too with her raven hair flowing down her back, her little white dress, and she was so naturally beautiful that she didn't need make-up. Sung Hoon began to lean forward to kiss her but then suddenly she opened her eyes. He pulled back instantly, his cheeks turning red. 'Crap! Did she know what I was about to do?'<br>Kyung Hee patted him on the shoulder. "Hey Sung Hoon..."<br>"What?"<br>"Look. There's a full moon out tonight."<br>Sung Hoon looked up at the sky. The moon was full and bright. Then he looked over at Kyung Hee, who was smiling. Then she asked him, "Do you remember when we were ten, we saw the moon's reflection on the lake? You told me the moon was a ball so I would go in and get it."<br>Sung Hoon smiled when he reminisced about his childhood past. It had been a happy one ever since he met Kyung Hee. "Yeah. You went into the lake and started to get the moon ball. And you kept asking me why the ball would disappear everytime you came near it. You were so stupid!" He started laughing. Kyung Hee gave him a look. That made him stop laughing. But then she gave him a little smile to show that she wasn't mad and it made him feel better.<br>"Yeah because of your dumb lies I almost ended up drowning."<br>"Yeah...I had to jump in and save you. I was so worried."<br>Kyung Hee looked at him. "Were you?"<br>Sung Hoon faced her. He was gazing directly into her eyes. He always thought the best part about Kyung Hee were her eyes. They were big, innocent, and honest. Every time he looks back, he always remember them as the first thing he saw when he met her. "Yeah kinda. I mean if you ended up drowning then I have no one else to pick on."<br>Kyung Hee looked down and smiled. She knew what Sung Hoon really meant though. They continued talking about their past and before they knew it, they both fell asleep on each other's shoulders.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter TWENTY-TWO<br><br>It was morning when Ji Won woke up. He went over to Kyung Hee's tent but she wasn't there. He patted Chun Ok on the shoulder. "Hey Chun Ok. Do you know where Kyung Hee is?" Chun Ok rolled her eyes. "That girl hasn't been back all night and neither was Sung Hoon. She must have-"<br>Ji Won left before she could finish talking. "Ahh!" she screamed because no one ever listened to her.<br>Ji Won called the others so they can help look for Kyung Hee but he had the feeling she was with Sung Hoon. He took them to the place where Sung Hoon had fell. Sure enough, there they both were. Kyung Hee was leaning against Sung Hoon asleep. Ji Won was mad. "Hey!" The yell woke up Sung Hoon and Kyung Hee up. They glanced up to see what it was.<br>Sung Hoon stood up. "Hey you guys, help us out!" Jae Duc started laughing as he pulled Sung Hoon up. "Ooo...Sung Hoonee...what were you and Miss Kyung Hee doing down there all night?"<br>Everyone else except Ji Won laughed. "Shut up Duc-ee" said Sung Hoon. Then he leaned over to help Kyung Hee up. "Let's go home," Sung Hoon said to the others.<br>It was evening by the time Sung Hoon got home. He was exhausted so he took a shower and headed straight for bed. He looked over at Kyung Hee's room, who was exactly across from his. Her lights were out so she must be asleep. Sung Hoon sat down on his desk and began writing in his journal. He had kept one ever since he was ten and he wrote in it whenever something came up. When he finished his entry, he turned off his lights and went to sleep too.<br>It was eleven at night when Sung Hoon woke up. It was dark out but he couldn't sleep anymore so headed downstairs to look for something to eat. His mom was in the kitchen.<br>"Hi mommy."<br>"Hi Sung Hoonee." She walked over to kiss him on the forehead. "How was camping?"<br>"It was fun."<br>He sat down at the table with his mom. She touched his hair and let out a sigh. "What's wrong mommy?" He began eating his noodles.<br>"Nothing son. It's just that you're all grown up and going to be off to college soon."<br>"Don't worry mommy. It's only a couple of hours from here. I'll be back to visit you and dad often."<br>His mom smiled. "I know. Can you believe it? You and Kyung Hee know each other for ten years now and in just two more days it will be the last time you'll ever see each other." Sung Hoon choked on his food.<br>"What?"<br>"Oh didn't you know? Kyung Hee came over an hour ago and made those noodles for us. She told me she's leaving for the U.S. with her boyfriend in just 2 more days."<br>"Boyfriend?!"<br>"Yes. A boy from your class. I think his name is Ji Won."<br>Sung Hoon stopped eating. 'So Kyung Hee is going to go back to Ji Won.' His mom looked at his unfinished food. "Something wrong dear?" Sung Hoon shook his head. "No mommy. I'm full. I think I'll go to my room."<br></div>
