Told her tat i personally think that since this man can't even make his own decision on his marriage (which is suppose to be the most impt decision) then he's probably not worth the effort of keeping.  I fear that even he manages to convince his parents that this poor lady is the one he wanna marry, chances are they'll continue to his and indirectly her life after their marriage.  And also, she can't actually pressurised him into marrying him, and thus risk ruining his relationship with his parents.  It is for him to decide.<br><br></div>
