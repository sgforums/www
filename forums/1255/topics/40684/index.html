            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Part 3</strong><br><br>I had lunch with Tye, we talk about the conversation with FlyNDance this morning.<br><br>"You moron. Told her you are not romantic, you siao ah? You have disgraced me man. How can you make such a big mistake?"<br><br>"....I...I..."<br><br>Tye grabbed a chicken wing with chopstick, and I can see the trembling of the hand and the wing.<br><br>"There are 3 'don'ts' in chasing a girl...<br><br>One, don't forget to be romantic;<br><br>Two, don't be too honest;<br><br>Three, don't be too stingy on the sugar in our speech.<br><br>In mandarin, we say 'nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai', you should know this."<br><br>"This I know, but it has been a controversial topic over centuries. Women aren't really that, cheap"<br><br>"So why would they only falls for 'bad guys' like me?"<br><br>"That's because 'bad guys' are usually romantic. Those 'nice guys' are usually, dumdums. So she would rather choose a romantic 'bad guy' rather than any of those dumdums. In maths we call this<br>2C1, understand? dumdum."<br><br>Oh, Tye is talking about maths! Now I understand. No wonder I have always been left on the shelf.<br><br>"In another words, gals wouldn't mind if you are not tall...<br>if you are not handsome...<br>they can bear with your inconsiderate acts...<br>can forget your stupidity...<br>But they can never forgive if you are not romantic..."<br><br>"Come on, this is so exaggerating."<br><br>"Hey, most women have a 'knot' for romance, just like most men have a 'knot' for virginity. To women they just can't understand how precious the thin layer of membrane is to men. Same thing, men can't imagine how important women treats romance."<br><br>"This is bullshit! How come I've never heard of that."<br><br>"The key word is 'knot', if you can untie it, fine. But how many had actually succeeded in that. practically none."<br><br>"ok, fine. now I've done it. So what should I do to remedy the situation?"<br><br>"Face it. You are hopeless already."<br><br>I promise you I'll have a drink with you when you and her are<br>over."<br><br>You SONOFABITCH.<br><br><strong>Part 4</strong><br><br>Midnight. I am trying to concentrate on my physics notes...<br><br>F=ma, v=u+at...<br><br>It's really a wonder that nature can be explained by just a few formulas and equations, and this we call science.<br><br>Then why is astrology and palmistry being labeled as superstitions? Science should only be one of the ways to explain truth, what can't be explained by science, it doesn't necessary mean that it's unreal....<br><br>Close to 1 am. Since I can't get anything into my head, I shall try my luck on net then, maybe she is there.<br><br>"Slorr, you here."<br>"Finally, good night to you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">"<br><br>'FINALLY'? Strange word to use it here. What is she doing here at<br>this hour? Must be feeling down again.<br><br>"Yes, it is fate that brought me to you at this moment."<br><br>I am trying very hard to convince her that I am a bit romantic.<br><br>"Slorr, nothing to do with fate. I waited for you for one hour<br>liaoz..."<br><br>"Sure or not? For what?"<br><br>"Talk to you mah or else I can't sleep."<br>"You sick is it? Go see doctor lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">"<br>"Slorr, let's continue our topic.<br>What do you think of relationships that began from the internet?"<br><br>Oh my god, how should I answer her now?<br><br>"It's... it's very... romantic..."<br><br>Indeed I am not a good liar, even my words are shaking now.<br><br>"Slorr, you bluffing. You not romantic one mah."<br><br>GAME OVER. I am finished! No choice but to drink with Tye.<br><br>"Slorr, you lagging? Or just daoing me?"<br><br>"No, I am wondering why is the sky so chio tonight?"<br><br>"No no no. Don't try to shift the topic, Slorr."<br><br>Sigh. I give up. I asked for it myself.<br><br>"Actually I think relationships started from cyberspace is considered as ROMANTIC, cos romance gives people an impression of unreal, and cyberspace is virtual."<br><br>"Slorr, that's interesting."<br><br>"Surfers keep a safe distance from each other and usually 3 types of people are produced in this way.<br><br>The first type....<br><br>The first type being those who present themselves on net with their 'secondary personality'. Usually all of us consists of multiple personalities, and in everyday life, what we present to the world is the 'primary personality', with the secondary one being suppressed, or maybe we don't even realised this other trait of us deep inside. So internet is the place where this side of us is revealed, both intentionally or without conscious knowledge."<br><br>"Is it true? What about 2nd type?"<br><br>"The 2nd type are those who will transform themselves into the kind of man/woman he/she would want to be. There's bound to be 1 or 2 characteristics that you particularly admire, too bad, sometimes these characteristics are just couldn't be found in you. Cyberspace is the perfect location for this transformation to occur."<br><br>"Slorr, you blowing cow is it? Type 3 leh?"<br><br>"I am not blowing cow, I read it from an article of TIMES magazine! Type 3 will be those who transform themselves into characters which are impossible for them to become in real life.<br>For example, if you are a girl, you may act as a man on net. You may even become BATMAN or SUPERMAN if you want."<br><br>"Hmmh.. That's pretty amazing."<br><br>"The first type is the 'faithful' type, 'cos its his own personality that is being presented on net. The 2nd type is the 'foolish' type, 'cos he knows only how to admire others, always forgets his own strong points. The 3rd type is the 'pathetic' type, 'cos he is wishing 4 some<br>impossible."<br><br>"Slorr, then you belong to what type? Me leh?"<br>"I don't wish to believe you are type 3, 'cos I am not.<br><br>I crossed the possibility of type 1 'cos its too common, because I think you are special. Being able to attract you, I think I am at least a bit special. So we belong to type 2."<br><br>"Type 2, then who you wish to become? Slorr.."<br><br>I certainly would like to become a person like Tye, humorous, romantic and eloquent, 'cos these are what I am lacking of.<br><br>"Slorr, what about me?"<br><br>"you? I don't know. you want to FLY and DANCE, probably that means you wish to fully enjoy your youth while you can. But if this is somethng you wish yet you can't achieve, then there's 2 possibilities:<br><br>1, you are aging, 2, you are leaving the world."<br><br>I think I said something wrong, cos she didn't sent me anymore message after this. I began to blame myself for being so perverted, why talk about these things?<br><br>I should have discussed with her whether ZOE or FANN, who should be the queen of Caldecott Hill. Damn that TIMES magazine, poison my mind. Maybe she's lagging. so I waited... and waited. Girl its just a few minutes, but it felt like several hours. I want to apologize,but do not know how to start. until she sent me this message:<br><br>"Slorr... let's meet..."<br><br>Without hesitation, I used the hand that I had used it over 18 years to wipe my ass, typed 'O-K'.<br><br>I am supposed to meet FlyNDance tonight , 8pm, at the entrance of McDonalds, the one beside YMCA. That's the best time and place to meet a girl you have never met before, according to Tye, 'cos they would have taken their dinner by that time which means we can simply go inside the Mac and have some fries and coke. She will be wearing a whole set of coffee theme attire and I will be wearing my usual blues, this is our way of identification. She told me she is not those 'cute gals' I may think she is, I said never mind, I am not Brad Pitt either. then she told me she has long ago given up on this hope already.<br><br><strong>Part 5</strong><br><br>"Slorr, you are early."<br><br>While I was idling, a girl tapped my shoulders from my back.<br><br>Although I was already mentally prepared for anything that's going to appear in front of me, I was still astonished by this girl who stood in front of me now.<br><br>If not for the coffee theme and that 'Slorr', I would think she is only asking for directions. She is one of those 'chio bu' that can only be found on Orchard Road, which I usually see while crossing the road. Maybe I suffered from a serious concussion due to the heavy blow, my mind was extraordinarily calm.<br><br>"Had your dinner right? I think we shall go inside the Mac first.You are pretty smart huh? A good way to save money indeed."<br><br>AIYA! She knows me so well, I can only give her an innocent smile back.<br><br>Since she's so pretty, I ordered 2 LARGE cokes, and even ordered TWO packets of fries.<br><br>"This time you treat, next time I'll let you treat."<br><br>I am not falling for that, miss. But I am glad she mentioned 'next time'.<br><br>"Slorr, are you disappointed when you saw me just now?"<br><br>DISSAPPOINTED? Are you drunk?<br><br>"Why do you think I will be disappointed then?"<br><br>"Cos I told you I am not cute mah, so you must be quite disappointed when you saw me"<br><br>She is making zero-sense, but I know she is just trying to hint that she's actually cute.<br><br>"Then why did you have to lie that you are not cute?"<br><br>"Slorr. I said I am not cute. I didn't say I am not pretty."<br><br>#$%$##%^*&amp;%$@!!!<br><br>"But you are also quite decent looking what it's not like what you described to me too."<br><br>'DECENT'? A very vague word. To many gals, decent=boring. One good thing is that she didn't lie to me about the fact that she is keeping long hair. She also has a fair complexion which reminds me of HL milk I take almost everyday. It is now only that I found out she is from ACJC, but had spent her first 3 mths in AJ.<br><br>Sitting in front of each other, we talk about many things. From her obsession with coffee to my hobby of watching movies. BTW, she had completely shook off my misconception of 'if she is pretty, she is brainless'. She appears to be an attractive girl, both physically and character wise, talking, smiling to me, occasionally being a little sarcastic and nasty.<br><br>It's like a dream.<br><br>We left the Mac at around 10 pm. Since it's still early, I decided to send her home and fortunately, it's just Ang Mo Kio, two MRT stops from mine. I would have second thoughts if she's staying at Pasir Ris.<br><br>"Slorr, congratulations! You are officially permitted to date me from now on."<br><br>She said this before the lift door closed. Back at home, I realized that I hadn't asked for her real name,<br>maybe it's the influence of that stupid Tye.<br><br>Tye told me :<br><br>Never ask a pretty girl her name the first time you meet her, cos there are already too many wolves out there dying to know, so she will be more interested in you if you act bochap. Then why didn't she ask for mine? Don't tell me there's a female version of Tye telling her not to?<br><br>It's again 1 am. Time to meet her in ajcrr.<br><br>"Hi! Slorr you tired?"<br><br>Of course I am tired after all the surprises she presented me, I would go straight for my bed if not for her. But why is she here also?. Isn't she tired too?<br><br>"Long time no see how are you?"<br><br>"Slorr you siao ah? 2 hours only leh... miss me?"<br><br>"A)Yes B)Of Course C)Abuden D)Dying to see you E)All of above.<br>Answer is E."<br><br>";<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">."<br><br>Seems like she is really tired, even the smiling face are yawning to me right now.<br><br>"You wanna go for a movie tomorrow?"<br><br>Maybe I should ask her now, while she is half asleep, hoping that she will blur-blurly click 'OK'.<br><br>"Should be no problem. What show?."<br><br>HOOOOORAY!!. I am cheering for her fatigue.<br><br>"We decide what show tomorrow. Anyway what's important is watch with who. Not the show."<br><br>Tye's favourite line, I am just borrowing it.<br><br>";<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">."<br><br>"You should go sleep now lah."<br><br>"Wait one little while. You haven't tell me you tired or not?"<br><br>"Ok lah, A bit. You leh?"<br><br>"I am exhausted but have to say good night to you first. Slorr, if not I can't sleep."<br><br>"me too."<br><br>I can't believe I am doing this SILLY business right now.<br><br>"Ok I tell you what I count 1,2,3. Then we log off together."<br><br>"ok good night Slorr."<br><br>"Same to you"<br><br>"1..."<br><br>"2..."<br><br>"3..."<br><br>Part 6<br><br>I never talk whenever I am inside a cinema, and now is the best time for my mouth to rest, so I spent the following 3 hours to admire this much-talked-about movie of the century, Titanic.  I am not a romantic person, so it's perfectly understandable if I can't really appreciate this motion picture fully, except for all those stunning special effects. but something struck me when Jack said to Rose before he sank into the deep.....<br><br>"Rose, listen to me... listen.... winning that ticket was the best thing that had happened to me... it brought me to you....and I am thankful, Rose....I am thankful...."<br><br>Suddenly I felt much fortunate than Jack, because I don't have to risk my life to board Titanic, all I have to do is to switch on my PC every night. But he's one lucky guy too, because he knows how to draw, and<br>just look at how slowly he was drawing Rose, that made me blame myself for the lack of this talent. But to her, this movie wasn't just about drawings or special effects. I noticed that packet of tissue paper she was holding in her hand. and just when Rose said:<br><br>"I promise... I will never let go, Jack... i'll never let go.."<br><br>She opened up her sling bag and here comes the reserve handkerchief. Damn that Celine Dion, why on earth did she had to sing that "MY HEART WILL GO ON" at the end of the show, for all the female species inside the theater, its like "MY TEARS WILL ALSO GO ON".<br><br>"Ok, movie ended. Let's go."<br><br>I stood up, speak to her gently, worried that every single word I breathe out might just crush onto her, and kill her. she continued to sit on the position, looked at me with her beautiful eyes that just came back from a swim.<br><br>After a while, she said "Slorr, movie ended, but life goes on. Am I right?"<br><br>I nodded my head. But I just wished somebody might give me some clue of what she was saying. Finally we managed to leave Orchard Cineplex, since its still early, we decided to take a walk down the street.<br><br>Along the way, she seems unusually quiet. So I guess Tye was right about the 'TITANIC FLU', he said that gals often got so mentally distressed after watching this show, and it's the best time to launch an emotional attack on her, that's why Tye had watch Titanic for over 5 times roughly. Her eyes were focused on the path or the crowds but I know her mind was still left on Titanic, sinking with her, waiting for somebody to pull her up.<br><br>I just kept my mouth shut. I know I am not a good swimmer. We walked to Plaza Singapura. Suddenly she stopped in front of a Christian Dior counter.<br><br>"Slorr, have you read a novel called 'Fragrance'?"<br><br>"Err..nope. Why do you ask?"<br><br>"Look at this 'DOLCE VITA' from Christian Dior. It's what the guy bought for her girlfriend in the story on her birthday. And he told her 'DOLCE VITA' is French, meaning 'SWEET TIMES'"<br><br>She pointed to a bottle of perfume at the counter, but I was more<br>interested at the price tag around the neck of the bottle.<br><br>"Oh... is it?"<br><br>"Slorr, then do you consider today as 'sweet times'?"<br><br>"At first I do, but some points are deducted since you started crying."<br><br>"That means it can only be considered a little bit sweet, I'll buy the small bottle then."<br><br>I insisted to pay for the perfume as her birthday present from me since I know her birthday is coming soon, this kind of saves me a lot of trouble of finding a present for her. Luckily it's just perfume, or I would have to pawn my underwear if that guy in the story gives her girlfriend diamond or gold bar.<br><br>"Are you hungry? Wanna sit down and have something?"<br><br>"I don't have appetite, what about you?"<br><br>"You eat, I eat..."<br><br>Her eyes are red again. I am such a fool. Finally got away from the noisy crowd at the MRT station, walking on one of the steets of AMK Ave 6. Contrastingly, it's so quiet now that I even can hear the rhythm of her heartbeat."<br><br>"Slorr, do you know what's the correct way of applying perfume?"<br><br>I shook my head. In fact, I had never used a perfume or cologne before, medicated oil maybe.<br><br>"First you apply some behind your ears, then your neck and wrists. After that spray some onto the air, then walk through it."<br><br>"Sure or not?"<br><br>"In that case this little bottle won't even be able to last you for 3 days"<br>"Slorr, shall we try?"<br><br>"We? You go ahead. I am a MAN."<br><br>She opened up that DOLCE VITA, behind her ears, neck then the wrist she applied some and she really did spray some onto the air!!<br><br>WABIANGZ!! Expensive leh! Finally she stretched out her hands, facing up like enjoying the raindrops falling on her face.<br><br>"Hahaha...."<br><br>"Slorr, this is so fun! Now its your turn."<br><br>She went through the same procedures with me and I can feel the coldness of her fingers. maybe it's the perfume, I guess.<br><br>"Slorr, get ready, I am going to spray!!"<br><br>I imitated her. Face up and walked through my first perfume rain.<br><br>"Slorr let's have another round!!"<br><br>" WHAT!! Serious?"<br><br>My money isn't easy to come by leh!! before I can collect the broken pieces of my heart, she had walked through her second round. She was even more excited this time, hoping around, like her nickname. A flying and dancing butterfly. late night of AMK, the streets smells unusually nicer right now. until we finished the whole of that DOLCE VITA.<br><br>"DOLCE VITA is exhausted."<br><br>"I guess this sweet time shall end now too. Slorr, I'll go up now. Tonight 1 am, I won't be online, and you are not to do so too."<br><br>"Huh? But why?"<br><br>"Go online at 12pm tomorrow. You will know.... Remember, only 12pm..."<br><br>She turned and walked into the lift. At the same time, I saw an obvious pink patch behind her neck, which is visible only now because she tied her hair.<br><br>I looked up towards her window on the 4th floor from below, but it never light up.<br><br>Part 7<br><br>I switched off the light in my room. Engulfed in the absolute darkness. I wished to have the same kind of feeling as her right now. I realised in complete darkness, the easiest mood one gets...is loneliness. she must be lonely right now, half asleep.<br><br>I almost can see a beautiful butterfly, turning to ashes amidst<br>the sea of flame. And that patch behind her neck.. from pink it<br>became red. Then burgundy. Slowly, it swallowed me was it the cause<br>of that can of beer just now?<br><br>Suddenly I felt cold and shaky. And that coolness seemed to have<br>come straight from my heart, the rate of my heartbeat was an<br>exponential function of time as it got closer to 1 am.<br><br>USE A DIFFERENT NICK!!<br><br>checked ..<br><br>She isn't there, my heart was beating fast. But the temperature<br>remained below healthy level....<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>Finally its 12 pm, excited as I was, logged on the net, yet there<br>was still no sign of FlyNDance. But there's a mail from her :<br><br>Dear slorr,<br>At first I thought it will be easier for me to settle down in<br>the darkness... recollecting memories we have shared... but all I<br>felt was loneliness...... can you feel it too?...<br><br>I still can't change the habit of logging on at 1am... so I used<br>a different nick to sneak into AJCRR... you don't blame me<br>right?...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... you werent there... should I feel glad for your<br>obidience?.... you said both of us belonged to TYPE 2... the<br>foolish type...maybe you are right!... 'cos I really do admire<br>those who dares to fight for their desires... I stroke my hair<br>gently when you said that I am leaving the world... and a few<br>strands of hair fell..... No!... doctor told me its not a terminal<br>disease... and doctor aren't supposed to lie!!?... I still can live<br>like a normal person... BUT CAN I?..<br><br>FlyNDance... is it really something I wont be able to do?...<br>After the first meeting with you at Mac... I started to realise<br>that you are not only a virtual being living in the cyberspace...<br>in reality you are strong, gentle and sensitive.... I can feel the<br>defense Wall of my heart is slowly breaking apart.... I am<br>defeated... I tied my hair today.. 'cos my fren told me that I look<br>more attractive this way...<br><br>I want you to remember my face as it is today... 'cos after<br>today... everything may change.... But why didn't you ask for my<br>real name? ..thats why I never asked for urs...<br><br>I am a girl mah..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... do you realised how I wish to have<br>something more than a nick to take along with me? ...Slorr... thank<br>you for the DOLCE VITA... finally got a taste of what sweet times<br>are like... but I am really sorry..... I just couldnt bear to say<br>goodbyz.....<br><br>since it started from a mail.... it should end with a mail<br>too.... Its been 3 months and 2 days since the very first mail...<br>not a very long time but it isn't short either.... our story began<br>from me... and I will end it..<br><br>Maybe its what you said... 'internet is fast and convenient, but<br>it isn't perfect'.... I can send you my thoughts right away... but<br>not my tears... Its about 5.30am now.... time to go.... by the time<br>you receive this mail... I would be trying to settle down somewhere<br>else.... I don't know....Good Bye.<br><br>With lotsa love,<br>FlyNDance<br><br>After reading her mail, I felt as if I had just experienced a<br>roller-coaster ride which almost derailed. she had shown me the<br>other side of her, soft and sensitive.<br><br>For a couple of months, I was trying to hypnotise myself, to<br>suppress my feelings whenever I started to think about her again.<br>Perpetually I was telling myself, she is just one virtual character<br>that flys and dance in the net, but never in the real world.<br><br>I became a fugitive, escaping from my PC, escaping from the<br>internet and anythng that has to do wih coffee. Hide myself behind<br>the piles of lecture notes, behind the crowd of people, trying to<br>get rid of this thought of missing something in life.<br><br>But I failed. I found out that its not that I don't miss her, its<br>just that I had forgotten the passion that always comes along when<br>you are having something hanging on your mind all the time. its<br>like I cannot not breathe, its just that I had forgotten the fact<br>that I have been breathing in and out for the past 19 years.<br><br>I can hold my breath for a while, but not forever.<br><br>I have to find her.<br><br>Part 8<br><br>"Err... I am looking for ... er..FlyNDance...."<br><br>"HUH??..."<br><br>'Huh', this is the exact word I was expecting from her.<br><br>She seems to be FlyNDance's elder sister, 20++, looked quite a<br>beauty too even without any makeup. But of course, still can't be<br>compared with her. I explained to her my purpose for knocking on<br>the door and told her that I am no stalker whom she might think I<br>am.<br><br>Surprisingly when I told her my disgusting nick, Slorr, she<br>appeared to be rather excited and quickly she scribbled something<br>on a small piece of paper and handed it to me.<br><br>"You should go and see her. SGH, Room 3-425."<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>This is the first time I've ever stepped into the Singapore<br>General Hospital. It's a dust-free space, everything looked so<br>clean, tidy and arranged.<br><br>But I don't like the feeling it gave me... I entered room 3-425,<br>she was there, in a deep sleep. I stood by her, watching.<br><br>Her hair was still as long as before, laying across the soft,<br>white pillow...<br><br>Her face looked roundish now, I know it's the side-effect of the<br>medicine. And the pinkish-red patch that was on her neck had spread<br>to her face appearing in a shape of a butterfly.<br><br>Nevertheless, she was still the most beautiful butterfly I've<br>ever seen.<br><br>Her eyelashes twitched slightly, she must be dreaming, what's<br>that in her dream?<br><br>McDonald's fries and coke? Sinking Titanic? Or the rain at AMK<br>Ave 6? The room was getting darker as the clock approaches 6pm.<br><br>I wanted to switch on the light. I hate to see her lying lonely<br>under the shadow of a patient's room.<br><br>But I am worried that her dreams might be disturbed by the sudden<br>light rays. While I was in a dilemma, her eyes opened slowly. Her<br>eyes were wide on me, then she turned away suddenly.<br><br>I can only see her back at this moment. She lost weight. After a<br>long time, she turned to face me again, rubbed her eyes and<br>smiled....<br><br>"Slorr, you are here!"<br><br>"Yes, nice weather today, isn't it?"<br><br>"Ya lor, sky also very chio today? Right? Heehee.."<br><br>SKY VERY CHIO...<br><br>I can still remember this was the conversation we had in one of<br>our AJCRR meetings."<br><br>But she didn't realized that it's raining today.<br><br>"Slorr, why are you standing there. Sit down."<br><br>Thanks for reminding me. I just found out that my legs were<br>numbed due to the several hours of standing.<br><br>"Slorr, you lost weight."<br><br>ME? I thought I should be the one who's telling this to her!?<br><br>"Slorr, you hungry? Had your lunch? Food here isn't so good.<br>That's why patients like me always slim down a bit. Apart from<br>that. It's quite ok. But sometimes I feel really bored without a PC<br>here to talk to you.."<br><br>"Slorr, how's your mid-year? Sure did very well right?"<br><br>WAIT A MINUTE! You are the one who's lying on bed right now not<br>me! Yet, I had nothing to ask her actually.<br><br>Because I was there to see her, not to find out the answers to<br>those questions. Maybe now its the time for me to utter some<br>touching lines like whats in the case of a movie.<br><br>But I am not a Romantic person... moreover...<br><br>Movies are fiction.<br><br>Life isn't.<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>I just wished that she could leave this place as soon as possible<br>back to AMK Ave 6, back to ACJC, back to where she belonged. And I<br>promised she won't be alone anymore, because I will always be<br>there.<br><br>After a while, her mum was here to see her. Around the age of 50,<br>slightly overweight. Other than the cheerful smile, she didn't<br>really remind me of FlyNDance.<br><br>"Err, I think i've gotta go now. Bye bye auntie."<br><br>"You....You..."<br><br>She sat up straight in a sudden, like if she'd experienced a<br>tremendous shock.<br><br>"I'll be here again tomorrow.. and the day after tomorrow...<br>until you leave this place..."<br><br>Before I went back home, I went to Plaza Singapura again to buy<br>that Christian Dior Dolce Vita... and I've got the biggest bottle<br>this time, that she can even swim in it.<br><br>I try not to close my eyes that night, I want to go to her as<br>soon as the first sun ray shoots into my room....<br><br>Part 9<br><br>"Slorr.. you are here.. i've been waiting for you for a long<br>time..."<br><br>"Had a good night's rest?..."<br><br>"Oh... I didn't allow myself to fall into a deep sleep because I<br>know you won't wake me up when your here."<br><br>"Then you should take a rest now."<br><br>"Err, since you are here already, I don't think I can..."<br><br>I gave her the Dolce Vita, and we'd agreed that we would dance in<br>the rain in front of SGH main entrance the day she's discharged.<br><br>I dare not look straight at her, because there's a butterfly on<br>her face. It was only last night before I leave SGH that I found<br>out she's suffering from an illness called ERYSIPELAS. What the<br>clergymen would term the BUTTERFLY DISEASE...<br><br>But what I like is the coffee butterfly that is able to dance<br>around freely, not that pinkish-red butterfly that settled on her<br>pale complexion. Moreover, whats a butterfly if it can't fly?<br><br>"Slorr, why are you looking at me and not talking?"<br><br>I don't know, because I noticed that she's getting weaker<br>physically. I had a bad feeling about this.<br><br>"Slorr, I am thirsty, can you get me a drink?"<br><br>I am not leaving her at this moment. I can still remember a movie<br>about this guy who went all the way to get red bean soup for his<br>girlfriend who's on sickbed and to find her lying silently on the<br>white bedsheet when he came back... never to wake up again...<br><br>"Are you trying to get rid of me, like what's in that movie?"<br><br>"Slorr, movie is movie, life is life..."<br><br>MOVIE? LIFE?....<br><br>"But I thought you just had a drink? Anyway, so what can I get<br>for you?"<br><br>"Ultimate Ice Blended!!"<br><br>This is a hospital leh!! Did she think I can find Coffee Bean<br>everywhere on this island? Like McDonalds, what's more coffee<br>wasn't suitable for her at that time.<br><br>"Err... coffee isn't good for health, order something else, ok?<br><br>"So you know coffee isn't good for the body too. Then you should<br>cut down on your intake also, ok?"<br><br>I saw her smile appearing and there's a shine in her eyes. I<br>realised that shes just trying to tell me not to drink too much<br>coffee in the future.<br><br>My heart seemed to have suffered from a heavy blow.<br><br>This is not good. A taste of pH7 has started to fill my nose. If<br>this is not going to stop, tears might be the next thing that<br>appears in front of her.<br><br>I recalled the chapter on reservoir and dam in physics textbook.<br>Quickly applied the knowledge on myself. Even if it's just a few<br>droplets.<br><br>"Ok, I promise, I'll try my best."<br><br>"And try to sleep earlier in the future and don't skip<br>breakfast..."<br><br>"It'ss important to you and don't be too obsessed with blue. It<br>makes you look troubled and....."<br><br>This didn't sound good. It's like giving the final instructions<br>before she... I can't bear to let her continue.<br><br>"Ok ok, I'll go get you a drink right away."<br><br>"Slorr, is the machine far away? If it is, then its ok, I don't<br>want it anymore."<br><br>From my mental calculation, men would take 67 steps while women<br>would take 85 steps to reach the vending machine right at that<br>corner. Plus the time taken to purchase, average would take a total<br>of 1.8 to 2.1 minutes. Not very far.<br><br>"Quite near."<br><br>"Slorr, come back quick. I don't want to be alone for too long...<br>I hate that feeling."<br><br>I didn't answer her. I just increased my pace....<br><br>Part 10<br><br>"Eh... its late already... go to sleep..", my mum was nagging at<br>me again.<br><br>"Ok ok.... 10 more minutes..."<br><br>Until today, FlyNDance had left for more than 2 mths.<br><br>I still logged on at 1 am every night, but onto channel<br>DOLCE-VITA which was created by myself, with slorr and FlyNDance<br>being the only 2 nicks inside, for 10 minutes.<br><br>Although she won't be able to fly and dance in real life anymore,<br>but I still wish that she could continue to do so in the virtual<br>world.<br><br>Even Tye has given up on me...<br><br>"She's gone, why are you still doing this? For what?!!"<br><br>Yet, even if that's the case, I can't allow her soul to be left<br>at the corner of loneliness. Because she said she hated the feeling<br>of being alone....<br><br>I still remember there was a heavy downpour on that day. When I<br>reached SGH, they told me... A coffee butterfly flew away from her<br>room at around 1 am last night....<br><br>After that... I can't remember...<br><br>I just knew that I stood at the bus-stop for a whole day and I<br>was all wet because of the rain. even my face.<br><br>I've been trying hard not to think of her over these 2 months.<br>I've been hoping that her face won't appear in my mind every moment<br>that I breathe, but it's like hoping that the sky isn't blue; the<br>grass isn't green; the stars do not twinkle at night...<br><br>Basically, I was hoping for something impossible to happen. I<br>can't believe that I am of Type 2, even in real life.<br><br>Did I cry?.. NO WAY!..<br><br>I said it before, I am not a romantic person, and this may be due<br>to the deficiency in the hormones that constitutes emotions.<br>Whenever I had the feeling of pH7, I'll browse through those<br>'FWDS:jokes...' Attention will then be shifted by those dim-wit,<br>low-class jokes...<br><br>So now everything is back to the way it was before I met her 9<br>mths ago.<br><br>Tye is still flirting around, and I am still the old decent=dull<br>me. But I've stopped taking coffee and beer.<br><br>"Xing ah, is this for you?"<br><br>My mum handed me a letter she picked up in the mail box this<br>morning.<br><br>I was surprised when I saw 'To:slorr...' written on the envelope.<br><br>That's for me I guess. I opened it up, there was a piece of<br>writing inside, and another coffee envelope.<br><br>Slorr,<br>I am FlyNDance's sister, I think this is how you are addressing<br>her. I am sorry that I do not know your real name, although we'd<br>met before.<br><br>When I was packing her stuffs a few days ago, I found this<br>letter with your name and address already written on it.<br><br>So I posted it to you, because I believe this is what my sister<br>intended to do.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Xiao Wen<br><br>The letter was sent 3 days ago, and there was another:<br><br>'To:slorr...'<br><br>Followed by my home address written on the coffee envelope. But<br>this handwriting was a lot nicer and the words seemed to be moving<br>swiftly...like in a joyful dance.<br><br>I have no time to figure out how she has gotten my home address.<br>Did I give her in one of my mails?<br><br>I tried to control my trembling hands, slowly, I opened up the<br>envelope. I found a photo, and a half of a movie ticket inside.<br><br>Apart from these, there was a blue letter... with the familiar<br>DOLCE VITA smell on it. The photo showed her, standing on a piece<br>of grassland, wearing the same coffee theme attire on our first<br>meeting at McDonalds.<br><br>Something was written at the back of it....<br><br>Dear slorr,<br>Coffee represents Pisces.. that's me. Blue represents<br>Sagitarius.. that's you. A blue letter inside a coffeee<br>envelope.... know what I mean? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Seeing me, do you feel like drinking coffee now? Stop drooling!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>FlyNDance<br><br>I smiled.... bitterly. The contents of the blue letter is simple:<br><br>If I have one more day to live, I want to be your girlfriend. Do<br>I have one more day? No. Too bad. I can't be your girlfriend... not<br>in this life.<br>If I have wings, I want to fly down from the paradise just to<br>see you. Do I have wings? No. Sadly. I can never see you again.<br><br>If all the water are drawn out of the bath-tub, but it still<br>can't put off the flame of love btw us. Can all the water in a<br>bath-tub be drawn off? Can.<br><br>So yes. I LOVE YOU.<br><br>FlyNDance<br><br>My chest was torn apart... tears broke through the dam I<br>constructed a long time go in a jiffy.<br><br>As proud, as emotionless as I was, I can't pull back the salty<br>wetness that's on the whole of my face anymore.<br><br>She has changed my 'little theory' and gotten back what I'd owed<br>her... tears for 2 months....<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>Titanic has won 11 awards in the Oscar, including best picture.<br><br>Yet, Rose wasn't the best actress under that category. So if it's<br>sad in a movie, it may not be so fortunate too in real life. And in<br>reality, should Jack hold on to Rose and 'Never let go?'<br><br>Maybe he shouldn't be worried about this. 'Cos that beautiful<br>coffee butterfly will continue to fly and dance in his heart..<br>forever...'<br><br><strong>~THE END~</strong><br></div>
