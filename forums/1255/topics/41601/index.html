            <div class='col-md body'>(Based on a true and factual story in my life)<br><br>Dear Mum,<br><br>I just wanna say that i miss you very very much. 18 years you left abruptly, leaving me,dad and brother, yearning for your love and concern. Though i never remembered what my first words are or to who they are to, i can still remember the feeling of your hug as you took me under your wing. I remembered the vanishing glimpse of your face under your cascading tresses. 18 years may not be long for a bankrupt to rebuild his empire but it is very long for a person who longed for his mum.<br><br>The only treasure you left me are the distant memories i had as a toddler and photographs of you carrying me around the house. You never showed me expressively how much you loved me. I never experienced motherly love before because you never gave me the chance to. I hid myself in envy during mother's day for i had no reason in the world to celebrate one. I ran away in despair during your birthday for there is no reason a birthday cake is to be bought. I hung my head in sadness during your death anniversary for now i am stepping on you instead of looking up to you in high esteem.<br><br>You are sorely missed by me and me alone. Auntie Edlynn appeared now in the picture and she will never replace you in my heart. You are the reason why i am now sitting here trying to succeed in my life. Please come back. I really need you Mum. I love you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Love,<br>Andy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Andy,<br><br>Mum is doing very well up here. Don't worry my son. Mum loves you very very much and miss you and the rest of our beloved family. I am so sorry to leave you early in your childhood. Mum has to been taken away to join the rest of my family and friends up here. Mum hopes to meet you too in the near future. So how are your studies Andy? Are you doing well lately? What about your brother? Has he recovered from his illness? Mum prayed very  hard for him to get well faster.<br><br>Mum has to apologise for not leaving you behind happy memories but instead sad memories that made you feel very sad. Mum knows that every night, you have been shedding tears for me but do not fret because Mum will take care of you spiritually.Auntie Edlynn is here because Mum has asked someone to send her to your dad. Mum noticed that Dad has been shedding tears too. Mum is very very very sad looking at my family like this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> . I hope that Andy and your brother will acknowledge Auntie Edlynn and accept her as much as you will to me.<br><br>Mum loves you Andy but unfortunately, i have to go. There is a very very long queue up here for usage of the computer. Behind me is Bill Gates' dad. Anyway, take care of yourself and dun cry for me but for world peace. I love you andy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Love,<br>Mum  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mum,<br><br>Its been ages since i last wrote to you and i have been awaiting for your reply here. I just wanna tell you that my exams had finished and now awaiting results but i guess u can see everything from up there huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Well, Sunday is coming and i am dreading that day to come cause i never had the chance to enjoy it with you around. As long as you are in my mind, i always feel the love for you. Saying goodbye is very hard to do but it's something that i have to do. And one day everyone will say goodbye to me and hopefully joining u. I have been missing you terribly and i kept dreaming about you. I am absolutely clueless about my plans on Sunday.<br><br>You were all that i got and all that i think of.<br>Where ever i am and what ever i do,<br>my mind revolves around the things u used to do.<br>I love you so much and it hurts me to know<br>that you no longer could touch me or walk to and fro.<br><br>Mum, take care of yourself and i will sign off right now. I wun forget the words in ur letter that i just received from Daddy this week. I was angry with him for keeping it from e after almost 19 years.<br>*sigh*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Love Andy</div>
