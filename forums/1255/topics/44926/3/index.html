I was using ISO 200 film (only one I had on hand that day) so that could be the reason for the gradient in the blue or as you said, the scanners fault (using a 1st gen flatbed then) but I've upgraded since then!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I believe that you're right as regards to the focal length, should be 28-40mm. I didn't take down the info then and I can't remember now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  but perspective-wise the photo came out the way I intended, if not the technical aspects.<br><br>The reason why my glasses are all so big is due to the fact that telephotos are the only option when shooting planes in the air when they takeoff or land, anything else is too small. The 28 is used mainly for static display shots at airshows, I could have gone for the 28-80 for coverage but I wanted something I could stop down to f2.8, and I don't have the bucks to buy a 28-80 that can stop down that far.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Hahaha...the FM2's got an inbuilt meter thankfully, but shooting fast moving subjects with a manual camera brings about its own set of problems I tell you, even with a motordrive!<br><br>I'm a moderator on the Military Nuts forum, and I know Duotiga and his similar fetish for planes, I'm just wondering how long it'll take for him to stumble across this...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
