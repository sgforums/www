            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: black;">[color=violet]It was early in the morning when Thaddeus reached home. He had been out entertaining his clients and had missed dinner with his wife, Rachel. Trying not to wake her up, he moved around the house quietly and finally sliding into bed, next to her.<br><br>Lying in bed, unable to sleep, Thaddeus recalled what happen earlier that night. Dinner was at a posh restaurant and later drinking at one of the favorite lounges in town. It was there that Thaddeus saw her. Beautiful, long haired and slim, she had what it takes to be a model. She turned heads wherever she goes, finally settling to a seat near the bar counter.<br><br>Â“Hey, sheÂ’s a beautiful thing, isnÂ’t she?Â” One of the clients said, looking quite smitten by the lady.<br><br>Thaddeus smiled and thought about his beautiful wife alone at home. Feeling guilty, he excused himself and made his way to a quieter area and called home. The phone rang for some time before Rachel answered. Â“Honey, have you eaten? IÂ’m at the Jazz lounge with some clients, will be home late, donÂ’t wait up for me ok?Â” Thaddeus said. Â“IÂ’ve eaten and am watching DVD now. DonÂ’t drink so much ya?Â” She said understandingly. What else can a man ask for, with such an understanding wife? Thaddeus smiled and hung up.<br><br>Â“Where did you go? She gave me her number!Â” His colleague, Joe said excitedly. Confused, he asked, Â“Who?Â” Â“The beauty, her name is Liz.Â”  Slightly disappointed by what Joe said, he mumbled a reply and sipped his drink. Thaddeus was far better looking than Joe and he couldnÂ’t understand why the beauty would give him her number.<br><br>Before the group left for home, Joe went to say his goodbyes to the beauty and Thaddeus tagged along. He shook hands with the lady and introduced himself. They exchanged name cards and left.<br><br>It was early in the morning before Thaddeus fell asleep.<br><br>Back in the office after the weekend, Joe excitedly told Thaddeus that he managed to date Liz for dinner that night. Â“Wow, youÂ’re reacting fast!Â” he replied and Joe said, Â“Oh man, youÂ’re married, I want to settle too, you know.Â” Thinking about Rachel, he soon felt guilty about thinking of Liz.<br><br>Thaddeus was going through his documents and the phone rang. It was Rachel asking him to suggest what to have for dinner. Trying to make up to her, he suggested her favorite cuisine, Japanese food. They decided to meet up at the Japanese restaurant that they frequent.<br><br>During dinner, his mobile phoned beeped. It was a message from Liz. Â“Hey there, Liz here, want to meet up for coffee?Â” He was busy replying the message that he didnÂ’t hear what Rachel was saying. Â“IÂ’m sorry dear, you were saying?Â” Â“I said, shall we go for a holiday this year end?Â” Â“ShouldnÂ’t be a problem, IÂ’ll see to it.Â” Rachel was all smiles when she heard that.<br><br>The mobile phone beeped again. Â“Well, you got a wife, so? We are just having coffee, not an affair. Ha Ha.Â” He smiled and replied, Â“Maybe another day?Â” For the rest of the day, Liz didnÂ’t reply the message.<br><br>While having lunch with Joe and the rest of the executives, he nudged Thaddeus. Â“She spent the night with me yesterday. Speechless is the word to describe.Â” Joe was grinning. Thaddeus thought, so was the message was a ploy to get her away from Joe or what? They walked back to the office and Joe couldnÂ’t stop talking about Liz. Thaddeus stopped him in the middle of his sentence, by asking, Â“Maybe youÂ’re not the only one that sheÂ’s with.Â” Wide eyed, Joe couldnÂ’t believe what Thaddeus just said. Â“No way man, sheÂ’s not that type of girl. No way, Thad, I wouldnÂ’t take that.Â” Thaddeus just shrugged.<br><br>Back at home, Rachel was in the shower and Thaddeus was watching television. His phone rang. Â“Liz here, want to come out for a coffee? IÂ’ll be asking Joe along.Â” Â“Ok, what time and where?Â” He replied. She briefly told him the place and time and hung up. Since Joe is going, IÂ’ll bring Rachel along, he thought.<br><br>Â“Rachel, weÂ’re going out to meet Joe and his new found squeeze.Â” He said to her, standing outside the shower screen. Â“Honey, why donÂ’t you go ahead, IÂ’ve got a long day tomorrow and IÂ’ve got to rest early tonight,Â” she replied.<br><br>Liz and Joe were chatting when ThaddeusÂ’s car moved into the parking lot. Â“Sorry guys, Rachel was actually coming with me, but sheÂ’s tired.Â” Joe nodded and Liz just stared at Thaddeus. Â“Is there something on my face?Â” She shook her head.<br><br>The chat was simple and informal. Liz is freelance model and will be flying off to Spain the next week. All the while during the chatting session, Liz was looking at Thaddeus most of the time. By this time, it was pretty clear that Liz was interested in Thaddeus rather then Joe. Feeling out of place yet knowing that the man is married, he spoke to Thaddeus when Liz went to the ladies. Â“Hey, looks like sheÂ’s making a pass on you. YouÂ’re married, you know.Â” It sounded like a warning but the fact is Joe was intimidated by Thaddeus. Laughing, Thaddeus joked, Â“I wonÂ’t fight with you over her, but if she throws herself at me, then no choice ok?Â”<br><br>When it was time to go, the threesome went to collect their cars and went on their individual ways home. During the drive, Liz messaged Thaddeus and asked to meet up with him one of the days before she leave for Spain. He replied, Â“Will confirm with you again, am driving now.Â”<br><br>It seemed like a normal meeting to Thaddeus. But to Liz, it was something else. </span>[/color]</div>
