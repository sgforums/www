            <div class='col-md body'>yesterday we met at my sch at 8plus then we were grouped and we set off to botanical gardens to take photos. and i was trigger happy or rather shutter happy.  in a matter of 3 hrs i clocked 100+ photos.<br>i dare my bet my stupid face tat at least 80% of the shots will be deleted. when i wanted to take pictures of some fishes in the pond, i realised i need a polarizing filter. since i could barely see any fishes in it with the camera, only when i zoomed in max and places where sunlight was strong, i could clearly see the fishes.<br>the colour of the plants werent that intense. ( haiz. wasted my leica lens)<br>along the way we took pics (macro) of plants and noted down the names of some of the more interesting plants. but when we arrived at this waterfall, the fact that my farked up camera cannot select shutter speed, was highlighted. the water droplets were smudged. so blur. so lousy.<br><br>then i practised with spot and centre metering, which i find spot metering the most useful when i am take macro of flowers while wanting to blur or to 'destroy' the background. though it didnt turn out bright, at least the petals and the patterns could be seen.<br><br>then i managed to take a candid pic of a pair of jap babes,,,,(1 was wearing heels, hahhahahah....heels....ahhah) and also a jap baby, kinda cute but she kept staring into the camera ( I WANT A CANDID SHOT, NOT A POSED BABY) .<br><br>then we went for lunch and we realised we had this 5hrs time before we meet at JE mrt. so my grp went to watch SWAT. and the worse thing happened, my iPAQ couldnt detect my SD card, so i had to call my ma to bring the laptop i initially wanted to bring and meet me at JE and the best part of the joke is,,,my first batt died....then we went to west coast to take sunset pics and some of them played at the playground and climbed this pyramid there.....and there was another cute baby but due to my farked up skills.....none were ok....&amp;*(Q%$#^$!#^<br><br>we went for a grp shot at the bus stop...and the commuters there thought we were mad esp when we placed our camera mounted tripods on the road where the bus would stop.<br><br>after dinner.....some played arcade for a while and some had left for bugis earlier than us. since it was a long ride on the train, 1 year1 guy took sneak pics of the club president....sleeping....and i showed some of the pics i took to my juniors.<br><br>when we arrived at bugis we rendezvous with the rest and we photographed this hotel there. i tried a variety of methods to capture it...spent 20 pics.....total failure. even a newbie with a simple fuji digital cam did better. tmd<br><br>and there begun our long journey to changi for our stay,....haha....i continued to upload pics and some played cards,sleep,played PS2, experimented with macro shots.<br>the grp which did the macro shots thingy, i see liaoz pengz....all kinds of equipment also got. wah lau eh.<br><br>at 3am, some of us went down for supper and we saw this grp of "ladies", we couldnt confirm they were 'ladies' since we didnt dare to look at them too long and they were sat faraway.<br><br>while chit-chatting, i photographed some of the 4wheeled 'ladies' there.it seems to be weird as i saw at least 4 modded honda civics heading towards this carpark and disappeared.<br><br>we hung ard....photographing some stray cats, took a pic of my friend trying to slam dunk. i was lucky but the pic wasnt too bright...somewhat dark. but composition wise...ok only.<br><br>waited and charged my batt....till 5am where i decided to pack my bags earlier as i was expecting them to take some time and i needed to be in sch at 9am. then i wanted to take this panaromic shot so i went pass this guy and placed my tripod closer to the water than him and he just screamed at me blocking this view. i told him i was taking pana and after that i move back liaoz. then he kp  say he came first . so i ignored him and the club pres came and told me it was my fault. HELLO?! i told him i was taking pana, i know he came first,i damn very well know tht i may be blocking him but there was no sun yet...take what sunset ?<br><br>i mean like i want to stand so bloody close to the damn seawater and let my cam breath in salt ah ? stupid year ones. clear yr puny head of junk and think...or do u need a charger for yr brains ?<br><br>so i gave up my pana and went to a corner where the position was perfect.  took pics like nobody's business while experimenting with spot and centre metering,where to meter, use EV or not and how much,<br><br>ended up with 140+ pics there.<br><br>in grand total. i took 352 pics for 24 hrs of shooting ?<br>if i was using film , i would be bankrupt.</div>
