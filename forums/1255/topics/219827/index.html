            <div class='col-md body'>My comments.... and I hope your not like farmerseed.<br><br>Pix 1: You might like to have your camera to go on selective focusing.... not sure what you are using, but it's likely that it's on default mode. Most camera will have a program or even manual mode where you can pick for the zone for focusing.<br>Pix 2: I like the picture except for the reflection on the widescreen. Sometimes by changing the angle, you can cut off the unnecessarily reflection.<br>Pix 3 and 4 same subject: Unless you've got a DSLR, your probably can't change much. By change, I mean get a super wide angle. This will overdramatise the perspective of this old cannon. Photoshop will bring up some of the colors on this otherwise dull photo. I'd use the curves or the levels control, and possibly the hue slider for this.<br><br>I do not pretend that I am a pro (which I am not) and I am not in the league of Pointblue (my current photographer idol), and these are just my comments... hope you don't take offense.</div>
