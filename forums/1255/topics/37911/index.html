            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> A story that I just came up with tonight. Sharing with you guys.</span></strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><br><br>The shower was running when I woke up. I looked at the bedside alarm clock and it read 6.00am. I got out of bed and wrapped myself in the white bathrobe lying on the armchair across the room. Drawing the curtains aside, the sun coming up. I could hear the birds chirping and I remembered how the previous night was. Passionate and sensual.<br><br>Â“What are you thinking about, baby?Â” He hugged me from behind and whispered in my ear. Â“Thinking about making love again,Â” I naughtily teased him. Â“How about tonight?Â” He suggested with a wink. I smiled and gave him a passionate kiss. He went into the walk-in wardrobe, and I went to wash up.<br><br>I took quite a while in the bathroom and when I went to the living room, he was gone. On the coffee table was a note. It read, Â“Love you baby. IÂ’ll pick you up after work. Yours, AdamÂ”<br><br>That evening, we went to one of our regular hunts for dinner. We chatted over the dayÂ’s activities and Adam broke the news about his company posting him to Hong Kong.<br><br>Â“What? Of all people, why you?Â” I asked, confused and lost. I didnÂ’t want my husband to leave me when we got married for less than a year. Â“Baby, the company is setting up a new office there, and IÂ’ve got to be there.Â” Adam explained. Â“For how long?Â” I asked. Â“Maybe a year, of two.Â” He said softly, knowing that the duration was too long. You mean you are leaving me for 2 years and IÂ’m supposed to be okay with that?Â” I flared up. He tried to explain how the posting would benefit us in our future. I couldnÂ’t hear any of it and sipped my wine in silence.<br><br>The drive home was silent. I canÂ’t bear the thought of Adam leaving me. The radio played Â“All by myselfÂ” as my tears came rolling down my cheeks. It was his favorite song. Adam saw it and I knew it was difficult for him. Â“Look, I know how much this job means to you. IÂ’m really upset about it, I hope you take consideration of our relationship before you make a decision.Â” I said without looking at him. Â“I know IÂ’m selfish, but please spare a thought for me?Â” I pleaded with him. Â“Baby, youÂ’re not selfish. YouÂ’re my princess. Why not IÂ’ll talk to Ben about this and see if he could send someone over instead?Â” he suggested. I was not satisfied with the answer, maybe because I was used to Adam giving in to me throughout our relationship. Â“I want to sleep alone tonight.Â” I said. He nodded.<br><br>We slept in different rooms that night. I couldnÂ’t sleep the whole night. Tossing and turning in bed, I finally went to sleep in the wee hours of the morning.<br><br>I woke up two hours later and fixed him breakfast. Â“IÂ’m taking leave today, you donÂ’t have to sent me to work.Â” I told him. Â“Why? Are you sick? Shall I bring you to the doctorÂ’s?Â” He asked anxiously. Tears glistened in my eyes as I watched his concerned expression. Â“No, IÂ’m fine. Just didnÂ’t get much sleep last night.Â” I said, reassuring him. Â“Ok, but if you arenÂ’t feeling well later, call me ok? IÂ’ll come home and bring you to the doctor.Â” He said, stroking my head. With a peck on my forehead, he left for work.<br><br>Â“Ben, can I talk to you for awhile?Â” Adam asked as he was leaving the meeting room. Â“Sure, talk to me in the office.Â” Ben said.<br><br>Seated down across his boss, Adam braced himself and enquired if he could send someone over to Hong Kong instead of him. Â“Give me a good reason why?Â” Ben enquired, looking at him. Â“IÂ’m still newly wed, Ben. I canÂ’t leave my wife alone here.Â” Adam explained his situation. They talked for quite some time and Adam left the room.<br><br>Back in his office, Adam called up the florist and ordered a dozen of roses to be delivered to his house. He happily put down the phone and carried on with his work.<br><br>I was putting the dirty laundry into the washing machine when the doorbell rang. I answered the door, and saw the roses. Â“Mrs. Can you please sign for it?Â” the delivery boy said, handing me the slip. I signed and he left. The roses were beautiful. A card accompanied it, read, Â“Baby, I love you no matter where I go. I will never leave you. Loving you always, Hubby.Â” I smiled.<br><br>I placed the roses in a vase and placed them on the coffee table in the balcony. I headed down to the nearest supermarket, intending to cook him a good dinner. As I walked down the aisle, my eyes twitched. Thinking that I didnÂ’t sleep well was the reason of the twitching, I ignored it. I selected a few pieces of steak, potatoes, vegetables and a bottle of his favorite red wine.<br><br>I was paying for my purchases when my mobile phone rang. Â“Hello,Â” I answered. Â“Is me, I got to rush through a document today. Might be home a little late. By the way, you like the flowers?Â” Adam asked. Â“Yes. Love it. IÂ’ll prepare dinner and wait for you.Â” I said, smiling at the thought of the roses. We hung up and I went home.<br><br>I prepared dinner and laid the table. The time was 7.15pm. He should be home anytime soon, I thought. I took a shower and changed into fresher clothes. Playing our favorite CD on the home entertainment system, I sat on the sofa, waiting for his return.<br><br>I dozed off. The clock on top of the plasma TV sounded. I woke up quickly and realized it was 8.30pm. Adam was not home yet. I took the dinner into the kitchen and reheated it. Picking up the kitchen phone, I dialed his mobile number. Â“The number you just dialed is not getting a response. Please try again later.Â” This was what I heard. Thinking that his battery might be flat and heÂ’s on his way home, I hung up. My eyes twitched again.<br><br>At about 9.00pm, my mobile phone rang. ItÂ’s the hospital. Â“Mrs. See, this is Jenny calling from Singapore General Hospital. IÂ’m afraid that I have to tell you Mr. Adam See is being awarded to the hospital half an hour agoÂ….Â” Before the nurse finished her sentence, I dropped the phone in shocked. Quickly picking it up, I let the nurse know that IÂ’ll be on my way there.<br>As I took the cab to the hospital, I prayed that Adam would be fine, that the accident was a minor one. I walked briskly to the emergency ward and enquired with a nurse on duty. The nurse told me that the doctor is attending to him, and told me to take a seat.<br><br>God, please let him be fine, I prayed. Not knowing what to do, I paced up and down the corridor, waiting anxiously. A middle-aged doctor came out of the operating room, and I rushed up to him. Â“Are you Mrs. See?Â” He asked. I nodded, waiting for him to tell me AdamÂ’s fine. Â“IÂ’m sorry, Mrs. See. I did my best. Your husband had a strong will, but we were not able to save him.Â” The doctor said and I broke down. The nurses pushed Adam out and I hold on to him, refusing to let go. Â“Hubby, is me, wake up. You canÂ’t just leave me here.Â” I wailed and the next thing I knew, I was unconscious.<br><br>The next few days were a blur to me. I couldnÂ’t eat. I couldnÂ’t sleep. I wonÂ’t talk. Tears just keep falling. My mind was playing back the times IÂ’ve spent with Adam. The days of our courtship; our wedding ceremony; our honeymoon in Paris and the roses.<br><br>My parents stayed over at our house for almost a month. Everyday I would just sit in the balcony, looking at the roses. I wouldnÂ’t eat or talk. I was dead spiritually. Every now and then I wished Adam would come home and hugged me from behind. Mum was heart broken to see me in such a state. Dad was always comforting me, giving me hugs every now and then. Subconsciously, I knew what was happening around me. I just couldnÂ’t face reality. Adam dead. HeÂ’s gone.<br><br>One day, Dad was playing one of AdamÂ’s favorite CD and the song Â“All by myselfÂ” was played. I broke down again, shocking my parents. Â“AdamÂ…Â” was all I said. IÂ’m now alone and all by myself. No. I still have Adam in my heart. He will always be.<br><br>Â“Baby, I love you no matter where I go. I will never leave you. Loving you always, Hubby.Â” Reading the card again, I realized that he will always love me and he had never left me. He was in my memories, in our house, and most importantly in my heart. Â“I love you too,Â” I whispered as I hugged his photograph close to my heart, Â“I always will.Â”<br><br></span></div>
