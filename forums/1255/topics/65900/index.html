            <div class='col-md body'>this was something u said to me... towards the end of us...<br><br>we met..nearly 4 years ago... i remember that i didn't have a good impression of you at that time... you were much too quiet... and that goofy grin of yours.. i didn't like it at all, i used to think it was rather irritating... but... it grew to be something i loved about you....<br><br>middle of 1998... it was the beginning of us...<br>we started seeing each other very often... because our mutual friend "Al" just broke up with his gf.. and we were both there, supposedly to be around for him, to comfort and console him.. it was during this time.. that we started talking.. and when we stayed over at Al's place.. we'd spend the entire night talking... after Al knocked out.. from all the alcohol...<br>i remember the night it all started... Al had already knocked out... but both of us were still awake.. we were lying in bed... talking... u told me about the past year.. about how u felt for me.. but i was with someone else.. and how difficult it was for you when you knew... you said alot more... and then... u turned towards me... looked deeply into my eyes... and lightly lightly kissed me..<br>it was the first time in my entire life... that i can finally use the word "magical"... it was something i thought i would only read about in story books... but it happened to me...that night...</div>
