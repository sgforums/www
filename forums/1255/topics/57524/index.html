            <div class='col-md body'>er.. going thru the specs it looks ok means that i haven't seen or use the cam so that's all i'm basing my conclusions from...<br><br>well like i said, getting zoom is easy, i know of someone who's using my cam, (280mm max) adds on the original nikon 1.5x TC and this has a 58mm thread, and still adds on ANOTHER oly tcon (which uses 55mm so he needs to get a step down ring) so in total he gets 280 x 1.5 x 1.7 = 714mm. of course u can continue stacking and i have seen pictures of my cam that's longer than a dSLR with a 70-300 + TC... madness..<br><br>anyway for me, i won't be 'fooled' by a large zoom. most of the time u'll find that having heaps of zoom will result in blurry pics due to hand shake. the general rule of thumb is that u need a min shutter speed of 1 on ur focal length. so at 420mm u need a shutter of 1/420 which is pretty fast and u'll only get it under direct sunlight. under the shade, with that long a zoom (probably a smaller aperture) u're gonna have a hard time trying to get that shutter speed, and hence getting underexposure. bump up ur iso and u'll get noise. so... gotta bring a tripod. and with a tripod, all "stealth" mode is gone..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>5700 can be had here for around 1600 brand new (maybe just under)? just the cam and standard accessories (1 batt, 1 small crappy cf card etc etc). it's using a CMYG array ccd, but that shouldn't bother you, or i (amatuers). i mean.. it's just a way they record colour, look at the sample pics online to check the colour reproduction. dun use my shots as comparison becos most are photoshopped.. go dpreview to see the unammended shots.<br><br>the vf in 5700 is electronic.<br><br>in a few years (actually much less!) the 602, and also the 5700 will well be superceeded. anyway i think the s7000 is meant to superceed the 602?<br><br>photography is a very expensive hobby. i think u already know that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yeah there is 1 thing i wanna know abt aperatures and long zooms that has been bugging me.<br>someone told me abt having a f/2.8 constant being a plus even at long zoom ( my cam is constant 2.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> which is good as in u will get light even when u are zooming in at great dist and the object is under the shade. so few cameras have this constant 2.8 thingy. so when pictures are taken, pics will turn out dark because the aperature will become small.<br><br>my point is,if i can select the aperature, then why is it still a prob ?<br></div>
