This midset is like thinking you can only consume noodles with a  pair of chopsticks when using a fork and with your bare hands still work.<br><br>Anyway i will go for the S5-IS. It can let you take snap shots, and could also be a great camera for intermediate/ prosumers that comes in handy when you are serious about taking better photos.<br><br>When the time comes for you to want to progress further, you may find yourself having to spend thousands just for a good wide angle lens with your SLR.</div>
