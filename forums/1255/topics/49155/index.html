            <div class='col-md body'>Jenny was so happy about the house they had found.<br><br>For once in her life it was on the right side of town.<br><br>She unpacked her things with such great ease.<br><br>As she watched her new curtains blow in the breeze.<br><br>How wonderful it was to have her own room.<br><br>School would be starting; she'd have friends over soon.<br><br>There'd be sleep-overs, and parties; she was so happy<br><br>It's just the way she wanted her life to be.<br><br>On the first day of school, everything went great.<br><br>She made new friends and even got a date!<br><br>She thought, "I want to be popular and I'm going to be,<br><br>Because I just got a date with the star of the team!"<br><br>To be known in this school you had to have a clout,<br><br>And dating this guy would sure help her out.<br><br>There was only one problem stopping her fate.<br><br>Her parents had said she was too young to date.<br><br>"Well, I just won't tell them the entire truth.<br><br>They won't know the difference; what's there to lose?"<br><br>Jenny asked to stay with her friends that night.<br><br>Her parents frowned but said, "All right."<br><br>Excited, she got ready for the big event<br><br>But as she rushed around like she had no sense,<br><br>She began to feel guilty about all the lies,<br><br>But what's a pizza, a party, and a moonlight ride?<br><br>Well the pizza was good, and the party was great,<br><br>But the moonlight ride would have to wait.<br><br>For Jeff was half drunk by this time.<br><br>She felt someone remove her from the twisted rubble,<br><br>And heard, call an ambulance!<br><br>These kids are in trouble!<br><br>Voices she heard...a few words at best.<br><br>But she knew there were two cars<br><br>involved in the wreck.<br><br>Then wondered to herself if Jeff was all right,<br><br>And if the people in the other car was alive.<br><br>She awoke in the hospital to faces so sad.<br><br>"You've been in a wreck and it looks pretty bad."<br><br>These voices echoed inside her head,<br><br>As they gently told her that Jeff was dead.<br><br>They said "Jenny, we've done all we can do.<br><br>But it looks as if we'll lose you too."<br><br>"But the people in the other car!? "Jenny cried.<br><br>"We're sorry, Jenny, they also died."<br><br>Jenny prayed, "God, forgive me for what I've done<br><br>I only wanted to have just one night of fun."<br><br>"Tell those people's family, I've made their lives dim,<br><br>And wish I could return their families to them."<br><br>"Tell Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied,<br><br>And that it's my fault so many have died.<br><br>Oh, nurse, won't you please tell them that for me?"<br><br>The nurse just stood there-she never agreed.<br><br>But took Jenny's hand with tears in her eyes.<br><br>And a few moments later Jenny died.<br><br>A man asked the nurse,<br><br>"Why didn't you do your best?"<br><br>To bid that girl her one last request?"<br><br>She looked at the man with eyes so sad.<br><br>"Because the people in the other car<br><br>were her mom and dad."<br><br>This story is sad and unpleasant but true,<br><br>So young people take heed, it could have been you.<br><br>READ AND PASS ON<br>TO AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE<br><br>Please listen to<br>this angel's request......<br><br>If you do the small favor she<br>asks to come true,<br><br>She will be sent down to guard<br>and protect you.<br><br>Please....do it for Jenny.<br><br>Send ten copies and see what<br>happens in four days.<br><br>You will<br>get a surprise.<br><br>This is true, even if you are<br>not superstitious.<br><br>Good luck, but please<br>remember: 10 copies of this message<br><br>must leave your hands in 24<br>hours.................................<br><img src="http://www.whoohoo.net/images/princess.gif"></div>
