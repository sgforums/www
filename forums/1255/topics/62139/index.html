            <div class='col-md body'>A day in the life of Parka-san<br><br>I think this was the first time I woke up this early this year.<br><br>6am.<br><br>No. Maybe it was the other time during ROD. But anyway it doesn't really matter.<br><br>6.42am. I put my foot out and closed the main door.<br><br>6.52am. I thought it used to take me 8 minutes or less to get to the MRT station.<br><br>7.02am. Was at Jurong East Station squeezing with the crowd.<br><br>8.02am. I spent the whole trip looking at the law of economics at work on the train before I could get myself a seat.<br><br>8.10am. Luckily the MRT station is directly underneath Terminal 2. The sky train just takes too much time.<br><br>8.15am. I wonder what I ate in the morning. Anyway, I think they have a cleaner for every toilet. Finding a drop of water on the ground isn't an easy task.<br><br>8.25am. Decided to proceed to the 4th floor. Saw a couple of guys and gals who are like me, going to do their attachment here at CAAS.<br><br>9.00am. I believe we waited in the wrong room for too long.<br><br>9.05am. After being lead to the correct room, we were being brief with a long briefing by the almightly supervisor.<br><br>10.00am. Work started. Or should I say "orientation" started.  Then there was the usual here-what-we-do-here-and-here's-what-you're-going-to-do welcome session by my colleague.<br><br>11.00am. Yes. I know that welcome session is too long. As I found out, my first task was actually to call up companies asking if they have any innovation rooms. It's for the "Blender". Don't ask me what that is.<br><br>1.00pm. After numerous calls, with some success as indicated by ink on the paper, it was lunch time. Went to the canteen there with the other attachment students from Ngee Ann.<br><br>2.05pm. The lunch break was suppose to end 5 minutes eariler.<br><br>4.45pm. After more calls and even more voice mail messages, which I hung up on, I was finally told of my purpose here. It was to re-do the webpage aptly named "Current Staff Page", or was it some other name I can't remember. Anyway, that should be the simple part. The challenging part would be to come up with a electronic version of a management test of which I was handed a copy of, luckily to read and not do. I need dreamweaver and I seriously need to read that book "e-learning with dreamweaver"<br><br>5.00pm. I always thought that the introduction of the current staff should be held earlier. Hmmmm......Looks like there's no evil HR manager Catbert among the 26 people in the HR department.<br><br>5.35pm. Man. I knocked off after clocking 5 minutes of OT which I wouldn't be able to claim.<br><br>5.50pm. The train was slow. And I had to see the law of economics at work again from Tanah Merah to Bukit Gombak.<br><br>7.10pm. It was raining, but not on the east side.<br><br>7.20pm. I was having dinner when Ah Bee called me saying that I tricked him into going to West Mall at 7pm when the movie is only going to start at 8.45pm.<br><br>11.08pm. $6.50, 2 hours 9 minutes of shivering and a "Matrix Revolutions" later, I starting thinking on how the Waichowski Brothers can improve on the plot. They can't. We should all forgive them. Remember that they brought us "The Matrix" which is in the #33 movie on the "Top 250 movies" list on imdb.com<br><br>11.20pm. Thanksh Ah bee for the ride home.<br><br>11.35pm. Just reading the time of the clock at the taskbar.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Thought I would forget the arrow eh?
