            <div class='col-md body'>In DevilÂ’s Own, Simon was sipping his Vodka Lime. It was Saturday and the club had a full house. Simon was elated to see that. Suddenly a lady with long luscious hair wearing a short skirt and a toga top walked pass him and sat down at the bar counter. Her beauty and elegance stunned the bartender on duty. All the men around her were taken aback by this ladyÂ’s aura. SheÂ’s no other then Violet, the young lady who tried to seduce Reynar. When sheÂ’s ordering her drink, Simon strode over and signaled to the bartender that the drink is on him. She turned around and faced Simon. Giving her best smile, she said, Â“Thanks.Â” Seeing SimonÂ’s good looks and great body, she started to play her game.<br><br>Â“Hi, IÂ’m Simon, the general Manager here,Â” offering his hand to the temptress. Â“NameÂ’s Violet, nice meeting you,Â” She replied with her seductive lips. Â“Why not I get us seats that are much quieter so that we can chat?Â” Simon offered, wanting so much to know this lady, thus abusing his authority. She nodded and followed Simon to the wine bar on the second level. He led her to a corner seat with plush sofas and ordered wine for them. They clicked on pretty fast, and fell prey to each otherÂ’s games.<br><br>Oblivious to Van, Simon was a player in love and mind games. The more he finds Van interesting, the more he wanted her. The same goes for Violet, however she was not able to get hold of Reynar, sheÂ’s glad that Simon fell prey to her. Unknown to both of them, both players are good in the game.<br><br>Back in VanÂ’s office the next morning, Ramie, her superior came knocking on her door. She was told to come up with her follow up publicity and event for the launch of DevilÂ’s Own. The management of the club was very satisfied with the launch and signed a 0ne year contract of events and publicity with the company, and demands Van to be solely in charge. It sounded like a promotion for Van and she was indeed overjoyed. She thanked Ramie. Â“Do your best, and IÂ’ll see that this year end, your bonus would be tripled, maybe a promotion as well.Â” Ramie encouraged and left.<br><br>Van immediately called Reynar on his mobile and told him of the great news. However Reynar did not sound happy, in fact he seemed to be troubled over some matters. Â“WhatÂ’s wrong, darling?Â” Van asked with concern. Â“Nothing, weÂ’ll talk tonight when we get home ok?Â” Reynar replied.<br><br>Reynar was summoned to his superiorÂ’s office in the midst of training his platoon. He was given a letter to relocate him to AustraliaÂ’s camp and to leave in 2 weeks time. The duration of stay would be one and a half years. He canÂ’t think of a way to reject that without breaching his bond and he didnÂ’t want to leave Van alone. However his superior had given him 1 week leave for every 3 months of stay in Australia, meaning he can fly back to visit his wife and family. He wonders how Van would react to his relocation.<br><br>When he got home, Van was lying on their living room couch flipping through a fashion magazine. Â“YouÂ’re home! Shall we go out for dinner?Â” Van asked excitedly. Â“Before I answer that, I need to talk to you about my work.Â” Reynar said, bracing for himself for Van to vent her temper. Â“What happen?Â” Van asked. Reynar told her about his relocation in 2 weeks and his duration of stay and that he could come back once every 3 months, surprisingly Van did not vent her temper, but was visibly very upset.<br><br>Â“I canÂ’t say anything, because you signed on a contract with them, and you have to go,Â” Van reasoned, Â“but IÂ’ll miss you, and IÂ’m trying hard to be understanding.Â” Â“I know you are, and IÂ’ll miss you too,Â” Reynar consoled, Â“why not we go out for a nice dinner tonight to celebrate for you?Â” She declined and suggested ordering pizza instead.  They spent quiet times together that night, cuddling on the couch, watching their favorite movies and chatting till late at night.<br><br>For the next two weeks, Van brought home her work to be done and called Joshua and Mel to pop over when necessary. She wanted to spend more time with her husband and seek her companyÂ’s understanding. Her wishes were granted. Reynar also did his part by taking 1 week of leave to accompany his wife before leaving for Australia.<br><br>The day for Reynar to fly to Australia came and Van did not want to send him off, just in case she couldnÂ’t bear it and break down. Reynar fully understand and did not blame her. Â“IÂ’ll ring you when I get to the base. DonÂ’t worry for me. You must take good care of yourself. Three months later, I want to see you either the same or have gain weight ok?Â” Reynar said, hugging her tightly and kissing her on the lips. Â“Yes, IÂ’ll be the same when you come back. I canÂ’t wait for the day.Â” She said, fighting back her tears.<br><br>After Reynar left, she decided to cheer up because she knew that he will be back very soon. That he could take good care of himself. About 4 hours later, Reynar called to say he had reached the camp. Van told him to take care and that she already missed him. A while later, the conversation ended.<br><br>From there on, she buries herself into the upcoming follow up event for DevilÂ’s Own. She called Joshua and Mel to come over to her place to do some brainstorming.<br><br>The doorbell rang about 1 hour later. Â“WhereÂ’s Reynar?Â” Mel asked. Â“He flew to Australia this morning, relocation by the army.Â” Van replied sadly. Â“Are you ok?Â” Joshua asked with a concerned look and placed his arm around VanÂ’s shoulders. Â“IÂ’m fine. DonÂ’t worry. WeÂ’ve been through other shit as well; this is not pulling me down.Â” She smiled, recapping on how ReynarÂ’s parents disapprove of their relationship before, how his parents accepted her and how they finally got married.<br><br>They sat in the dining room. The table full with files, rough work, and stationery. After much brainstorming, they decided to take a rest from all of it. Â“Shall we get some dinner and hit the clubs tonight before we crack our brains again?Â” Joshua suggested. It was decided. They headed down to a cafÃ© and grab some dinner and Mel suggested going to DevilÂ’s Own.<br><br>It was quite crowded when the time was only ten. The publicity for the club had shown its prowess. As Joshua and Mel hit the dance floor, Van went to the wine bar on the second level. She took a seat near the windows overlooking some apartments and a nice view of the skyscrapers. The waiter came to take her order. She placed her order and enjoyed the ambience. It was a nice place as not many people come to the second level of DevilÂ’s Own. The jazz music really soothes her out and momentarily she forgets about work and that Reynar is away. Then her mobile phone rang. Â“Hello, whoÂ’s this?Â” Van asked. Â“This is Simon, why are you sitting there alone? Can I come over to join you?Â” He asked. She looked up and saw Simon across the bar. Van signaled him over and they started a conversation. Not long after, Joshua and Mel came up to take a rest, and the foursome talk about the follow up event for a while. It was about 1am when Joshua and Mel decided to leave. Van suggested sending them home, but they declined.<br><br>Simon and Van carried on their careless chatter. Amidst the chattering, Simon was trying to know Van better so that he can plan his game. He knew how much Reynar trusted Van and vice versa and he got to know her background pretty well soon. Â“Goodness me, why am I telling all this to you?Â” Van suddenly realized. Â“ItÂ’s ok. We are friends, arenÂ’t we?Â” Simon asked. She smiled and was glad to be friends with him. Simon also revealed part of his life to her, some lies and some truth. A good impression was created and Simon knew that it wouldnÂ’t be easy to tempt Van. But the fact that Reynar would not be by her side for 1 and a half year proves to be of advantage to him.<br><br>Van decided to go home at about 3am and Simon suggested going for a ride and supper. Since it is the weekend and ReynarÂ’s not home, she agreed. They took SimonÂ’s Lexus to the seaside and on the way got some supper.<br><br>They sat in the car eating and listening to jazz. Afraid to scare off Van, after the supper and a brief stroll on the beach, he drove Van to collect her car and went home individually. Â“HeÂ’s actually a nice man, and sincere about making friends.Â” Van said to herself. She had actually enjoyed the night with Simon.<br><br>However SimonÂ’s night was far from over, he called Violet and went to her place for a rendezvous. While they were in bed, his mind kept thinking about Van and momentarily he pictured Violet as Van. Violet is good in bed, knowing how to satisfy her man. Staying alone in a private apartment enables her to bring her prey home. However no man had satisfied her like Simon had, making her want him again and again. He was lying on her bed thinking about Van. The woman next to him, knew nothing about it, and didnÂ’t have the intention to know. Furthermore she has her fair share of fun with other men.<br><br>At home, tossing and turning in bed, without Reynar by her side, she felt weird. She decided to take some milk and watch movies till she falls asleep. It was dawn when she fell into slumber.<br><br>A few hours later, the doorbell rang. It was Mel. He even bought lunch for them. Â“YouÂ’re still sleeping?Â” Mel asked surprised. Â“No, I couldnÂ’t sleep last night. Sorry. Come on in.Â” She said, rubbing her eyes. A short while later, Joshua came.<br><br>They plan the publicity and advertising for DevilÂ’s Own and decided the promotion should be 1month long. After which, they will liaise with the management of DevilÂ’s Own to do their marketing and promotions for them. It was decided.<br><br>They worked for another 3 to 4 hours and left. Leaving Van alone at home again. She tried to call Reynar on his mobile, but to no avail. She left a message in his voice mailbox, saying she missed him and wanted him to call back.<br><br>Reynar was on outfield training and there was no reception on his mobile phone. When he got back to his bunk, he received the message and immediately called his wife. Â“Hello, itÂ’s me. I missed you too.Â” Reynar said. Â“Darling! IÂ’ve been waiting for your call.Â” Van said sadly. Â“I know, we have to get through this. Why not on every Sunday, we shall see each other using web camera?Â” He suggested happily. Â“ItÂ’s a deal.Â” She joyously replied. They chatted over an hour on their daily happenings, however Van left out the part about Simon, and it was time for them to hang up.<br><br>Van then decided to go shopping and went to take a shower. During the shower, her mobile phone rang. She quickly rushed out with a towel wrapped around, and answered the call. It was Simon. He called to ask her out for dinner. She agreed and told him that she will meet up with him in the Italian restaurant in town at 7pm.<br><br>Wearing a white sundress and white sandals with her long hair tied in a ponytail; she looked every bit an innocent student. She walked into the restaurant with quite a handful of shopping bags in one hand and her small Gucci bag in another. Simon was already at the table when she arrived. He waved at her and the waiter led her to the table. Simon then helped her with her shopping bags and got her seated. Clad in beige cotton shirt and khakis pants, he looked pretty laid back.<br><br>The waiter brought her a glass of water and asked for their orders. Â“IÂ’ll have the seafood spaghetti, a soup of the day and an orange juice.Â” Van told the waiter. Then SImon placed his order. They talked about the upcoming events in DevilÂ’s Own and about music. It was then Simon suggested Van going to his place to view his collection of jazz music. Â“I donÂ’t think itÂ’s a nice idea, although we known each other as friends for like a week?Â” Van tactfully declined. SheÂ’s not going to be unfaithful to Reynar, even though itÂ’s just enjoying her favorite music. She didn't want to mislead Simon that she's interested in him. She just purely wanted to be friends<br><br>Simon could sense that he needs to put in more effort in going after Van. Although he knew that heÂ’s just playing a game, deep down in his heart, he knew that this girl is totally different and he did liked her. Â“Ok, I wonÂ’t insist. But at least let me send you home?Â” Van nodded, and said jokingly, Â“When I know that IÂ’m meeting you for dinner, I decided not to drive my car, so that you can be my chauffeur for tonight.Â” She giggles. At least, she loosens up a little with the fact that ReynarÂ’s been away for about a week.<br></div>
