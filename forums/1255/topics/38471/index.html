            <div class='col-md body'>The Saturday night was a boring one for Kim. He had lived a life of misery, and the life that he lead, had make him independence. In fact, too independent. His family bounded his freedom when he was 13, the age when all his other friends are having the happiest moment of their life. He was forbid to go out at night, he was forbid to chat on the phone for more than 5 minutes, regardless itÂ’s a boy or girl, he was forbid to had a thinking of his own. For he only do what his parent wanted him to.<br><br>Finally, on his 15th birthday, he made a promise to himself. He would fight for freedom, and break free from the chain that entangles him. He wanted a free live, no one to bother him, no one to let him bother. Therefore, he went about doing it his ways. He stayed out late, with friends, chatting. He skips classes, just to go window-shopping, alone. He ignore all warning from his parents, he do not care a damn about them. The resentment slowly builds up as his parents tried to tied him down again. However, it was not long after that, his parent realized that there is no point in grounding him anymore, as he is already 16.<br><br>This was the time when he got to know a girl, named Yvonne, through his friends. They held on fast, and chat on the phone every night, before they went to bed. And it was the first time that someone ever said that he was not that bad looking. For Kim, this is more than a compliment.<br><br>Yvonne was the girl-next-door type who will make heads turn. She is not pretty, but she had in her a kind of feminine touch that would make any guy want to protect her. And Kim could not escape this enchantment too. Two weeks after they knew each other, Kim gather the courage to pop out this question that is for Yvonne.<br><br>Â“ I guessÂ…ermÂ…I kinda like yaÂ…Â”<br><br>The phone at the other side was dead quiet.<br><br>Â“ I was wondering if Â…wellÂ…u would accept me more than just a friend.Â” Kim continues.<br><br>Yvonne pauses for a moment, and replied Â“ But IÂ’m really busy, I guess I donÂ’t really have the time to commit in a relationshipÂ…reallyÂ…Â”<br><br>The truth is that she is afraid, due to her pass romance, which her previous boyfriend went steady with her just to win a bet with his friends.<br><br>Kim, on hearing such reply, do not know what to say anymoreÂ…. it is his first time after all. Â“ Oh well, I understand. I guess IÂ’m tiredÂ…good night.Â”<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>.....to be continue</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And that particular Â‘good nightÂ’ lasted for 6 whole months. He kept himself busy working, day and night, just to put the thought of Yvonne off his mind. But the more he told himself to forget her, the more he think of the time they had together, although is was a short 2 weeks. Than one afternoon, while he was working, he felt very lonely, for the first time in his 6 months.<br><br>He browses through his cellphone, as he was having his lunch and came across YvonneÂ’s number. Never before had he felt this kind of loneliness during the past few time he saw her number. Never before his heart felt that aching painÂ…gasping for breathe. Kim, than know, deep down in his heart, that perhaps he should call her, just to see how she gets on with her life.<br><br>Kim, dropped a 10 cent coin into the public phoneÂ…and dial the number, which after 6 months, still remain so fresh in his mind. It rang, and rangÂ…no one pick up. Disappointed, he hung the phone. Dozen of excuses sprang to his mind: maybe I dial the wrong numberÂ…maybe she changed her numberÂ…maybeÂ… He dial a second timeÂ…this time hoping and praying that someone, anyone would pick up the phone. Seems like God had heard his prayerÂ…and it was a female voice over the other end.<br><br>Â“ WhoÂ’s that? Yvonne here.Â”<br><br>Â“ Erm, hi, Kim here, do you remember me still?Â”<br><br>Â“ Oh Kim, yeahÂ…yeah I do remember you. Of course I do. So how are you doing now?Â”<br><br>Â“ Well, IÂ’m working right nowÂ…can I talk to you tonight?Â”<br><br>It was a feeling that is almost indescribable by words. Yet, there was so much to say, after 6 months of non-contact between Kim and Yvonne. Kim found out that Yvonne is still single, despite the number of suitors she had. And Yvonne realized that Kim had failed his Â‘OÂ’ level, and is now waiting to get a place in an ITE, hopefully. They talk and talk, until daybreak when the first peep of the sun shines through the grayish cloud. They had arranged to meet up on Saturday, and Kim is looking very much forward to it. So does Yvonne.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saturday came, finally. 2 days wait was like 2 lifetimes for Kim. And he wonders if itÂ’s the same for Yvonne. He was pacing back and forth at the City Hall MRTÂ’s control station. He was nervous and, at the same time, smiling to himself.<br><br>It was at this moment when he notices a girl walking gracefully towards him. She worn a short sleeve shirt and a black skirt, tightly wrap around her hips and thighs. She had her shoulder long hair clipped back, and had applied light make-up. Somehow, she looks womanly, also desirable.<br><br>Â“ Hi Kim,Â” Yvonne greeted him with a smile, so sweet that it nearly make his heart melt. Â“ You looked soÂ…stuntÂ…hahaÂ…so unlike you.Â”<br><br>Â“ ErmÂ…you look great today, and if I am a girl, I would have gone unnoticed walking beside you.Â”<br>Â“ Thanks, I take that as a compliment than.Â”<br><br>Â“ Well, THAT is a complement. Haha.Â”<br><br>They had their lunch at Broadway, a buffet style restaurant, tucked neatly at the corner of the shopping arcade, known only to the regulars. As they eat, they chat about the past, how they knew each other and most importantly, the reason behind KimÂ’s disappearance for 6 months. The day slip by in a glance and than it was 6pm.<br><br>Â“ Guess its time to have dinner ya?Â” Kim enquired jokily<br><br>Â“ But we just finish our lunch, haha. Only you can make me laugh.Â”<br><br>These words had caught Kim unguarded. Â“ Erm, well, how about a movie than? My treat, for your compliment.Â”<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The show was not a very exciting one. It was about how a women who had lost 2 of her dearest men in life during war picking up the pieces again. It was somewhat sad. And it had managed to make tears welled up in YvonneÂ’s eyes, making them glistering in the cinema. It was this time when Kim realized how fragile she is, and had the sudden urge of wanting to hug her, protect her. Slowly, he placed his arm just above YvonneÂ’s seat, to stimulate it over her shoulder. It was somewhat stupid but it was a courageous move for him. At this moment, when the explosion of a bomb goes off in the movie, Yvonne jerked towards KimÂ’s direction and she was unknowingly in his arm. Her face was apple red, but she felt that this little gesture had made her complete, for that moment. She realized what she had missed out in her life, all this while.<br><br>The crowds disperse as the credits of the movie started to creep onto the screen. They sit there, enjoying each moment. Kim could smell the faint shampoo fragrance in her hair, and his JPG perfume flood YvonneÂ’s nostrils. None of them dares to make the first move to end this moment.<br><br>Â“ IÂ’ll sent u home, itÂ’s late.Â” Kim suggested.<br><br>Â“ Oh, okay, anyhow I thought I only stay a few block away from you huh. Hehe.Â” She let out a girlish giggle.<br><br>Â“ And IÂ’ll call you when IÂ’m home too.Â”<br><br>The journey on the bus was quiet, both too shy to talk anymore. Yvonne merely just stare out of the window, thinking about how it would be wonderful if Kim would put his arm around her now, again. It never happens.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kim had made the effort to walk her to her doorstep. Both were panting slightly, from all the walking. Yvonne passes a piece of tissue over to Kim, as he was sweating faintly on his forehead. The air-con inside her house rushes out to greet them as the door pushed open.<br><br>Â“ Wanna come in?Â” Yvonne invited.<br><br>Â“ Erm, I donÂ’t think its appropriate, your family should be asleep by now andÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“ And they are not in Singapore.Â” She interrupted, as if really hoping that he would at least stay for a cup of coffee. Â“ They went on a holiday at Thailand. And, they are asleep by now, in Thailand.Â”<br><br>Â“ Well, I guess not. Its late, and I donÂ’t really intend to take midnight cab home. IÂ’ll call u when I reach home, k?Â”<br><br>Â“ The choice is yours than. Be careful, and bye.Â”<br><br>Kim was walking alone, enjoying the breeze and the moonlight that shone upon the trees. The shadows of the branches and leaves dance on the ground. He was enjoying every moment, from the first time he met Yvonne, till now.<br><br>Finally, he was home. The clock struck 12 as he went into his room. The room was small, but neat, for a guy. It had a desk, fully occupied with his hi-fi set, table fan, rows of books and a photograph. A photograph of Yvonne, which she had, gave him 6 months ago. He let himself down on the bed, staring at the ceiling. Somehow, a thought came into his mind. What if she was here to share this room with him, and to share this bed with him right now? And on the thought of it, he gather enough guts to ask the question, the question that he had ask 6 months ago.<br><br>The phone rang and Yvonne picked it up hurriedly, knowing that it was Kim. She was starting to get worried as she had waited slightly more than an hour. There is no reason that Kim took so long to get home, not knowing that he walked home.<br><br>Â“ Yvonne, do you still remembers the thing I asked you 6 months ago.Â”<br><br>Â“ Would you mind to refresh me abit?Â” She knew what he means, just that she find it fun, just to tease him.<br><br>Â“ ErmÂ…oh well, I guess I still had feelings for you, after so many months. I hope you would give me a chance, to take care of you.Â”<br><br>These are what Yvonne had wanted to hear all these while, after she regretted rejecting Kim months ago. Â“ I donÂ’t really have much time for my boyfriend if I happen to have oneÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“ IÂ’m not the possessive type. We both love freedom, donÂ’t we.Â”<br><br>Â“ And I always put my friends before my boyfriend, you know that?Â”<br><br>Â“ I guess its okay with me. ShouldnÂ’t be a problem here.Â”<br><br>Â“ Than, IÂ’ll guess this relationship would worth a try.Â” She finally agreed.<br><br>This Â‘yesÂ’ from her had made his heartbeat pumping faster and faster. It was like jumping off a building and survives. It was as if a prayer answered. And deep in his heart, he promise himself that he would love and treasure her, from tonight onwards.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span>[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the next few days, he shown care and concern towards Yvonne, and he felt that there is no one in the world that is worth him doing these. He listen to her grumble about studies, and rejoice when she break a good news to him. He had become part of her life, and hers became part of his too. They had planned for a getaway in a resort out of busy lifestyle of Singapore this weekend, to Bali.<br><br>At Bali, the sun was always hiding behind the cloud. It always rain in the night and had in the island a very natural air-conditional effect. They had rented this little shag, constructed tastefully from logs of timbers. It comes with a fireplace, a few couches, and a very romantic ambience. This was the time that Kim felt so alone with the other sex. And this was the time that Yvonne felt so loved all these years. They drank cheap beers and cuddle each other to sleep. At times, Kim would whisper sweet nothings into her ears. At times, they would tickle each other to the floor and end up kissing. But they never went beyond the line of taking off their clothes. Yvonne does not allow him to either. The weekend pass by so fast that it was time for them to face the harsh reality back in Singapore again.<br><br>On the flight back, Yvonne asked Kim. Â“ Do you think IÂ’m worth it, all your concern, your time, your patience and your love?Â”<br><br>Â“ Of course you are worth it. No one else does. And no one else wonÂ’t either.Â”<br><br>Â“ I really had a great time this weekend. Thanks.Â”<br><br>Â“ Well, we could always plan another getaway next week.Â” Kim replied with a smile.<br><br>The following Thursday, Kim had planned for a fishing trip. However, the plan was disrupted by a sudden long distance call from Thailand. YvonneÂ’s parents were involved in an accident, so serious that they might just die any minute. Yvonne was dumbfounded when she heard the news. She was in a frisky, not knowing what to do. Kim came into his mind in her first thought. Over the phone, she was crying hard, she was crying her heart out. She knew she had lost both her parents, in a foreign land. And there was nothing much she could do here, except for the body to be cemented when its flown over to Singapore.<br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>...to be continue</span></span></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It was dead quiet at the wake. Yvonne had cried till she can shed no more tears. Kim was heartbroken every time he saw her in this state. He wanted to comfort her, but donÂ’t know how to go about it. He just cried with her, tried to share the pain with her. Friends and relatives came by and send their condolences, but none would soothe the pain inside her. The pain that engulf her will for staying alive. She had no one else now, except Kim. Apart from the pain she is going through, there is also much uncertainly about her future. She feared for the future. She only had with her a decent sum of money that was the only thing left behind by her parents. Surviving is going to be hard.<br><br>Yvonne had allowed time to heal her wound gently, for the pass few months. And she would not have done it without KimÂ’s support for her. He was always there for her. Kim had already forsaken his studies in ITE to work, to support Yvonne, financially. He had moved over to YvonneÂ’s place since last month, and had fallen out with his own family. But Kim couldnÂ’t care less.<br><br>One evening as they were having dinner, Yvonne said something that is very disturbing for Kim. Â“ Guess like IÂ’ll be forever indebted to you.Â”<br><br>Â“ Why did u say that? I just merely did what I should do, as a boyfriend.Â”<br><br>Â“ You are too good for a boyfriend. I felt that I am somewhat like a burden. You gave up your studies for me. And even your family too. Sometimes I wonder, am I worth it all.Â”<br><br>Â“ Of course you are worth it, silly. What make you ask these questions?Â” Kim went up to her, hugged her around her shoulder from behind, and inhales the fragrance of her hair, deeply.<br><br>Â“ What ifÂ…. what if I left you one dayÂ…Â” and she left it hanging in the air.<br><br>Upon hearing this, the smile on KimÂ’s face faded. He released those arms, and took his plates to the kitchen. Deep down, he knew that their passions had somehow lessened. It had become somewhat a habit to provide for Yvonne. The relationship is just like a habit, a routine that needs to be done everyday. But that does not means that love had subsided between them. However, if it continues this way, love might be replaced by the guiltiness of Yvonne. The guilt that Kim keeps providing while she is always the receiving end. She can do nothing. She is still studying, and all the burdens of the two of them is shouldered by Kim alone. And Yvonne knew that she own him a lot. So much that she knew that there is no way to repay him, and she had choose to run away from it all. She felt so useless, wanted to run away from everything, and yet she could not do without Kim.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She still loves him, as much as she needed him.<br><br>That particular night, while they were getting ready to sleep, Kim decided to pursue the issue that Yvonne had started. Â“ Why did u said such things just now? It kinda hurts.Â”<br><br>Â“ I understandÂ…butÂ…itÂ’s not what you really think it isÂ…I wanted to study oversea after I completed here. I hope that u can support me. I had do some read-up, and IÂ’ve decided to go for Australia.Â”<br><br>Â“ Than what about me? IÂ’ll be alone here, without you by my side, my life would be like a puppetÂ’s. Meaningless!!Â”<br><br>Â“ I knew you could now take it, for I just canÂ’t put my future on the line just because of our relationship, can I? Please understand Kim, for the better of our relationship. And its only 2 years, IÂ’ll drop by during holidays, you can come visit me too.Â”<br><br>Â“ IÂ’m worriedÂ….Â” Kim frowned. He does not like this idea, but he had no right to stop her from getting a better life, upgrading herself. He wished he can agree to this idea without much thought, but he just couldnÂ’t do it. However, one thing is very clear to him. Yvonne and him both loves freedom, tied anyone of them down, thatÂ’s game over. Â“ When have u decided to go?Â”<br><br>Â“ Coming July.Â” She was almost whispering, as if a sense of guilt struck her.<br><br>Â“ Fine than. If that is your final decision, than so be it. I just wanna let you know that I agree to let you go to Australia, all because I still love you.Â”<br><br>Â“ Thanks Kim!Â” Yvonne rolled over and kissed him gently on his lips. Â“ Good night than.Â”<br><br>Â“ Good night dear.Â” He really hoped he could sleep that night. He couldnÂ’t. He kept thinking about the entire Â‘ifÂ’ and Â‘what ifÂ’, and itÂ’s enough to keep him awake till the next morning. He slept only after Yvonne left for school. He did not go for work that day.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><br>...to be continue</strong></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Months flies by, and it was almost July. The conversation that night had buried deep into his brain. He could remember it word by word. Â‘Coming JulyÂ’, Â‘Coming JulyÂ’, these words kept repeating themselves everyday, until this day. All the while, he had longed for Yvonne to told him that she had forsake her plan to go oversea, but it was just fat hope. She had grown somewhat very determined since her parents death 1 year ago. Now, she is going to Australia for a period of 2 long years, after 2 days.<br><br>Â“ There are five grands in your account. IÂ’ve deposited them this afternoon. Guess its not much but guess itÂ’ll get you settle down over thereÂ” Despite KimÂ’s reluctance to let her go, he still provide for her this much.<br><br>Â“ Thanks dear. I own you again.Â” She replied, knowing that she could not give him anything back in return.<br><br>Â“ Please donÂ’t say that you own me. Cause I donÂ’t expect you to return me the favors after all. Just know that I did them all out of love for you.Â”<br><br>Â“ I love you too.Â”<br><br>Perhaps the only thing that Yvonne had given him is her virginity. And that night, they made sweet tender love. Kim had never felt that its so good to make love with his beloved before her departure. She was satisfying his every need, and he is not getting enough of it. And they slept in each others embraces.<br><br>The next day, Yvonne was busy packing her clothes. She never knew that she had so many clothes. And more than half of them are brought with KimÂ’s money. She had busied herself with all the packing and stuffing, and when she is done, she is dead tired. Kim came home from work in the evening, with dinner. It was something that Yvonne loves to eat. Roasted chicken with sesame seeds, fried baby squids, sushi and a bottle of red wine.<br><br>Â“ So the plane flies for Australia at 3am huh.Â” Kim said, he appeared to be sad.<br><br>Â“ Yes, and I expected you to see me off.Â”<br><br>Â“ Of course, IÂ’ve taken a day off tomorrow. And after tomorrow, it would not be the same anymore.Â” A tear welled as the thought of him n her house, alone, flashed across his mind.<br><br>Yvonne proceeded to moves her fingers through his hair. Â“ Come on dear. There is web cam, telephone, and online chat too. We can always do that, canÂ’t we.Â”<br><br>Â“ Yes, we can always do thatÂ…Â”<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was as quiet as a graveyard at the airport. The air-con was spooky cold. Only the breathing and footsteps of Kim and Yvonne can be heard echoing through the place. A few homeless old man sleep on the chairs with newspaper, some slipper, as their pillow. The airport in the night is so much different from it is in the day.<br><br>Â“ Time for me to go in.Â” Yvonne finally said something to break the silence when she heard the announcement.<br><br>Â“ You take care there. Give me a call when u touches down. Miss you.Â” These words followed by a hug and a combo of kisses on YvonneÂ’s cheeks, forehead and lips. Â“ I love you to much to see you strained by my side. I hate to see you go too.Â”<br><br>Yvonne was sobbing. She was touched by his gestures and words. He is always so good to her. It made her so special. Â“ Sorry Kim, IÂ’ll call u often. Take care of yourself when IÂ’m not around, will you.Â” She tiptoed and kissed Kim on his lips. Â“ I hate to say this, but, bye.Â”<br><br>Kim did not say anything further. What is needed to be said had been said. He watched through his tears filled eyes, as she walk away further and further, until she went into the gate, and he can see her no more. The trip home was very lonely. The radio in the cab plays only songs of departures and sadness. His heart was heavy, as though a million pound had tied it down. Breathless.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span>[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following day, he had a day off, so he did not went for work, but neither did he take a wink. Kim felt as if he had lost the reason to live. In the past, he had liked to come home, to see Yvonne doing her homework, or housework. Now, the house is just a memory of them. And the more he remained in it. The more forlorn he felt.<br><br>Â“ How are you dear? IÂ’m so happy here; you can stop worrying for me. I had friends to take care of me here and I am not spending much. IÂ’ve found a part-time job as a waitress here, 5 minutes from my school and hostel.Â” Yvonne sound cheerful enough on the other end.<br><br>Â“Oh great. So I can send you less allowances huh.Â” Kim joked.<br><br>Â“ I wouldnÂ’t mind that. Save it more for yourself. Take care.Â” The phone went dead.<br><br>She was obviously enjoying every moment at Australia. And he still struggled with the mixed feelings he had in him since she went away. For 1 year, he had only seen her through the web-cam. She was always smiling away. Kim had suggested to drop by Australia this Christmas, but was rejected by Yvonne. She told him that she would not be free as her exam is just around the corner. Him being there would prove to be too much of a distraction. He buy that.<br><br>He kept himself busy with his work and had saved a decent sum of money, which he had planned for their marriage. The sole reason that kept his hope high and his spirit up. He longed for her return, to be with him again. He longed for the fragrance of her hair, the touch of her silky skin, and her gentle kiss. He longed for the year to pass by.<br><br>Within the 2 years without YvonneÂ’s, Kim had transformed her house into a little heaven, so warm and cozy. Walls in the living room are painted in orange and furnish with matching sofa. Their bedroom is a light blue, with a brand new queen size bed. The tiles of the floor are changed to dark marble. It felt so cooling walking bare footed. All the things are in place, except for YvonneÂ’s present.<br><br>Â“ She would make this home complete.Â” Kim agreed with himself.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally, comes the day when she return from her studies from Australia. He was to meet her at the airport at 6pm in the evening. And he had planned to take her out for a late dinner and a stroll along the beach. For the first time, he shaved, seriously. He put on hairspray and perfume and he really look good.<br><br>Â“ Finally, she is back.Â” Kim took a deep breath and depart for the airport.<br>Upon reaching, he checked to see if there would be any delay of the flight she is supposes to be in.<br><br>Â“SQ 015 had arrived.Â” The loudspeaker wailed.<br><br>Kim was holding a bouquet of white lilies, the flower she like most, in his arms. He worn a black shirt, pressed neatly and a black pants. He always likes black. It was at this moment when he notices a girl, in a blue blouse with flowery pattern, pushing the heavy cart with tons of stuffs on it, walking gracefully towards the entrance. It was like the first time Kim saw Yvonne, and now he is seeing it again.<br><br>Â“ Over here, Yvonne, here.Â” Kim waves fanatically, with the lilies in the air.<br><br>Â“ Oh there you are alright.Â” Yvonne said upon spotted him.<br><br>Kim helped her with all the stuff she was carrying with her, onto the taxi, which was waiting outside the lobby. And they left for home.<br><br>Â“ Well dear, do u missed me.Â” Yvonne knew he did. Â“ Been 2 whole years since you saw me face to face ya? Haha.Â”<br><br>Â“ And I hope the wait was worthwhile. Wait till you see your house, our house.Â”<br><br>Â“ What have you done to it? ItÂ’s so beautiful!Â” Exclaimed Yvonne, as she stepped into the living room painted in orange. She was whirling in circle as she looked around the house. Her blouse floating along. Â“ Woah woah woah! Look at that!Â” Pointed to the rows of cute stuff toys.<br><br>Â“ All for you. 24 of them in total. Signified the numbers of months IÂ’ve waited for you patiently, as thought sitting there with them.Â”<br><br>This time round, Yvonne was more touched than the time she parted at the airport. She had never felt so welcome in her own house. With tears rolling down her cheeks, she hugged Kim with all her might and cried.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That night, they had a romantic dinner at the FishermanÂ’s Village. It was a moonless night, with only the stars to lit the sky. So many of them, outshining one another. The Sound of waves breaking against the rocks and creeping up the beaches is as soothing as the breeze itself. The candle flame flickered on their table, dancing as if itÂ’s the central of attraction.<br><br>Dinner was BBQ stingray in samba sauce, top shells, crabs, fruits salads and hooch. The clock struck 12 and the DJ peppered the atmosphere with some really romantic songs. Kim had dedicated the song Â‘ Just another dayÂ’ by Jon Secada earlier on and it almost made Yvonne cried again.<br><br>Â“ No you donÂ’t, or the make up would be ruined.Â” Kim said as he saw tears welled in YvonneÂ’s eyes.<br><br>She just smiles, not knowing what to say. Than comes the next song, Â‘Damn I wish I was your loverÂ’ by Sophie B. Hawkins. Kim took out a small metal container shaped like a shell, and opened it. Inside, was a diamond ring, small but carefully designed and crafted. Yvonne grasped when she saw the ring, which glitter as the candle flame shined on it.<br><br>Â“ For me?Â” She asked.<br><br>Â“ Not without a price.Â” Kim smiled. His eyes locked with hers.<br><br>Â“ And whatÂ’s the price to pay huh?Â” Yvonne joked.<br><br>Â“ Your marriage, in return for this ring.Â”<br><br>Â“ So IÂ’m worth only this ring huh.Â”<br><br>Â“ ItÂ’s kinda small, but, its my best offer.Â”<br><br>Â“ Well, so be it than.Â” Yvonne took the ring from Kim and tried to put it on. Â“ Deal.Â”<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>...to be continue again tml</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That night, Kim made love to Yvonne, once again, after 2 long years. Its seems that the passion that had build up for the past 2 years had finally come for a release. He was thrusting himself away as Yvonne dug her fingernails into his back. When its over, Kim asked, Â“ How was it?Â”<br><br>Â“ How was what? Do u mean the marriage or the ring or the session huh?Â” She replied seductively. Â“ Well, the ring fix nicely, the session was great Â– I never knew you to be so rough. Marriage had to wait.Â”<br><br>Â“ Wait? But why? I have the money to marry you now, you know.Â” He was abit disappointed upon hearing her remarks.<br><br>Â“ I know you have enough of it, but what will happen when we used it all up on marriage? We gotto plan further right dear? IÂ’ll get a job first, k. ItÂ’s not like I will run awayÂ…haha.Â”<br><br>Â“ Oh well, what can I say.Â” Kim shrugged.<br><br>For the following weeks, Yvonne was looking hard for a decent job. Kim might think that she is too demanding and her expectation is too high. But Yvonne felt that with her qualifications, she could get a better offer. Weeks become months and Yvonne was still unemployed. She had gone for dozen interviews and sent in more dozens of applications but none is successfully.<br><br>A lot of companies are in fact waiting for her to agree, but Â“ the pay was peanutÂ” she said. And the Â‘peanutÂ’ pay she refers to is what Kim is almost earning now. And it was this kind of Â‘peanutÂ’ pay that is supplying for both of them all this while.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was 3 months later when she finally found a job of her choice. It was a HR managing post in a 5 stars hotel, located in the city. She was generously offered 3 times the sum of what Kim is bringing home every month. Of course, Kim was happy for her. Kim would always be happy when she is happy.<br><br>It was a Monday when she started work, there is no blues for her. Yvonne was all exciting about it. The office was not very big, about the size of a basketball court. She reached there Â½ an hour earlier than the expected time and was shown her place by one of her colleague. It is tucked away at a corner, and not very spotting. The stationeries were placed neatly at the cornet of the table, beside it was a LCD-screen PC and a personal phone. Keys were inserted in their respective keyholes, on all the drawers and selves.<br><br>Â“ Thanks, I like it very much.Â” Yvonne was obviously grinning. She would not like the idea of being situated in the middle of the whole office.<br><br>Â“ Welcome, IÂ’m Summer, if you need anything just ask me. The coffee machine is over thereÂ” Pointing to a gray box at the other corner of the room, Â“ and this is the keys to the toilet. Staff toilet.Â”<br><br>Summer was a petit girl around 25. She had glossy black hair and tanned brown skin tone. Her face was angel like and so was her voice. Â“ She must be the apple of the menÂ’s eyes here.Â” Yvonne thought. Well, she is. As a matter of fact, Summer had at least 2 suitors from this office and another more from the Finances.<br><br>It was almost 9am, when the rest of the staff flocked in. There was Moon, the computer expert, a athletic-looking lady in her early 30s, whose features does not show her age. And there was Joey, the secretary of the Â‘headÂ’ in this HR department. She was obvious from far because of her dyed-golden hair. She looked proud, and very confident of herself. Of course she is, given her position here. Than there was the boss, Smith, a British, very friendly, especially towards the girls. Yvonne could not help but wonder if he and Joey had a relationship. Lastly, there was Cliff, a handsome man with great body. He stands at least one head above Yvonne, nearly 1.8m in height. His features were sharp, and his voice was deep and hollow.<br><br>All of them had been very friendly towards Yvonne, teaching her the ropes, cracking jokes to make her feel at home and allowed her to participate in their gossips. However, Cliff was the most quiet in the group, perhaps he is the only guy around, excluding Smith, as he is seldom around. He blushed each time he heard the girls talking about sensitive topics and the girls just like to tease him. And every time they do, he just smiled and walk away, with his face almost red. Yvonne found him quiet an interesting guy, and would like to know more about him, as a friend.<br><br>...to be continue<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“ Wanna lunch together, guys?Â” Summer trying to get everyone heard.<br><br>Â“ Well, count me out. IÂ’m having Jap.Â” Joey mumbled from her desk. It was much expected that she might be abit anti social.<br><br>Â“ Wait up for me awhile would you. Finishing this soon.Â” Cried Moon. She had the most files on her desk, compare to none on YvonneÂ’s.<br><br>Cliff was smiling as he turn off his computer, Â“ IÂ’m done, whatÂ’s for lunch? IÂ’m staving!Â”<br><br>Â“ Sure you are,Â” remarked Yvonne, Â“ you eat the most here, if IÂ’m not wrong.Â”<br><br>For a moment, the small office was echoed with giggles from the girls.<br><br>Lunch was relaxing at the hotel build-in cafÃ©. ItÂ’s affordable and away from the food courts elsewhere in the city. Yvonne had a pan-fried fish in sweet and sour sauce. Summer was just having a veggie salad and Moon was having chicken chop with thick fries on her plate, over flowing. Cliff really ate a lot. He had a beefsteak, a thick one, and a very big portion of whipped potato.<br><br>Â“ Guess itÂ’s always the few of us having lunch huh? Seems like Joey donÂ’t join us frequent.Â” Yvonne interrupted all the munching sound that came from Cliff.<br><br>Â“ Right, you are observance hoh. She is quite a nice conversationist but not so socialist. Kinda irony izzit.Â” Moon said as she tucked into her chicken again.<br><br>Â“ She only talk to Cliff here wooh. I think she is a bimbo. A nice one at least.Â” That was so unlike something that comes out from Summer.<br><br>Â“ What me huh.Â” Cliff jumped in self-defended. Â“ So what if she is good looking. DonÂ’t put me with her okay. Why not put me and Yvonne together for a change..haha.Â”<br><br>Yvonne was speechless this time. She regretted starting this topic, as it was backfiring at her. Â“ The food is really nice hereÂ…Â” Trying to make it sound natural.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>...to be continue</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was late evening when Yvonne reached home. Kim was sitting in front of the Tv, asleep. Yvonne guessed that he must be really tired that he did not even bother to turn it off. Kim looked like a baby, with his head tilted to one side, resting on his right shoulder. Yvonne could not help but when forward to kiss him gently on his left cheek. This startled him, and he woke up. He had always been a light sleeper. He looked at Yvonne in the eyes and smiled. On second thought, Yvonne realized that Kim is not actually tired. He is just bored to sleep. She was feeling very bad inside. She knew that she was not able to accompany him during her time in Australia, and now, even when she is back, she could not spent much time with him as well. As if Kim knew what she was thinking in her mind, he held her hands in his palms and stroked them. This is somehow, comforting.<br><br>After a few days in the office, Yvonne was starting to get used to it. There was not much things to learn and Summer was always there to help. As usual, Moon was the busiest among all. Sometimes it seems like the boss, Smith, is giving her these tasks personally. Cliff would always find chance to chat with Yvonne. Once while she was alone at the coffee corner, Cliff stopped by and talked to her. He even invited her to dinner, which she gracefully rejected. Cliff had no idea that she is already attached to Kim, nor did he knew that they were staying together.<br><br>It was a Friday when Summer needed to attend a meeting. And Moon was on MC that day. It only left Yvonne and Cliff, both of them, for lunch. They went to a fast food outlet and ordered some burgers, CliffÂ’s treat.<br><br>Â“ WhatÂ’s that for?Â” Yvonne referred to the lunch treat. Â“ AinÂ’t my birthday today you know?Â”<br><br>Â“ Well, itÂ’s to celebrate the first time we are having lunch together.Â”<br><br>Â“ WhateverÂ…IÂ’m going to get something after this. A gift.Â”<br><br>Â“ Sure.Â” Cliff replied without the need to think.<br><br>They walked along the crowded shopping mall, packed with people from all the nearby offices. It was so crowded that Yvonne had to walk shoulder to shoulder with Cliff. He happened to brushed against her hand a few times and fantasize about holding them in his own. They stopped by CityChain, and went in to look around. Yvonne spotted a black metallic watch with a plain face. The edges of the face were lined with silver stripes. It was a killer. She knew Kim would like it too, as he had always like black and gray. The price was steep and Cliff offered to subsidized a bit by chipping in 50% of the money.<br><br>Â“ ItÂ’s not necessary Cliff, itÂ’s for my boyfriend. Our 4th anniversary.Â” These words fall like an hammer striking upon an anvil, into his heart. He didnÂ’t know she had a boyfriend, 4 years plus.<br><br>Â“ Erm, so you are attached huh. I didnÂ’t notice that.Â”<br><br>Â“ Is there a need to know? Haha, I bet he will love this watch.Â” Yvonne proceeded to pay for her gift for Kim.<br><br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...cumming up soon</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kim had agreed to meet up with Yvonne in an Italian restaurant, couple of minutes walk her workplace, for the anniversary dinner. As Kim came straight from his job, he was all sweaty and dirty. He suggested to Yvonne before that he really need to wash up but she said its alright. If itÂ’s alright for Yvonne, itÂ’s alright for Kim too. He had somewhat managed to clean himself up a bit, and changed into a clean sky blue shirt, which he had brought along with him. He also dropped by the nearby florist to get some fresh lilies, combinations of yellow and white.<br><br>The door swung open as he stepped near the entrance of the restaurant. The smell of breads, spaghettis and pizzas greeted him as he walked in. It was not crowded, and the place was spacious. The whole room was littered with tables and chairs, with waiters stationed at each occupied table. Music flooded the place giving it a relaxing ambiance.<br><br>Â“ Table for 2 please.Â” Kim told the waiter who was standing at the Â‘Please wait to be seatedÂ’ sign.<br><br>Â“ Please follow me sir.Â” He replied politely. From the back, the waiter looks like a penguin with his coat split at the end. The thought made him smile.<br><br>10 more minutes before Yvonne would arrive. He took out a parcel from a paper bag. It was nicely wrapped in tones of pink and red. Inside was a sexy lingerie, red in color with black laces at the sides. It was translucent. Kim would love to see Yvonne in it. He had taken all the trouble to buy this special gift himself, not to mention the prying eyes of the customers and salesgirls. One of them even teased him by asking if it was for himself.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>...cumming up soon</strong></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was only after 15 minutes when Kim noticed Yvonne entering the restaurant. She was in a dark brown dress and a white shirt.<br><br>Â“ IÂ’m looking for someone. He should have a table already.Â” She said to another penguin-like-coat waiter. Â“ There he is, thanks.Â” She dodged the waiter as Kim waved frantically at the far corner of the room.<br><br>Â“ Woh you are late.Â” Exclaimed Kim.<br><br>Â“ Sorry dear, I was helping another colleague with some stuffs.Â” She explained, as she tidied her hair.<br><br>Â“ Well, you own me a kiss than.Â”<br><br>Â“ Guess thatÂ’s fair enough, but not now.Â” She bended closer towards Kim. Â“ Tonight.Â”<br><br>They ordered a bacon and cheese pizza, extra cheese, and some spicy chicken wings. There was also a plate of cabonara topped with fresh mushrooms. Yvonne had ordered an ice blended limejuice while Kim had a nice cup of steaming cafÃ© mocha. They talked about their work and Yvonne keep emphasizing that she liked her current workplace very much.<br><br>It was only after when Kim passed her the gift and flowers. She smiled as she neared her nose at the lilies. Kim remembered that lilies do not really produces any fragrance. He did not understand that one thing about women. Yvonne was shaking the parcel up and down as if by doing so, she could guess what it contained.<br><br>Â“ Can I open it now? Can I can I?Â” She was behaving like a child.<br><br>Kim nodded.<br>Â“ Woah! ItÂ’s so Â…Â” she was obviously speechless, as she held the lingerie up high.<br><br>Â“ Erm, would you mind,Â” pointing at that sexy piece of clothe, Â“ not so showing.Â”<br><br>It was at this moment when someone tapped Yvonne on her shoulder. It was Cliff. He smiled at Kim, somehow knowing that he was her boyfriend, and introduced himself. Kim stood up and exchanged handshakes with Cliff, Yvonne was trying to overcome the sudden shock of seeing Cliff here, so suddenly.<br><br>Â“ Mind if I join you guys? Am I interrupting something here?Â” Cliff asked.<br><br>Â“ Actually, erm Cliff, we had finish our dinner and will be going in a minute.Â” She was tucking away the lingerie back into the parcel.<br><br>Â“ Not even for a chat?Â” He was looking at Kim, as if studying him. Â“ IÂ’m sure your boyfriend would not mind.Â”<br><br>Â“ Well, I guess its okay, so long Yvonne get to catch the soap opera at 8pm.Â” Kim replied.<br><br>Therefore, the three of them sat there. Conversations were mostly between Cliff and Kim, and Yvonne just popped a few Â‘yahÂ’ and Â‘u-huhÂ’. When Cliff knew that Kim was working in a shipping company, as a mechanic, he was disguised. The thought of Kim working with rowdy bunch of people, sweating in the greenhouse environment, made him wonder why would Yvonne stuck with him. Yes, Cliff had taken a fancy on Yvonne, at least on her body, and hated to imagine her wearing that lingerie in front of Kim.<br><br>Â“ We really need to go now.Â” Yvonne pierced through the conversation that is still going on between Cliff and Kim. She had noticed that look on CliffÂ’s face and was somewhat ashamed by the thoughts of other people knowing KimÂ’s occupation.<br><br>Â“ See you on Monday, Yvonne.Â” Cliff waved goodbye without looking back.<br><br>Â“ He is quite a nice guy.Â” Kim looked at Cliff as he crossed the road. Perhaps he was too insensitive and did not feel that Cliff was looking down on him.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be cumming</span></span>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At night, Yvonne dressed herself in that special gift that Kim had given her. The cloth cringed onto her body like silk. She was not wearing anything underneath, she knew it was not necessary also. Her breasts were ripe and firm, with her nipples protruding out, visible from that lingerie. Curls of hair can be seen between her thighs, and this sight made Kim breathless. Maybe itÂ’s the lighting, which is dimmed and dulled. Or maybe itÂ’s the music in the background, creating an atmosphere so romantic.<br><br>They had made love before, but none was like this time round. She was like a desert, hunger for him. She lowered herself down towards Kim, who was lying there, naked, on the bed. She had never done this before to him and was wondering if he would like it. Her mouth cupped the tip of his shaft and started to move. It only took a second for Kim to be fully erected. Kim was trembling, as she tongued his most sensitive part. At last, he could not withheld any longer. He pulled Yvonne on top of him and penetrated her, long and hard. He started slow and getting slower. Yvonne was moaning and crawling, as the both of them moves to the rhythm of the music in the background. It was the beginning of a long and enjoyable night.<br><br>The next morning, Yvonne got up early to prepare breakfast for the both of them. The sound of eggs frying on the pan woke Kim up too. He greeted her with a tight hug and a bite on her lips. The morning sunshine clothed he kitchen in warm yellow. A gentle breeze was coming in from the gaps of the windows, making YvonneÂ’s hair danced in the sunlight. Breakfast was some toasted breads and fried eggs with onions chips. Fresh brewed coffeeÂ’s smell surrounded the entire kitchen.<br><br>Â“ I gotto work tonight, overnight, Yvonne.Â” Kim said as he munched on the bread. Â“ They need an extra hand.Â”<br><br>Â“ Oh well, IÂ’ll be at home anyway. Just be careful thouÂ’Â” Yvonne had already got used to him having the need to work during weekends or shift work. Â“ IÂ’ll try to stay up. Call me, will u.Â”<br><br>Â“ How can I survive without your voice..it was the only thing that gave me hope during your stay in Australia, remember.Â” Kim stroked her face as he said these words.<br><br>Â“ And your is full of butterÂ…you dirtied my face!Â”<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></strong>[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yvonne had spent her day with Kim, working out in the gym. Kim teased her if last night was not enough of a workout for her. After that, they went for an early dinner before Kim leave for his job. Yvonne went home early that evening. She had armed herself with potato chips and chocolates to keep her through the night. As the sunset, she finally understood how Kim had felt during the period she was not around. Loneliness is a tough enemy to fight against, especially at night. The clock struck 9pm when the phone rang. Yvonne knew it must be Kim.<br><br>Â“Hello dear, how are you there?Â” She began to speak as she picked up the phone.<br><br>Â“ Erm, its Cliff here. So sorry about that, I didnÂ’t know you were expecting a call from your boyfriend.Â” He figured that Kim should be out working, by the greeting Yvonne said a moment ago.<br><br>Â“ Oh hi, Cliff. WhatÂ’s up?Â” Yvonne asked him.<br><br>Cliff was calculating that since Kim wasnÂ’t around, and Yvonne was alone, he might be permitted to go up to her house, for a chat, or more. Just as Cliff thought, Yvonne invited him over when he asked if she needed any company. One hour later, Cliff arrived, with some beers. He was wearing a sleeveless tee and bermuda. His arm was toned to the finest details and had gone unnoticed during the days she saw him in the office, as he was always in shirt. They was watching the Friday night movie and drown themselves in potato chips and beers. Yvonne was not a heavy drinker, but she sure knew when to stop. She was rather afraid if Cliff got drunk and slept in her house for the night. During the commercial break, Cliff popped a question.<br><br>Â“ You stayed with him all these while?Â” He was abit drunk.<br><br>Â“ Yup, this is my house, in fact, it should be Â‘ he stayed with meÂ’.Â” Yvonne was correcting him.<br><br>Â“ Whatever. You really intended to marry him? He doesnÂ’t even earn enough to support your lifestyles. Look around youÂ…and youÂ’ll see others who are better than him.Â” His sentences were punctured with hiccups. Â“ And I think I had all that he can give you, and more than that too.Â”<br><br>Â“ I really think u r drunk. Let me get you some tea to sober you abit there.Â” She was getting up from the couch when Cliff suddenly got hold of her hand. It was the first time he held her hand.<br><br>Â“ I think I like you, Yvonne. Be mine, tonight.Â” Cliff whisper into her ears as he pulled her nearer to himself.<br><br>Yvonne tried to break loose but Cliff was just too strong for her. It was almost midnight, and raining heavily outside, any shout for help would not have been heard. Cliff lay her down on the couch and got on top of her. His hands were locking hers. She was scared. His eyes were burning red from all the drinking, and seem determined to have her tonight. He forced her head to the side and mouthed her lips. His tongue working its way into her mouth but was only block by her teeth, tightly cinched together. Yvonne was wriggling under his body and the movement must have got him more aroused. She could feel the mound through his bermuda, rubbing against her belly.<br><br>Cliff, half drunken, continued to conquer Yvonne. He lifted up her t-shirt, exposing her black, strapless bra. Yvonne was pleading for him to stop. She tried to cover her exposed body with the cushions on the sofa but the effort was futile. In less than a minute, she was topless below him. Cliff sucked her breasts and nibbling them at the same time. Yvonne was morning from the waves of pain when Cliff bit into her. She was sweating and tired from all the struggling, and was crying softly. Cliff did not notice that and continued to endeavor her. Her hands tried to pushed Cliff away when she felt that he was pulling down her shorts. She regained her energy and managed to use her knees to block him back and she fell to the ground with a thud. She grabbed her clothes and darted into the bedroom, banged the door and locked it.<br>Â“ Yvonne. YVONNE!Â” Cliff was shouting. Â“ WhyÂ…why am I doing this.Â”<br><br>It sounded like he was fully sober already. Â“ Go away! Get out of my house youÂ…you beast!Â” She shouted through the door.<br><br>Â“ IÂ’m so sorry YvonneÂ…I must have hurt youÂ…Oh God! What have I doneÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“ Go away! Get out now or IÂ’ll call the police.Â” She does not have a phone in her bedroom. But it seemed to work. She could hear the main door opened and than closed. She had to be sure, so she waited for the sound of the gate. Cliff had left her apartment.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>to be continue...</strong></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She went to clear up the mess that Cliff had created in the living room. Beer was spilled, potato chips were everywhere, and her breast was sore. That night, Kim did not called. Either he was busy or he was sleeping on his job. Yvonne believed that it was the former. She bathed after tiding the place and coaxed herself to sleep. If was like a nightmare. How she hoped it was all a nightmare, the moment when she thought of having to face Cliff on Monday.<br><br>Kim came home in the wee hours in the morning, fell onto the bed beside Yvonne, dead tired. He had no idea of what had just happen a few hours ago. Yvonne did not wake him up too, since she didnÂ’t really lose anything.<br><br>Monday came. She decided to try to act as natural as possible with Cliff around in the office. When she walked closer to her desk, there was a bunch of bright red roses, and a card. It read:<br><br>Dear Yvonne,<br>I do not know what to say. I was drunk that night.<br>Forgive me. IÂ’m really sorry.<br>Cliff<br><br>She read the words on the card repeatedly. It sounded sincere to her. And she thought, if he were really drunk, than he would not remember much about that night. She decided to let what had past, pass. Cliff was very quiet the whole day, and did not join them for lunch. Summer and Moon thought that it was weird for him to act like this. Yvonne was worried that the rest of her colleagues would smell something fishy about them, since Cliff is avoiding her, she decided to call CliffÂ’s phone with hers, in the office.<br><br>Â“ Good afternoon, this is Cliff speaking, may I know whoÂ’s that on the line?Â”<br><br>Â“ Yvonne here.Â” She paused for awhile before she continued. Â“ I hope that we can forget about that night which u violated me. I do not wish to let Summer or Moon find out about us. We women are very sharp to this kind of stuff. You didnÂ’t join us for lunch today, it was fishy enough. Moreover, you didnÂ’t even talk to me today. PleaseÂ…pretend nothing had happen and just act as normal. ThatÂ’s all I wanna say.Â” She hung the phone without even waiting for his reply.<br>Month later, Yvonne was doing quite well in the department and her effort was greatly appreciated. Smith had been very impressed by the job that she did. She was efficient and had a great sense of responsible. Cliff had been placed with her for a couple of projects before, and this had help to heal the wound that Cliff had inflicted upon their friendship. Cliff had recited his fondness for Yvonne a few times but was turned away. Yvonne was very good at rejecting people, at least verbally, if not physically. Somehow, Cliff was still jealous of the fact that Kim, who is not as good as him, could have Yvonne all for himself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: red;">...to be continue</span></strong></span></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It was bedtime, one Saturday night, when Kim proposed to Yvonne, again. Â“ LetÂ’s get married, what do you say, huh?Â” He was cuddling Yvonne, making her sleepy.<br><br>Â“ IÂ’d donÂ’t like the idea of being tied down.Â”<br><br>Â“ Are there any differences now? We are already staying together, for so long. I just wanna give you a status.Â”<br><br>Â“ Since there are no differences, why not keep it this way. ItÂ’s late, sleep. IÂ’m tired.Â”<br><br>She flipped over to face the other side. She did not sleep, neither did Kim. He did not understand why Yvonne do not like the idea of getting married. It was almost every girls dream to have a family. And both of them have in fact started a family. They had a shelter, stable incomes and a baby if Yvonne donÂ’t mind. WhatÂ’s stopping her than? Kim was puzzled. On the other side, Yvonne was also trying to understand why the thought of marriage turned her off. She analysis many things, trying to think logically. She had someone who truly loved her. She had embarked on a career that she liked. She was paid more than what the outside market is offering now. What is holding her back? Finally, it was all clear when she asked herself a question. A question that she had never answer to herself. Did she really love Kim? Or was it because he loved her in the first place? The answer lies between the gray area between Â‘yesÂ’ and Â‘noÂ’.<br><br>She was so much loved by Kim. And it was this love that continued to hold them together. But it cannot be put in the way that Yvonne does not feel for him at all. Its just that she is used to receive than to give. And all these while, something that Cliff had said on that faithful night had haunted her. Â“You really intended to marry him? He doesnÂ’t even earn enough to support your lifestyles. Look around youÂ…and youÂ’ll see others who are better than him.Â” These words sounded like a death knell. She felt that she deserved a better man, and a better life.<br><br>In the few weeks that followed, Kim and Yvonne were always squabbling. Kim noticed that Yvonne was always looking for the chance to find fault with him. But he did not know why. She nagged him the moment she reached home after work, when she saw him taking a nap, pointing out that she was always the one who does the most housework. Kim, tried to compromised as much as he could. He tried hard to please Yvonne in every little ways. Even though sometimes he did get very frustrated over her sudden change of temper, he would find himself an excuse, any excuse, to forget about it. She might be stressed out at work, or she could be really tired today; these are little things that Kim assured himself that eventually it will turn out fine. However, things just did not get better.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...to be continue</span></span></div>
