            <div class='col-md body'>It was early in the morning when Thaddeus reached home. He had been out entertaining his clients and had missed dinner with his wife, Rachel. Trying not to wake her up, he moved around the house quietly and finally sliding into bed, next to her.<br><br>Lying in bed, unable to sleep, Thaddeus recalled what happen earlier that night. Dinner was at a posh restaurant and later drinking at one of the favorite lounges in town. It was there that Thaddeus saw her. Beautiful, long haired and slim, she had what it takes to be a model. She turned heads wherever she goes, finally settling to a seat near the bar counter.<br><br>Â“Hey, sheÂ’s a beautiful thing, isnÂ’t she?Â” One of the clients said, looking quite smitten by the lady.<br><br>Thaddeus smiled and thought about his beautiful wife alone at home. Feeling guilty, he excused himself and made his way to a quieter area and called home. The phone rang for some time before Rachel answered. Â“Honey, have you eaten? IÂ’m at the Jazz lounge with some clients, will be home late, donÂ’t wait up for me ok?Â” Thaddeus said. Â“IÂ’ve eaten and am watching DVD now. DonÂ’t drink so much ya?Â” She said understandingly. What else can a man ask for, with such an understanding wife? Thaddeus smiled and hung up.<br><br>Â“Where did you go? She gave me her number!Â” His colleague, Joe said excitedly. Confused, he asked, Â“Who?Â” Â“The beauty, her name is Liz.Â”  Slightly disappointed by what Joe said, he mumbled a reply and sipped his drink. Thaddeus was far better looking than Joe and he couldnÂ’t understand why the beauty would give him her number.<br><br>Before the group left for home, Joe went to say his goodbyes to the beauty and Thaddeus tagged along. He shook hands with the lady and introduced himself. They exchanged name cards and left.<br><br>It was early in the morning before Thaddeus fell asleep.<br><br>Back in the office after the weekend, Joe excitedly told Thaddeus that he managed to date Liz for dinner that night. Â“Wow, youÂ’re reacting fast!Â” he replied and Joe said, Â“Oh man, youÂ’re married, I want to settle too, you know.Â” Thinking about Rachel, he soon felt guilty about thinking of Liz.<br><br>Thaddeus was going through his documents and the phone rang. It was Rachel asking him to suggest what to have for dinner. Trying to make up to her, he suggested her favorite cuisine, Japanese food. They decided to meet up at the Japanese restaurant that they frequent.<br><br>During dinner, his mobile phoned beeped. It was a message from Liz. Â“Hey there, Liz here, want to meet up for coffee?Â” He was busy replying the message that he didnÂ’t hear what Rachel was saying. Â“IÂ’m sorry dear, you were saying?Â” Â“I said, shall we go for a holiday this year end?Â” Â“ShouldnÂ’t be a problem, IÂ’ll see to it.Â” Rachel was all smiles when she heard that.<br><br>The mobile phone beeped again. Â“Well, you got a wife, so? We are just having coffee, not an affair. Ha Ha.Â” He smiled and replied, Â“Maybe another day?Â” For the rest of the day, Liz didnÂ’t reply the message.<br><br>While having lunch with Joe and the rest of the executives, he nudged Thaddeus. Â“She spent the night with me yesterday. Speechless is the word to describe.Â” Joe was grinning. Thaddeus thought, so was the message was a ploy to get her away from Joe or what? They walked back to the office and Joe couldnÂ’t stop talking about Liz. Thaddeus stopped him in the middle of his sentence, by asking, Â“Maybe youÂ’re not the only one that sheÂ’s with.Â” Wide eyed, Joe couldnÂ’t believe what Thaddeus just said. Â“No way man, sheÂ’s not that type of girl. No way, Thad, I wouldnÂ’t take that.Â” Thaddeus just shrugged.<br><br>Back at home, Rachel was in the shower and Thaddeus was watching television. His phone rang. Â“Liz here, want to come out for a coffee? IÂ’ll be asking Joe along.Â” Â“Ok, what time and where?Â” He replied. She briefly told him the place and time and hung up. Since Joe is going, IÂ’ll bring Rachel along, he thought.<br><br>Â“Rachel, weÂ’re going out to meet Joe and his new found squeeze.Â” He said to her, standing outside the shower screen. Â“Honey, why donÂ’t you go ahead, IÂ’ve got a long day tomorrow and IÂ’ve got to rest early tonight,Â” she replied.<br><br>Liz and Joe were chatting when ThaddeusÂ’s car moved into the parking lot. Â“Sorry guys, Rachel was actually coming with me, but sheÂ’s tired.Â” Joe nodded and Liz just stared at Thaddeus. Â“Is there something on my face?Â” She shook her head.<br><br>The chat was simple and informal. Liz is freelance model and will be flying off to Spain the next week. All the while during the chatting session, Liz was looking at Thaddeus most of the time. By this time, it was pretty clear that Liz was interested in Thaddeus rather then Joe. Feeling out of place yet knowing that the man is married, he spoke to Thaddeus when Liz went to the ladies. Â“Hey, looks like sheÂ’s making a pass on you. YouÂ’re married, you know.Â” It sounded like a warning but the fact is Joe was intimidated by Thaddeus. Laughing, Thaddeus joked, Â“I wonÂ’t fight with you over her, but if she throws herself at me, then no choice ok?Â”<br><br>When it was time to go, the threesome went to collect their cars and went on their individual ways home. During the drive, Liz messaged Thaddeus and asked to meet up with him one of the days before she leave for Spain. He replied, Â“Will confirm with you again, am driving now.Â”<br><br>It seemed like a normal meeting to Thaddeus. But to Liz, it was something else.<br><br>Pacing up and down in the office and being unable to concentrate in his work, Thaddeus was getting frustrated. The phone rang. Â“Yes?Â” He yelled into the mouthpiece. Â“Whoa, whatÂ’s the matter with you?Â” Joe said, caught in surprise of his sudden outburst. Â“Oh Joe, sorry, whatÂ’s up?Â” He asked, calming down as they spoke about the project. After hanging up, Thaddeus was still fidgeting. He took his mobile, and checked his messages. Â“Hi, Liz here, remember our date? IÂ’ll be waiting for you at the coffee joint. See you at 10.Â”<br><br>He decided to call home and check if Rachel would like to go out for dinner. Â“Darling, youÂ’ve forgotten? I told you last week that IÂ’ll be leaving for Hong Kong in another hour for the seminar? Are you ok?Â” the concerned wife asked. Thaddeus was one who has a good memory; someone who never forgets special occasions and dates. Â“Oh, I totally forgot about it. Sorry dear. Was busy with the project. So you have a safe flight and called me when youÂ’re settled, ok?Â”  Â“Sure, remember to have proper meals. IÂ’ll be back next week. Miss you already.Â” She giggled and hung up.<br><br>After talking to his wife, Thaddeus had a strong urge not to meet up with Liz. Though itÂ’s just coffee and nothing else, he didnÂ’t want to lead her on. He didnÂ’t want to hurt Rachel. Switching off his laptop and clearing up the mess on his table, he decided to take a stroll along Esplanade before grabbing dinner, even though he could jolly well drive there.<br><br>From the office to the Esplanade was only ten minutes walk, but it seemed forever to him. Racing across his mind was LizÂ’s message, JoeÂ’s warning and his wife. Sitting down in a cafÃ© near the waterfront, he ordered a pint of beer. Thaddeus knew he shouldnÂ’t be thinking about Liz. He shouldnÂ’t even harbor any thoughts about her, but deep down in his heart, he knew that he do have thoughts about Liz. Â‘ItÂ’s just physical attraction,Â’ he thought. Indeed it is.<br><br>It was about nine thirty when heÂ’s done with dinner and beer. He asked for the check and slowly walked back to collect his car. The phoned beeped. Â“Darling, IÂ’ve safely reached my hotel. Am tired now, will call you tomorrow? Remember to collect your suit at the dry cleanerÂ’s tomorrow. Love you.Â” He smiled.<br><br>As fast as the smile came, it was gone. There she stood. Long legs, short black skirt, kitten heels, and a pink knitted top, she looked like marvelous. With her long black hair pulled back, she showed off her sharp features with minimal make-up. Â“I didnÂ’t want you to stand me up again. Called your office and the security said you left your car here.Â” Â‘Oh god,Â’ he thought.<br><br>Â“Come on, letÂ’s go.Â” She smiled and winked at him. Â“ErrÂ… where would you want to go?Â” Thaddeus asked, opening the car door for her. As she slipped into his BMW convertible, she said, Â“someplace quiet where we can be alone.Â” He adjusted himself as he heard that, and suggested, Â“Why donÂ’t we ask Joe out too? He should be done with his dinner at his parentsÂ’ place.Â”<br><br>Â“Listen; is it really very uncomfortable for you to have coffee with me alone without him?Â” Liz said, clearly upset. Her advances to Thaddeus were pretty obvious.<br><br>Â“Look, IÂ’ve a wife. I donÂ’t want to hurt her and my best friend, Joe,Â” he said, Â“IÂ’m not someone who fools around. YouÂ’re beautiful. YouÂ’ve no lack of men, so please stop whatever youÂ’re doing to me.Â”<br><br>Â“What did I do to you?Â” she asked, flirtatiously. She placed one hand on his lap, caressing him, the other hand touching his chiseled face. He pushed her hands away. Â“Please, stop it, if not, get out of my car.Â” Thaddeus agitated with her and the situation that heÂ’s in. Â“No man has ever rejected me like you did. Stop lying to yourself. You wanted me as much as Joe wanted me. I want you, not Joe, that night when we first met.Â” She stepped out of the car as she finished her sentence.<br><br>Without batting his eyes, Thaddeus drove away. He was very affected because he knew what Liz said was true. He wanted her so much. The desire was so strong that he could not curb.<br><br>Standing at the roadside alone, Liz thought, Â“YouÂ’ll be mine, soon.Â”<br><br>Drowning himself in cold shower, Thaddeus felt guilty even though he did not do anything unfaithful to Rachel. He scolded himself for being weak. Rachel and he had gone through a lot before getting married. He should be glad to have Rachel as a wife, but yet, he canÂ’t help but think about Liz.<br><br>Her touch was soft and alluring. There was something about Liz that keeps pulling him towards her. It was not just lust but something else that Thaddeus couldnÂ’t figure out. Stepping out of the cold shower, he got dressed into his Calvin Klein pajamas and went into the living room.<br><br>Playing a Jazz CD on the stereo, he poured himself a glass of red wine. Flipping through a magazine, his thoughts kept steering back to Liz. He decided to message Rachel. Â“Baby, I believe youÂ’re sleeping now. ItÂ’s kind of weird without you at home. Call me when youÂ’re free tomorrow.Â”<br><br>Beep. Beep. Thinking it was Rachel whoÂ’s still awake, Thaddeus happily check his message. Â“IÂ’m sorry about just now. I didnÂ’t mean to make things turn out this way. I donÂ’t know why IÂ’m feeling this way, but I think IÂ’m in love with you. LizÂ” He tried to delete the message, but his fingers got numb. Â‘Does she really mean it?Â’ He thought, Â‘No, even if itÂ’s real, thereÂ’s nothing to be done.Â” He pressed the Â‘replyÂ’ key and started messaging her. Â“Hey, thereÂ’s nothing to be sorry about. What has happen, had happened. Just remember that IÂ’m married. We can be friends, but nothing more than that.Â”<br><br>Beep. Beep. Â“I know youÂ’re married and I donÂ’t care about it. I want you. I donÂ’t mind being friends, but I want something more then that.Â”<br><br>To Thaddeus, this was something going out of hand. He doesnÂ’t know how to react to this situation and he felt lost. He hoped someone could tell him what to do. He drank a few more glasses of wine and went to bed.<br><br>It was twelve twenty nine in the afternoon when the phone woke him up. Â“Hey still in bed?Â” It was Joe. Â“Hey, yup, just got up. WhatÂ’s up?Â” Thaddeus asked. Â“IÂ’ll be organizing a small party at my house tomorrow night. So IÂ’m inviting you now.Â” Joe happily shared. Â“WhatÂ’s the occasion?Â” Thaddeus asked cautiously, hoping that Liz would not be there. But Liz and Joe was the unofficial couple. So chances of her being there is quite high. Â“Liz, will be flying off to Spain on Tuesday. So since itÂ’s the weekend, might as well grab a chance to introduce her to our friends.Â” He explained. Not wanting to disappoint him, Thaddeus agreed.<br><br>Â“Please wrapped that up for me.Â” She said to the sales girl standing behind her. Wearing jeans and a white fitting shirt, Liz was shopping for the nightÂ’s party. She grinned at the thought that Thaddeus would be there alone. Joe had told her about Rachel being overseas at the moment. She had picked a pink satin sleeveless top to match her black knee length skirt. She will never miss a chance to be beautiful and wow the men around her.<br><br>Â“Hey sweetie, IÂ’m at the pickup point. Take your time.Â” Joe called on LizÂ’s mobile. Â“IÂ’m on my way there.Â” She replied. ItÂ’s not that JoeÂ’s a bad guy. Joe had been nice to her ever since they met, but he had been an easy target. Liz found a challenge in Thaddeus. The more he rejects her, the more she wants him. ThatÂ’s her character.<br><br>Back at JoeÂ’s house, which sheÂ’s quite familiar by now, she went into the master bedroom and laid her bags on the floor. Kicking off her heels to a corner, she slowly massages her feet, aware that Joe was standing at the door, looking at her. She then purposely took off her jeans and slowly showed more flesh to Joe, leading him on.<br><br>She then strutted into the bathroom, leaving the door wide open for Joe to enter. Joe, contemplating to enter the bathroom or not, heard the shower head being turn on. Â‘Damn, sheÂ’s hot,Â’ he thought to himself. Aroused and turned on, he made his way into the bathroom.<br><br></div>
