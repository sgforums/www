            <div class='col-md body'>I woke up about seven in the morning and fixed him breakfast. We had breakfast together and he went to work. Before he left, he told me that he will be applying leave for a week, so that we can do some stuff together before I adjust my life. I agreed.<br><br>It was decided that same day that we would be going to an exotic island for a short holiday. I was excited over the whole plan. We would be leaving the day after.<br><br>The short holiday brought us closer then before. We shared many quiet moments and talked about stuff that we never came across. Desmond enjoyed the holiday a lot and thought of extending our stay. I do love the beautiful ocean and sunset that was missing in Singapore, however I need to be back to reality. I need to find a job and support myself financially. With the funds I have left in the bank, I wouldnÂ’t be able to sustain the year. I told Desmond, Â“ I think we should leave. This holiday had rejuvenate me, and I want to start afresh back home.Â” Desmond agreed and we left the island for home.<br><br>It was difficult looking for a job when the economy is down. Many of the interviews I went, they were unable to offer me a job with a good pay. I was a fashion consultant, now I had to change jobs. I was walking aimlessly in Orchard Road when I saw Melanie.<br><br>I called out to her. Â“Mel, hi, surprised to see you.Â” Melanie gave me a hug and smiled to me. Â“Why not join me for coffee?Â” She offered. We went to the nearest coffee house and talked about the latest happenings. I told her about Steven, my job and Desmond. Â“Natty, I have a job offer for you. You can consider about it and give me an answer anytime,Â” Mel said. I looked at her, waiting for her to carry on. Â“IÂ’m opening a themed boutique. I need a consultant to help me with the merchandising and the operations.Â” The offer is tempting and I was tempted to accept it right away. Â“But Mel, you were not in the line previously, what makes you want to do this?Â” I asked curiously. Mel told me that her fiancÃ© is a fashion designer and they are in partnership for this. Â“I think IÂ’ll love the job.Â” I smiled at her. Â“Great Natty! IÂ’m looking forward to work with you. The details, we shall talk about it next week with my fiancÃ©. Ok?Â” She said, placing her name card in my hand. I accepted it and nodded. It was decided and I got myself a job.<br><br>I went home and prepared a feast for dinner, intending to give Desmond a surprise. He came home much earlier then before. I called out to him while cooking and he gave me a hug from behind. I returned him a hug and told him the new job IÂ’ve found. He was ecstatic for me. We had dinner and he suggested having wine for the celebration. Â“Why not?Â” I said happily.<br><br>He took a bottle of red wine from the cellar. I played some Jazz music from his range of CDs and sat on the couch. We drank. The bottle was finished and I ended the celebration, telling Desmond that I was tired. He cleared up the table and I went for a shower.<br><br>I came out of the shower and walked past DesmondÂ’s room. He was changing into his pajamas without the door closed. I blushed and walk back to my room. I shut the door and thought it was so long that I didnÂ’t see Desmond naked. Two long years that I left him for that jerk. As I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. I thought of the times spent with Teddy. Teddy. I gave him the name when we were shopping in the soft toy section when we were together.<br><br>It was dawn before I knew it. I heard him woke up. I was deciding whether to cook him breakfast when I heard the front door close. I closed my eyes and fell asleep.<br><br></div>
