            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Memoirs</strong><br><br>Her smile lighted up my day.<br><br>She had just walked out of the office tower where she worked but looked like she had just walked out of a make-over. Whereas I, with my Armani tie half-loosened, and God knows what else, was standing there waiting for her with my filthy, half-smoked cigarette. I'll have to quit that habit soon...<br><br>"Hi bunny", she smirked. GAWD why is she so happy? Unconsciously I smiled back.<br><br>"Hiya baby", I managed, taking her document bag from her. "I didn't manage to collect the car on time, so it's still at the workshop. Let's take a cab, shall we?"<br><br>"Can we walk to the Esplanade and skip the peak hour traffic? I haven't been there since the opening and I'd really like to go again to have a look. It's just so beautiful there!"<br><br>I tried to hide my wince. But I couldn't disappoint her sweet anticipation. She did have a point though. Catching a cab at this hour would be like would be like catching a fly with a pair of chopsticks.<br><br>The journey made her document bag seem to weigh like a tonne of bricks. However, her light-hearted cheeriness and animated chatter made my heart flutter weightlessly. How could someone describing how her boss tripping over the photocopier power cord look like such an angel?<br><br>We reached the Esplanade in no time, although not without my tie being taken off and my shirt tucked out, while she still had her suit jacket on and of course, that million dollar smile.<br>Correction.<br><br>No amount of money could replace that smile.<br><br>Feeling slightly peckish, I muttered if we could grab a bite. She said she would prepare something when we got home and I immediately rescinded my request. She made the simplest meals fit for a king, and I thank God everyday that I was her king. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. I say even without my stomach she's there to stay.<br><br>We seated ourselves on an empty bench. I couldn't help but ask, "Baby, how do you do it?"<br><br>"Do what, bunny?"<br><br>"Make me so happy..... so effortlessly!"<br><br>I thought the smile when she greeted me earlier was flawless. Yet she managed to surprise me with yet another smile that was even more flawless when she heard that, if that was possible. It was a rhetorical question. Yet I was puzzled. Maybe I shouldn't question why. If only she knew how happy I was.<br><br>She leaned against me amorously. Since I wondered if I stank like sweat and smokes, I shifted uncomfortably.<br><br>As if reading my thoughts: "How much did you smoke today, bunny?", she asked dreamily.<br><br>"Too much...." Wrong, but truthful answer. Her frown made me wince the second time since seeing her but what she said made me want to slap myself.<br><br>"I love you anyway you know that right?"<br><br>Damn, she's good. Ok, I'm quitting.<br><br>The rest of the evening was spent in a silence that was soothing, even satisfying. I even wondered what I would do if she ever failed to be part of my life. I shuddered at the thought, and mentally chidded myself at my pessimism. Again, as if reading my thoughts, she snuggled up even closer, her thoughts intimated that she would never leave me. I believed her.<br><br>When we finally got home I was an absolute wreck. I must be getting old, ten hour days in the office seemed more labourous than a seven day field camp with my old commando buddies. She, of course got undressed and promptly went into the kitchen to whip up some goodies for her husband, whom thankfully, was me.<br><br>The hot water splashing on my face was the second best thing I felt all day. The best of course, was her gentle touch and mind-boggling smile. My thoughts drifted to when I first met her. She was, and still is, the most beautiful creature I have ever laid eyes on. For the first time that day, I smiled so uninhibitedly that I was thankful I was in the privacy of my bathroom.<br><br>*~~~*<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Memoirs</strong><br><br><strong>Part II</strong><br><br>I remember how I met her.<br><br>I was shopping for a bath robe for my mother at Robinson's and being the typical male, could not, for the life of me, find where they were. I looked around, found a staff member and asked for help. Goofy was how I sounded.<br><br>"Would you mind telling me where I can find the bath robes?"<br><br>Her delayed reply rather annoyed me. I was already cursing at the screaming kids, irritating Christmas jingles and mindless people that were foraging through the Christmas items on sale. Lucky for her, or me, she was rather good-looking. That helped things a little.<br><br>"Why don't I bring you to that department? Maybe I can help you select a suitable one. Is it for your wife?"<br><br>Now, I don't remember Singaporean sales staff being that helpful, nor personal. Before I could think of a suitable reply, I found myself following her to a section that I swore I browsed through moments ago. I guess being male makes you blind when buying bath robes.<br><br>"Well? Who is it for?" She asked again.<br><br>"Er... My mother." I replied.<br><br>"Her favourite colour?"<br><br>"Yellow."<br><br>When we (more like she) finally decided on which one to get, I proceeded to the cashier and paid for my purchase. She was still with me, like she was worried I wouldn't pay or something.<br><br>"Say, do you want to help me shop for something for my dad now?"<br><br>My dumbfounded look was a Kodak moment. I couldn't really find anything intelligent to say so I muttered, "Huh...?"<br><br>"I said, I need to get a present for my dad, and I'd like you to help me out. That's why I'm here. I don't work here."<br><br>I wanted to dig a hole and bury myself. And plant some cabbage while the soil is still soft. I don't know how long it took me, but when I finally found my voice,<br><br>"Then why did you....?"<br><br>"Because you're cute!" She cut me off. It's like she anticipated my every move. Are men that predictable? "So are you gonna help me or what?"<br><br>I had never experienced the feeling of total elation coupled with extreme embarassment at the same time. My heart was beating double time and my stomach, triple. I looked at my feet. Damn! My shoes needed cleaning.<br><br>She slid her hand under my arm and started to head for the men's section. "Come on, relax, it's not that hard, my dad isn't really fussy."<br><br>After we selected a blue pinstripe Aldo Rossini business shirt size 15, and paid for it, I was feeling much more comfortable with her. She showed no hint of remembering my embarassment from moments before. Instead, by that time, I not only knew her father's shirt size, I also knew that he didn't like green, that his favourite food was fettuccine carbonara, that he called her roly-poly when he wanted to annoy her and that his golf handicap was 18. I was smitten by her through and through. So lively and spontaneous, open and uninhibited, charming and intelligent.<br><br>"I want to see you again." I said as we left the department store.<br><br>"Why?" I swore that sounded a little cold.<br><br>"Because I still have other presents to shop for, and I'll need your help again." Of course, that wasn't the reason.<br><br>She raised an eyebrow, and then smiled. It was then that I was taken. The pure, unadulterated smile that is her signature.<br><br>As we navigated through the Christmas crowd that evening, I could only sense all things beautiful, the Christmas carols lingering in the festive air, the smiles of little kids eating lollipops, and the joy in my heart that would only grow in time to come.<br><br>*~~~*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Memoirs<br><br>Part III</strong><br><br>Our relationship was just so right. We were attuned to each other in such a poignant way that it was astonishing. Six months had passed, she moved in, and we shared each other's lives in a way that re-wrote the meaning of love.<br><br>"Bunny! Let's go to Australia!" She exclaimed one night, looking away from the LCD screen.<br><br>"Err, you're talking to me right?" I looked up, beyond the rim of my reading glasses, giving her the most incredulous look I could muster.<br><br>"There's no one else in this room, you goondoo! C'mon, let's go, let's go, let's go!" The shine in her eyes near blinded me.<br><br>"How? I mean... you remember this little minor detail called "work" don't you?" Sarcasm rippled off my tongue. I shifted slightly under the covers of the bed.<br><br>"We'll take leave. We'll quit, whatever!! Look here, I'm at this website and there's this wonderful offer from SA Tours for only $888 to any city in Australia...."<br><br>Her voice trailed off. Even though my eyes were rolling while I was listening to her, my heart marvelled at her sweet innocence. I instantly remembered why I loved her. Such positivity, such optimism, devoid of gloom. The perfect complement for me. I gazed at her dreamily. The LCD screen seemed to be reflected off her rosy cheeks, as she meticulously read the contents of "this wonderful offer" out loud.<br><br>"Hey! Are you listening?" An ever so slight tinge of annoyance rang thru her voice.<br><br>"Yes dear, I'm listening." I didn't hesitate. "When shall we leave?"<br><br>Her excitement burst with all the vigor I had ever seen. "Really?!! This is great! We're finally going for a holiday together!" She jumped off her chair and flew across the room to give me the most endearing hug a man could ask for. After I found my breath, she propped herself up over me with her elbows and started visualising: "We could go to Brisbane first, and you can show me all the places you grew up at, see your parents, meet your brother, then down to Sydney, can we still make it for the Mardi Gras? Then Melbourne, the penguins, it's winter right?....."<br><br>Here we go again. I had my jaw semi-opened, stuck. I swore she said all that with one breath. Women sure are interesting creatures. They don't breathe when they talk. Cool.<br><br>"...then Adelaide via the Great Ocean Road.."<br><br>I lifted my hand, and slightly brushed her lips with my thumb. Her eyes, filled with joy, found mine, filled with awe. I leaned forward, then hesitated. She was silent now, her lips still, moist, with a half-smile soft and tender. She spoke to me now, not through her lips, but through her eyes, still glistening, this time with coy ardency. Gently, she removed my glasses, and placed them beside me. "I love you", she whispered softly, and transfered her weight off her elbows onto my naked torso. We embraced, united in sweet romance.<br><br>My reading glasses broke that night.<br><br>*~~~*</div>
