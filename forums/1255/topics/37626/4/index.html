            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Memoirs Part V</strong><br><br>After freshening up it was time for dinner and I couldn't wait to savour my mum's cooking after all those years. My brother had arrived with his wife, and to my greatest surprise she was already 6 months pregnant! Time passes fast, and I felt like I'd lost touch with my family. Yet I never felt alone, and I attributed that to the love that Chloe had shown to me the past months, and instantly felt that there would be no one else in the world that I would ever love again.<br><br>Chloe was already downstairs helping my mum with dinner preparations. I was just beside myself with glee. How could she just blend in so well? Chatting with my brother and his wife while fiddling with tongs trying to get little bite-sized appetizers on a large dish seemed like something sheÂ’d been doing for years. She obviously needed no introduction to the rest of my family.<br><br>Â“Bunny, you didnÂ’t comb your hair again! ItÂ’s so messy!Â” She exclaimed while I sat myself down on a chair giving my brother a friendly punch on the shoulder.<br><br>Â“You know, IÂ’ve never said this to you before, but while my mumÂ’s still around, you are not to take over her role to nag me.Â” I smirked back. Ha! Looks like I won that one.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s not funnyÂ…Â” She trailed off, and continued with what she was doing. Oh no, was she upset? I didnÂ’t have time to think before my brother and I started busying ourselves with man talk, which always seemed to divert towards the topic of photography. I guess that was one of the rare things that he and I had in common. Still, I loved and missed him so.<br><br>Dinner was, as usual, belt bursting, even though I wasnÂ’t wearing one. Thank God for elastic bands, I thought to myself. However, I wasnÂ’t too worried about my over-eating as I was about ChloeÂ’s silence towards me. She was amiable to the rest of my family but it seemed weird that for once, her attention wasnÂ’t on me. I couldnÂ’t quite figure out if I was just being sensitive, or that she was deliberately ignoring me. Sometimes I hate being a man, for we can never tell such things.<br><br>After my brother and I did the dishes, I grabbed DadÂ’s keys and said, Â“Dad, I need to go out for a sec, taking your car hor?Â” and didnÂ’t bother waiting for an answer. He probably just grunted anyway. To my surprise, Chloe didnÂ’t bat an eyelid. DidnÂ’t she want to know where I was going? Looks like IÂ’m in the deep end this time, I thought, and left.<br><br>When I returned, she was already in bed reading. I entered our room tentatively, and she put her magazine aside and snuggled under the covers, facing away from me. I walked up to her from behind and sat down beside her.<br><br>Â“Dear, IÂ’m back. Can I have a kiss?Â” I coerced.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m trying to sleepÂ…Â” She managed. The temperature definitely dropped a few degrees there.<br><br>OK, I thought to myself. This wasnÂ’t going to be easy. I left her alone and proceeded to undress myself and got into my pajamas, hoping that sheÂ’d break the silence. I knew her well; she just wouldnÂ’t be able to keep mum about her unhappiness for long. And I was right.<br><br>Â“Where did you go?Â” Her icy-cold voice stung.<br><br>I remained silent for a while. Â“Well?Â” She demanded.<br><br>Â“When I left the house I knew you were angry at me because you didnÂ’t even bother to ask where I was going. I didnÂ’t have anywhere to go, just wanted to see if you were really angry.Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’m not angry whatÂ…Â” She was such a bad liar, it was almost cute.<br><br>Â“Anyway since everything was closed, I drove around aimlessly for a while until I remembered a MacDonaldÂ’s restaurant that opened late. So I went there and got a few straws to make you these.Â” From my pockets, I produced twelve stars made out of folding the straws and showed them to her, hoping she would notice the sores on my fingers from folding the thick plastic. They donÂ’t make them that thin like those found at the kopitiams in Singapore thatÂ’s for sure.<br><br>Her eyes lighted up.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sorry dear, I think I have a good idea why youÂ’re pissed off, I just donÂ’t want to start this holiday on a bad note.Â” I sat next to her while she picked up one of the stars off my hand and threw them childishly back at the rest of the eleven. And repeating that a couple of times. Her sweet innocence was returning, and a hidden smile seemed to slowly reveal itself on her tender lips.<br><br>Â“So you like the stars anot?Â” I probed. Â“I havenÂ’t made these in 5 years. WasnÂ’t easy since these straws are so hard, you know.Â” The most innocent look of my life adorned my face and I took a great deal of effort to make it stay, since my smile was also oozing out of my lips.<br><br>She grabbed a star, and instead of throwing it back at the pile, she threw it in my face playfully. Â“YouÂ’re not off the hook ok?Â” This time her smile was uncontrolled, and turned away so as not to give me the pleasure of her immaculate beauty.<br><br>Â“Oh yes I am!Â” I exclaimed. Â“Yippie! IÂ’m off the hook liow.Â” I stared jumping up and down on the bed and sprinkled the stars on her head. That was certainly something I did not want anyone else to see. A 30-year-old man treating his bed as a trampoline yelling Â“YippieÂ” wouldnÂ’t go down well with society, I figured.<br><br>Â“Hey stop it, youÂ’re making me dizzy!Â” So I stopped, and asked her, Â“Do you know why I made twelve stars?Â”<br><br>Â“Well, I know twelve roses means Â‘Be mineÂ’, but IÂ’m already yours mah.Â” Cheeky grin. Â“So what does it mean?Â”<br><br>Â“It means the number of children youÂ’re gonna bear for me!Â”<br><br>Â“Yeah right, in your dreams!Â” Now she was really back to her usual self. I was just so happy. I never ever wanted her to be angry with me again. Not that itÂ’s easy though. I moved under the covers so she could snuggle tightly in my arms. Her breathing was light, and I could feel it on my bare chest. She started to speak again.<br><br>Â“Bunny, you know why I was angry right? When you were gone I was thinking that I was over-reacting, but then, did you know IÂ’m under a lot of pressure?Â”<br><br>I was a little shocked. What did she mean by that? Reading my thoughts, she continued. Â“Meeting your family has been one of the things that IÂ’ve always looked forward to, yet I feel pressured because I didnÂ’t know what they would think of me. Especially when you told me about Andrea and how your mum hated her. That scared me you know. And just now, your stupid comment on how I was taking over your motherÂ’s role wasnÂ’t funny at all. What if she took it the wrong way? I just didnÂ’t like it. Luckily she didnÂ’t seem bothered by it. Obviously she knows your nonsense better than I do!Â” With that she proceeded to thump my chest. SheÂ’s been in the habit of doing that lately. Â“So thatÂ’s why I was all annoyed and scared. I really love you, and your family, and I donÂ’t want them to hate me.Â”<br><br>She sounded so forlorn that it wrenched my heart into the most oddly contorted shape. I was so touched. Here I was thinking it was a little squabble between a couple that I knew I could Â“fixÂ” while she was introspecting about the future of our relationship. For the first time in my life, impending commitment in a relationship didnÂ’t scare me at all. I knew I was important to her since she felt this way, and felt so idiotic that I hadnÂ’t been able to sense this apprehension in her. Â‘Bloody menÂ’, I used that excuse again.<br><br>I sighed. Â“IÂ’m so so so sorry dear. I had no idea you thought that much. I mean I always knew you wouldnÂ’t have problems with my parents. I guess I shouldÂ’ve reassured you. Why hadnÂ’t you spoken to me about this?Â”<br><br>Â“DidnÂ’t want to worry you lor. I usually just tell myself that I was thinking too much.Â”<br><br>Â“Hey, I donÂ’t want you to keep anything from me ok? And stop feeling that youÂ’re not as important to me as my family and all that nonsense, in case you are thinking that way, ok?Â”<br><br>Â“Ok bunnyÂ…Â” She was sleepy now. All the anxiety about meeting my family and the long periods of traveling seemed to finally culminate in an exhausted and spent body and mind of my beloved Chloe. I was glad she was in my arms. No one in this world would ever fill those arms again.<br><br>We slept soundly that night, under the clear star-lit skies of Brisbane, and among the MacDonaldÂ’s straw stars scattered over lilac satin sheets.<br><br>*~~~*</div>
