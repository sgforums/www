            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Memoirs Part VI</strong><br><br>Southbank hadnÂ’t changed.<br><br>Man-made and poised by the banks of Brisbane river lay the picturesque esplanade, adorned with places of pasta, lobster and sirloin. A wading pool formed from a rock waterfall could be found at one end of the esplanade where fragrances of charred, barbequed meat lingered.<br><br>That evening, we found ourselves patronising one of the bistros situated along the esplanade.<br><br>Â“Bunny, this place is just so peaceful. Do you think we could live here next time?Â”<br><br>I smiled approvingly, since I had every intention to. I didnÂ’t know how serious she was, and whether she thought about her friends and family that sheÂ’d be leaving behind in Singapore, but that didnÂ’t matter. What mattered was that she was in front of me, making me the happiest man alive. However, the fact of whether she was also the happiest woman alive was unbeknownst to me.<br><br>I took a sip of my red wine gave a nod of approval to the anticipating sommelier. Â“YouÂ’ve indeed chosen an excellent wine, sir. Please allow me to serve your lovely companion so that she may also savour this excellent wine.Â” He said, with a smile that could probably win more awards than the wine in his hands. Chloe grinned and allowed her glass to be filled.<br><br>Beyond her, the bistro was filled with soft jazz, dampened by constant chatter from the guests and their occasional bouts of laughter. Teak dining tables with matching table runners stood on matt parqueted flooring. In contrast, the shining silverware that reflected a single tea-light candle on the tables added a touch of class to the ambience of the bistro.<br><br>Â“Bon appÃ©tit,Â” The waiter said as he laid our dishes in front of us. Chloe had ordered the grilled salmon, while I opted for the lamb rack.<br><br>Â“DearÂ…Â” I started to speak.<br><br>Â“Yes, bunny?Â” She replied, taking a bite of her fish. Without letting me continue she commented, Â“Wow bunny, this salmon is good! You wanna try some?Â” That smile again. It almost felt like I never had to eat again if I could see that smile for the rest of my life.<br><br>Â“Alright!Â” I replied as she placed a slice of fish in my mouth. Â“Hmm, itÂ’s pretty good, huh? But I reckon you could do a better job!Â” I smiled back. I was telling the truth. Food prepared by her with an extra ingredient called love could not be bettered by the best chef.<br><br>Â“Oh, youÂ’re kidding. DonÂ’t tease me like that. DonÂ’t forget, youÂ’re the one who taught me how to cook, so in other words you are praising yourself lar?Â” She sniggered playfully.<br><br>Dinner continued with playful banter and I felt at the top of the world. She was such great company and even after all these months I felt that everyday with her was like getting to know her again. The excitement, freshness and vitality that exuded from her never seemed to fade. In fact, it seemed to grow with time, much the opposite to my previous relationships where the spark seemed to die with the passing months.<br><br>Â“Chlo, I want to ask you something.Â” I said over dessert. Â“Are you happy?Â” I asked apprehensively.<br><br>Â“Of course I am! WeÂ’re on holiday bunny, our first holiday ever. And this place is just great! I love the weather, and even the air, itÂ’s so fresh! Then itÂ’s not really crowded like in Singapore, and people here are just so friendly! And oh, your family, theyÂ’re just wonderful. IÂ’ll definitely have to learn more dishes to cook from your mum.Â” Her exuberance never failed to elate me, even though she hadnÂ’t really answered the question.<br><br>Â“And IÂ’m sure sheÂ’ll be more than happy to. But I meant to ask, are you <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> happy?Â” This time I looked serious. The glint in my eyes surely communicated to her that I meant if she was happy with our relationship.<br><br>Her smile faded slightly, and her face turned into an almost confused look. Her arched eyebrows showed concern as she responded, Â“What do you think? DonÂ’t you have any idea?Â”<br><br>Â“Well, letÂ’s just say when something perfect in my life presents itself, I would think it was too good to be true. And dear, youÂ’re prefect.Â” I didnÂ’t know why I was so negative. I had always been a pessimist, and this time was no different. Maybe, for once in my life, I actually feared that someone walking out of it would probably kill me. I took a big gulp of my wine and emptied the glass.<br><br>Â“BunnyÂ…Â” She spoke softly. Â“I love you. I know you love me too. ThatÂ’s enough for me. I hope that answers your question.Â” She stretched her arm forward and placed her hand gently on mine and stroked reassuringly with her fingertip. She looked at me with contentment in her eyes, something which I was sure IÂ’d seen, but never noticed. Tonight, I certainly noticed it, and was relieved. I leaned forward to give her a peck on the lips, tasting partly of lipstick and partly of the sweet wine she just had, but mostly the assurance that she too, was happy. I was the reason she was happy.<br><br>*~~~*</div>
