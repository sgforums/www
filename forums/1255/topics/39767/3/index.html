            <div class='col-md body'>9 August 2003 (Saturday) Â– It was time to sing the National Anthem and recite the pledge.  What followed was a cacophony of noise.<br><br>The Indians were still squabbling away.  The mobile phones of the Hong Kongers were ringing away.  The mainland Chinese were clearing their throats and spitting.  At least the mats were singing; after all, the anthem is in their language.  However, I swear I could hear strains of Â‘rasa sayang, eh, rasa sayangÂ….Â”.  The white men were either singing Â‘God Save The QueenÂ’ or Â‘America the BeautifulÂ’.  It was beneath their dignity to sing the song of a former colony.  The only ones who were singing the anthem properly were the pathetic bunch of citizens.<br><br>Then it was time to recite the pledge.  There was a deafening silence.  Again, the pathetic group of citizens, outnumbered 9-to-1, were the only ones who recited.<br><br>Being endowed with helicopter vision, I immediately realized the problem.  9 out of 10 of them may be Singaporeans, but they are not citizens, and could not identify with the pledge.<br><br>I turned to my MIW spokesman Klose Wuneye.<br><br>Â“Instruct the Ministry of Home Affairs to change the pledge from Â“We, the citizens of SingaporeÂ…Â” to Â“We, the residents of SingaporeÂ…Â”Â”<br><br>In order to make these foreign talents identify with Singapore, nothing is sancrosant, not even the pledge.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>16 August 2003 (Saturday) Â– National Day rally speech is tomorrow.  Press Secretary Tok Nonsern (another foreign talent) gave me the draft of Ah GohÂ’s speech to vet.<br><br>The speech was the usual crap to fool the peasant.  In these tough times, the tactic is to tell the peasants about the even tougher times in the past.  I wanted to start the speech with Â“A long time ago in a province in ChinaÂ….Â” but Tok Nonsern alerted me that this line has already been patented by Moses Lim as Tan Ah Teck in the sitcom Under One Roof.  Damn.<br><br>Hope the peasants will not notice the part where we cut the CPF rate from 40% to 30%.  Hope the peasants will not do their mental calculations and realized that they now will have to work till 70 years old in order to be able to afford the cost of retirement.<br><br>It was a well-written speech.  Until the last page.  My face turned as red as the red shirt I was wearing.  I sent Tok Nonsern flying across the room with one tight slap across his face.<br><br>Â“This is a horrible speech!Â”  I screamed.  Â“You better apologise!Â”<br><br>I took out my pen and made changes to the script.  The changes were minor, I changed just four words.  The original paragraph ran:<br><br>Â“You may also have heard this old story about Loong. Back in 1990, Loong had a quarrel with Richard Hu. Dhanabalan sided with Richard. Loong lost his temper, reached across the table, and gave Dhanabalan a tight slap! The whole Cabinet was thrown into commotion. I then forced Loong to apologise.  I am not suffering from amnesia.  I still can remember this incident.Â”<br><br>I change the last sentence to: Â“I must be suffering from amnesia. I just cannot remember this incident!Â”<br><br>I was finally satisfied.  Â“Now, this is a great speech.Â”  I proclaimed to Tok Nonsern.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>25 August 2003 (Monday) Â– The public relations consultant called.  They said that the peasantsÂ’ perception of the dragon is very bad.  I need a makeover and to come across as a softer, gentler leader.  Do whatever is necessary, I said.<br><br>The PR consultant suggested a manicure for a start to remove the dragonÂ’s talons.  I slashed the idea away.  I need the claws to fight any dissension.<br><br>PR next suggested a visit to the dentist to remove the fiery breath and the sharp teeth.  I chewed on the idea for a while but spat it out.  I need my fire-breathing and my sharp teeth to devour the opposition.<br><br>How about a body treatment to remove the horny scales?  I wriggled over the suggestion, but was squirmish about it.  I need the scales to protect myself from all the back-stabbing by enemies.<br><br>The PR consultant was at witsÂ’ end.  Damn, looks like I will just have to re-invent myself.  I chanced upon the Straits TimesÂ’ Life section and flipped through it.  Got my inspiration.<br><br>Called up David Gan of Passion.  Gimme the latest in menÂ’s hairdo, I said.  Some brown streaks in my hair would be nice.  Made appointment for a facial and massage.  While on the line, also ordered a complete grooming set: shaving foam, facial scrub, facial soap, moisturizer, toner, eau de toilette.  Reluctantly agreed to a pedicure but still refuses to do a manicure.  While they are at it, they can paint my nails.  Called the jeweler and asked them for the latest in necklaces, rings and diamond earrings.  But no nose ring or naval ring please, that would be too kinky for the peasants.  Finally, ordered a new wardrobe of pink clothes, underwear and shoes.  Also ordered some fishnet shirts, and some G-strings.<br><br>Called WIW (Woman In White).  Â“ItÂ’s my new image.  I have re-discovered myself.  My new name is Gaylord, and I am a metrosexualÂ….Hello?  Hello? Hello?Â…Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WHEN HARRY MET SALLY<br><br>Circa 1960s Â– Growing up time.  My brother Ah Yang had reached puberty and was starting to take an interest in girls, especially a particular girl-next-door.  I never knew the neighbours had a girl; she looked and behaved like a boy.  Her name was Sally.<br><br>Brother also started giving himself a Christian name: Harry Junior.  I can still remember the day when Harry Met Sally.  He went over to play with her, and brought his new toy telephone set along.  Sally grabbed the phone set from him and said: Â“ThatÂ’s mine!Â”  ThatÂ’s when I first knew Sally was an ambitious gal.<br><br>WHEN HARRY SUE SALLY<br><br>2003 Â– The girl-next-door is even closer now: she is the girl-same-door.  Sally became my wife:  Sally Ho.  ThatÂ’s the problem with being a younger brother: you get the hand-me-downs from your older brother.<br><br>Years ago, Father had given Harry a telephone company as a Christmas present.  Sally also wanted one, and pestered her in-laws until she got her own telecommunications company.  She wanted to call it Sally&amp;Hub (short for hubby), but I would not have anything to do with it.  In the end, she reluctantly changed it to Star.<br><br>Sally wanted to reach as many residential households as Harry, and started to encroach onto HarryÂ’s telephone lines and manholes.  Without HarryÂ’s permission.  At first, Harry, being the good and dutiful brother-in-law, kept quiet.  But the encroachment grew.<br><br>I can still remember the day when Harry Sue Sally.  That evening, over dinner, Sally pulled out her company management reports.  She had gained more market share at the expense of Harry.  That was too climatic for her.  She started moaning, groaning and gasping for one full minute.  Mother called the butler and said: Â“I want to have whatever daughter-in-law is eating.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>16 September 2003 (Tuesday) Â– In the morning, went to The Little Sisters of the Poor to say goodbye to them.  The papers reported that they left Singapore, but the truth was that they were kicked out.  The government gave them an ultimatum: are they willing to come under the umbrella of the Community Chest, and be subject to the governmentÂ’s control?  I promised them unlimited funding.  However much they want in proceeds raised from the PresidentÂ’s Star Charity, they can have it.  Only condition is that the government controls their board and their budget. The little sisters replied: Â“They would rather remain poor and independent, than be rich and soulless.Â”<br><br>At the farewell, in front of the media and those present, I made an hour-long speech, praising the Little Sisters for their humility and frugality.  Also mentioned how citizens should count their blessings and be content with just their daily bread in these troubled times.  At the end, they passed around a tin can for one last round of fund raising.  I very generously contributed $10.<br><br>Afternoon.  Time to get ready for fatherÂ’s birthday celebration.  Have ordered the best food money can buy: sharksÂ’ fin, birdÂ’s nest, abalone, caviar, champagne, whisky, truffle etc.  The presents from the guests have started piling up at the house.  There was a title deed to a landed bungalow from our tycoon friend in HK.  Damn, better hide this before the public finds out.  There were a few luxury cars, many precious gold and jewels, bouquets of flowers, and ang pows (red packets).  There was even an ang pow from The Little Sisters of the Poor.  I opened it up and inside was $100.  Not bad, thatÂ’s a ten-fold return on my outlay this morning.<br><br>Called Woman-in-White (WIW) and gave her some tips on how to score points: wear a cheongsam, just like mother.  And wear red, the auspicious colour.<br><br>Evening.  It was supposed to be a grand gala dinner, but it looked like an old folksÂ’ home instead.  There were so many old men and women around.  And the old women were making pathetic attempts to look young, sexy and glamorous again.  But the giveaway signs were their sagging bosoms, heavy bottoms, protruding tummies and elephant legs.  And damn, so many of them were wearing cheongsams.<br><br>A Woman-in-Red (WIR) appeared at the entrance.  I rushed towards her.  But it was not WIW.  It was dear wife.  She wore a red cheongsam.  Did she eavesdropped into my conversation with WIW?  Another WIR appeared. Again I was disappointed.  It was my sister-in-law.  Then another.  It was Ms Amy.  In all, there were two dozen red cheongsams that evening.<br><br>Finally WIW appeared.  She was stunning, and was easily the most gorgeous woman that evening.  The photographers gathered around to take some pictures.  I had to look good in the photos, so I shoved dear wife away, and pulled WIW next to me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do not read on if you are offended by racist stereotyping.<br><br>26 September 2003 (Friday) - Agent Smith, or rather, Agent Samad, reported that there is growing unrest in the Malay community.  Time to milk the sentiments of the Mats.  I pulled out fatherÂ’s 1965 secret manual "How To Play Fowl In The Kampung."  Tactic #1 was to distribute out free Guns n Roses CDs to the Mats.  Nope, that wouldn't work.  Nowadays the modern Mats are listening to cina gals like Stefanie Sun.  Tactic #2 was to give them free tickets for next year's National Day Parade.  That's too far away.  Tactic #3 was to organize an event in the void deck of a HDB block.  Any event will do, as long as it is the void deck.  Not a bad idea.  Tactic #4 was to appeal to their historical ties with the MIW.  HmmÂ…<br><br>Called up my old Malay tuition teacher Cikgu Amin.  Does he need a new bicycle?  Cikgu Amin said yes but he has been waiting for 45 years to hear from me.  A bit busy lah, I explained to him.  It's no more like those idyllic days of old when Cikgu would teach me how to climb coconut trees and chuli ayam (steal chickens).<br><br>"So you got a steady civil service job? 9 to 5?" Cikgu wanted to know.  Damn, Cikgu sure has not been in the news.  What has he been reading?  Berita Harian?  Told him that yes, I kind of got a civil servant job.  But the hours are shorter.<br><br>I told Cikgu that he is going to be in the news as my Malay tuition teacher.  In return for the bike, I asked him to say something nice about me.  There was a long silence.  "Like what?" Cikgu finally asked.  Talk about gratitude, I moaned.<br><br>But I did have fond memories of Cikgu.  He was a good teacher.  He was the one who taught me phrases like "balik kampung", "referee kayu" and "kelong." And gave me my first joint of cannabis.  (But I only inhaled, I did not smoke.)  He also introduced me to the world of SPG (sarong party girl).  In fact, my first time was with a Malay minah.  Yes, I am all for a multi-racial society.  It allows you to s hit outside of your own backyard.<br><br></div>
