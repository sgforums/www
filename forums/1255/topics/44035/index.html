Thank you so much!!!!<br><br>Please pass the following note to Charles, thank you so much once again.....<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Ruth<br><br>Dear Charles,<br><br>I hope that it is you reading this now, actually I have so much to say to you, I really don't know where to start... ... I really miss you you know that? I really wish that you didn't.......... How I wished that it was me and not you, you had so much ahead of you, you were going to get married!! I never even got a chance to really talk to you and you just left like that..... How could you leave me behind???<br><br>You promised me that you would buy a flat and I could stay with you as long as I didn't tell anyone about the girls you bring back!! I promised you that I wouldn't, I really did!! I was so looking forward to it!!! But it never happened....... I ended up living in your room for my final year in Nanyang...... Do you know how terrible that was??<br><br>Everyday I reached home I had to avoid looking at the black and white photo of you your dad had put on the cabinet facing the door! I didn't want the image of you alive to disappear from my head cos I wanted to remember you the way you were when we went all around Singapore looking for that one shirt you wanted from U2. You only wore business shirts from U2!! I still remember that!! I wanted to remember you the way you were when you, your girlfriend and I went for a movie in JB, and then seafood supper.  I wanted to remember you the way you were when when you were driving.  I wanted to remember you the way you were when you were explaining why the forever friends bear I gave you was back facing up on your hand break.  I wanted to remember you the way you were when you let me ride pillion on your bike...<br><br>But do you know what?? I'm really really sorry because no matter how hard I try to recall your face, the image that comes to my mind is the stupid black and white photo and the image of you lying in the coffin!!! I hate myself for not having an alive image of you!! Do you know that when I saw you in the coffin, I told myself that that was not you?? It didn't even look like you!!! They must have found someone who looks just a little like you and tried to pass it off as you!!<br><br>I still can't believe that you are actually, gone, forever, and that I will never be able to hear your voice, hear your laughter, hear your stupid sarcastic, act smart comments, ride with you on your bike, sit in your car, talk to you!!!! Charles........... Do you know how much I miss you and long to just talk to you one more time?? Just one more time, at least let me say good bye...... I really wished that you were here........................</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Charles,<br><br>Why is it that I cannot feel you? Why is it that people say that when loved ones die and we need them, they will be around, either as angels or just around and we can feel it but since your death, no matter how hard I try, I cannot feel you?? Are you angry with me?? Or have you gone the other way?? But I refuse to believe that you've gone the other way!! You of all people don't deserve it!!<br><br>If you have really gone the other way, is it my fault?? It is all because of that stupid promise I made when I was not in the right mind?? But why??? If only I had not wanted to kill myself on the 14th of Aug, if only I had not promised the devil an addition to hell, if only I had not changed my mind, then you would have lived!!! And I would be the one dead and in hell which is what was suppose to have been!!!<br><br>Can I switch places with you?? You would not have waste the last 6 years the way that I did! I screwed up my life and you would naver have done that!! You were suppose to get married!! I should have been the one who died!! I made the decision to die, I made the promise to Satan, but why did I have to change my mind?? I deserve to die more than you do!<br><br>Charles, how exactly did you die?? How exactly did your bike skid? What were you avoiding?? Till now, they still can't find the cause of your death, what did you see?? Is it because the devil was angry that I had changed my mind and so he decided to send something to distract you and make you skid?? What did you see that made you skid and die??? It was a safe stretch of road!! How could it have been possible??<br><br>Why did you choose to ride your bike that day?? You have a car!! Why did you not drive? you were suppose to meet your fiance right? Why ride? I know you drank before that but I know that you were sober when you got onto your bike!! Why must you insist on getting the number plate 4 for your bikes when you know what negative meanings it has?? Why???<br><br>Why did you appear in Flossie's dream and not mine? Why did you tell her that you were suffering? Was it to tell me that I really caused you to go to hell? But why didn't you just haunt me?? I would give anything to switch places with you, I would give anything to have you come alive again, why must it be this way? Is this the devil's way of torturing me for the rest of my life because I broke my promise? But I cannot take it, I really cannot take it........<br><br>Charles, if you have really gone the other way, how can I get to you?? Does it mean that I have to beg the devils to help me pass notes to you too? Is it possible for you to tell me in any way? Can you please appear in my dreams? I really want to see your face again........ I really want to hear your voice again......... I really miss you so much...... I just want to know how you are now, where you are, what you're doing......... Why can't I just know? Charles, please don't do this to me, you promised me that you would be there for me, you promised! Please just let me know that you are in Heaven, I really need to know... Please forgive me for doing this to you, you know that I would give anything to have you back alive......... Please.................</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Charles... ...<br><br>I want to apologize for being so worked up yesterday, it's just that I really feel guilty for your death... ... Your death was like a nuclear bomb that was dropped right smack into my face... ... ... ... ... ...<br><br>I have a lot to say, a lot to tell you, 6 years' worth but I can't just dump everything onto you now, I've caused you enough... ... I will always remember what you said, I may not remember your face as it was when you were alive but I will always remember your words... ... You were and are the only one who trully understood me, was it because you were 15 years older than me? Maybe, most likely... ...<br><br>I injured my knee in Sec 4, do you know? And I used the crutches you used when you injured your knee also... ... Remember the time you were explaining the procedures of your operation? I told you that I understood what you were saying but in actual fact I did not understand a single word you were saying... ... It was only when I injured my own knee that I understood what you were talking about... You injured your left  knee right? I injured my right, ligament also... Guess it's fate... ...<br><br>Your father drives your car now, or rather he was driving your car when I last saw and when I looked into the car, the forever friends bear I gave you was thrown into the back seat, not at the hand break where you left it.  Actually I had wanted to take it after your funeral but Flossie told me not to.  She told me to leave it there so you could find it in case you came back but I think now I can go take it right? At least then I will have something that represents what was between us... ...<br><br>Remember the Minnie Mouse top you gave me? It was the only thing you ever gave me just like the FF bear was my ony present to you... Well, I was upset that time when I found out that it was actually bought for your girlfriend and you only gave me because you had broken up with her and I happened to need a top. Because I was upset, I did not wear it much... And because I did not wear it much, my mum gave it away!! I was SO pissed off with her because she had not asked for my permission before giving it away... I was so pissed I think I didn't talk to her for a few days...<br><br>Remember your birthday? I wore a pair of red jeans, and a mid-riff top with a red checked long sleeved top and you wore a pair of blue jeans and a blue checked top? We like SO flipped when we found out we were dressed so similiar! Ha ha... That was one day! All because of your one U2 shirt we had to ride all around Singapore just to get it, what a way of celebrating your birthday! But I will never forget it... ... Never... ...<br><br>I still remember your comment about me walking in heels... "There are people who walk better in high heels that you." Well, I didn't say anything then but like hello?? I was only 15?? The people you knew were probably like 20+? How could you compare?<br><br>I also remember you explaining why the FF bear was back facing up and had its shirt lifted up... ... Will never forget the reasoning you gave me, was so touched... ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It was the morning you sent me to Chinese High for my sports meet on your way to work after I stayed over... Still remember you made me sleep on the couch! You creep! Didn't even offer me the bed! But you tucked me in, so it was ok.. Ha ha...<br><br>Charles, I seem milder today, not reprimanding you, not blaming you, at least not seriously, but that's maybe because I am tired... ... I really miss you,miss your voice, miss your laughter, miss your company...<br><br>I still remember what you said: "I'm sure you will be able to find someone who will be able to understand you better than me." Well, the truth is that up till now I have yet to find someone who can understand me better than you do, maybe that is why I am missing you more, because I just broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year 5 months precisely because he did not understand me... You know that the most important thing to me is that my boyfriend/husband understands me... And yet... ... Sigh... ...<br><br>How I wish that I could talk to you again... I have forgotten how you sound like! How could I?! Sigh... ... Ok, I should stop sighing because I remember you said that I sigh too much... ... How I wished that I could just see you, talk to you, hear you laugh just one more time, just once... ... But I know that it can never happen, you are gone forever... And it's really forever, no matter how hard I pray, no matter how much I wished, you won't come back... How I wish I had talked to you more, how I wish I had gone out with you more, how I wish I had spent more time with you, how I wish I had listened to you more... ... How I wish, how I wish, how I wish... ... ... ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Charles,<br><br>made a major decision today, which is why I decided to tell you... Actually I decided it last night but I only started acting on it today. I've decided to change my outlook on life. As in, change the way I look at life, the way I view everything, the way I deal with things. I have been too emotional and I have always thought that it was just me and refused to believe that I could change and that people would just have to accept me the way I am. I have always thought that I sufferred from depression and have always used that as an excuse. But I just realised that like I said, those were just excuses.<br><br>I need to learn to change and not be so emotional and not get influenced by everything so easily. Not everything is as important as it seems. I have to learn to always look on the bright side of life and not to take everything so seriously.  And yet, i also have to take certain aspects of my life more seriously.  As in I have to learn to be more responsible for my own actions and not blame what happens to me on others.<br><br>I don't know whether you get wat I mean but I think that you know enough to understand. I also know that change is not an overnight thing. I've always talked about the need to change myself but have not been able to. I believe that it has been because I only knew that I needed to change but did not know what was it that I needed to change. Now I more or less know or rather finally acknowledged what I sort of knew all along what I need to change.<br><br>I know that it is not easy, which is why I am asking that you watch over me and help me in any way you can. I know that you will be so proud of me if I succeed. Maybe that was what you were trying to say to me all along? Anyway, I just felt that I needed to tell you because I know that if you knew you would be happy that your wilful cousin is finally moving on in her life. Just a few days ago I was feeling like my life has come to a standstill but now I know that it is finally moving on.<br><br>Thank you for always listening. Thank you.........</div>
