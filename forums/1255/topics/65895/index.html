            <div class='col-md body'>I'm posting this on behalf of a friend(Hey...1 can't write 2 love story at 1 time rite?)<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>'The Beginning' by Venus<br><br>I have a story to tell. A story of Love (at least thatÂ¡Â¦s what everyone thinks it is.)<br><br>My life is full of lies, broken friendships, quarrels and troubles. But no matter how bad it seems, they made me grow more sensitive of love, compassion and humility. When I was still studying, I would go to school only to study the heck out of myself to achieve a better and more prosperous future. I canÂ¡Â¦t say IÂ¡Â¦m good-looking though I did chance upon a few girls who had crushes on me. IÂ¡Â¦m just clean (thatÂ¡Â¦s good enough, yes?).<br><br>Anyway, hereÂ¡Â¦s where the second main character appears in this story. Sarah. 15, a year younger than I, with the most amazing eyes, long-flowing shiny hair (though the school rules ruined the image because she needs to tie it up... darn), lips as red as a bleeding rose, nose so small that it brings out the pout of her lips, and lastly, a body and built that were the objects of envy of all the girls. Naturally what follows this Snow White would usually be a whole bunch of boys just breathing her lovely floral scent or just simply to see her looking backwards in puzzlement (not as if she really doesn't know what were they doing...) Nevertheless, I too, an Average Joe in my final year (despite the humongous competition) fell in love with her.<br><br>Then one stormy morning, God answered my prayers, I finally got to see her face to face, and also spoke to her without anyone around us for the first time! I still remembered those initial words that came out of those soft tender lips, Â¡Â§Oh hey Eugene! Wet day huh?Â¡Â¨ With that she smiled, with teeth so dazzling and dimples so perfect that I couldnÂ¡Â¦t blink. Yes, here comes the most embarrassing part. I stared at her with my mouth open for a very long time before replying abruptly,Â¡Â¨Sorwee, Wha-di-ya-sai?Â¡Â¨ At this point you readers would probably think I blew this opportunity huh? Think again people! She smiled even more widely and raised her eyebrows in a curious way before speaking again. Â¡Â§Oh hey you want me to walk you to the vending machine for a drink to cool off that dry throat of yours?Â¡Â¨ With that, my heart flew as those words rang in my ears. Did I hear it right? I nodded profusely - which almost rhymed with my heart-beat beating underneath my skin.<br><br>As we turned towards the direction to the canteen together, a hand suddenly broke though the small comfort zone just between us grabbing SarahÂ¡Â¦s shoulder. Â¡Â§Sarah! CalvinÂ¡Â¦s looking for you. About the big date after school?Â¡Â¨ It was then my legs stiffened. Calvin? The famous playboy-Brad-Pitt-look-alike? Going out with my Sarah! Her expression turned serious before giving an apologetic smile. Â¡Â§Oh that, right, IÂ¡Â¦m sorry Eugene, got to go straight to my class now.Â¡Â¨ Then she turned and walked off, alongside with Yun Lei, her best friend and the destroyer of that moment. That was the first contact we had! Maybe it might be a beginning of something Â¡K<br><br>-Venus<br><br>More coming along...<br></div>
