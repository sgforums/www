            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">This lesson explains one of the widely used training exercise for beginner voice training.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is the method better known as "Blow Bubbles". And it really works.</strong></span><br><br>It's hard to explain in words, but generally you blow out with your lips closed gently, with the air sending your lips rattling in a 'bub-bub-bub-bub-bub' fashion.<br><br>I usually have a hard time convincing students to do this; it does feels pretty funny and irrelevant. However, just being able to do the bubbling, along with singing notes in it, is a major step in training your voice to sing, or for some, re-training your voice to recover from ill techniques.<br><br>How can one exercise be so 'miracle'? Well, in the first place, it's used by top vocal instructors around the world. Second, it's proven by science. The bubbling exercise works in 2 ways.<br><br>1) Just 'bub-bub-bub' with no sound works your diaphram. One MUST use the diaphram in order to do this bubbling. A certain amount of air pressure need to be maintain in your lungs throughout the bubbling process. The diaphram dynamically changes it shape throughout the exhaling process to maintain constant pressure. This is the same process during singing(sustain of notes). If you can't do this, then it's probably time you learn.<br><br>2) After you can bubble, try singing with it. It's not as easy, but it greatly trains your vocal cord it operate in total freedom. For those who simply cannot sing without squeezing your throat or any other weird muscle action around the jawline, this is for you, because any external muscle interference will stop the bubbling process(tense lips and facial muscles). The vocal cord operates in the way it was built for; a vibrating reed with air passing through it. You'll also learn to experience vocal registers(covered in another lesson).<br><br>The exercise is best done with a vocal guide who is familiar with this technique. There are alot of subtles points and variations in this exercises. However, in general,<br>i) The bubbling should be slow and steady, not like a motorboat engine.<br>ii) There should not be a loud hissing sound.<br>iii) You don't have to sing loud.<br>iv) Start with low pitches, working your way up the scale slowly.<br>v) Tuck in your cheeks.<br><br>This exercise is really simple for those who get it, and hell for those who haven't.<br>Feel free to post questions regarding self-practise.</span></div>
