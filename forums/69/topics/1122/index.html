            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, I'll start up a topic.<br><br>As kids, my brother and I, not unlike most other siblings I suspect, played "doctor", or some other game where "you show me yours and I'll show you mine". These games soon lead to "you touch mine and I'll touch yours". The little "adventures" usually happened in the course of everyday play together, &amp; the location ranged anywhere from a bedroom, a garage or tree house.<br><br>As adolescents, still learning about our own bodies, there were frequent "show-and-tell" learning opportunities. As the lessons advanced, they became mutual masturbation sessions. Heavy petting and to oral sex followed quickly thereafter. Vaginal intercourse was too scary. We knew the consequences . . . a pregnancy . . . with mom and dad discovering our little secret.<br><br>By then, those sex games of our youth were replaced by backrubs with wandering hands, or wagers (over just about anything) or a barter system (the earliest form of prostitution)or by dares, (when we were both really horny at the same time). The stakes or payments were some sort of sexual act for the winner (and loser?).<br><br>There really was no regards that what we were doing was "incest" . . . it was just a word meaning "family sex". There was no immorality or taboo attached to it, it was just a word. We figured it was something that most siblings did and never talked about. Besides, it seemed so natural. We had been the best of friends our entire lives, nudity was common in our household, and it was incredible fun!<br><br>As "full-grown" adults, our relationship has remained rock-solid. Unlike our inattentive spouses, my brother and I still give each other therapeutic back-rubs. At times they become very sensual, and occasionally we've found ourselves, well, sort of naked. Sometime guilt and cognitive dissonance would mess with our emotions, based strictly on our collectively being unfaithful to our spouses. During these "rationalization rounds" we'd talk about the human instincts that drew us together, and the fond memories of our innocent, incestuous past. The theoretical positions taken ranged from the moral to the libertarian perspectives on the issue of consensual adult incest. We agreed that our having spouses was the only issue making us feel bad about these sensuous moments.<br><br>When recently, through divorces, our "having spouses" was no longer an issue, and we found ourselves in multiple coital positions and living together in her house. Our friends, parents, and former spouses, believe our living arrangement to be based on convenience and financial efficiency, and are glad we did not rebound into other marriages.<br><br>We know better.<br><br>When my brother was surfing the 'Net and came across some of the many incest forums in cyberspace, we realized we are not the only ones to engage in incest, nor to even have similar living arrangements.<br><br>So, as a creative outlet and supportive tool, we combined my writing ability with his computer skills and created a web site for those, like us, who are actively involved in incestuous relationships or are at least stimulated by the thought. If you are one who falls into either one of these categories, please visit our site at:<br><a href="http://teen.sexplanets.com/watchingsis" rel="nofollow">http://teen.sexplanets.com/watchingsis</a><br><br>There are enhanced photo-essays, hundreds of pictures, an incestuous family's documentary, a club, and even an Incest Toy Store where you can get the entire "TABOO!" movie series.<br><br>Enjoy, and unite!<br></div>
