              </p><p><strong>What really prompts the dog's 'guilty look'</strong></p>
              <p><em>Thursday, June 11, 2009</em><br><br>What dog owner has not come home to a 
              broken vase or other valuable items and a guilty-looking dog slouching around 
              the house? By ingeniously setting up conditions where the owner was misinformed 
              as to whether their dog had really committed an offense, Alexandra Horowitz, 
              Assistant Professor from Barnard College in New York, uncovered the origins of 
              the "guilty look" in dogs in the recently published "Canine Behaviour and 
              Cognition" Special Issue of Elsevier's Behavioural Processes. <br><br>Horowitz 
              was able to show that the human tendency to attribute a "guilty look" to a dog 
              was not due to whether the dog was indeed guilty. Instead, people see 'guilt' in 
              a dog's body language when they believe the dog has done something it shouldn't 
              have â€“ even if the dog is in fact completely innocent of any offense. 
              <br><br>During the study, owners were asked to leave the room after ordering 
              their dogs not to eat a tasty treat. While the owner was away, Horowitz gave 
              some of the dogs this forbidden treat before asking the owners back into the 
              room. In some trials the owners were told that their dog had eaten the forbidden 
              treat; in others, they were told their dog had behaved properly and left the 
              treat alone. What the owners were told, however, often did not correlate with 
              reality. <br><br>Whether the dogs' demeanor included elements of the "guilty 
              look" had little to do with whether the dogs had actually eaten the forbidden 
              treat or not. Dogs looked most "guilty" if they were admonished by their owners 
              for eating the treat. In fact, dogs that had been obedient and had not eaten the 
              treat, but were scolded by their (misinformed) owners, looked more "guilty" than 
              those that had, in fact, eaten the treat. Thus the dog's guilty look is a 
              response to the owner's behavior, and not necessarily indicative of any 
              appreciation of its own misdeeds. <br><br>This study sheds new light on the 
              natural human tendency to interpret animal behavior in human terms. 
              Anthropomorphisms compare animal behavior to human behavior, and if there is 
              some superficial similarity, then the animal behavior will be interpreted in the 
              same terms as superficially similar human actions. This can include the 
              attribution of higher-order emotions such as guilt or remorse to the animal. 
              <br><br>The editor of the special issue, Clive D.L. Wynne of the Department of 
              Psychology, University of Florida, explained, "this is a remarkably powerful 
              demonstration of the need for careful experimental designs if we are to 
              understand the human-dog relationship and not just reify our natural prejudices 
              about animal behavior." He pointed out that dogs are the oldest domesticated 
              species and have a uniquely intimate role in the lives of millions of people. 
              Recent research on dogs has indicated more human-like forms of reasoning about 
              what people know than has been demonstrated even in chimpanzees. <br><br>###
