He said that they were a family consisting of a father, a mother and a son... and it was best we helped them find peace as they were very pitiful...<br><br>i told my colleague that, and i think he did the necessary rites and prayers himself... i was posted out of there a few months later, so i'm not too sure what happened after.....<br><br></div>
