Don think that it is end of the world and she is the only one. NO,NO.. U definitely will find better one in future!</div></blockquote>Maybe i'm not worthy of being one...Ha...1 more thing i realise is girls can say anything when they r interested in u but they can forget everything and become a totally different person when they hav lost the interest in you. 1 example is i remembered she saying to me that we have a long way to go together but now she totally severed all ties with me and want me out of her life so damn bad. I believe it works for both sexes i presume?

Since you cannot give that person happiness, you should be happy that she had found someone who maybe can give her happiness right? So to pple here, normally how will you all feel, when you found out about this kind of things? That person had moved on obviously and had found someone else, while you are still in this moving on stage....<br><br>For me, don't think my feelings for her is so so great that i can be so selfless to feel happy for her. Maybe i will be glad someday, but right now, i'm feeling a bit sad yet happy. Contradicting right? Ha..</div></blockquote>happen too many times liao until numb liao.</div>
