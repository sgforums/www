            <div class='col-md body'>You Promised<br>By : mhcampboy<br><br>A short story about love and promises.  Blinded by distance and distrust.<br>To all whom hearts are torn and healing.  Ever wondered why your love ones left you?  Ever given promises which was empty?<br>Ever felt that you need to given a chance?<br>I dedicate this to you guys. Enjoy and be strong Aight<br><br>Will you wait for me until I come back? I ask K. He said he would.  He proposed for us to be together. I told him to wait until I come back. But he see's no point in waiting and still want us to be together. I said ok.  We kissed and embraced together like there was no tommorow. Our first kiss. Our first hug. It was all magical. It was all real. At the airport, we spent few hours sitting down close to each other, feeling the warmth of love in the cold airport.  We even tried to steal kisses oblivious to our surroundings.  I love you K.  I said.  He replied, I love you too babe.  My soul was complete.  I have been alone for years now.  And so has he. And this was both of us first warmth of love after so long.<br><br>It was time for my flight. We walked slowly to the departure gate. I didn't want to leave him. My mind was twirling at that time.  I wanted to stay. To be there when he needed me most. He was a new person at that time. I shouldn't have leave. I asked him again, will you be there when I come back and still love me? He said with an assuring voice he would.  I smiled. And hugged him goodbye. The hug was supposed to be followed with tears.  But I controlled it.  We waved goodbye.  In my heart, I told myself, I am going to love you with all my heart K.  No matter what happen, I will.  With that, my handphone vibrated.  New message.  It was K.  It read : I love ya... Ya know?  Take care please. I replied saying I love him too.  And I have missed him already. He replied saying, Ok. You know what? I miss you quite a lot.  I was overjoyed seeing that message.  Everyone in the waiting gallery was looking at me differently.  In me right now, was a happy soul.  Never had I been so ecstatic before.  Not even with my ex boyfriend, E.<br><br>There were fine moments with E.  But there were many more heartaches.  He cheated on me countless times.  And yet I forgave him and accepted him back to my life.  I was tormented by his flirtatious ways and abuse.  Physical abuse.  True he does love me.  But he took me for granted.  Why I still accepted time and again if he tortures me so much?  People say I'm stupid.  But I would say, I will never leave love just like that.  My loyalty towards the relationship is strong.  That is why I endured.  As painful as it is.  Once I met few of his friends few months after we broke up.  They said, E told us so many good points about you.  One of it was your enduring loyalty and love towards him.  I smiled knowing that E realises it.  The final blow was when he had an affair with someone for the I do not know how many already times.  That's it.  I have to move on.  I left him.  It was extremely painful.  I told myself never to fall in love again.  And so, I healed my wounds.  And now, I have K in my life.  He promised to love me so much that I will get sick of him saying I love you everyday.  He promised me never to break my heart as how E broke it.  He won't be a bore as E was.  I smile to myself eveytime he says that.  K loves me.  I love K.  And that should be enough to seal the bond of love between us.  I pray for it.  With hopes it will be granted.  I still do pray for it.<br><br>On flight, I thought about him.  Thinking about how happy our future will be.  How amaze he will be when he is showered by my enduring love for him.  My mind was soon focused hours before my departure, at my home.  We talked.  We hugged.  We kissed.  He told me, he is a man of his words.  He will promise to love me forever.  And never to break my heart.  We talked about his life.  His ex.  His time off from life.  And our future.  No matter what state of condition he is in I would still by his side.  He told me to stay.  I didn't reply.  He repeated it again.  I smiled.  I should have stayed.  I really should have just stayed.  I really should.  I'm sorry K.  Can we start over?<br><br>As soon as I landed I was relieved.  I rushed home so that I can get online to check emails from him.  I was pretty sure he will sent it.  And he did.  I smiled..  I clicked on his message.  I read it.  He promised to wait for me.  He promised to be there when I need him most.  Above all he promised to love me.  I replied saying how sucky the plane food was.  And how I am happy seeing his email.  How I missed him already.  I told him I would be online on Yahoo Messenger(YM).  We will chat there like how we used to do back when we were in Singapore. Spending till late nights chatting on YM before on the phone.  I miss those days.  I unpacked my luggage.  And fell asleep.  I guess I was too tired with love.  Thinking of love.  Thinking of you, K.  As I fell asleep, I embraced my pillow like how I would embrace K.  I really love you K.<br><br>We were soon chatting online.  We talked. We chatted so happily.  Not enough with just online.  We talked on the phone.  We were so in love.  So in love till I made a decision.  A decision which soon changed my life.  I didn't care about it.  I just want to be near K.  To embrace him.  I asked him, do you want me to come back now?  Do you want to come back, he replied.  I asked him again, do you?  He said Yes.  I was overjoyed.  I'm coming back to you K.  This distance will soon be over.  I immediately called the airline and inform them of the date changes.  I wanted to go back on that weekend.  Which was 5 days away.  The lady over the phone said, they can't change it.  There is no available seats till about 2 weeks later.  I was saddened.  I told K about it.  He said its ok.  He will still wait.  Alright.  I accepted the date changes.  The airline gave me new flight tickets.  And I am roaring to go home.  Even though it is about two weeks away, I have already started to pack.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Friends once asked me, what do you think of long distance relationship?  I told them it's possible.  They said no.  And boy were they right.  Between that two weeks, no thanks to the time difference and distance, we argued.  I wanted his attention.  He gave it to me.  I guess I was hungry for more.  Well, its normal I guess as we were 20 000km apart.  But over that arguement, I still love him lots.  My love blossomed.  I was missing him more.  I want him to be near me so badly that I cried.<br><br>Suddenly a turn of event took place.  I had waited all day for his call.  When suddenly he said, I got to go.  My "brothers" need me now.  I was shocked.  Or maybe I was selfish.  I didn't want him to put down the phone.  I waited a long time just to talk to him.  He said he has to go and immediately put down the phone.  I tried calling him back.  I message him.  All to no avail.  I was heartbroken.  I saw him later online, I asked him what happened.  He told me everything.  I said I was sorry if I acted differently.  He smiled.  We were both in love.<br><br>Couple of days before my flight back, the same thing happened.  We just got on the phone together.  When he said, he will do something which I will be angry at.  He has to go.  His "brothers" is waiting for him at his place.  They need his help.  I went hysterical.  He put down the phone on me. And I did something which I regretted doing.  Tears fell as I typed.  I said things I shouldn't have in the email.  I compared him with my ex.  I doubted him.  I made him choose between his friends and me.  Things which he hated.  I was pondering like crazy whether to send the email or not.  I clicked "send".  Rightaway I went hysterical again, finding ways to actually get back the email.  I knew there was no hope left.  But I still tried anyway.  All I can do now is to wait for him.  I am sorry.<br><br>When I saw him on YM, I asked him how is he.  I said I'm sorry.  He said, I think it's best if we are not together.  I was dismayed.  He said he loves me too much that I do not want to see you get hurt again in the future.  I explained.  I tried to make amends.  I said I was sorry.  I was begging back for him.  I have stooped so low as to begged for him.  He told we talk about this when I come back.  I didn't sleep that night.  I tossed and turn.  I love you K.  Please do not leave me.  Please don't.  Please do not break up with me.<br><br>When I reached Singapore, I rushed out of immigration as fast as I could.  As I went down the steps to the baggage conveyor belt, I couldn't find him.  He is not around.  He doesn't want to fetch me.  I sighed.  I waited patiently for my luggage.  As I turned around, there he was.  With that smile on his face.  The same smile when I first saw him.  I was overjoyed.  I wanted to cry.  Tears of happiness.  He is there.  I told myself.  This is it.  Say sorry.  And do not ever do it again.  I am sure he will forgive you.  Distance and anger can always make people decide indecisively.  Now that I am back, things will be much normal and better.  Or so I thought.  I got out from the gate and hugged him.  We didn't say any word.  We just looked at each other and smiled.  I guess the feeling of akwardness is still around.<br><br>We went back to my place.  I kissed him.  We embraced each other tightly.  He said he was sorry.  He told me to cherish this moment.  I was stunned.  Speechless.  I cried.  I asked why.  I asked for another chance.  He was still adamant to his decision.  It won't change anything he said.  Just cherish the day babe.  He said.  I cried.  No K.  Please don't leave me.  I came back just for you.  You shouldn't have judge me when we were far apart.  You must wait until I come back and let our bonding begins then you can start judging.  You promised to be there for me and love me and cherish me.  You promised K.  YOU PROMISED.  I cried.  I begged him to give me another chance.  You cannot do this I said.  I have decided to come back long before the email that I sent.  You should have waited for me.  He told me, things change after the email I sent.  I told him you cannot judge a person like that.  Not when we have yet to be together.  I asked him whether he still loves me.  He said yes.  I love you too.  Please open your heart.  Please K. Open it and see the real truth.<br><br>He spent the night with me.  The night was filled with tears, joy, warmth, sadness and love.  When the day comes, he will leave me.  I asked him why must he do this.  His reasons wasn't strong enough.  And somehow, I felt that wasn't the entire truth.  I was determined to find out the reason.  For I love him so much.  And since he loves me, why must he do this?  There is always a way to solve a problem.  There is always a way.  Before he left, I look at him sympathetically.  I still asked myself at that time, why is all this happening?  He smiled and left.  I broke down.  Never have I faced a defeat such as this.  Never have I loved a person so strong as this.  Why didn't he feel it?<br><br>I spent the next few days thinking.  About what I should do.  About me.  About him.  I still love him.  I missed him alot.  Only God knows the torture I am in.  I truly miss him.  Does he still miss me?  I hope he does.  I called him.  I asked him again why he is he doing all this.  He told me the same reason.  He doesn't want to hurt me.  All I want is the truth.  The truth hurts.  But untruth hurts even more.  Finally he relented.  He told me what I had feared.  He has a new other half.  His new lover.  I was stunned.  Something hitted back at me.  Something painful.  Something which I want to avoid.  My past.  I tried to calm myself down and asked him questions.  Questions which I know won't be answered truthfully by him.  Questions which will tear my heart even more.  Why K?  Why?  You Promised to love only me.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I asked him to meet me.  We met up.  We talk.  I tried to relay my defence point.  I tried to explained why he should not leave me.  I tried to let him see the real love and truth and dedication.  I tried to let him see my loyalty towards love.  He was silent.  All he said was,  It will not change anything.  I got angry.  Why?  I wanted to slap him.  But I can't bear to.  He wanted to leave.  I don't want you to go. I said.  I held him tight.  He struggled.  He broke free.  And he walked away from me.  I spent 15 seconds thinking.  Before I finally chased after him.  I love you K.  Please do not leave me.  Please give me a chance.  You have yet to see my true love.  He tried to avoid me and finally ran away from me.  I was so sad seeing him run.  Why is he running away from a love which he has accepted?  Why?  12 mins after the incident, he called me asking how am I.  Is that a sign of pity?  Or love?  I do not pity.<br><br>I was sad.  He has a new lover.  And here I am being tormented.  How could you be so heartless?  How could you make me come back to you only to be rejected by you?  Why is your love hiding from me?  You asked me time and again what you should do.  Well, you should make it right.  You must love our relationship even though we had our arguements.  I said.  That way you won't feel so angry over it.  Maybe I should have done that, he replied.  Over the days, we chatted on msn and on phone.  Almost everytime I feel happy to hear your voice, angry to hear your link with your new lover and sad to see you go.  You promised me so many things.  From living together.  To watching dvd's.  Even to do business on the computer  together.  You wanted to have a new future with me.  You promised me that.  And now, you have your new love.  I'm sure you promised the same thing to your new lover as well.  You treated me like a fool.  How can you be so heartless K?  How could you?<br><br>I roam around trying to find peace.  I broke down a lot.  I cried a lot.  All this while he is having fun with his new other half.  You told me you still love me.  You told me you missed me.  Yet, you are blinded by your own love.  I'm suffering from anxiety disorder already.  I suffered heart palpation.  Soon I think, depression will sets in.  K, you have no idea how hard it is for me to carry on living normally.  And so, I told him, I will always wait for you K.  As I have given my heart to you.  I am not the person to fall in love with another person so easily.  My heart is with you now.  Be happy with your life.  I may cry.  I may be hurt.  But I forgive you.  For my love is pure and strong.  But all I hope for is for you to see the real light.  If you miss me and my presence, just meet me ok.  I will not disturb you anymore.  I won't interfere in your life.  But all I asked is for you to make things right.  And honour my love and cherish my sacrifice for you.  Same goes for me.  That was my message for him.  Then I moved on walking to an empty and dark road.  Walking aimlessly.  With love as my strength.  And sadness as my aid.  And wounds as my memories.  Remember how tortured you felt when your ex, N, left you?  Thats how I am now.  I am defeated.  But you are worth my tears.<br><br>Just honour your promises please.  Though our story is at the end,  I may still think of you know and then.  I promised to love you.  And I will.  And I will wait.  I will.  I do not know whether its my love.  I do not know whether  its my patience.  But somehow I do know  I will wait.<br><br>The past is so familiar.  But that's why you couldn't stay.  Too many ghosts.  Too many haunted dreams.  Besides you already find your own way.   But after all this time,  I thought we would still hold on.  But when I reach for you and search your eyes, I see you've already gone.  Thats ok.  I'll be fine.  I got myself, I heal in time.  But when you leave just remember what we've had.  There's more to life than just you.  I may cry but I'll make it thru.  Even though I know the sun won't shine again, I may still think of you now and then.<br><br>One day, may our two paths joined as one.  I love you K.  And I know you still do too.<br><br>Story Ends Here.  But The Love Continues.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
