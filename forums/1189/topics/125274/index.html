            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">I was born in a secluded village of a mountain.<br>Days by days my parents plowed the yellow dry soil with their backs facing the sky. I have a younger brother, 3 years younger than me.<br><br>Once, to buy a handkerchief which all girls around me seemed to have,<br>I stole 50 cents from my father's drawer. Father known about it right  away.<br><br>He made my younger brother and me kneeled against the wall, with a  bamboo stick in his hand.<br><br>"Who stole the money?" he asked.<br>I was stunned, too afraid to talk. Father didn't hear any of us admit,<br>so he said, "Fine, if nobody wants to admit, you two should be<br>beaten!" He lifted up the bamboo stick.<br><br>Suddenly, my younger brother gripped father's hand and said," Dad, I<br>was the one who did it!"<br><br>The long stick smacked on my brother's back repeatedly.<br><br>Father was so angry that he kept on whipped my brother until he lost<br>his breath.<br><br>After that, he sat down on our stone bed and scolded my brother, "You<br>have learnt to steal from your own house now, what other embarrassing<br>things you will do in the future?? You should be beaten to death! You<br>shameless thief!"<br><br>That night, mother and I hugged my brother. His body full of injuries, but he didn't shed a single tear.<br><br>In the middle of the night, all of sudden I cried out loudly. My brother covered my mouth with his little hand and said, " Sis, now don't cry anymore. Everything has happened."<br><br>I still hate myself for didn't have enough courage to admit what I had done.<br><br>Years gone by, but the incident still looked like it just happened yesterday.<br><br>I will never forget my brother's expression when he protected me. That<br>year, my brother was 8 years old; I was 11 years old.<br><br>When my brother was in his last year of his lower secondary school, he<br>was accepted in an upper secondary school in the central. At the same<br>time, I was accepted into a province's university.<br><br>That night, father squatted in the yard, smoking, packet by packet. I<br>could hear him said, "Both our children have good results? very good results?"<br><br>Mother wiped off her tears and sighed," What is the use? How can we<br>possibly finance both of them?"<br><br>At that time, my brother walked out, he stood in front of father and said, "Dad, I don't want to continue my study anymore, I have read<br>enough books." Father swung his hand and slapped brother on his face.<br><br>"Why do you have a spirit so damn weak? Even if it means I have to beg<br>for money on the streets, I will send you two to school until you both<br>finish your study!" And then, he started to knock on every house in<br>the village to borrow money.<br><br>I stuck out my hand as soft as I can to my brother's swollen face, and<br>said, "A boy has to continue his study; If not, he will not be able to<br>leave this depths of poverty."<br><br>Me, on the other hand, had decided not to further my study to university.<br><br>Who knows on the next day, before dawn, my brother left the house with<br>a few pieces of worn-out clothes and a few dry beans. He sneaked to<br>the side of my bed and left a note on my pillow;<br><br>"Sis, get into an university is not easy. I will go find a job and send money to you."<br><br>I held the note while sitting on my bed, and cried until I lost my voice.<br><br>That year, my brother was 17 years old; I was 20 years old. With the<br>money father borrowed from the whole village, and money my brother<br>earned from carrying cement on his back at construction site, finally,<br>I managed carrying cement on his back at construction site, finally, I managed to get to the third year of my study in the university.<br><br>One day, I was studying in my room, when my roommate came in and told<br>me, "There's a villager wait for you outside!"<br><br>Why is there a villager looking for me? I walked out, and saw my<br>brother from afar, His whole body is dirty, covered by dust, cement<br>and sands. I asked him, "Why don't you tell my roommate that you are<br>my brother?"<br><br>He replied with a smile," Look at my appearance. What will they think<br>if they know that I am your brother? Don't they laugh at you?"<br><br>I felt so touched, and tears filled my eyes. I swept away dusts from<br>my brother's body. And said with a lump in my throat, " I don't care<br>of what people say! You are my brother no matter what your appearance<br>is?"<br><br>From his pocket, he took out a butterfly hair clip. He wore it on me,<br>and said, "I saw all the girls in town are wearing it. So, I think you<br>should also have one."<br><br>I could not hold back myself anymore. I pulled my brother into my arms<br>and cried and cried.<br><br>That year, my brother was 20 years old; I was 23 years old. The first<br>time I brought my boyfriend home, the broken window had been repaired.<br><br>And it looked so clean inside the house.<br><br>After, my boyfriend went home, I danced like a small girl in front of<br>my mother, "Mom, you don't have to spend so many time cleaning the<br>house!" But she said with a smile," It was your brother who went home<br>early to clean the house. Didn't you see the wound on his hand? He was<br>injured while replacing the<br>window."<br><br>I went into my brother's small bedroom. Looking at his thin face, I<br>felt like there are hundreds of needles pricked in my heart.<br><br>I put some ointment on his wound and bandaged it,<br>"Does it hurt? " I asked him.<br>"No, it doesn't hurt. You know, when I was working in the construction<br>site, stones falling on my feet all the time. Even that could not stop<br>me from working and?"<br><br>In the middle of the sentence, he stopped. I turned my back on him and<br>tears rolling down my face.<br><br>That year, my brother was 23 years old; I was 26 years old.<br><br>After I got married, I lived in the city. Lots of time my husband<br>invited my parents to come and live with us, but they didn't want.<br><br>They said, once they left the village,they didn't know what to do.<br><br>My brother also didn't agree, he said, "Sis, you just taking care of<br>your parents-in-law. I will take care of mom and dad here."<br><br>My husband became the director of his factory. We wanted my brother to<br>get the job as the manager in the department of maintenance. But, my<br>brother rejected the offer. He insisted on starting to work as a<br>reparation worker.<br><br>One day, my brother was on the top of a ladder repairing a cable, when<br>he got electrocuted, and was sent to the hospital.<br><br>My husband and I visited him. Looked at the white gypsum on his leg, I<br>grumbled, "Why did you reject to be a manager? Manager will not do<br>something dangerous like this. Look at you now, such a serious injury. Why you didn't want to listen to us?"<br><br>With a serious expression on his face, he defended on his decision,<br>"Think of brother-in-law?he just became the director, and I almost<br>uneducated. If I became the manager, what kind of rumors will fly  around?"<br><br>My husband's eyes filled up with tears, and then I said, "But you lack<br>in education also because of me!"<br>"Why talking about the past?" My brother held my hand.<br><br>That year, he was 26 years old and I was 29 years old<br><br>My brother was 30 years old when he married a farmer girl from the village.<br><br>In his wedding reception, the master of ceremonies asked him, "Who is<br>the one you respect and love the most?"<br><br>Without thinking, he answered," My sister." He continued by telling a<br>story I could not even remember.<br><br>"When I was in primary school, the school was in different village.<br>Everyday, my sister and I walked for 2 hours to go school and go home.<br>One day, I lost one of my pair of gloves. My sister gave me one of<br>hers. She only wore one glove and walked for so far. When we got home,<br>her hand was so trembled because of the weather that was so cold that<br>she could not even hold her chopsticks. From that day on, I swore that<br>as long as I live, I would take care of my sister and be good to her."<br><br>Applause filled up the room. All guests turned their attentions to me.<br><br>Words were so hard to come out from my mouth, "In my whole life, the<br>one I would like to thank the most is my brother,"<br><br>And in this happy occasion, in front of the crowd, tears rolling down<br>my face again.<br>Love and care for the one you love every single days of your life. You<br>may think what you did is just a small deed, but to that someone, it<br>may mean a lot. Have a nice day everyone! May this story inspire you<br>in any way! Friends Forever! </span></div>
