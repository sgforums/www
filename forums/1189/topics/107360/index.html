            <div class='col-md body'>*~* ?: got this off my email... enjoy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>regards<br>foga<br><br>The honeymoon stage is over. It's time to take off those rose-tinted glasses.<br><br>All of a sudden, the little habits of your other half irritate you big time. New problems surface and you guys are arguing about the same things over and over again.<br><br>Don't worry, we spot the common relationship problems and offer solutions so that you can cope like a pro and strengthen that relationship.<br><br>1- Disagreements<br>Everything becomes a point of disagreement which leads to a heated argument. Matters which has nothing to do with you or your relationship (eg: your sister's hairstyle or the bus route) are topics which spoil the night. This is not right.<br><br>What to do:<br>Wake up! Skip the topic and cut the argument short. Learn to read the signs or know what triggers the anger. Maybe (yes, maybe) the root of the problem lies deeper than the topic of argument. Listen and start figuring out what is it really that starts the irritation.<br><br>2- I trust you.. (not)<br>The green eye monster emerges every time you check the hot babe or hunk in that corner. Ok, maybe you didn't do it that obviously, it was just a mere glance. I mean, after all, you were just admiring the results of evolution- which happened to produce better looking specimens. Well, your partner has to understand that a casual glace at the eye candy available is different from you pursing them.<br><br>What to do:<br>Allow the checking out of eye candy be a fun game where both of you can indulge in. Maybe it will make him/her realize that noticing attractive people is a perfectly natural thing to do.<br><br>3- Romance is not in the Air. (anymore)<br>I call it 'Couple-doom'. All you guys seem to do is to watch the movies or the TV. In one word- Boring. Well, someone's got to heat things up a little- bring the sparks back.<br><br>What to do:<br>Plan a romantic night out. It shows that you've put some thought to romance your partner. We've got plenty of articles which you can draw your inspiration from. Enjoy.<br><br>4- Honey, I want my space.<br>After being seen as an inseparable couple (yes, her friends call you on your mobile to talk to her), you are starting to feel stifled and you desperately need some space of your own. Of course you still love her, but you just want your 'alone' time.<br><br>We Say:<br>ClichÃ© as it may sound, the codeword here is: quality time. Hanging out together doing nothing isn't as fun as it seems after a while. Plan something for the night or do some activity together- make every minute count. Encourage her to take up a new activity so that you can have your space. Plus, if you don't see each other that often, you will actually look forward to seeing her the next time.<br><br>5- Workaholics Alert!<br>You may have lots of work to do, (or maybe you're just too in love with your job), and you're neglecting him/her. The understanding or empathy shown would be short-lived, trust me.<br><br>What to do:<br>Increase your productivity at the office or school. Clear a few evenings and spend time with her. Make an effort to give her the attention she needs.<br><br>Try and organize your lunch hours to see each other more during your workweek. If you work or study close to each other, hop in the MRT and take her out for lunch.</div>
