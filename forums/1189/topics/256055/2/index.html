            <div class='col-md body'>The feeling of emptiness is because you have not found and loved yourself yet, hence your need for someone to fill that void......<br><br>Take time out on your own to meditate and appreciate yourself for who you truly are. This is easier said than done. But once you succeed, you'll want to find a companion to love and share your happiness and not because you want the emptiness/loneliness inside you to be filled......

            <div class='col-md body'>what you are doing now is, telling everyone, including yourself, that you are trying to forget him and move on. but what you are really doing is lying to yourself and everyone else, cause you arent moving on.<br><br>accept the fact that memories are there to stay, they will not disappear at a snap of your fingers. but do remember, memories are memories. if everyone were to behave like you, thinking because they remember their memories = not moved on, i guess this whole world nobody moved on at all.<br><br>cherish your old memories as they were sweet and all. why do you keep telling  yourself that "I AM NOT MOVING ON!!!" or something along that line. self fulfilling prophecy. the more u think u cant do it, the more u cant do it. instead think, OK! WE ARE FRIENDS NOW! BETTER FRIENDS THAN ENEMIES. talk talk sing song. and move on.<br><br>dont force yourself to look search find man on purpose. you are defying your heart. let it rest. wait for the right person to come at the right time.<br><br>how do you know you are not healing when you do not know what others mean by time heals all wounds? can you see the wound on your emotions? like how deep and how much of it is healed?<br><br>i think, correct me if i am wrong. there are a few signs of healing.<br><br>1 u can talk to that person, nicely, drawing the line clear that u 2 are friends.<br>2 u will not keep thinking of him daily, hourly, minutely, secondly. occasionally will think of the past memories but other than that u can live life normally.<br>3 putting up a false strong front will only hurt u more. it is like having a cut on yourself and adding salt on it, then shouting out NO PAIN NO PAIN!!! instead, accept the fact u might still have feelings for him, and let your heart rest. accept that although u still like him, but fate is up. forcing yourself to think that u dont like him is of no use.<br><br>aiya i dont know how to say. haha. advice also like rubbish so messy.<br>dont care how long u 2 together ,what matters is u 2 were together.<br><br>sorry cant really help much.</div>
