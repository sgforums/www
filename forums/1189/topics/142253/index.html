Why you? After everything you have done?<br><br>Come on, nobody forced you to do all these things. Stop going round the bend, letting your brain roll and roll and roll, again.<br><br>You could have stopped your relationship long before.<br>Be honest, a few times you had signals that it was not working out. Why did you stay? Because you were addicted. The wind was just blowing too fast.<br><br>Now stop whining. Move your bottom. Get up &amp; go back to the top.<br><br></div>

This guide will serve you as a survival-kit. You are given a compass, a map, and a lighter to find your way in the night and get warm with a fire till you get back.<br><br>First of all, it's not your fault nor the pilot's or the team, the wind was just blowing too fast. By thinking so, you will stop negative energy and focus on your survival. Your mind carries you back in the past. You keep analyzing your mistakes. Your mind can accuse your partner, your relative or yourself for not having done the right thing at the right moment. But the only thing we want is for you to look ahead and come home.<br><br>Stop looking behind you, look ahead. Your energy is limited, so use it for coming back behind our lines. Full stop. Is that clear?<br><br>Now, you're strong. You're gonna fight! You'll see. It works!<br><br><span style="color: brown;">"DON'T follow your instinct - and DON'T obey your heart" </span><br><br>Common sentences don't apply to you anymore because you left the common world. You're driving in a tunnel in fire with black smoke all around. Oxygen will be missing in a few minutes. Be aware of that. Common driving code doesn't apply to you anymore.

Think about Hawaii, planets, or whatever you like.<br><br>Get a visual trainer, and solid visual support, with a strong image. It could be the picture of a climber, a sportsman or famous person, somebody who faced difficulty and triumphed. You can get a poster, put it in your room, so that it kicks your blues in the morning or when you get back home. Or a small picture and you use it as a bookmark.<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><br>Avoid triggers</span><br><br>Stay away from romantic movies. Consider, it's like cheese when you're on a diet. Avoid anything which is not action or which leave your mind wander away.<br>Avoid places which bring back memories. Restaurants, streets, bars, districts. Avoid your common territory for a while. I remember a time when I was going to a park, and just getting to that park could make my stomach like a brick. Once there, I was wondering between 2 destinations. And I was undecided for 5, 10 minutes till the next cab. You tend to have special memories, you build up your own space, your own territory where you feel comfortable and good no matter what.<br>Avoid these moments, and all these factors which trigger your broken heart like an arrow in a bleeding wound. Avoid triggers like the plague.<br><br>Out of sight, out of mind.<br><br></div>

Then try 20 minutes.<br>Don't start to eat 1 chocolate bar every minute. The best way to get back in the tracks is to be competitive. Allow yourself, 1 week, no more than 7 days for food revenge. After that, become stronger and stronger.<br><br>You have to clear your system. Unhappiness comes because your system is delivering sad hormones over and over. There's a break in your good- mood system, and you have to repair it. The sooner the better. By exercising every day, you will clean your body and charge yourself in positive energy. When the balance is stabilized, you will get back your harmony. You will be able to be happy again.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Have a physical activity once a day</span><br><br>Learn French, music, anything. Set some goals. In 1 month you will have to know the basics in Spanish, in French, marketing, IT, new software, whatever you want, whatever is your challenge.<br><br>In France, they say "le travail, c'est la sante". It means "work, it's health". Something said, of course, when going to work is a pain in the neck, but work does help you not to let your mind wander around. Physical activity, or just suppressing idleness are a fantastic help for self-esteem, balance and harmony.<br><br></div>

You're just trying to talk about it, because it pleases you, but in a negative way to get rid of your reproach. Get rid of them with your closest friends if you feel like it. But don't bring that forever.<br>Every time you speak about it, you reprint images in your brain. These images make you suffer.

Wash your brain. Think about Hawaii, planets, or whatever you like.<br><br>Get a visual trainer, and solid visual support, with a strong image. It could be the picture of a climber, a sportsman or famous person, somebody who faced difficulty and triumphed. You can get a poster, put it in your room, so that it kicks your blues in the morning or when you get back home. Or a small picture and you use it as a bookmark.<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><br>Avoid triggers</span><br><br>Stay away from romantic movies. Consider, it's like cheese when you're on a diet. Avoid anything which is not action or which leave your mind wander away.<br>Avoid places which bring back memories. Restaurants, streets, bars, districts. Avoid your common territory for a while. I remember a time when I was going to a park, and just getting to that park could make my stomach like a brick. Once there, I was wondering between 2 destinations. And I was undecided for 5, 10 minutes till the next cab. You tend to have special memories, you build up your own space, your own territory where you feel comfortable and good no matter what.<br>Avoid these moments, and all these factors which trigger your broken heart like an arrow in a bleeding wound. Avoid triggers like the plague.<br><br>Out of sight, out of mind.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>more ways<br><br>1. Throw a small party. The fun of letting loose and being surrounded with your close friends can make anyone feel better.<br><br>2. Gather everything that reminds you of your past love and put it in a box specifically for this. Then give it to a friend or store it somewhere where you won't see or think about it. When you're ready you can either throw away the box or keep it for memory's sake.<br><br>3. Start a new exercise or well-being plan. It never hurts to take time to look good!<br><br>4. Start a daily journal, even if it's on your computer. Somewhere everyday take the time to jot down whatever comes to mind. The idea in starting a journal is not to write cleverly or even about anything important. Just write (or type) whatever comes to mind even if your journal starts to look like this: "Went shopping yesterday for a new book oh yea need to e-mail Susan, the flowers on that window sill need watering." The point of your journal is to clear your thoughts. In a few weeks you will be able to read your entries to discover new things and trends about yourself.<br><br>5. Join a new interest group. It's never to early too meet new friends and, at least this way, you'll already have one thing in common.<br><br>6. Learn something new. Take a foreign language or art course, or buy a how-to computer program.<br><br>7. Pick out an inspirational book or movie to read or watch whenever you start feeling down or depressed.<br><br>8. Take yourself out on a date, even if it's a night alone watching your favorite programs and eating your favorite foods.<br><br>9. Do the things you said you always wanted to do when you were with your partner but somehow never did.<br><br>10. Get a new look.<br><br>11. Pick up a calendar and fill out the next 3 months with social events you'd like to attend or things you'd like to do. Browse your city's web site or the entertainment section of your local newspaper to find out ideas, dates and times.<br><br>12. Spend a "comfy" day. Get out your favorite comfy clothes, pillow, blanket, etc. and just spend the day relaxing doing whatever you want!<br><br>13. Get a pet or plant to take care of.<br><br>14. Rent a few romantic movies or read a few romance novels to remind yourself that love does still have happy endings.<br><br>15. Write a goodbye poem or letter. Then stick it in a bottle and throw it out in the sea or attach it to a helium balloon to be carried away.<br><br>16. Do something you wouldn't normally do to celebrate your "singleness."<br><br>17. Redecorate your space. Start off by cleaning out everything and throwing away anything you don't use or need anymore. Make a few self-indulgent decorating additions like a few candles, a favorite painting or fresh flowers!<br><br>18. Visit a new city. Pick some place you've always wanted to go or some place closer to home to save money.<br><br>19. Spend time with your friends.<br></div>
