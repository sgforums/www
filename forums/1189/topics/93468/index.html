Look on the bright side, you still got a long way to go and there inhibit better thing for you to accomplish than this. I used to be like you (years ago).  But don't live to regret your live.  Your priority now is to get to the goal you set for yourself.  If you set your mind on something 'BIG', don't even think of woman for they are everywhere.  Look around you as you grow, if you can't get A, B and C will come looking for you.  Hang in there, don't be so uptight about girls.  Otherwise, you live a life of insecurities forever!</div>
