            <div class='col-md body'>these 2 days are by far the happiest two days i have had since last nov.<br><br>she called me on friday, and it was so great to hear her voice again. even though i dun know if she if doing well but i believe she is doing fine. well at least there's someone to take care of her now.<br><br>she asked me about a book which is believed to be in my place. i was quite sure i didn't see the book in my place but since her bro-in-law did mention he lent to me, which i realli have no recollection that i did borrowed from him.<br><br>i search my room and couldn't find the book.<br>but i did found lots of other stuffs. photos of us together, .... the bottle of 'wei zhi bao' her dad gave me when i had gastric the other time. when i look at the photos, i realised that i had let someone i love so much , slip away from me.  and it hurts so much....<br><br>i e-mailed her to let her know that i couldn't find the book but i'll still continue to search for it and return to her should i find it. i patiently waited for her reply.<br><br>and she did replied. i was so happy! even though it was jus 2 sentence long, i felt as if the words were talking to me, that she was talking to me. and that i could see her.<br><br>i was very stupid. i signed off with  "love always, feng"<br>am i givin her pressure? a great pressure that i'm still holding on?<br>little will she know that i still love her so much. and that how much, at this point in  my life, i needed her.  but haven't i caused enough hurt and pain to her? i myself dun know for sure if i would make it thru another day. why must i still do this to her?<br><br>today i went to a old classmate's father's funeral wake and deep down inside i felt very frightened for i know one day, soon, i would be jus like him, lyin inside the coffin.i was very quiet. i kept thinkin, if i ever die one day, i would not want her to be informed. i would want my friends to keep it to themselves as if nothing happen and as if i jus disappear. she would never know wat happened to me. perhaps to her, it's better that i leave quietly.<br><br>friday afternoon after i put down the phone, i went out to get the book. although i knew i didn't borrowed the book, but since my name was mentioned i felt it would be better  if i got the book and return to her. i dun wish to cause any inconvience to her.<br><br>i got the book,  went straight to the post office, mail the book to her.<br>i have tot of passin the book to her personally but i knew the sight of me would spoilt her day and perhaps the rest of her week. so i decided to mailed it to her.<br><br>today after i came back from the wake, i recieved her email again!!!<br>i was so happy. even though it was jus sentence, i still feel very happy. stupid me. i deserve this fate this outcome.<br><br></div>
