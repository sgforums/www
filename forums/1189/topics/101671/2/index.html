Wrong old-dated conservative mindset of women...<br><br>But the strange thing is, I haven't really felt that sad and miserable like I used to... For the other breakups earlier, I would feel really lonely, miserable and guilty... Tears roll in my eyes whenever I think of her...<br><br>But now... I didn't experience such strong emotions...

            <div class='col-md body'>3 years of relationship... its gonna be tough on you.<br><br>i've been through this rough patch myself. After 3 years, after coming to 4, my ex told me that she wanted back her singlehood, something which she longed even so when we're still together. At that point of time, my heart just crumbled, broken into a zillion pieces and i was thinking was it that i didn't do enough. I had so much wanted to protect her and live my life together with her<br><br>Seriously i've always been giving in to her, letting her have her ways, sometimes forsake things that i wanna do for her and yet, things turned out this way.<br><br>i was sad and depressed and i clinged on to something that wouldn't happen, which was a patch coz while we were together, she said it once that if i ever broke up with someone, i wouldn't patch back with that person. i was being too persistent for my own good.<br><br>Right now, we're just friends. Still i miss her very much and so much wish that this hadn't happened. Now, we're more like hi and bye kinda friends and somehow i totally hate this feeling. i totally want to give up this friendship but yet somehow i don't want. All i am wishing now is that she is happy (i know she is) right now and the next guy who comes into her life wouldn't hurt her. i can't be bothered too much with the rest already.</div>

It must really be tough on you...<br><br>I hope you're feeling better now... Sometimes, loving someone means letting go... like in your case.<br><br>We can only hope and view from afar that they are happy and content...<br><br>For me, I think our differences are too much... I don't think we will be happy together, spending the rest of our lives together...<br><br>I can only hope she can do so with the next person who comes into her life.<br><br>Hope time will wash away your sadness, friend...</div>

Of course there are happy times too but how often can the happiness overcome the sorrow of losing someone u loved with all ur heart.<br><br>same as you, i guess i wun be walking into another relationship anytime soon.<br><br>you take care too my friend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
