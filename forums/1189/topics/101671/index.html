            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I met J in the university. She was in the same course as me. I was attracted by her cuteness and frankness. J is a very attractive girl too. Very soon, we were a couple.<br><br>J and I were together for more than 3 years. We practically see each other everyday and we shared everything. ThereÂ’s nothing I donÂ’t know about J and thereÂ’s nothing she doesnÂ’t know about me. We even had a savings joint account together. We were making plans for the future and it seems very likely that we were going to get married to each other. Friends were asking me if she is going to my future wife and I always replied, Â“Yah lor, should beÂ”.<br><br>J has a very bad temper. She would flare up very easily over the tiniest thing. She says she inherits her temper from her mother who is quite a bit of a chilli padi too.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t stand JÂ’s temper. She would get pissed easily over everything I do. It seems to me that thereÂ’s nothing I can do that will satisfy her. She always lament that IÂ’m not caring enough, IÂ’m not sensitive enough, etcÂ… She always criticizes me for being boring, having no life, etcÂ… And these made me sad. Worse is she said I donÂ’t love her.<br><br>When she gets angry, she would stare at me like I just massacred her family. The stare slices through my heart like a knife through butter. In particular, she blames for me for not remembering what she always said. Whenever I forgot a name of her friend or something else, she will fly into a rage. I admit that IÂ’m a very forgetful person but surely you donÂ’t have to get so angry.<br><br>Sometimes, she gets pissed when I say something that seems right to me but wrong to her. Then the nagging, scolding and criticism will all come and it will get endless. Most of the time, I just kept quiet. I donÂ’t think IÂ’m in the wrong but I donÂ’t want to aggravate the situation. I will just apologize and hope she simmers down. But no she donÂ’t. She will scold me why I can only say Â“sorryÂ” and why canÂ’t I coax her.<br><br>IÂ’m not a romantic person or a charmer with sweet lips. But I try. She complains that I donÂ’t give her little surprises so I tried to do so by giving her tiny presents or find her unexpectedly. I feel like a slave to her. Every time I went to her house, I would pack her stuff, clean up her bed and room, keep her clothes, etcÂ… I also wash the dishes after we ate in her house. But she says any Tom, Dick or Harry can do those chores. She doesnÂ’t feel secured with me, that I didnÂ’t give her the impression that I love her. She says I place my studies or work above her, that I didnÂ’t spend enough time with her. But I spend more time in her house than in my own house, I spend so much time with her that I practically neglected all my other friends.<br><br>She also likes to criticize me. Almost every time I see her. She would say why IÂ’m not sensitive and caring. Why I donÂ’t how to coax her. Why I canÂ’t go to her workplace to fetch her from work. Why IÂ’m so ugly. Why IÂ’m so selfish. And so on. I donÂ’t know if IÂ’m truly so bad as a boyfriend. I donÂ’t think IÂ’m that bad. I donÂ’t understand why she likes me in the first place if she wants me to change into another completely different person.<br><br>As time goes by, I feel like IÂ’m trapped in this relationship. I feel like a slave. Here I was doing everything for J to have J say that I donÂ’t love her. Yet I donÂ’t see J doing any thing for me. Her tempers have made me so paranoid of her getting angry that everything I do in front of her, I do it with care to make sure she wonÂ’t get pissed. Her criticism had made me so unsure of myself to losing my self-esteem and confidence.<br><br>I used to be very patient with J and her temper. But about a year ago, I also started getting angry every time J gets pissed with me when I donÂ’t think I made any wrong. Why would you always get pissed off with someone you love? I thought we should try to give and take?<br><br>We quarreled frequently and had break-ups often too only to patch back. But our differences still remained and patching back only returns us back to square one. IÂ’m the one who always initiated the break-up only to relent and patch back. Most of the times, I couldnÂ’t bear to see her crying and feeling so sad. She is very weak emotionally and I really couldnÂ’t bear to see her so sad. But I also wonder why treat me so badly like you donÂ’t appreciate me only to cry when I want to break up?<br><br>Last Friday, we broke up again. This time, IÂ’m quite determined not to patch back. Just now, I saw J in my MSN. I nearly wanted to message her to ask how she is. I stopped myself in time. I donÂ’t want to return to square one. I think both of us will be happier without each other.<br><br>But I canÂ’t help being worried about J. Will she be okay? Can she cope with the break-up? Will she be able to move on in her life? Is she okay without me? Is she crying now? Will another man come along in the future and made her miserable? I wanted so much to protect J and give her happiness but I only gave her tears and misery.<br><br>Well, J is offline now. I hope she is sleeping and having sweet dreams. I can only wish that J is happy from now on, without me in her life. 3 years is a long time. I wouldnÂ’t be able to forget her.<br><br>Wish you happiness J. IÂ’m sorry I canÂ’t give you that now.</div>

Sometimes she would even surprise me when she gets pissed out of nothing.<br><br>After so long, so many breaking ups and patching back, nothing has changed. The problem is either in me or in her.

            <div class='col-md body'>you seem to have a good head on ur shoulders. in situations like this, rationalise instead of emotionalise. easy to say i know, but well, ur decision is purely logical, so keep it that way, continue to use ur head and suppress ur heart now.<br><br>i know i'm being stereotypical, but this is a time where u gotta be a MAN, u know 'they' complain we are emotionless and get over break ups easily. well for your case, let's hope they are RIGHT. cos u now need this trait that is more inherent in us males.<br><br>i dun think u've lost ur self-esteem. i feel confidence in your writing, you admit that u were belittled, but you weren't ashamed about it. that's courage, and that's standing up for what is/was important to you, her happiness, not yours. it's got nothing to do with self-esteem. if indeed it has waned becos of her, then u better get it back, for the sake of the girl that will truly love u, in time.<br><br>btw, click on the banner to come to the bbq, we need guys like you to uplift the overall impression of the guys in this forum.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
