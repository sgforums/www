              <div id="1eu7" class="ArwC7c ckChnd">
              <p>The heart that breaks open can contain the whole universe.  <br>- Joanna 
              Macy, writer and teacher (1929- )</p>
              <p>When I first read that quote I thought "Oh, No, another of those namby-pamby, 
              wishy-washy, 'the world's a beautiful place' kind of fluff stuff."</p>
              <p>Then I thought about people with broken hearts. That led inevitably to 
              thinking about people whose hearts apparently had never broken.</p>
              <p>That moved me to the startling conclusion that I have never met a person who 
              has not suffered from a broken heart who I have liked. They're cold, unfeeling. 
              They care little for anyone else, unless the other person can do something to 
              help them or because it's their duty and it will make them look good.</p>
              <p>As co-workers they aren't much fun, unless you want to retire to a pub after 
              work. They usually have a ready supply of jokes or insults to sling around about 
              people who are having problems. You can't learn much from them because they 
              don't care enough to teach anyone else.</p>
              <p>While they pride themselves on their parenting skills, it's not much fun to 
              be their child because they have no idea what a child needs. They do know how to 
              structure family life so they visit the theme parks and drive SUVs and the kids 
              know how to behave because they're painful to be around when they bitch about 
              the kid not being well mannered.</p>
              <p>People whose hearts have been broken open--usually more than once--so they're 
              never sure they will be able to piece their lives back together again, they care 
              about others. They're sometimes painful to be around too because they want 
              others to avoid having their hearts broken (little knowing how 
              counter-productive that is to building stability and sensitivity in young 
              people). But they care and they show it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">
              <p>They're usually much loved as parents because they know--perhaps their most 
              important and endearing characteristic--how much those they love need to be 
              touched. Touch is a basic human need, though not one well publicized. Those 
              whose hearts have been broken want to hold their loved ones near, which while 
              being awkward sometimes lets their loved ones know how much they are loved.</p>
              <p>People whose hearts have been broken are better listeners, especially to 
              others who have problems. They have been there and know that often just 
              listening is the best form of comforting for someone in great need.</p>
              <p>They need to be learners more than those whose hearts have never been broken. 
              Rock-hearted people believe they already know as much as they need to know, find 
              learning from someone else humiliating, believe that nothing is true unless it 
              conforms to their personal life experience.</p>
              <p>Those whose hearts have been broken know they will never know enough. They 
              know they didn't know enough to prevent their heart from being broken, so they 
              had better learn more. They never learn the secret (and they shouldn't) but they 
              learn a great deal more along the way.</p>
              <p>Broken hearted people know how to trust, even if it hurts them. Rock hearts 
              never trust anyone fully, which makes them shallow people.</p>
              <p>Heart-healed people know how to smile in such a way that they convey both 
              that they feel good and that they want others to share what they feel. They 
              appreciate being happy because they know it never lasts. They also eventually 
              learn that unhappiness never lasts. Life is a cycle of ups and downs and the 
              survivors live it more fully.</p>
              <p>The survivors share more of themselves and what they have. They share their 
              love with family and loved ones, but also with strangers, homeless people, lost 
              children, dying aunts, co-workers who are "suddenly single."</p>
              <p>Heartbreak survivors learn that emotions work like a pendulum, the farther 
              they swing to the negative, the greater the potential they have for their 
              emotions to swing the same distance toward happiness, peace and contentment. 
              Hard hearted people may not get angry much, but they don't have the capacity to 
              enjoy life to the fullest either. They believe that happiness can be bought with 
              money and delight in the acquisition of it.</p>
              <p>Those with unbroken hearts like to be bosses because they don't have the 
              ability to be sensitive to the things that common people enjoy and appreciate. 
              They think they are whole people because they have no experience with being 
              other than like rocks. They believe they are the smart ones and those who get 
              their hearts broken are simply careless with their emotions, that are needless 
              anyway.</p>
              <p>People with cobbled-together hearts know how to live whole lives, something 
              they discover before they find themselves at the end of it. Some of the rock 
              hearts never learn that and secretly die with the intention of returning to 
              earth and finding a way to take their money with them wherever they go. It's all 
              they really have.</p>
              <p>I find it easy to like people whose heart has been broken. We share much in 
              common, including our ability to survive. I wouldn't care if I never met people 
              whose heart has never been broken.</p>
              <p>Have you ever wondered about why some kids are so very different from other 
              kids? It's not just their natures. Part of it is that some kids have never had 
              their hearts broken (yet) so they act like the child version of adult rock 
              hearts. A broken heart is not something you wish on a child, but it makes them 
              different people who live different lives because of it.</p>
              <p>Life changes when you get your heart broken. It's a tough experience, but no 
              one ever promised us that life would be grand. At least they shouldn't have 
              because it's not. We grow when we survive the worst that life has to throw at 
              us.</p>
              <p>People whose hearts have been broken have a greater capacity for life. But 
              you could never convince the rock hearts of that.</p>
