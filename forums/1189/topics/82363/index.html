            <div class='col-md body'>I was listening to 933 jus now and heard this particular entry.<br>A lady wrote to ling zhi.<br><br>17 years ago, a young gal, Y met this guy Z when they were working part-time.   Z was a handsome young man, whereas Y was a fat and ugly gal. Y found herself falling in love with him. She tried very hard to look her best. Z was very touched by her efforts and soon, they fell in love. Everyone felt that their relationship wouldnÂ’t last. But Y didnÂ’t care. She still pamper him with all her love and care.<br><br>Things started to change when Z was drafted into the army to serve his nation service. Initially Z would call Y very often. Soon it became once every week, twice a week, to none. Y tot it was because of the training he has received. Every sat afternoon, Y would find herself sitting by the telephone, waiting for ZÂ’s call. But he never did.<br><br>They started to drift apart. Z never asked her out for movies, coffee or shopping anymore. The onli time he did contact Y was to borrow money from her or to satisfy his craving for sex.  Y was onli 22 then.  Even though Z was different form before but Y was happy to have his attention, even if it meant some sacrifice on her part.<br><br>Y herself was feeling insecure of the relationship and after thinking for a long while, she decided to test Z. so one day, Y told Z that she was pregnant with his child but she didnÂ’t want the baby to hamper his plans so she went for an abortion. Y was hoping Z would hold her close, tell her that heÂ’s sorry and would never hurt her again. But she was wrong.<br><br>Z left without saying a word. And that was the last time Y ever saw him. Z was very hurt. She finally found out that Z was toying with her feelings. The more she thing, the more hurt she felt. Inside her, everything started to fall apart. She couldnÂ’t face herself nor her family anymore, she wanted to end her life. So she took sleeping pills and lie on her bed awaiting death. But she was saved by her sister.<br><br>It was during this time that she realize that her family cared so much for her.  Even thou it was very difficult for her to move on, she doesnÂ’t want to let her family, the people who love her, down.<br><br>9 months after she was discharged , she got married.<br>Her family was against this marriage for fear of her getting hurt in a relationship again. But Y was determined that this guy, A, was the one for her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> And they did gotten married, A few days before their wedding day,  Y told A about her past , how she was used and hurt.<br><br>A said this to her , Â“ whatÂ’s important to us now is the present and the future. Let the past be the past.Â”<br><br>Today, A and Y are happily married for 12 years and they have 2 kids now. Even thou A was declared bankrupt after a failed business venture, Y still love him deeply. A would still bring her out for dinner, movies and for strolls.<br><br>Then the author tell lingzhi that she was Y.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah nice one... the following was an email received from a friend of mine which I think can add to the collection. I dun know if this is one of the Stories in the Music Diary. The story abit lengthy... Paiseh ar Foga...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><br>==Tree===<br><br>The reason I'm called tree is because I'm good at painting trees.<br>Overtime I start to use a tree on the right hand corner as a trademark for all my watercolors painting.<br>I have dated 5 gals when I was in Pre-U.<br>There's one gal who I love a lot but never dare go after her.<br>She doesn't have a pretty face, doesn't have a good figure, doesn't have outstanding charm.<br>She is just a very ordinary gal. I like her. I really like her. Like her innocent, like her frankness. Like her cuteness, like her intelligence and her fragility.<br><br>Reason for not going after her is because I felt somebody so ordinary like her is not a good match for me.<br>I'm also afraid that after we are together all the good feelings will vanish.<br>I'm also afraid other's gossips will hurt her.<br>I felt that if she's my gal, she will be mine ultimately &amp; I don't have to give up everything just for her.<br>The last reason, made her accompany me for 3 years.<br>She watch me chase after gals, and I have make her heart cry for 3 years.<br><br>She wants to be a good actress and I'm a very demanding director.<br>When I kissed my 2nd girlfriend, she bumped into us. She was embarrassed but smile &amp; say "Go on!" before running off.<br>The next day, her eyes was swollen like a walnut.<br>I purposely didn't want to think about what causes her to cry but laugh at her the whole day.<br>When everybody go back home, she was alone crying in the classroom. She didn't know that I returned from soccer training to get something.<br>I watch her cry for an hour or so.<br><br>My 4th girlfriend didn't like her.<br>There was once when both of them quarreled.<br>I know that based on her character she's not the type that will start off the quarrel. But I still sided with my girlfriend.<br>I shouted at her and her eyes was filled shocked. I didn't care about her feelings and walked off with my girlfriend.<br>The next day, she still laugh &amp; joke with me like nothing has ever happened.<br>I know that she's very hurt but she didn't know that my heart ache is as bad as hers.<br><br>When I broke up with my 5th girlfriend, I asked her out.<br>After going out for a day, I told her that I have something to tell her.<br>She told me that coincidentally, she has something to tell me too.<br>I told her about my break up and she told me about her getting together.<br>I know who's the guy. He had been going after her for quite a while.<br>A very cute guy full of energy, lively and interesting. His pursuit for her has been the talk of the school.<br><br>I can't show her my heart ache but could only smile &amp; congratulate her.<br>When I reach home, the heart ache is so strong that I can't stand it.<br>It's like a heavy weighted stone on my chest. I couldn't breath.<br>Wanted to shout but can't.<br>Tears rolled down &amp; I broke down &amp; cry.<br>How many times have I seen her cry for the man that doesn't acknowledge her presence too.<br><br>During graduation, I read a sms in my hp.<br>It was send 10 days ago when I broke down and cry. I haven't read it since then.<br>It says "Leaf's departure is because of Wind's pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay"<br><br>==== Leaf =====<br><br>During Pre-U days, I like to collect leaves. Why?<br>Because I felt that for a leaf to leave the tree she has been relying on for so long it takes alot of courage.<br>During the 3 years of Pre-U I was on very close terms with a guy.<br>Not BGR kind but as buddy kind.<br>But when he had his 1st girlfriend, I learnt a feeling I never should have learnt - Jealousy.<br><br>The sourness in the heart can't be describe by using a lemon.<br>It's like 100 rotten sour lemon. Sourness to the extreme limit.<br>They were only together for 2 mths.<br>When they broke up, I hide my strong sense of happiness.<br>But after a mth, he got together with another gal.<br><br>I like him &amp; I know he like me. But why won't he pursue me?<br>Since he love me why he doesn't want to make the first move?<br>Whenever he had a new girlfriend, my heart would hurt.<br>Time after time, my heart was hurt.<br>I begin to suspect that this is a one sided love.<br><br>But, If he don't like me, why does he treat me so well?<br>It's beyond what you will normally do for a friend.<br>Liking a person is very heart wrenching. I can know his likes, his habits. But his feelings towards me I can never figure out.<br>You can't expect me a gal to ask him right?<br><br>Despite that, I still want to be by his side.<br>Care for him, accompany him, dote on him.<br>Hoping that one fine day, he will come &amp; love me.<br>It's like waiting for his phone call every night, wanting him to send me sms.<br>I know that no matter how busy he is, he will make time for me.<br>Because of this, I waited for him.<br>The 3 years were the hardest to go through &amp; I really want to give up.<br>Sometimes, I wonder should I continue waiting.<br>The pain and hurt, the dilemma accompany me for 3 years.<br><br>Till the end of my 3rd year, a 2nd year junior begins to go after me.<br>Everyday he pursuit me relentlessly.<br>From outright rejection to a point in time when I felt that I'm willing to let him have a small footing in my heart.<br><br>He's like a warm &amp; gentle wind, trying to blow a leaf away from the tree.<br>In the end, I realized that I didn't want to give this wind a small footing in my heart.<br>I know this wind will bring this badly battered leave far away &amp; better land.<br>Finally I left tree, but the tree only smile &amp; didn't ask me to stay.<br>Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay<br><br>==== Wind ======<br><br>I like a gal called leaf.<br>Because she's so dependent on tree so I have to be a gust wind.<br>A wind that will blow her away.<br>When I first met her, it was 1 mth after I transfer to the new school.<br>I saw a petite person looking at my seniors &amp; me playing soccer.<br>During ECA time, she will always be sitting there.<br>Be it alone or with her friends looking at him.<br><br>When he talks with gals there's jealousy in her eyes.<br>When he looked at her, there's a smile in her eyes.<br>Looking at her became my habit. Just like she likes to look at him.<br><br>One day, she didn't appear. I felt something amissed.<br>I can't explain the feeling except it's a kind of uneasiness.<br>The senior was also not there as well.<br>I went to their classroom, hid outside and saw my senior scolding her.<br>Tears were in her eyes while he left.<br>The next day, I saw her at her usual place, looking at him.<br>I walked over and smiled to her.<br>Took out a note &amp; gave to her.<br>She was surprised. She looked at me, smiled &amp; accept the note.<br>The next day, she appeared &amp; pass me a note and left.<br><br>Leaf's heart is too heavy and wind couldn't blow her away.<br>It's not that leaf heart is too heavy. It because leaf never want to leave tree<br><br>I replied her note with this statement and slowly she started to talk to me &amp; accept my presents &amp; phone calls.<br>I know that the person she loves is not me.<br>But I have this perseverance that one day I will make her like me.<br><br>Within 4 mths, I have declared my love for her no less than 20 times.<br>Every time, she will divert away from the topic. But I never give up.<br>If I decide I want her to be mine, I will definitely use all means to win her over.<br>I can't remember how many times I have declared my love to her.<br>Although I know she will try to divert but I still bear a small ray of hope.<br>Hoping that she will agree to me my girlfriend.<br><br>I didn't hear any reply from her over the phone.<br>I asked "what are you doing? How come you didn't want to reply?"<br>She said, "I'm nodding my head".<br>"Ah?" I couldn't believe my ears.<br>"I'm nodding my head" She replied loudly.<br>I hang up the phone, quickly changed and took a taxi and rush to her place &amp; press her door bell.<br>During the moment when she opens the door. I hugged her tightly.<br><br>Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay<br></span></div>

The reasons of me loving him before, has now transformed into the cause of all my restlessness. I am a sentimental woman and extremely sensitive when it comes to a relationship and my feelings, I yearn for the romantic moments, like a little girl yearning for candy. My husband is my complete opposite, his lack of sensitivity, and the inability of bringing romantic moments into our marriage has disheartened me about love.<br><br>One day, I finally decided to tell him my decision, that I wanted a divorce.<br><br>"Why?" he asked, shocked.  "I am tired; there are no reasons for everything in the world!" I answered.<br><br>He kept silent the whole night, seems to be in deep thought with a lighted cigarette at all times.<br><br>My feeling of disappointment only increased, here was a man who can't even express his predicament, what else can I hope from him?<br><br>And finally he asked me:Â” What can I do to change your mind?"  Somebody said it right, it's hard to change a person's personality, and I guess, I have started losing faith in him.<br><br>Looking deep into his eyes I slowly answered: "Here is the question,<br>if you can answer and convince my heart, I will change my mind,  Let's say, I want a flower located on the face of a mountain cliff, and we both are sure that picking the flower will cause your death, will you do it for me?"<br><br>He said:" I will give you your answer tomorrow...." My hopes just sank by listening to his response.<br><br>I woke up the next morning to find him gone, and saw a piece of paper with his scratchy handwriting, underneath a milk glass, on the dining table near the front door, that goes....<br><br>My dear, "I would not pick that flower for you, but please allow me to explain the reasons further...Â”<br><br>This first line was already breaking my heart. I continued reading.<br><br>"When you use the computer you always mess up the Software programs, and you cry in front of the screen, I have to save my fingers so that I can help to restore the programs.<br><br>You always leave the house keys behind, thus I have to save my legs to rush home to open the door for you.<br><br>You love travelling but always lose your way in a new city; I have to save my eyes to show you the way.<br><br>You always have the cramps whenever your "good friend" approaches every month; I have to save my palms so that I can calm the cramps in your tummy.<br><br>You like to stay indoors, and I worry that you will be infected by infantile autism.<br><br>I have to save my mouth to tell you jokes and stories to cure your boredom.<br><br>You always stare at the computer, and that will do nothing good for<br>your eyes, I have to save my eyes so that when we grow old, I can helpto clip your nails, and help to remove those annoying white hairs. So I can also hold your hand while strolling down the beach, as you enjoy the sunshine and the beautiful sand... and tell you the colour of flowers, just like the colour of the glow on your young face...<br><br>Thus, my dear, unless I am sure that there is someone who loves you more than I do... I could not pick that flower yet, and die... "<br><br>My tears fell on the letter, and blurred the ink of his handwriting...<br>and as I continue on reading...<br><br>"Now, that you have finished reading my answer, if you are satisfied, please open the front door for I am standing outside bringing your favourite bread and fresh milk...<br><br>I rush to pull open the door, and saw his anxious face, clutching<br>tightly with his hands, the milk bottle and loaf of bread....<br><br>Now I am very sure that no one will ever love me as much as he does, and I have decided to leave the flower alone...<br><br>That's life, and love. When one is surrounded by love, the feeling of<br>excitement fades away, and one tends to ignore the true love that lies in between the peace and dullness.<br><br>Love shows up in all forms, even very small and cheeky forms, it has never been a model, it could be the dullest and boring form....<br>flowers, and romantic moments are only used and appear on the surface of the relationship.<br><br>Under all this, the pillar of true love stands...  and that's our<br>life...<br><br>Love, not words win arguments...</span></div>
