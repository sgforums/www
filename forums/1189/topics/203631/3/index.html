I was<br>not involved with the patient initially."<br>Lawyer: "Well, are you even sure then, that he died in the emergency room."<br>Doctor: "That is what the records indicate."<br>Lawyer: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?<br>Doctor: No.<br>Lawyer: Did you check for blood pressure?<br>Doctor: No.<br>Lawyer: Did you check for breathing?<br>Doctor: No.<br>Lawyer: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?<br>Doctor: No.<br>Lawyer: How can you be so sure, Doctor?<br>Doctor: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.<br>Lawyer: But could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless?<br>Doctor: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law somewhere.</div>

It's a relief to know the truth after all those conflicting medical studies.<br><br>1. The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.<br><br>2. The Mexicans eat a lot of fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.<br><br>3. The Chinese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.<br><br>4. The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.<br><br>5. The Germans drink a lot of beers and eat lots of sausages and fats and suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Eat and drink what you like.<br>Speaking English is apparently what kills you.</div>
