The boy says, "I can't, I sold my baseball and my glove." The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?"<br><br>Boy said "$1,000"<br><br>The father says, "That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that.....that is way more than those two things cost.

Would you please make way?<br>Singaporeans: Lai, siam! or Siam ji bi! or S'kius!(excuse)<br><br>When someone offers to pay...<br>Britons: Hey, put your wallet away, this drink is on me.<br>Singaporeans: No need.<br><br>When asking for permission...<br>Britons: Excuse me, but do you think it would be possible for me to enter through this door?<br>Singaporeans: (while pointing at door) Can or Not?<br><br>When asking to be excused...<br>Britons: If you would excuse me for a moment, I have to go to the gents/ladies. Please carry on without me, it would only take a moment.<br>Singaporeans: Le tan, Wa ke pang jio! (wait while I visit the washroom) or Wah, buay ta han, ai choot liao! (cannot stand it anymore, have to relief myself)<br><br>When entertaining...<br>Britons: Please make yourself right at home.<br>Singaporeans: Don't shy, leh!<br><br>When doubting someone...<br>Britons: I don't recall you giving me the money.<br>Singaporeans: Where got?<br><br>When declining an offer...<br>Britons: I'd prefer no to do that, if you don't mind.<br>Singaporeans: Dowan, lah. (don't want)<br><br>When deciding on a plan of action...<br>Britons: What do you propose we do now that the movie's sold out and all the restaurants are closed?<br>Singaporeans: Then how?<br><br>When disagreeing on a topic of discussion...<br>Britons: Err. Tom, I have to stop you there. I understand where you're coming from, but I really have to disagree with what you said.<br>Singaporeans: Le siow, ah? (are you crazy?)<br><br>When asking someone to lower their voice...<br>Britons: Excuse me, but could you please lower your voice, I'm trying to concentrate over here.<br>Singaporeans: Mai kao beh, kao bu!<br><br>When asking someone if he/she knows you...<br>Britons: Excuse me, but I noticed you staring at me for some time.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">A few years after I was born, my Dad met a stranger<br>who was new to our small town. From the beginning,<br>Dad was fascinated with this enchanting newcomer<br>and soon invited him to live with our family. The stranger<br>was quickly accepted and was around from then on.<br><br>As I grew up, I never questioned his place in my family.<br>In my young mind, he had a special niche. My parents<br>were complementary instructors: Mom taught me good<br>from evil, and Dad taught me to obey. But the stranger<br>. . . he was our storyteller. He would keep us spellbound<br>for hours on end with adventures, mysteries and comedies.<br><br>If I wanted to know anything about politics, history or<br>science, he always knew the answers about the past,<br>understood the present and even seemed able to predict<br>the future! He took my family to the first major league<br>ball game. He made me laugh, and he made me cry. The<br>stranger never stopped talking, but Dad didn't seem<br>to mind.<br><br>Sometimes, Mom would get up quietly while the rest of us<br>were shushing each other to listen to what he had to say,<br>and she would go to the kitchen for peace and quiet.<br>(I wonder now if she ever prayed for the stranger to leave.)<br><br>Dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions,<br>but the stranger never felt obligated to honor them.<br>Profanity, for example, was not allowed in our home . . .<br>not from us, our friends or any visitors. Our longtime<br>visitor, however, got away with four-letter words that<br>burned my ears and made my dad squirm and my<br>mother blush.<br><br>My Dad didn't permit the liberal use of alcohol. But the<br>stranger encouraged us to try it on a regular basis. He<br>made cigarettes look cool, cigars manly and pipes<br>distinguished. He talked freely (much too freely!) about<br>sex. His comments were sometimes blatant, sometimes<br>suggestive, and generally embarrassing.<br><br>I now know that my early concepts about relationships<br>were influenced strongly by the stranger. Time after<br>time, he opposed the values of my parents, yet he was<br>seldom rebuked . . . and NEVER asked to leave.<br><br>More than fifty years have passed since the stranger<br>moved in with our family. He has blended right in and<br>is not nearly as fascinating as he was at first. Still, if<br>you could walk into my parents' den today, you would<br>still find him sitting over in his corner, waiting for<br>someone to listen to him talk and watch him draw<br>his pictures. His name? . . .<br><br>We just call him, "TV."<br><br>**Note: This should be required reading for every household<br>in North America!**<br><br>He has a younger sister now. We call her "Computer."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">A little old couple walked slowly into a McDonald's one cold winter<br>evening. They looked out of place amid the young families and young<br>couples eating there that night. Some of the customers looked<br>admiringly at them. You could tell what the admirers were thinking:<br>"Look, there is a couple who has been through a lot together, probably<br>for 60 years or more!"<br><br>The little old man walked up to the cash register, placed his order<br>with no hesitation and then paid for their meal. The couple took a<br>table near the back wall and started taking food off of the tray.<br>There was one hamburger, one order of french fries and one drink.<br><br>The little old man unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it<br>in half. He placed one half in front of his wife. Then he carefully<br>counted out the french fries, divided them in two piles and neatly<br>placed one pile in front of his wife. He took a sip of the drink, and<br>then his wife took a sip as the man began to eat his few bites.<br><br>Again, you could tell what people around the old couple were saying.<br>- "They were used to sharing everything."<br><br>Then the crowd noticed that the little old lady still hadn't eaten a<br>thing. She just sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally<br>sipped some of the drink. A young man came over and begged them to let<br>him buy them another meal. The lady explained that no, they were used<br>to sharing.<br><br>As the little old man finished eating and was wiping his face neatly<br>with a napkin, the young man could stand it no longer and asked again.<br>After being politely refused again, he finally asked the little old<br>lady, "Ma'am, why aren't you eating. You said that you share<br>everything.<br><br>What is it that you are waiting for?"<br>She answered,<br><br>"THE TEETH"</span></div>

Peter said, "I'm sorry, but<br>I really need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back."<br><br>"That's better" she said,"but it's still not very nice to use the word<br>bathroom at the dinner table."<br><br>"And you, little Eddie,can you use your brain for once and show us your<br>good manners?"<br><br>I would say, "Darling, may I please be excused for a moment?
