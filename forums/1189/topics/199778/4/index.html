"<br><br>" It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it,<br>but its also true that we don't know what we've been missing on until it arrives."<br><br>" You can fall in love in an instant. It's letting go that takes time."<br><br>" A kiss is just a kiss until you find the one you love.<br>A hug is just a hug until its the one your thinking of.<br>A dream is just a dream until you make it come true.<br>Love is just a work until its proven to you. "<br><br>" The more you love, the more you lose a part of you.<br>Yet you dont become less of you are, instead you end up being complete... "<br><br>" There are 3 great things in this world.<br>The first thing is for you to love someone.<br>The second thing is for someone to love you back<br>and the third greatest thing is for the first and second thing to happen at the same time ... "<br><br>" Love can touch just one time, but it can last for a life time. "<br><br>" Don't frown, because you never know when someone is falling in love with your smile. "<br>" Love wasn't put in your heart to stay, because Love isn't Love until you give it away. "<br><br>" Love is like a roller coaster. Once you have completed the ride, you want to go again. "<br><br>" It is far better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all "<br><br>" I was lonely and scared I asked god for an angel<br>and he sent me something even better he sent me you. "<br><br>" Some people think they have to say they are in love so they believe themselves,<br>others don't need to say it because they are. "<br><br>" Love can be trying and hard to accomplish but<br>when you have love always hold it close to your heart<br>because you never know when you have to let it go. "<br><br>" The way to know true and selfless love is rather than trying to<br>change the one you love to fit your way, change instead your way to fit the one you love. "<br><br>"Remember not to ever expect love, but do not forget about it either."<br><br>" Dreams only last one night but love can last forever "<br><br>"If You Love Someone Put Their Name In A Circle Not A Heart,<br>A Heart Can Break But A Circle Goes On Forever"<br><br>"Loving You Is Like Breathing, How Can I Stop?"<br><br>"Love Is When You Don't Want To Go To Sleep<br>Because Reality Is Better Then A Dream"<br><br>"If You Love Me Like You Told Me Please Be Careful With My Heart. You Can Take It Just Don't Break It Or My World Would Fall Apart."<br><br>"The First Time I Saw You I Knew It Was True. That I'd Love You Forever And That's What I'll Do. You Don't Know What You Do To Me, You Don't Have A Clue. You Don't Know What It's Like To Be Me Looking At You"<br><br>"Somewhere there's someone who dreams of your smile, and finds in your presence that life is worth while, so when you are lonely, remember this is true: Somebody, somewhere is thinking of you."<br><br>"Sometimes I wonder if life is really worth it, then I look at your smile and I know it is."<br><br>"I love you with all of my heart, body ,and soul. You complete me. You make my life worth living. To have known you and to have loved you has been the most beautiful dream. I can only hope that I never wake up."<br><br>"Just the thought of being with you tomorrow, is enough to get me through today."<br><br>"You are what happened when I wished upon a star."<br><br>"To see you is what my eyes long for, to touch you is what my body longs for, but to love you, my heart has done already for a long time."<br><br>Â“If, each time I thought of you, were a flower I could walk in my garden forever."<br><br>"Within you, I lose myself, without you, I find myself, wishing to be lost again."<br><br>"I love you not because I need you, But I need you because I love you."<br><br>"Gotta let you know that I love you, gotta let you know that I care, gotta let you know that for you, I'll always be there."<br><br>"If you ask me about the love, I can't answer you. But if you ask me who I love, the answer is you."<br><br>"I hope that I die before you do, my love, because I never want to know the pain of what it's like to be without you."<br><br>"The moment I looked in your eyes I fell in love. Every time I look I fall in love again. I've looked so many times, and have gathered so much love. I have so much to carry with me I don't know what to do"<br><br>"If living life would mean loving you for the rest of my life, I would take the chance."<br><br>"If it's wrong to love you, then my heart just wont let me be right."<br><br>"Should I Smile Because You're My Friend Or Cry Because Thats All We'll Ever Be?"<br><br>"A Million Words Would Not Bring You Back,<br>I Know Because I've Tried.<br>Neither Would A Million Tears,<br>I Know Because I've Cried."<br><br>"Forget The Times You Walked By, Forget The Times You've Made Me Cry,<br>Forget The Time You Held My Hand, Forget The Sweet Things If I Can,<br>I Can No Longer Pretend, I Have To Remember Now That You're Just A Friend"<br><br>Â“When I Look At You My Heart Skips A Beat But Later That Beat Could Mean A Lifetime Of Tears Wasted On Something I Knew I Could Never Have"<br><br>"How Can You Be Friends With Someone If Everytime You Look At Them It Makes You Want Them Even More?"<br><br>"My Heart Was Taken By You, Broken By You And Now Is In Pieces Because Of You"<br><br>"As Part Of You Has Grown In Me, Together Forever Shall We Be, Never Apart Maybe In Distance But Not In Heart"<br><br>"Its hard to tell your mind to stop loving someone if your heart still does."<br><br>"Even when I pour my heart out to you, I'm not sure it shows, that I love you more than you'll ever know."<br><br>Â“Sometimes it's hard to love someone because you're so afraid of losing them"<br><br>"I know in reality we can't be together, so I just close my eyes and you're right here with me... in my dreams you're mine forever."<br><br>"I was reborn when you first kissed me. Part of me died when you left me. But now I still live, waiting for the day you return to me."<br><br>"You are always there for me and so you give me the courage to stand alone."<br><br>"The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love is having to wake up."<br><br>"There is one pain I often feel which you will never know because it is caused by the absence of you."<br><br>"Of all the words of tongue or pen, the saddest are those...it might have been."<br><br>"Who do you turn to when the only person who can stop you from crying is the one who is making you cry?"<br><br>"I understand that with loves comes pain, but why did i have to love so much?"<br><br>"The part that hurts me the most, is knowing that I once had you and then lost you..."<br><br>"The worst feeling in the world is giving all the love you have and knowing it will never be returned."<br><br>"Its hard to pretend you love someone when you don't but its harder to pretend that you don't love someone when you really do."<br><br>"How do you heal a broken heart? I have no idea where to start because everything I do reminds me of you.

And I wish on a star,<br>that somewhere you are thinking of me too"<br><br>"Would you be my angel to have and to hold?<br>Would you be my rose to cherish more than gold?<br>I love you so much. I wish you were mine,<br>but all I can do is wait till that time."<br><br>"I don't want to lose this feeling.<br>If I could choose a place to die, it would be in your arms."<br><br>"Lovin' you always is like a dream come true,<br>and someday I hope to become a part of you.<br>But until that day comes, I will pray that one day you will love me in the same way."<br><br>"There's a smile on your face that lets me know that you need me,<br>there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me,<br>the touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall,<br>you say it best....when you say nothing at all."<br><br>"I cannot show you I love you. Time will show you I love you."<br><br>"I miss you most when I'm sad.
