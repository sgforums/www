            <div class='col-md body'>How many of us believes in Fate?  I used to think menÂ’s fate were held within the palm of our own hands.  Til I met her, she made me believe that Fate is something so special that we could not run away from. Her birthday is coming soon. 25th may. I would never forget this date as the series numbers 2505 happens to be the digits of my NRIC too. It was Fate that I first met her 9 years ago. It was also Fate that brought us back together. And it was also Fate that we were apart today.<br><br>This year is an especially bad one for me. Nothing went smoothly for me. My health and career went straight down hill. Even as IÂ’m recovering, thereÂ’s still a chance whereby it could turn malicious against me. Taking things easy bah. I dun even know what down the road ahead for me.<br><br>As if it was yesterday, I could recall clearly the first time we celebrate her birthday as a couple. It was in sentosa. We were at the station 5- fort siloso. We had a cake and I put on the gift I got for her, a necklace.<br><br>I remember the time she was hospitalised for an operation. Even thou both her and myself were attached at that moment, I couldnÂ’t help it and fallen in love with her again. In fact I shouldnÂ’t have said I couldnÂ’t help it. In fact I never did stopped loving her. Even after so long of not keeping in contact, the moment I saw her in the ward, my heart broke.<br><br>During her days in the hospital, one of the day happens to be my birthday.  And I hurt another galÂ’s heart when I decide to spend the day at the hospital instead of going out to celebrate which she has planned. And I didnÂ’t tell her I was at the hospital with dawn.<br><br>I was so happy when dawn gave me a birthday card.<br><br>Â“Thank you nanny hongÂ” was written on it.  Nanny was a term she coined because I was basically behaving like a nanny during her stay there.<br><br>Â‘walk-walkÂ” was the term she first used when she need to smoke. We would say she needs to go  Â‘walk-walkÂ’ for some fresh air downstairs even thou she was on wheelchair. I would bring her down from her ward to the little garden where I would sit beside her and smoke and chat.<br><br>After that time, whenever we need a smoke, we would use the term Â‘walk-walkÂ’ . how I miss those days with her by my side.<br><br></div>
