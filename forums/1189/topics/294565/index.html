            <div class='col-md body'>it started in primary 3.<br><br>we were classmates since the start of the year but i only noticed him after one math lesson. we were having a friendly inter-group math quiz and he lost our group the winning point. he was so distraught by it that he went to the back of the class and started crying. i was sitted at the back of the class and i saw him. thats when i started liking him.<br><br>i thought it would just be a short crush. i didnt know it just wouldnt go away. the next year, he shifted and so like me, had to take the bus and the train to and from school. and everyday, i would see him on my way to and from school but we never got to travel together. i was a very shy kid and i never got to talk to him. of course, this crush was kept in the depths of my heart.<br><br>sometimes during class, i would sneak glances at him from the other side of the classroom. and whenever i caught his eye, i would jump in shock and look quickly away. i still remember almost every instance where i got a chance to interact with him in some small way or another. i even remember some conversations i had with him before back in those days.<br><br>of course, during the puberty years, i had other crushes on other guys. the things is, these other crushes would fade away with time and i would find myself still liking him as before. how should i describe it? its like hes the one, and the others are just eye candies. the feeling comes and goes and comes back again but essentially its still there.<br><br>in secondary school, i lost touch with him for 4 years. no sight or sound of him at all. there were still eye candies now and then but they came and go. crushes here and there. but at the end of the day, i realised that i still thought of him and i really really missed him.<br><br>i seriously dont know if it was fate or not but we ended up in the same jc. sometimes i wished we didnt, because it just made me like him even more, now that i could see him almost everyday. prolly if he were in another jc, i would just forget about him altogether. or at least, i wont be pining for him, the feeling of liking him wont be so strong. he almost went to another jc, anyway. i find myself sneaking glances at him in school, conscious of myself. every time i get to talk to him would be moments i relished.<br><br>and he ended up joining the same cca as me. if not for one different subject, i would have ended up in the same class as him too.<br><br>these feelings of affection has been going on for what, 8 years? and its still one sided, i highly suspect, since i dont know if he reciprocates my feelings. its like a big secret, weighing down on my heart all these years.<br><br>the thing is, hes darn cute, many other girls like him too, its this way since primary school and i know i have no right to fight for him or even wish of anything that may happen. imjust thankful that i have at least some chances of seeing him more often, that i can have a more vivid picture of his face in my mind.<br><br>my sis told me its just a habit. that i may not really like him after all but its just a bad habit that ive become accustomed to.<br><br>i dont know.<br><br>this is just a story im sharing with. this is the the story of my crush, the crush that never went away</div>

That, in turn, would just fuel your other courses of action to maintain the present status quo.<br><br>I'm afraid the fear of rejection, failure and trying are but excuses to fuel your brand of defensive reasonings and continue to live in self-denial (best demonstrated by the times you feel like you don't like him).<br><br>Some opportunities never come knocking twice and you probably know what needs to be done. It's just a matter of summoning the courage to do what you think is necessary. Surely, pining for someone after 8 years can't possibly be just sheer coincidence, eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
