            <div class='col-md body'>Saw her some 2 years ago, at a once overcrowded channel of galaxynet. An intensive relationship just ended then, and she cheered me up a lot. Her name is Kelly. She brought me up when my life was at its lowest and turned my mourning into dancing again - and perhaps that was how the chemistry began.<br><br>I still remember our first meeting, it was outside Causeway Point's Watson's Store. I ran around in that li'l hide and seek game just to see my online souldmate online. When we finally saw each other, eyes met and all, I wanted her bad. So weeks after the first meeting, moving on from my heartache - I decided to court her.<br><br>We had a beautiful start; things were so perfect. 2 lovely persons deeply in love, she'd stroked my head and tell me "you really know how to make me fall in love with you" and I'd plant the softest kiss on her lips. She became such a huge part of my life; my moltivation and strength. She was really my soulmate, mentor and lover; the best any man can ever ask for. Such is how perfect it was.<br><br>She was a really wonderful person, my parents love her. I still remember all those intimate moments when she gave herself to me and only me. "I give you anything as long as it makes you happy" she said, love is the spirit of willingness to sacrifice she taught me. And as her man, I always try my best in everything I do, never to let her down and all.<br><br>Things were working so fine, till she gave her heart to another guy. But patience, forgiveness and love - I forgave and forgot her misdeeds. And with tears in her eyes, she promised it'd never happen again. I hugged her and cried. But history has a sick way of repeating itself, but how could I not forgive someone that I love? So I did.<br><br>I remember the last time was the 3rd time. She went out with a guy, kissed, held hands and hugged. I waited hours downstairs on the fateful day before she even agreed to see me. And when she did, all she said was a cold "yea I did" With my heart shattered to a thousand pieces, I went home in pain.<br><br>Many things happened since then, turned ugly too. Was blinded by my anger, almost caused her harm - wanted to email her mom her those "adult - themed" smses that she sent me. I must be frank, I was so disappointed and angry, but thank God I didn't. Just because someone didn't love you all the way, doesn't mean that they didn't love you with all they had. Looking back, I still miss her sometimes. She's attached now, so am I; it's almost half a year since she's gone. I wish her happiness, I wish her love. Adios carino mio.<br><br>Forever and a day,<br>Detached</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My parents asked whatever went wrong, I told them that I screwed up, she caught me with another girl. But it wasn't my pride or ego, I just wanna defend her image in my parents' hearts, especially my mom's. Lets just leave them with some beautiful memories of Kel.<br><br>Although memories are mine, the story is ours. I have no regrets going through the relationship. I've learnt to be a better man, a more forgiving person from it. Some 30 years down the road, at least I have some touching stories to tell my grand kids.<br><br>Sometimes, when I cry at night thinking of her - Yes, I can be emotional sometimes. I tell myself this in my heart in the midst of the midnight's silence "Forgiveness is letting go of a hurtful situation and moving on with one's happiness. The feeling of void is but a temporaily emptiness; with every step I take, things will get better. I still miss those I loved who are no longer with me but I'm grateful for having loved you. The gratitude has finally conquered the loss. I'm going to treasure the people around me, Kelly. I've seen for myself how they come and go, just like you and I. Go look for your own piece of heavens, darling; I'm looking elsewhere for mine. I wish you happiness, I wish you love. And maybe one day we will find that this isn't wasted time."</div>
