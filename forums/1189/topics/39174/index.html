            <div class='col-md body'>Here is one of them....<br><br>This happened to me in person in late 1992 when i was in Pulau Tekong under going my Basic Military Training.<br><br>I was in camp 3 Hawk Coy 6th floor Pl 31. The bunk i was staying was about 6m width and 20m in lenght. There are two doors at each end both open to the corridor. The toilet was just next door to my bunk on the right side.<br><br>I woke up one of the nite probably around 1-2am for nature call. When i opened my eyes, i saw a "being" wearing a long white gown with long hair, standing and staring at my friend (my friends bed was just next to the door) with it's back facing me.<br><br>At that point of time i wonder, who on earth would still be awake at this hours as the schedule for tomorrow is tough. I kept lying there, looking at that thing and out of sudden rite in front of my eyes, it just vanished into the thin air. It is not possible for human to move so fast as i never took my eyes off it. I sat straight up and look around for the thing but the room was in total darkness and slience. At this time i was freaked. I lay back and cover the blanket over my face and fall asleep again.<br><br>About 30 mins to one hours, i woke up again becos of my nature call. It was really urgent this time so i tried to wake up my buddy who was sleeping next bed to me but he was too engross in his sleep. I got no choice but to make my way to the toilet myself. I walked past that door and head to the toilet.<br><br>Entering into the toilet, straight in front left was the business cubicals, on the right was the doorless bathing cubicals and next to the enterence was a urine pool. I decided to do my business in one of those business cubical. When i finished and was heading towards the exit, approaching the urine pool, an unseen force pulled the flush level. The level was still swinging around in front of my eyes, as if someone had pull it. (Note the flush level had a string attached to a level to make the mechanism work, like those in the old public toilet squating cubical). I ran all the way back to my bed and cover myself with the blanket throughout the nite. I seldom go to the toilet at nite myself and i also never told my friend who was sleeping in that bed.<br><br>If you are schedule to go for your BMT in Tekong, just be prepare but Camp 3 had already pulled down, but that place get lots of tales floating about. Hope you don't have to meet one.....bless you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here is another<br><br>When i was young (in my teens....15yrs) me and some my neighbours was hot in cycling at nite. We often went in a group of seven to eight, cycling to Chinese Garden's carpark to catch lover having action in their car. We are all having a good time as there is always live free show for us to see and at the same time catching some small "soon hock" and snake head.<br><br>I remember there was once we went all the way to Jurong Park to try our luck catching some fishes. While returning, we (7 of us) cycled across the wooden bridge leading from Jurong Park toward Japanese Garden (behind Fairway Country Club). At the split road (one travelling near the bushes while the other along the bank of the lake with benches along it), 3 of them turn into the lane near the bushes while me and 3 other cruise along the lane near the bank of the lake.<br><br>As we are not our 1st time there, we knew that it is a hot spot for lover to meet and we have saw many action of gal topless with breast exposed while the lover was petting.<br><br>We cruise very slowly along those benches and on our head light of our bike while doing, so we might catch a glimp of the gal and maybe her body.<br><br>This is the moment that stopped us from cycling there ever since that nite, we approach a bench, with the light, we can roughly see a couple sitting on a bench under a big tree, the guy sat facing the lake while the gal was sitting on the guy's lap, with her legs wrap around the waist of the guy, facing the lane. It looks like they are making love. We cruised very close and slowly near them (less then 1.5M) and shone our hand carried touch at them and was happy to see that the gal was totally naked. The guy had no reaction at all (thinking that he is shy), we shone our touch at the face of the girl and was shock to see (all 4 of us) that her face was decomposed with no eyes and nose but only a mouth smiling at us. We paddle out of that place at a record timing reaching the enterence of chinese garden (350-400M away from that bench).<br><br>Then a gust of cold and strong wind start to blow at us, we look around and found that all the trees and plants was not moving at all!!! A small "tornado" made up of dried leaves and unwanted plastic bags start to form in front of the 7 of us. That time was about 10++pm. Then, we heard chinese opera coming from within Japanese Garden. Loud and clear!!!!<br><br>What will you do if you are us? We cycle our breath out all the way home and never go there at nite no more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a personal experience. hopefully i can squeeze it in before my AGM comes in.<br><br>once i had a chalet with my secondary school friends at east coast.<br>then me and my ex gf left the chalet for a walk.  something really strange happened. i guess we were walking for like ten minutes then my ex noticed that it was the second time we walked past the particular bunch of people having a bbq!<br><br>i brush it off initially but then around 5 minutes later i saw it myself.<br>i couldn't believe it! my ex was totally freaked out.<br>so i suggested we walk to the nearest bench and sit down for a while.  after around half an hour we started walking back towards the chalet.<br>thankfuly we made it back.<br><br>anyone with similar experiences?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>last year when i went to taiwan for hloidays, i happen to see a very interesting program on their tv.<br><br>there was this show whereby they ask for contestants to participate in a program of the third kind.<br><br>they would serach for the so-call the most haunted place/buliding in taiwan. they would then ask the the contestants to stay in perhpas the most haunted floor or the most haunted buliding with only a digital camera fitted with night vision. the rest of the contestants and the carema crew bascially everyone would be somewhere away from the buliding.<br><br>that particular episod i saw was quite amazing....<br>out of the ten contestants (all ladies ) four said they felt some "thing" hit them on the butt, then they were screamming and crying and one was even vomitting. later the crew went up to the contestants and found those who complained that they have been hit on the butt showed shoe stain on their skirt and jeans!!!!<br><br>wonder when would singapore have such a show????<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
