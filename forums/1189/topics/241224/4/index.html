He also wanted to let the guy know that should God let the gal lives using His powers, then everybody will ask God for such miracles in the future and humanity won't grow in character and spirit as they will ask God for everything possible.</div>

At least there are a few minority who really do as they promise and more. These are the ones who inspire us alot and give us inspirations. Nevermind the so many quarrels and break ups you seen, don't you want to see some hope once in a while to believe there are some things good worth cherishing and fighting for?

You can still see with your heart, soul and mind. You can touch, hear, smell, feel.<br><br>True, no one want a loved one to make such a big sacrifice, but then I always remember in some shows or testimonies from friends when they were asked by their partner, "How much do you love me? How much would you sacrifice for me?"<br><br>They find it contradicting and a paradox to answer in words. If your partner answer you, "I would die for you." Most likely you would not accept it 100%, right? They always show it in actions to justify their love for the person. Minor things like picking out bones from fishes to tasting their first baked cake to crossing the road where the person is in the direction of the oncoming traffic, shielding you from the vehicles should there be an accident. Some even contemplated the bigger sacrifices: protecting them from harm and giving their kidney or blood transfusion or in this case - giving their cornea.<br><br>The ultimate one is of course giving their lives for the one they loved.
