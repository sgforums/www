However in ur 1st post the fact that she left u for some1 hu has more $$$ then you makes mi think that these reasons came from her.<br><br>coming from a broken family we'll expected her to understand the just how precious our family members are however as stated above she doesn't seems to care.. which i can safely see problems in the furture should u marry her, it'll be 1 of those daughter-in-law fighting with mother-in law case...<br><br>you can see from this 1 problem it can lead on to many and how u still sit beside her durin lunch to avoid ppl saying that shes a bad girl is just wrong the fact is she is now with the other guy... However of cos affairs of the heart is just confuning at time so good luck dude!! hope u make de right choice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If she comes running back to you, don't reject her yet.<br><br>Instead, warmly welcome her, then screw and dump.<br><br></div>
