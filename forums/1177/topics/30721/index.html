I wonder what he wants.<br><br>SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.<br><br>SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes<br>at the most? What can we do?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.<br><br>SM: It's not working.<br><br>SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical<br>thing. He started to walk faster, too.<br><br>SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in<br>one minute.<br><br>SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go<br>that way and I'll go this way.<br>He cannot follow us both.<br><br>So the man decided to follow Sister Logical.<br><br>Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried<br>about what has happened to Sister Logical.<br><br>Then Sister Logical arrives.<br><br>SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!<br><br>SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't<br>follow us both,so he followed me.<br><br>SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast<br>as I could and he started to run as fast as he could.<br><br>SM: And?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing happened. He reached me.<br><br>SM: Oh, dear! What did you do?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up.<br><br>SM: Oh, Sister! What did the man do?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants.<br><br>SM: Oh, no! What happened then?<br><br>SL: Isn't it logical, Sister?<br><br>A nun with her dress up can run faster than man with his pants down.<br><br>And for those of you who thought it would be dirty, say two Hail Marys!</div>

"I haven't got any money"<br>and she proceeded to close the door.<br><br>Quick as a flash, the young man wedged his foot in the door and pushed it wide open.<br><br>"Don't be too hasty!" he said. "Not until you have at least<br>seen my demonstration."<br><br>And with that, he emptied a bucket of horse manure onto<br>her hallway carpet.<br><br>"If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of this<br>horse manure from your carpet, Madam, I will personally<br>eat the remainder."<br><br>"Well," she said, "I hope you have a damned good appetite,<br>because the electricity was cut off this morning."</div>

About 40 minutes later, the redhead crawled up on the shore and was declared the second place finisher.<br><br>Nearly 4 hours after that, the blonde finally came ashore and promptly collapsed in front of the worried onlookers.<br><br>When the reporters asked why it took her so long to complete the race, she replied, "I don't want to sound like I'm a sore loser, but I think those two other girls were using their arms..."</div>
