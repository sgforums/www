            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has said that the gash above David Beckham's eye was a freak accident.<br><br>Sir Alex said the injury was: "One of those freak acts of nature that happens and then it's over. It was a freak, it will never happen again."<br><br>Beckham sported a gash above his eye but remained tight-lipped about how his boss Sir Alex Ferguson kicked a football boot in his face.<br><br>With his hair held back by a hairband Beckham looked grim-faced as he left his home at Nether Alderley, Cheshire with the gash clearly visible to photographers outside.<br><br>Beckham, who earns millions as the face of brands including Police sunglasses, Vodafone and Pepsi, chose not to wear any of his collection of hats or bandanas.<br><br>And as speculation grew about the player's strained working relationship with his fiery boss the club refused to comment. A spokesman said only: "Whatever happens in the dressing room remains private."<br><br>Beckham's father Ted said: "I've got nothing to say. I don't even know what's going on myself."<br><br>After the game furious Ferguson kicked out in temper at a discarded football boot in the Old Trafford dressing room and it hit the midfielder in the face.<br><br>The England captain, who needed two butterfly stitches to the wound, reacted with fury, reportedly storming away from the ground with his wife Victoria and their son Brooklyn.<br><br>He received medical treatment at the ground after the dressing room incident and left immediately afterwards, according to The Sun. It is not thought that 61-year-old Sir Alex intentionally set out to hurt anyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fergie won't apologise for Beckham bust-up </strong><br><br>MANCHESTER -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson refused to apologise on Tuesday for the dressing room bust-up that left England captain David Beckham with a cut eye.<br><br>The 61-year-old Ferguson tried to laugh off what he described as a 'freakish incident'.<br><br>'Whatever happens in the dressing room is sacrosanct,' he told reporters at a press conference ahead of Manchester's Champions League match against Italian giants Juventus on Wednesday.<br><br>'There's no way I could betray the trust of the players. It's 100 per cent loyalty. It can never be anything less than that.'<br><br>But he agreed to answer a question about the spat because of the publicity it had created.<br><br>'(It was) an incident that was freakish. If I tried it a hundred times, a million times it wouldn't happen again. If it did I would carry on playing.'<br><br>Ferguson was reported to have accused Beckham of 'cocking-up as a footballer' during a four-letter tirade that sparked a bust-up following Saturday's 2-0 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal.<br><br>A red-faced Ferguson swore at the top of his voice before finally kicking a boot across the dressing room. It struck Beckham above the left eye and caused a cut requiring two stitches.<br><br>However, Ferguson denied the wound was as serious as reported.<br><br>'David did not have two stitches. It was a graze. It was treated by the doctor and we move on.'<br><br>He refused to answer any more questions.<br><br>Meanwhile, bookmakers are taking bets that Beckham is more likely to leave manchester United than Ferguson.<br><br>Beckham is 4-7 to leave manchester after the incident, while Ferguson is quoted at 5-4 to quit first. -- AFP<br><br><span style="color: red;">i buy beckham leaves!</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fiery Scotsman is renowned in football circles for his verbal outbursts.<br><br>Many former ex-United players have recounted his infamous 'hairdryer treatment' in which he launches into a tirade just inches from the face of his `victim'.<br><br>Beckham has fallen foul of Ferguson on several occasions.<br><br>The first came in 1999 when Beckham was fined for appearing at a party in London with his Posh Spice wife Victoria before a Champions League game against Sturm Graz in Austria.<br><br>Then just a couple of months later in December 1999 Victoria's relationship with her husband's boss worsened when she said Beckham would eventually move abroad to play.<br><br>But this was just the prelude to a furious full-scale bust-up in February 2000.<br><br>Rumours of the row began circulating when Beckham failed to turn up for a Friday morning training session ahead of a crucial game against Leeds.<br><br>Beckham turned up on Saturday and told his boss he was absent because his son Brooklyn, then still a baby, was unwell.<br><br>But Ferguson deemed this not to be 'a satisfactory reason for being absent' and the two had a training ground shouting match.<br><br>'There was no way I could consider including Beckham in the team to meet Leeds,' Ferguson later wrote in his autobiography.<br><br>'That much was crystal clear in my mind before David worsened the problems between us when we met on the Saturday by making me lose my temper badly, something I hadn't done in years.<br><br>'At first he simply refused to accept that he had anything to answer for and that made me blow up.'<br><br>Ferguson dropped Beckham from the squad.<br><br>The manager revealed in his book: 'It doesn't matter to me how high a player's profile is. If he is in the wrong, he is disciplined. And David was definitely in the wrong.'<br><br>It was alleged Ferguson was unhappy because Victoria was not there to look after Brooklyn - she was in London at the British Fashion Awards.<br><br>Beckham later reassured Ferguson of his commitment to the cause and that he did not want to leave the club.<br><br>A couple of weeks later Sir Alex was 'snubbed' when the Spice Girl chose to rehearse for the Brit Awards instead of attend a banquet in honour of Sir Alex being given the keys to the city of Manchester.<br><br>At the time it was felt that Ferguson saw the incident as a symptom of the celebrity lifestyle Beckham was leading.<br><br>The conflict underlined Ferguson's concern over the distractions of his star player having his main family home at `Beckingham Palace' in Hertfordshire, 200 miles from United's ground.<br><br>In September 2001 came the publication of Victoria Beckham's autobiography Learning to Fly.<br><br>In it she described Sir Alex as 'vindictive' and he had never said more than 'hello' to her.<br><br>She also revealed Ferguson 'went berserk' when the England captain asked for two extra days off following their wedding.<br><br>Ferguson instead told Beckham he had better report on time for training - with the reserves.<br><br>But even after these rows she insisted she told her husband to stay at United.<br><br>Ferguson has never hidden his desire to keep his superstars under a tight rein.<br><br>In his autobiography, Ferguson wrote: 'If footballers think they are above the manager's control ... there is only one word to say to them - goodbye.'<br><br>Ferguson is arguably the last of the great, old-fashioned football managers in the mould of Jock Stein, Bill Shankly and Bill Paisley; a gruff, tough workaholic Glaswegian and former shipyard worker turned millionaire.<br><br>The Beckhams on the other hand are a stylish showbiz couple with a love for the latest fashion and fast cars.</div>
