            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Purr-fect Gentleman</strong><br><br>I picked up my date at his apartment, and we went to the movies. Afterward, we played pool. Okay so far. Then I drove him home, and he asked whether I wanted to come up and have just one drink and "talk." My gut said "don't go," but I accepted anyway. I decided that one drink couldn't hurt. Once in his apartment, he started showing me pictures from his college days. It was then I realized that he was about 20 years older than me.<br><br>Suddenly he decided he needed to "slip into something more comfortable" -- he even used those words! Because his apartment was so small, his bedroom was right in front of the couch, where I was sitting. He went in to change but didn't close the door. I was exposed to the sight of him taking off his shirt to change into ... A SILK SMOKING JACKET! The horror of seeing his bare, hairy back combined with the jacket made me want to spit out my beer. Amazingly, things got worse. He came out, sat on the couch next to me and proceeded to start rubbing his head on my shoulder. Then, he began purring (yes, purring) -- quite loudly. He then attempted to lick my ear. At that point, I jumped up and said that I had to go. I held in my laughter until I got to my car.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Doorstop</strong><br><br>I was new to Internet dating, and I had just started talking to a few guys by email. This one guy started emailing me more and more frequently, then sent me a couple of photos of himself. When he started to bug me about me sending photos of myself, I should have known this wasn't the one ...<br><br>I never did send photos of myself, but we kept talking and even exchanged phone numbers. (If I remember correctly, I was the one who had to call him!) Anyway, we talked on the phone and throughout the conversation he kept asking me what I looked like. I tried to describe myself to him and must have sounded okay because he asked me if I wanted to see a movie together that Friday. For some reason I ignored the red flag that was being waved in front of my face and said, "Yes."<br><br>I was a little nervous that day, but also kind of excited. That night, he showed up at my house and rang the doorbell. I answered the door and greeted him (since this was technically our first time meeting each other), but as I turned to grab my purse, my "date" stopped me. He said, "I really don't think that this is going to work out. Sorry." Then he left!<br><br>I didn't know what to say. I was in shock, I guess. I just went back in my house, dazed because this total jerk only cared about my appearance. Then I reported him to the Website. From the response I got back, it was apparent that he had done this to more women than just me. I can't imagine what he was thinking, but here's a word of advice for everyone: What counts is the beauty that you bring to others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Oops, Did I Say That Out Loud?</strong><br><br>I went on a first date with a great guy. The date went really well. He seemed so polite and considerate. For example, we went to my favorite restaurant for dinner, then to a bar I love for drinks, and we even had courtside seats at a basketball game. But then we went on our second date.<br><br>At dinner, we were talking about an overseas trip he had taken recently, and how some of the men of that region were so rude to a woman with whom he was traveling. This made me think he had traveled on a tour, and so I asked what group he had gone with. He quickly and matter-of-factly responded, "With my girlfriend." I waited for him to add "at the time" or qualify her as an ex-girlfriend, but he didn't. He just sat there with a look on his face that said, "Oops, I wasn't supposed to say that." It was clear to both of us that the cat was out of the bag, so to speak, and that the date was very, very over.<br><br>We managed to keep up a stilted conversation until the meal was over, then opted to skip the movie we had planned to see. Instead, we said our good-byes. And I do mean good-bye.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Never Date a Mama's Boy</strong><br><br>One date showed up at my door one hour late. I was watching TV while waiting for him. When he finally arrived, he sat down on a chair in my living room, bent his head over and fell asleep! We were supposed to go out to dinner, and I was getting very hungry. When I nudged him awake and asked him about dinner, he said, "Oh, Mom made me dinner before I left. I didn't have the heart to tell her I had plans." I politely handed him his coat and gently pushed him out my front door. Last time I date a mama's boy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>(Not So) Picture Perfect</strong><br><br>My worst date was the first that I went on with a 45-year-old, never-been-married lawyer in New York City. It was the first time I'd ever been to his apartment, and everything was going along just fine -- at first. We were sitting and talking when he whipped out a photo album. I'm thinking family pictures? Vacation snapshots? I should be so lucky! He had actually created an entire book that was devoted to photos of his ex-girlfriends. Talk about show and tell! The "show" was obviously page after page of women, but it was the "tell" part that really got me. Hearing him say, "I only date beautiful women" was just too much. I mean, how do men get to be that age without maturing at all?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Dutch Treat (That's Not So Sweet)</strong><br><br>I waited for weeks for this guy to ask me out! When he finally did, we decided to go to a movie. Date night arrived, and everything seemed perfectly normal at first. Once we got to the theater, we waited in the ticket line and when it was our turn, he went up to the booth. Imagine my surprise, when he came back and said, "Okay, you can go get yours now." What? Fortunately, I had the good sense to stop by the ATM on the way to meet this guy. You know, in case I needed it for an emergency. This was an emergency. My red flags were going in all directions now, but I tried to play it cool and just watch the movie. Just as the flick was starting, he said that he was going to get popcorn and a drink. After about 10 minutes, I looked down from the screen and saw a familiar head sitting a few rows in front of me. It was him. He had come back to the wrong row! It was bad enough to be sitting there in the dark, watching him look around for me, but when I saw that he'd only returned with one popcorn and one drink, I got up and walked out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"Emergency" Rescue</strong><br><br>After meeting what seemed to be "the perfect gentleman" online, I agreed to go to dinner with him. We'd been "chatting" for about four months at this point and already knew that we had plenty of things in common, so I was really looking forward to it. I had my nails done, my hair done and even got my car detailed. (The lengths we go to ...)<br><br>He was already waiting for me when I arrived, so I gave him a big hug and we went in for dinner. However, once we were seated, things took a turn for the worse. Not only did he pick his nose at the table, but he also sucked his teeth. As if bad manners weren't enough, he also had a finger missing and insisted on telling me the gruesome details of how he lost it. Just as he got to the part about "blood shooting out," I excused myself to the ladies room.<br><br>The biggest surprise was what happened next. One of the waitresses came in and asked me if I was okay. She said that she had overheard some of our conversation and volunteered to concoct an "emergency" phone call for me. After the details were outlined, I returned to the table and shortly thereafter, the waitress came over and did her thing. I left without so much as a look back. It was the absolute worst date that I have ever had!</div>
