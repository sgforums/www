            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I</strong></span><br><br>Some things never change. She was late as usual.<br><br>The cafe I was sitting at was also something that never changed. Sure, Joe, the owner, had refurbished this place a couple of times since I'd known him. But somehow the ambience was one of dismal nostalgia, and never failed to bring me back to the past, to this table in the corner where we sat faithfully for a period of time in my life that I would never forget.<br><br>I was jarred away from my thoughts from the sound of the chair opposite me being dragged on the marbled floor.<br><br>"Sorry I'm late. Traffic jam."<br><br>At half past three on a Sunday afternoon? She's a hopeless liar.<br><br>"It's ok, I haven't been here long myself."<br><br>I beckoned to Joe and the surprised look on his face was obvious. He was wondering why she was there. I mimiced a person drinking coffee and he understood that I wanted him to get a drink for her.<br><br>When her mocha with marshmellows arrived she was quite elated. "You remembered, Joe. I'm impressed!"<br><br>"Yes, I remember. Too much sometimes. Enjoy your mocha, Chloe!"<br><br>She smiled and turned her attention back to me. All the familiar memories came flooding back, the countless times that we used to sit here, the countless times she smiled at Joe for bringing her favourite drink, the countless times that she would offer me one of her marshmellows well knowing that I never ate them.<br><br>This time was no different. "Want one?" She used her teaspoon to point to a pink marshmellow sitting comfortably by the green mug that said <span style="font-style: italic;">Joe's Cafe</span> on it.<br><br>"Okay." I said.<br><br>Surprised, she looked up. "Really?"<br><br>I laughed. "Of course not. You know I don't really like sweet stuff." Pause. "How have you been, Chloe?"<br><br>Without answering my question, she exclaimed, "Hey! I heard from a friend that there's this really cool party going on tonight. Since I haven't been back for a while, I really wanna see how the scene is like nowadays. You wanna come with us?"<br><br>I wasn't fazed. For some reason I was in a serious mood. Yes, I hadn't seen her for two years, but I did worry for her time and again. I wanted to know that she was ok.<br><br>"Answer me." I hoped I hadn't sounded too irritated.<br><br>Her smile faded slightly. Then totally. "Why do you want to know how I've been?"<br><br>"Why not?" I replied defiantly.<br><br>"Well then, I'm ok. You happy now?"<br><br>I didn't believe we were arguing already. This was bizzare. Just like the good old days. An awkward silence settled between us, while the cafe was slowly beginning to bustle with old ladies wanting warm scones with jam.<br><br>I took out my clean hankerchief and passed it to her when she unsuccessfully tried to hold her tears back. I knew how she was feeling. Because I was feeling it too.<br><br>"I'm sorry, Chloe..."<br><br>"No, don't be. I was just being overly sensitive. My life is shit, bunny..."<br><br>I hadn't heard her, or anyone else, for that matter, call me that for so long. It felt encouraging, yet disappointing. The epitome of oxymorons.<br><br>"I've missed you." She continued. "I know I shouldn't be saying all this, but you know I can't lie to you. I swore I wouldn't ever lie to you again if only you could forgive me."<br><br>I think it was my turn to change the topic. "So when are you going to the party tonight? I guess you'll be there with Yvonne and gang?"<br><br>The conversation lulled into idle chatter. I found out that the puppy that we bought together was still as cute, and that I should go and see her, that her university results were good, but not by her standards and that her mother just started her own business working from home as a seamstress to while her time away. Her incessant chatter, however, failed to mention one thing. Him.<br><br>"Tim...? Tim!"<br><br>"Huh? Oh..."<br><br>"What were you thinking about?" Her soft smile coupled with a slightly inquisitive look was exquisite. "You haven't spoken much since I got here. Don't you have anything to tell me?"<br><br>"How is he?" I bit my lip. I thought I swore to myself that I wouldn't talk about him.<br><br>"We've broken off." Her reply was almost instant. She had expected this question. Pause. "Are you attached?"<br><br>"Yes. I'm still attached. Very much attached to you."<br><br>The smile appeared again. "Thanks Tim, that means alot to me." I forced a smile back. One thing that I guess I was glad for was that I could make her happy, even if it was just for that moment, but at the expense of putting my heart in wrenching pain.<br><br>"Tell me, Tim, have you ever thought of us trying again?"<br><br>My heart skipped a beat. Maybe two. Was she kidding? Of course!<br><br>My reply was a straight faced "No." God dammit, I hated myself for being such a good liar.<br><br>After I paid the bill, I sent her back. There was no traffic on the streets, just families in parks, couples by the river, and the sunset over the horizon. The journey was a tormenting one. Neither of us spoke, neither needed to. The radio was playing Roxette:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It must have been love, but it's over now<br>It must have been good, but I lost it somehow<br>It must have been love, but it's over now<br>From the moment we touched till the time had run out</span><br></div>
