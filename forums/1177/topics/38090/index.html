Sagittarian girls suffer from extreme moods - when they're up, they are overenthusiastic and when they're down, they crash into the depths of despair. They sometimes rubbish people who do not share their views. They are optimistic, good-humoured, very intellectual, honest, irresponsible and tactless.<br><br>Likes: Having a gamble and any outdoor activity.<br><br>Love Style: She runs hot and cold, but there will never be a dull moment in her love life.<br><br>Best Friends: Sagittarians, Arians and Leos.<br><br>Best Partners: Leos, Sagittarians and Arians.<br><br>Not-so-good Partners: Pisceans and Virgos.<br><br>Colours: Violet and Indigo<br><br>Gemstone: Turquoise<br><br>Lucky Day: Thursday<br><br>Lucky Number: Three<br><br>Animal: Deer<br><br>Flowers: Narcissus and Dandelion<br><br>Element: Fire<br><br>How to win a Sagittarius guy: Sagittarians live life to the fullest, so win him over with an adventurous plan that'll keep him on his toes. Don't tie him down or he'll rebel. Sagittarians are very straightforward and lack tact, so don't take what he says too seriously - he probably doesn't mean it anyway.</div>

They are often intellectuals and also can be very witty. While a Virgo girl has great powers of judgement, this can easily get out of hand and make her a fussy fault finder. If you are born in late August of September, make sure you don't become to critical of others or have too high expectations of them. They are modest, shy, practical, intelligent, fussy, harsh and a total perfectionist.<br><br>Likes: A tidy desk and a completed essay.<br><br>Love Style: She takes a while to fall for her guy and she can be hard to please even when there is much to be happy about.<br><br>Best Friends: Capricorns, Virgos and Librans.<br><br>Best Partners: Virgos, Capricorns and Aquarians.<br><br>Not-so-good Partners: Sagittarians and Geminis.<br><br>Colours: All shades of Green<br><br>Gemstone: Sardonyx<br><br>Lucky Day: Wednesday<br><br>Lucky Number: Five<br><br>Animal: Cat<br><br>Flowers: Buttercups and Forget-me-nots<br><br>Element: Earth<br><br>How to win a Virgo guy: Virgos are the hardest sign in the zodiac to understand and they're quite tricky to communicate with, so be patient.
