            <div class='col-md body'>It is quite typical, almost clichÃ© to see an older man with a much younger woman. It has become the standard that men date younger women, but we have yet to accept the idea of a woman dating a man much younger than her. But let's turn that equation around. If you're an older woman, what do you have to offer a man that a younger woman can't? Well, older women are not only more mature, and financially independent, but they're also better lovers and usually won't mess with your head. These are just some of the positive aspects of dating an older woman.<br><br>A man in his mid-twenties who dates a woman in her early or mid-thirties will go through an enriching life changing experience. Your average 25-year-old woman is energetic, ambitious and out to get things done. By the time she reaches her thirties, chances are she's lived a little more. She's learned that the world isn't all it was cracked up to be, and she's not as enthusiastic about driving 20 miles to go to dance clubs that charge a $20 dollar cover and serve cherry- flavored water.<br><br>Of course, you'll never find a rose without a thorn. This means that in exchange for peace of mind, you have to be willing to accept some of the implications that come with dating an older woman. More often than not, however, the advantages overwhelmingly surpass the drawbacks:</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. Experience:</strong><br><br>Older women may not be as toned as they once were and they might not be quite as perky in the various spots they're supposed to be perky in, but it's amazing what an extra 10 years of experience can teach you. They don't beat around the bush (they let you do that).<br><br>A man is terrible when it comes to taking the time and effort to figure out what a woman really wants. An older woman has learned not to waste precious time waiting for the man in the shining armor to sweep her off her feet. She has accepted that it "ain't gonna happen," and she will let you what to do and where to do it.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>2. Independence: </strong><br><br>Older women are more established in their careers and rely less on a man to support them or a potential future family. An older woman's independence is a strong stress reliever for any man. A man does not have to worry about dating young gold diggers that will take him for a ride only to get a slice of his wallet. This takes away some of the pressure from a man's shoulder to support the relationship (i.e. you won't go broke).</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>3. Maturity:</strong><br><br>Older women know how to appreciate the truer things in life. They don't play head games and don't value the materialistic ideals that are pushed through the media channels. You can have a deep conversation with an older woman, and not have to worry about going into stupid topics such as how her hair follicle no. 490 was out of place, or how the pink lipstick did not match perfectly with her purple mini skirt.<br><br>The benefit of older women is especially apparent on vacations. Young women have the annoying habit of wanting to always wanting to do something. They say silly things like, "We paid all this money to be here, we should make the most of it." This is a phrase that no man in his right mind ever wants to hear. A man goes on vacation to drink over-priced beer while sitting in a Jacuzzi contemplating what to order next at the all-you-can-eat restaurant. An older woman understands that and so many other things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bad Things:</strong><br><br><strong>Commitment and Biological Clocks:</strong> There's nothing wrong with a May/September relationship because a woman has as much right as a man to like someone younger. To find that perfect older woman, you might have to consider her plans to start a family. Remember, her biological clock is pounding real fast. Since she wants to date a young man, however, there might be a chance that she just wants to have fun with an energetic man without having to worry about having babies. So before jumping into a relationship, find out if she's looking to have kids right away.<br><br><strong>Past Baggage:</strong> Along with those great years of sexual experience, some unresolved issues and excess baggage come attached to the package. You might want to consider doing a credit personality check to make sure she has no femme fatale history.<br><br>Well, I hope my little rant has helped open some minds, but most likely if you're a man, you probably weren't listening, and if you're a woman, you already know I'm full of rubbish. I encourage most men to give this whole idea a second thought, I bet you'll save yourself a lot of headaches.</div>
