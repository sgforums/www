            <div class='col-md body'>Question 1 shows your attitude toward life<br><br>A. If you chose the forest, you're deep, quiet. People find you incredibly interesting because you don't how show your true self right away. Pals love you because you're a good listener.<br><br>B. If you chose the cornfield, you're bright, honest and likable. You make friends easily and rarely get bummed. You've got a rep for being entertaining and fun, and you're always the center of attention.<br><br>C. If you chose the rolling hills, you're practical and down-to-earth, and you attract people with your straightforward nature. A great problem solver, you always listen to both points of view before taking a side.<br><br>Question 2 reveals what kind of boyfriend/girlfriend you're looking for<br><br>A. If you chose the mirror, you're searching for a guy/gal who shares your outlook on life. You've got a pretty good idea of what your ideal boyfriend/girlfriend is like, but you keep an open mind - the perfect guy may be someone you normally wouldn't look at twice!<br><br>B. If you chose the ring, you are a true romantic. When in a relationship, you work hard at keeping things mushy. You believe true love is forever, and although you might not admit it, you want your guy/gal care about you.<br><br>C. If you chose the bottle, you want someone who's not afraid to show his intelligence. Ambitious, hard-working guys/gals turn you on drop-dead gorgeous just isn't enough for you.<br><br>Question 3 tells how commitment-ready you are<br><br>A. If you said yes, you're dying to pick the right person.<br><br>B. If you said no, you're into playing the field for now.<br><br>Question 4 symbolizes your passion potential<br><br>A. If you chose the lake, you're not interested in having a superficial relationship. Once you meet someone you're really into, your love runs deep.<br><br>B. If you chose the waterfall, opposite sex think you're ultrasexy. You're good at turning on the charm, and loads of guys/gals lust after you.<br><br>C. If you chose the brook, you're always crushing on someone new. You're an expert flirt, and you're frequently on the move from one guy to the next.<br><br>Question 5 expresses your views on school<br><br>A. If you saw the housekey, education is less important to you than the world beyond. Secretly, you may be dying to start a career and a home of your own.<br><br>B. If you saw the antique key, you consider education to be crucial. You want to work hard and want to absorb as much knowledge as you possibly can.<br><br>C. If you saw the padlock key, you may not be too into school,but you still have plenty of great ideas. You follow your intuition, so you may eventually end up in an offbeat career.<br><br>Question 6 gives clues about your ambitions<br><br>A. If you chose the mansion, you've got tons of goals. You strive to be the best at whatever you do, and you're attracted to jobs that let you express your energetic personality. Being successful makes you superpsyched.<br><br>B. If you chose the cottage, you have a realistic attitude toward a future profession. Because your feet are planted firmly on the ground, you'll probably rock at whatever career you pick.<br><br>C. If you chose the castle, your career dreams could be a little unrealistic. Becoming a mega-star would be fab, but aim for something closer to home first. Otherwise, you may wind up being a little disappointed.<br><br>Question 7 shows your attitude towards success<br><br>A. If you looked through the window, you're a little afraid of failing. Taking that first step toward reaching a goal is the most intimidating to you, so don't give up before you've actually tried.<br><br>B. If you went inside, you feel confident about success. Nothing's going to stand in your way!<br><br>C. If you kept walking, success isn't a big deal for you. You're content with simple things and you'd rather be around people you love than spend your life trying to get to the top.<br><br>Question 8 reveals your worst fears<br><br>A. If you chose the bear, you worry about being able to stand on your own two feet. Independence is totally key.<br><br>B. If you chose the wizard, you're scared about things that are often beyond your control. So, to make up for it, you sometimes go on a heavy-duty power amperage.<br><br>C. If you chose the troll, you tend to obsess over how others see you. It's crucial that people like you - you're desperate to fit into the in crowd. You need to learn to trust your own judgment.<br><br>Question 9 represents your innermost self<br><br>A. If you chose the gardens, you're mature and honest. You believe in speaking your mind, and people rely on you to provide a sensible viewpoint. However, you may come across problems in the future that you'll have to solve with your heart, not your head.<br><br>B. If you chose the desert pond, you have a deep need for your own space. You're always analyzing your thoughts, and you've been known to do a disappearing act when things get tough. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel better.<br><br>C. If you chose the beach, you are passionate about life and have strong opinions that you aren't afraid to reveal. But you're unpredictable, and you change those opinions often. Sometimes, like the ocean, you'll show your calmer side-but usually not for long!<br><br></div>
