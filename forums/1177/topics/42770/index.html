            <div class='col-md body'>My husband was an engineer. Since I met him, he was always an<br>unflappable rock in my life. I knew he always had his feet firmly planted on the ground, and it seemed that no matter what else went crazy, he would be the one constant.<br><br>Three years of romance, and two years of marriage later, I got tired. He was the most unromantic man I know. He never bought me flowers, he never surprised me, and nothing changed in our marriage.<br><br>After some time, I finally found the courage to tell him that I wanted<br>to leave him. He just sat there, speechless. My heart froze... what kind of man was I married to that didn't even know what to say to make me stay?<br><br>After a while, he spoke, "What can I do to change your mind?". "I will<br>stay if you can give me a good answer to this question," I replied coldly. "If I asked for a flower that grew on a cliff, and you knew that getting it for me means certain death, would you get it for me?". His face grew troubled. "Can I give you an answer tomorrow morning?" he asked. Hearing that kind of answer, my heart died. I knew that I could never be happy with a man who couldn't even give me a answer straight away.<br><br>The next morning, when I woke up, he was missing. In the living room, under a warm glass of milk, was a note. My eyes grew misty as I read it...<br><br>"Dear, I have my answer. I will never pick the flower for you if it<br>meant certain death. But before you leave, I hope you can give me a chance to give you my reasons....<br><br>You will always sit in front of the  computer and type about for the<br>whole day, but everytime you will end up in tears cause your formating will always go all over the place... I need my fingers, to do the formating for you, so your tears will become smiles.<br><br>You like to travel, but would always get lost... I need my eyes, so that I can bring you to the nicest places on earth.<br><br>Everytime you leave the house, you would always forget your keys... I need my legs, so that I can run home to open the door for you.<br><br>You never knew how to take care of yourself... I need my hands to help you get rid of the pesky white hair you hate so much when you grow old, to trim your nails, to feed you.<br><br>So you see, that's why I can't pick the flower for you. Until I find<br>someone who loves you more than I do, I will need my body to take care of you.<br><br>If you accept my reasons, then open the door, where I will be waiting<br>with your favourite muffin."<br><br>With tears streaming from my eyes, I opened the door, and there he<br>stood, with a extremely worried look on his face. He still had nothing to say, but just stood there waving the packet he had in his hand in front of me. And then I knew for a fact that I will never find another man who will ever love me as much as he does.<br><br>Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean that they don't love you with all they have...</div>

My heart froze... what kind of man was I married to that didn't even know what to say to make me stay?<br><br>After a while, he spoke, "What can I do to change your mind?". "I will<br>stay if you can give me a good answer to this question," I replied coldly. "If I asked for a flower that grew on a cliff, and you knew that getting it for me means certain death, would you get it for me?". His face grew troubled. "Can I give you an answer tomorrow morning?" he asked. Hearing that kind of answer, my heart died. I knew that I could never be happy with a man who couldn't even give me a answer straight away.<br><br>The next morning, when I woke up, he was missing. In the living room, under a warm glass of milk, was a note. My eyes grew misty as I read it...<br><br>"Dear, I have my answer. I will never pick the flower for you if it<br>meant certain death. But before you leave, I hope you can give me a chance to give you my reasons....<br><br>You will always sit in front of the  computer and type about for the<br>whole day, but everytime you will end up in tears cause your formating will always go all over the place... I need my fingers, to do the formating for you, so your tears will become smiles.<br><br>You like to travel, but would always get lost... I need my eyes, so that I can bring you to the nicest places on earth.<br><br>Everytime you leave the house, you would always forget your keys... I need my legs, so that I can run home to open the door for you.<br><br>You never knew how to take care of yourself... I need my hands to help you get rid of the pesky white hair you hate so much when you grow old, to trim your nails, to feed you.<br><br>So you see, that's why I can't pick the flower for you. Until I find<br>someone who loves you more than I do, I will need my body to take care of you.<br><br>If you accept my reasons, then open the door, where I will be waiting<br>with your favourite muffin."<br><br>With tears streaming from my eyes, I opened the door, and there he<br>stood, with a extremely worried look on his face. He still had nothing to say, but just stood there waving the packet he had in his hand in front of me. And then I knew for a fact that I will never find another man who will ever love me as much as he does.<br><br>Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean that they don't love you with all they have...</div></blockquote>'<br><br>E|mo very well said... its really meaningful...
