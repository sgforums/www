They remember the dreamtime,<br>when they ruled the earth. Lizards, when under threat,<br>will let drop their tails as a defense mechanism ensuring<br>their survival, but people will not let go of past issues and this will be their undoing.<br><br>Woman : The frill-necked lizard woman is usually popular,<br>good looking and has a vibrant personality. She likes fine<br>clothes and dressing up. She dislikes slovenly men and<br>likes to feel proud of her partner. She loves going to<br>dinner or to a show, and likes mixing with the best people, in the right places. She is intelligent and has a good<br>sense of humour and is inclined to be independent.<br>She has a soft heart, is usually sentimental, and has a<br>weakness for flattery.<br><br>Man : The frill-necked lizard man likes to be dominant, but he can be jealous and has quite a strong temper if<br>annoyed. He can flirt and is often fickle, although he may<br>not mean this at heart. He dislikes loneliness, and will look for fun and pleasure and for the types of people who will<br>blend with his ego. He is loyal and affectionate and<br>generous with his money. He is usually well built and is fond of sport.<br></blockquote>yar loh..pretty true..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
