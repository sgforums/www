            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Never walk without a document in your hands</strong><br><br>People with documents in their hands look like hardworking employees heading for important meetings. People with nothing in their hands look like they are heading for the canteen. People with newspaper in their hand look like they are heading for the toilet. Above all, make sure you carry loads of stuffs home with you at night, thus generating the false impression that you work longer hours than you do.<br><br><strong>Use computers to look busy</strong><br><br>Anytime you use a computer, it looks like Â“workÂ” to the casual observer. You can send and receive personal e-mails, chat and generally have blast without doing anything remotely related to work. These are not exactly the societal benefits that the proponents of the computer revolution would like to talk about but they are not bad either. When you get caught by your boss and you * will * get caught Â– your best defense is to claim you are teaching yourself to use new software, thus saving valuable training expenses.<br><br><strong>Messy desk</strong><br><br>Top management can get away with a clean desk. For the rest of us, it looks like we are not working hard enough. Build huge piles of documents around your workspace. To the observer, last yearÂ’s work looks the same as todayÂ’s work; itÂ’s volume that counts. Pile them high and wide. If you know somebody is coming to your desk, bury the document youÂ’ll need halfway down in an existing stack and rummage for it when he/she arrives.<br><br><strong>Voice mail</strong><br><br>Never answer your phone if you have voice mail. People donÂ’t call you just because they want to give you something for nothing. The call because they want YOU to work for THEM. ThatÂ’s no way to live. Screen all your calls through voice mail. If somebody leaves a voice mail message for you and it sounds like impending work, respond during lunch hour when you know they are not there. It looks like you are hardworking and conscientious even though you are being devious weasel.<br><br><strong>Looking impatient and annoyed</strong><br><br>Always try to look impatient and annoyed to give your bosses the impression that you are always busy.<br><br><strong>Leave the office late</strong><br><br>Always leave the office late, especially when the boss is still around. You could read magazines and storybooks that you always wanted to read but have no time until late before leaving. Make sure you walk past the bossÂ’ room on your way out. Send important emails at unearthly hours (e.g. 9:35pm, 7:05am, etc.) and during public holidays.<br><br><strong>Creative and sighing for effects</strong><br><br>Sigh loudly when there are many people around, giving the impression that you are under extreme pressure.<br><br><strong>Stacking Strategy</strong><br><br>It is not enough to pile lots of documents on the table. Put lots of books on the floor etc. (thick computer manuals are the best).<br><br><strong>Build Vocabulary</strong><br><br>Read up some computer magazines and pick out all the jargon and new products. Use the phrases freely when in conversation with bosses. Remember: They donÂ’t have to understand what you say, but will sound impressive.<br><br><strong>Have 2 jackets</strong><br><br>If you work in a big open plan office, always leave a spare jacket draped over the back of your seat. This gives the impression that you are still on the premises. The second jacket should be worn while swanning around elsewhere. [/b]</div>
