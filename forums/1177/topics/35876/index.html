            <div class='col-md body'>Coping with a breakup is hard for everyone, but in my opinion, it is harder for men. This is especially true for men who were in long-term relationships.<br><br>Now you're probably wondering why I believe it is more difficult for men. The answer is simple: We all know that one of the best ways to recover from a breakup is to meet new people. Well, after a breakup, men have a more difficult time.<br><br>Just think about it for a moment. If you break up with your girlfriend, all she has to do is go down to the local cafÃ©, bar, club (you name it) and she'll have at least one man approach her. If she wants, she'll be in the sack with him by night's end.<br><br>On the other hand, the fragile, ego-broken man who was just dumped by his girlfriend now has the difficult task of approaching a strange woman and risking being rejected all over again.<br><br>Of course, his job is made a lot more difficult because he has to approach a woman while dealing with his new desperate state of mind (which definitely does not improve his chances: women hate desperate men), broken ego and rusty "pickup" skills.<br><br>Men, here are some necessary steps you must take to recover from a breakup:</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1. Stop feeling sorry for yourself<br><br>Over the years, men have earned the reputation for being big babies. One reason why they're labeled in such a way is because they're always feeling sorry for themselves. Being dumped only adds to this.<br><br>Every man thinks his breakup was the most traumatic one in history. The truth of the matter is, breakups always follow the same pattern, and life does go on. If you keep thinking about how badly you've been hurt, you will continue to hurt.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>2. Destroy the past<br><br>Many recently dumped men remain trapped in a limbo state of mind, hoping their ex will return. They will claim to be over the breakup, but if you ask them to throw away all the love letters and pictures, they'll refuse. Why? In case she does return, they won't have to start a whole new photo collection.<br><br>The best move is to destroy or burn anything that reminds you of her. Believe me, once you meet another woman, all those pictures of your ex will become meaningless.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>3. Remember your blood<br><br>A man can sometimes fall victim of his blind love and spend too much time with his woman leading him to forget his family. But in the end, once he's been dumped, he soon realizes the importance of his family. As one of our readers Scott Alex suggested, spending quality time with your blood - the family that sticks with you through tough times - is a sure way to recover from a break up.<br><br>Scott also recommends rearranging the furniture around the house. This will give you a new feel to the rooms - especially the bedroom - and can help you forget old memories and build new ones.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>4. Repair the ego<br><br>Your ego just took a heavy blow so the last thing you want is to get back into the dating scene and suffer the consequences of normal rejection that comes from dating -- you'll take it too personally.<br><br>The solution to repairing your ego is to start off slowly by first making friends and doing fun activities such as sports, dance lessons and training at the gym. Getting your body in shape will eventually give you the confidence to meet new women and build your ego.<br><br>Once you feel comfortable and decide to get back into the dating game, it will be a lot easier to meet women since you have planted some seeds (met women in dance classes and such) and you won't look as desperate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5. The sweetest revenge<br><br>Some men have bitter feelings towards their ex-girlfriends. Some behave in violent and crazy ways, while others let their performance level take a downward fall, be it in school or at work. I say, "rubbish" to all this nonsense. Don't let the actions of a woman dictate the way the rest of your life will turn out.<br><br>The sweetest revenge one could have is to be successful. Being dumped is actually the best motivation to help push you into succeeding in life. Believe me, there is no better feeling than bumping into your ex four years down the road after you've dropped twenty pounds, put on a rock hard six-pack and started your own lucrative business. Not to mention having your beautiful Swedish wife standing by your side.<br><br>You won't have to worry about hiding the fact that you work for a local McDonald's fast food restaurant. No. Instead, when your ex asks you what you've done with your life, you can start off with a big smile on your face, look at her wife-abusing husband and the rest is history. Get it on!<br><br>Remember guys, as in the famous words of W.E. Henley, "You are the master of your fate and the captain of your soul."</div>
