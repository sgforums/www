            <div class='col-md body'><strong>10. You trust her</strong><br>Trust has been always been an issue with you, but you quickly realize that you can trust the woman standing beside you. For the first time in your life, you don't think twice about opening up to her or letting her take care of pressing issues; you know she's got your back.<br><br><strong>9. She gets along with your friends</strong><br>She meets your friends one by one, and you get the eerie impression that she likes them and could actually get along with them. Better yet, she understands and encourages you to spend time with them and have your own life. What a woman!<br><br><strong>8. She has fun with your crazy family</strong><br>You cringe at the thought of her meeting your eccentric grandfather but when the big day comes, you realize she actually thinks he's funny. She seems to care for your parents as well, and they give you their stamp of approval -- not that you need it of course. Suddenly, quality time with the family has taken on a whole new dimension.<br><br><strong>7. You forget your friends</strong><br>You always chose the boys first and the girlfriend second, but now the tables have turned. The grief you might get from your buddies is worth it in the long run because following your heart makes you happy.<br><br><strong>6. You forget about your ex</strong><br>You couldn't stop thinking about the ex-girlfriend until ... you met this exquisite creature. From the first time you saw her until now, it's like you've turned a new page. You still look at other women, but it's just "looking." A definite good sign indeed.<br><br><strong>5. You get mad when others debase her</strong><br>Whether it's your friends, family or some stranger, you get irritated when people say mean things about your woman. You contemplate smashing their skulls, but opt to make them eat their words instead.<br><br><strong>4. Chemical balance</strong><br>You have so much chemistry oozing between the two of you that you have no choice but to give into temptation. She is on your mind at all times, and every time you go shopping alone, you end up buying her something. You can stare at one another and not say anything for hours; you have achieved "the comfortable silence".<br><br><strong>3. You ask yourself where she has been all your life</strong><br>She wants to know all about you -- the good and the bad -- and is not turned off by the latter. You envision yourself married to her and wonder what your kids would look like. While this thought would have made you nauseous years ago, it now brings a smile to your face.<br><br><strong>2. You treat her</strong><br>Your idea of cooking may have been delivery or microwave meals, but suddenly you'd love to fix up a five-course meal for her, serve her, wine and dine her, and then take her in your arms. You were once a cheapskate, but now spend all your discretionary income on her. You even clean your pad when you know she's coming over.<br><br><strong>1. You find yourself unable to concentrate</strong><br>Being productive at work has become increasingly difficult, listening attentively in class is a daunting task, and all you can think about is when you will see her next. As pathetic as it may be, you cannot wait to see her again, and you even consider calling her to let her know just that.</div>
