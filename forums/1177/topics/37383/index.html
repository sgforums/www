            <div class='col-md body'>i received this from an email, i think most of you must have read it.. but not harm reading it again...<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I am a mother of three (ages 14, 12, 3) and have recently completed my college degree.<br><br>The last class I had to take was Sociology.<br><br>The teacher was absolutely inspiring with the qualities that I wish every human being had been graced with.<br><br>Her last project of the term was called " Smile. "<br><br>The class was asked to go out and smile at three people and document their reactions.<br><br>I am a very friendly person and always smile at everyone and say hello anyway, so, I thought this would be a piece of cake, literally.<br><br>Soon after we were assigned the project, my husband, youngest son, and I went out to McDonald's one crisp March morning.<br><br>It was just our way of sharing special playtime with our son.<br><br>We were standing in line, waiting to be served, when all of a sudden everyone around us began to back away, and then even my husband did.<br><br>I did not move an inch ..... an overwhelming feeling of panic welled up inside of me as I turned to see why they had moved.<br><br>As I turned around I smelled a horrible " dirty body " smell, and there standing behind me were two poor homeless men.<br><br>As I looked down at the short gentleman, close to me, he was " smiling ".<br><br>His beautiful sky blue eyes were full of God's Light as he searched for acceptance.<br><br>He said, " Good day " as he counted the few coins he had been clutching.<br><br>The second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. I realized the second man was mentally challenged and the blue eyed gentleman was his salvation.<br><br>I held my tears as I stood there with them.<br><br>The young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted.<br><br>He said, " Coffee is all Miss " because that was all they could afford. (If they wanted to sit in the restaurant and warm up, they had to buy something. He just wanted to be warm).<br><br>Then I really felt it - the compulsion was so great I almost reached out and embraced the little man with the blue eyes.<br><br>That is when I noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action.<br><br>I smiled and asked the young lady behind the counter to give me two more breakfast meals on a separate tray.<br><br>I then walked around the corner to the table that the men had chosen as a resting spot. I put the tray on the table and laid my hand on the blue eyed gentleman's cold hand.<br><br>He looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, " Thank you.. "<br><br>I leaned over, began to pat his hand and said, " I did not do this for you. God is here working through me to give you hope. "<br><br>I started to cry as I walked away to join my husband and son. When I sat down my husband smiled at me and said, " That is why God gave you to me, Honey. To give me hope. "<br><br>We held hands for a moment and at that time we knew that only because of the Grace that we had been given were we able to give.<br><br>That day showed me the pure Light of God's sweet love.<br><br>I returned to college, on the last evening of class, with this story in hand.<br><br>I turned in " my project " and the instructor read it.<br><br>Then she looked up at me and said, " Can I share this?"<br><br>I slowly nodded as she got the attention of the class.<br><br>She began to read and that is when I knew that we as human beings and being part of God, share this need to heal people and to be healed.<br><br>In my own way I had touched the people at McDonald's, my husband, son, instructor, and every soul that shared the classroom on the last night I spent as a college student.<br><br>I graduated with one of the biggest lessons I would ever learn:<br><br>UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE.<br><br>Much love and compassion is sent to each and every person who may read this and learn how to LOVE PEOPLE AND USE THINGS - NOT LOVE THINGS AND USE PEOPLE. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">An Angel wrote: Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart.<br><br>To handle yourself, use your head.<br><br>To handle others, use your heart. </span></div>
