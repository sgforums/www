They have learnt from health upsets in the past how important their well being is. Lovers of fresh foods, many a Capricorn's garden is filled with herbs and vegies, organically grown to provide them with inner fortitude to face the world. They are great hosts and fabulous cooks.

            <div class='col-md body'>AQUARIUS CREATURE OF HABIT<br><br>It's not unusual for Aquarians to eat exactly the same breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. They don't enjoy surprises, particularly when it comes to food. They are not into cooking for pleasure, but will cook something to eat. They are content eating snacks such as biscuits and cheese with a glass of wine. This is enough to tide them over until they have a real meal- an evening out or a meal prepared by someone else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PISCES SWEET TREATS<br><br>Sweet dreams hold a special meaning for Pisceans. For them, it means going to bed loaded with chocolate and biscuits. Many have a love/hate affair with food. They love to eat but hate putting on weight. Many eat to ease troubled minds. That's why so many are constantly going on a diet, then off again. When Pisces puts on lots of weight and keeps it on, it's an indication they are protecting themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ARIES THE MUNCHER<br><br>Aries often look forward to meals with anticipation, but generally don't like preparing food. These munchers love to crunch on foods with texture, rather than smooth foods. They enjoy having a full tummy. It's surprising we don't see more "heavy" people born under Aries - being such an active sign, they burn their weight off with mental and physical activity. Feed them quickly as they become irritable when hungry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TAURUS THE SELF-INDULGER<br><br>Willpower is hard for Taureans to summon up when they diet. Many a Taurean's life revolves around what the next meal will be. At health clubs and gyms, you will see them working overtime to lose a few kilos, only to indulge in a chocolate sundae after their workout. They are excellent cooks (particularly desserts). There are more professional chefs and authors of cook books from this sign than any other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GEMINI ALL OR NOTHING<br><br>Geminis often need to carefully plan their diet and watch their eating habits, because these areas of their life can spin out of control. They often eat on the run, have strange food desires, unusual snacks or many drinks (such as coffee) during the day. Overeating (or drinking and smoking) can become Gemini's outlet for nervous energy. Equally, Geminis rate high on the statistical list of anorexics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CANCER THE MOOD EATER<br><br>Food means a lot to Cancer, because it has a lot to do with feeling loved and comfortable. As Cancer is the sign which rules the tummy, everything they eat has a profound impact on them. Eating excessively can be their outlet for emotional turmoil, especially if they have been through an upset such as marriage break-up or a job disappointment, or have financial difficulties. Many suffer from bulimia.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LEO FEAST OR FAMINE<br><br>Leos are hearty eaters, but they also like to have fine food - quality means more than quantity. They like to make their meals a special occasion. What makes a meal memorable for them is the presentation, the company, the wine and the location. If Leos cook, they have a great sense of s! tyle and presentation about it. Dinner parties at their homes can turn into a performance, which is talked about for a long time after.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VIRGO SIMPLE'S BEST<br><br>Virgos are fussy eaters. They prefer to avoid the unknown and like to stick with foods and spices they know well. The more basic, healthy and simple their diet is, the better they feel towards it. They feel guilty(or even suffer from nausea) if they eat fatty foods or desserts. simplicity is their idea of dining perfection. More vegetarians and health food fanatics are born under this sign than any other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LIBRA PLEASURE SEEKER<br><br>As Librans are under the sign of the trend-marker, they are often into food styles that are different or up-to-the-minute. Good cooks, they show their originality and style by serving sophisticated dishes. They can be veritable health-food gourmets (baking their own breads etc). The same applies to what they drink - it will be juices and herb teas (if their inkling is towards health foods) or the best wines and French champagne.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SCORPIO POWER EATER<br><br>As the sign of passion, intensity and desire, when Scorpios get into food, they really get into it and overeat. The same attitude applies to a diet - if they decide to diet, they do it well. This sign can have a desirous nature all of its own - which no other sign can beat. They can be obsessive about food preferences. If inviting a Scorpio for dinner,it's wise to inquire in advance what they do or do not like to eat.</div>
