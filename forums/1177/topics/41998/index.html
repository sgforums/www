            <div class='col-md body'>by Curt Smith<br><br>Many a man fails to recognize the importance of the first date. The mere fact that he got a woman's phone number is enough to convince him that he's "in" without a doubt. But there's more to a woman than just her phone number.<br><br>By knowing and avoiding the red flags women look for on first dates, you can make sure that she'll be calling you to make plans for a second one. So before you go out on that next big engagement, make sure you're not committing these first-date killer crimes:</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. Poor grooming</strong><br><br>Combing your hair, washing your eyes and chewing gum is not going to help you score big points. The first big date, more than any other, calls for a full body wash.<br><br>Don't just take a body shower; wash your hair and make sure that whatever critters are living in your hair smell good too. Get a close shave, clean your ears, clip your nails, brush your teeth, scrub your tongue, and as The Player would say, "Trim your pubes, you never know when you're going to get lucky."<br><br>First dates can get very stressful. Avoid stinky odors and sweat spots by wearing deodorant. Make yourself smell luscious and spray on the right cologne. Good hygiene is an essential element of attraction. Or at the very least, it helps you avoid being chased by wild dogs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>2. Lack of style</strong><br><br>Clothes make the man and your date will evaluate your appearance from the outside in, so it's in your best interest to dress stylishly. There is no one right way to do it. Different styles look good on different people; so check out the latest trends and choose a style that'll suit you.<br><br>Avoid fashion no-nos like "skin shows." The first date is not a time to impress your sugar pie with skintight T-shirts. I personally recommend a nice button-down shirt, with dressy pants and stylish shoes (very important).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>3. Unplanned transportation</strong><br><br>Show your woman that you can plan an event to make it as enjoyable as possible. Trust me, she doesn't want to hitchhike with you to your favorite restaurant.<br><br>Make sure you make the proper arrangements, so that you can get your lovely lady to the planned destination without much effort. Here are some rules to keep in mind:<br><br>-- Know where you're going.<br>-- Know how to get there.<br>-- Never ask your date to pick you up.<br>-- Never plan to meet at the destination, unless she insists.<br>-- Never take the bus. If you don't have a car -- most city folks don't -- pick her up in a cab, rent a car or borrow wheels from a buddy of yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>4. make it or break it</strong><br><br>A woman will take a chance and give you her phone number based on the first impression she has of you, but you still have to pass the first-date interview test, which is much more important than first impressions.<br><br>Each new D-Day is a big day. Pretending it's just another ho-hum night can be a recipe for disaster, or at least another lost potential. Women are always giving you tests and looking for clues that will signal whether or not you're going to be a "problem child."<br><br>By knowing and avoiding the top red flags women look for on first dates, you can be sure that she'll be calling you to make plans for a second one.
