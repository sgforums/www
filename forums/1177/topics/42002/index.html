            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mysterious</strong><br><br>This one's simple: stay mysterious and don't divulge too much information about yourself. The less you tell her, the more she'll want to know. If you want to impress the ladies, keep your ears open and your mouth shut, after all, mystery is the greatest aphrodisiac.<br><br><strong>Interview Test</strong><br><br>When she begins to ask you all the questions, turn the tables and give her the date interview test. Ask her questions about life, education, work, and career goals. Let her know -- through your questions -- that a simple pretty face will not suffice to keep you interested; you want a woman with depth.<br><br>This will make her feel like she has to prove her value to you rather than vice versa, which, in turn, reinforces her belief that you are a rare and valuable person who doesn't date just any woman with good looks -- no, you've got standards and you stick by them.<br><br><strong>Be A Challenge</strong><br><br>Don't give her everything she wants. Don't agree with everything she has to say. Women respect men who maintain their own opinion and don't let women walk all over them. Remain respectful with yourself, and women will find you more valuable and interesting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Patience Is A Virtue</strong><br><br>Don't be too aggressive or pushy; you might come across as being a potential desperate stalker. By displaying patience, you'll be sure not to scare women away.<br><br><strong>Lighten up</strong><br><br>A date is a date; it's not do-or-die time. Be in the right state of mind by reminding yourself to have a good time. After all, you're a confident, fun and interesting person.<br><br><strong>Display Of Affection</strong><br><br>Just because you're on a date, doesn't mean that you're married or dating seriously. Don't try to hold her hand, put your arm around her shoulder or tongue her to death. You can't go wrong with a simple kiss on the cheek.<br><br>Unless of course, you feel that you had a really successful date -- and I'm not talking about your Willy, I'm talking about signs your date is "kiss" ready, such as her facing you, arms down, head tilted upwards, she doesn't seem to be ending the date, her lips are parted, and she's looking right into your eyes. Then you could kiss her genius.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Interesting Topics</strong><br><br>Avoid taboo topics on the first date such as sex, your ex, politics, and religion. Instead, focus on the weather, locations (where you are right now), mutual friends, news events, popular culture (movies, plays, music, concerts), careers, schools, and so on.<br><br><strong>the follow up</strong><br><br>In order to avoid looking too desperate, most men wait seven to ten days before calling back. I personally recommend that you call within two to three days to tell her you had a nice time and to make plans for another date.<br><br>There you have it, first dates can be as easy as a walk in the park. Use your imagination, common sense, and treat your date in a similar fashion as you'd like to be treated, and I'm sure your date will be back for a second serving.</div>
