            <div class='col-md body'>The start of a new relationship is an electric time, a time when all you can think about is the awesome woman in your life. Although you may feel like you can do no wrong, certain topics are very delicate at this point. If you come on too strong, your girlfriend may take it as a sign that you're looking too far ahead.<br><br>Go with the flow, live in the moment and take a look at the following tips:</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>10. Don't focus on sex<br><br>While physical attraction was probably what gave you the courage (or motivation) to initiate a conversation in the first place, it's important to show your woman that sex need not come first. Be patient, establish a strong bond, and the rest will fall into place. Controlling your libido will pay off in spades.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>9. Don't introduce her as "my girl"<br><br>Break the habit of introducing your new woman as your girlfriend. You might come off as insecure, making sure everybody knows you are no longer single. You're much better off simply saying, "This is Mary" to your friends. They'll understand the relationship by your public displays of affection.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>8. Don't take her for granted<br><br>It is easy to slip into a comfort zone once you start settling into a "couple's routine," but resist the urge. Treating her as a long-time wife in a dull marriage is not the way to go. She'll start feeling unwanted and unappreciated. Remember how lucky you are to be with such a woman and don't forget to make her feel special.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>7. Don't say "I love you"<br><br>Although a serious commitment is what you want, this is a big no-no. It forces your girlfriend to respond or even reject you on the spot. Any talk of the future, like laying out plans for marriage and kids, might scare a woman off. Show your affection by reaching for her hand as you walk in the mall, touching her arm as you converse across the dinner table and making eye contact when she is talking to you. Don't feel you have to display your newfound love right away. The beginning of a relationship is all about taking things slow.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>6. Don't overspend<br><br>Don't try to buy your way into her heart. You may have purchased a tasteful gift in the early stages of dating, but now that you both feel there is a future, it's time to put away the plastic every time you see some nice jewelry. If you make sound decisions about what to get her at opportune times, the presents will mean more to her and will leave less of a dent in your bank account.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>5. Don't be an open book<br><br>It is true that you should be yourself around your girlfriend, but remember to hold off on displaying different facets of your personality until the right time. If you're a great cook, knowledgeable art lover and even a handyman around the house, don't let her know of your skills all at once.<br><br>One by one, when the need arises, reveal the things you know she'll love about you. In doing so, you compound her already growing love for you and offer fresh qualities for her to appreciate. By showing off too much initially, you leave little to liven the relationship later on.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>4. Don't meet the parents<br><br>Taking a new girlfriend to a family gathering the first few months into dating can often be misconstrued as too serious a move. Although you love your parents and quirky Uncle Bob, it is best to introduce your family at a time when she'll easily understand your motives and be able to put up with some uncomfortable questions from a rude grandfather.<br><br>Early on, her feelers are busy enough trying to establish if you are "the one"; throwing family into the mix is simply too much too soon. Of course, don't shy away from mentioning your love for them and the fact that your mother will adore her, but keep it at that until the time is right.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>3. Don't put on an act<br><br>You might feel the need to always pour on the charm in her presence, but this is actually the wrong vibe to emit. Sooner or later, she'll realize the phoniness of your actions -- your girlfriend wants you, not an actor. By being "super romantic man" all the time, the originality and shock value that special nights should provide will be non-existent.<br><br>Once in a while, surprising her with a candlelight dinner or some flowers will score big points, but pick your situations carefully and spread them out. Let her know that you do in fact have a romantic side, but tone it down and let little daily actions bear more importance than big productions.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>2. Don't start criticizing her<br><br>The last thing you want to do at the beginning of a budding relationship is put her down. More than any other time, it is in the first stages that you should be open-minded and accepting of her ways and habits. That is not to say that you should constantly give her a piece of your mind once you've settled in with her. It's important to keep in mind that you are walking on thin ice the first couple of months, and if you judge her immediately and frequently, she'll be out the door in no time.<br><br>Hold your tongue, be understanding and be careful with your words so as not to hurt her. Some would say there is no right time to express your opinion negatively when a relationship starts, but if you feel a strong need to do so, make your comment a mere suggestion and not an insult. Instead of "That dress is ugly," say "I preferred the beautiful black one you wore on New Year's Eve."<br><br>Note: Her annoying habit of asking you a lot of questions is one thing, but her extremely possessive behavior is another. If there's a serious issue at hand, it's a good idea to let your new lady know before things get out of hand.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1. Don't lie about the important stuff<br><br>A fundamental issue that is essential in any flourishing relationship is honesty. Telling lies or omitting pertinent things about yourself (like "forgetting" to tell her you love partying full tilt every Saturday night) will only lead to problems later on. Laying your habits -- and everything else that makes you tick -- out on the table is the only way to start a relationship you hope will last a long time.<br><br>Of course, sometimes little white lies cannot be avoided, but remember the bottom line: Don't lie about important things. No good can come from saying you come from a rich family when in fact you don't, or claiming you're a subdued intellectual when in fact you prefer beer and football to talking about Tolstoy, any day.</div>
