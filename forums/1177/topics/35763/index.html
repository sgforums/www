            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aries Male </strong><br><br>Are you in love with an Aries man? You`ve got quite a macho man on your hands! Ruled by Mars, the hot, red, active planet, the Aries man is known as the "warrior." Fearless and brave, active and entrepreneurial, he is eager for new experiences. Your man is never ever boring!<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>To get his attention away from his constant business wheelings and dealings, and to cater to his substantial physical needs.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>If this is your first date with an Aries, choose something daring to do. Aries, the lover of risk and adventure, is apt to enjoy activities with you that could include hang gliding, bungee jumping or car racing. The Aries man`s credo is he`ll try anything once. Use this to turn his mind away from everyday business matters and focus on you.<br><br>Being such a testosterone-charged and masculine sign, Aries needs a regular, highly active sex life. He is apt to be aggressive and spontaneous, and this is one man who likes to take the lead. At the same time, the Aries man is highly protective of his lover, being quite willing to fight (literally or figuratively) for her, and this is a big part of his appeal. Be gentle with this ego, though. If you`re not "in the mood" he might take the slightest rejection quite hard.<br><br>Aries likes a challenge, so you could tease him a bit when he starts getting bossy, keeping what he wants out of reach until the end of the pursuit. If trying to win an argument, the smart partner of an Aries man will subtly convince him that her ideas are really his ideas. Some Aries men have a roving eye, which is not an attractive quality, so to keep him playing in his own back yard, keep your body sleek, your lingerie sexy (a few skimpy pieces in his favorite color, red, would be a good idea) and the lights low (candlelight is perfect--Aries rules fire). Most of all, keep him guessing because he loves the thrill of the chase.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Want to surprise him? Cook him a spicy dinner, perhaps something Tex Mex--or--just tease him by putting a jalapeno pepper in your mouth and dare him to bite it gently (a la 9 1/2 Weeks). Then alternnate sweet flavors with spicy (Aries rules spicy flavors). That`s a way to get his attention!<br><br>In terms of gifts, the Aries man likes an experience rather than something tangible. You might buy tickets to a boxing match or an exciting basketball game where he can get all worked up and scream his lungs out--all the better to get his lusty self in bed later that evening.<br><br><strong>Aries Female </strong><br><br>Love an Aries woman? She`s modern all the way, full of spunk and drive. You will likely find her running her own business, or heading up a division in her company, for Aries is the sign that rules entrepreneurial ventures. She is a woman of strength, has well-formed and intelligent opinions, and part of her charm is that she is so thoroughly independent and self-reliant. Aries is a fire sign and therefore quite imaginative, born to lead rather than to follow.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>To keep up with her, you`ve got to think of some original things to do together--the "same old, same old" will never rate with her.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>In bed, the Aries woman will often enjoy initiating the lovemaking, much to your delight. Allow her that pleasure and enjoy the fireworks. Sexually, she will be creative and even humorous, and her sense of adventure will lead her to try many things.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Take her to an amusement park and try out the fastest, scariest rides together--she`ll be all the more passionate later. If you are giving her perfume, choose a fragrance that has depth and character--it could have a hint of spice or be a new, modern blen d. (One thing is certain, your grandmother`s sweet rose or lily of the valley just isn`t her style). Another idea would be to give her a gift certificate for a new hairstyle by a famous hairdresser she`s read about in her favorite fashion magazine. A fine imported hairbrush would be a good gift idea too. Aries rules the head, and a bad hair day is no joke for our girl. Having her hair just right gives her increased self confidence, and by giving her a chic new look, she`s apt to be delighted. Be prepared for her open demonstrations of her love for you! If you would rather choose something for her that is a bit more sexy, get her a short satin wrap robe with matching demi-bra and tiny thong panties, in her favorite color, bright red.<br><br>An Aries girl loves uniforms, so let her see you in your Navy dress whites the next time you call on her. If you don`t have an "Officer and an Gentleman" uniform around, any other uniform will do. Do you have a friend who is a UPS or FedEx delivery man? Y ou are in luck--borrow his uniform and pretend to be a delivery man. This will really ring her bell! Take note all "suits": every Aries womaan looks forward to those sexy, well-muscled UPS guys, even when they`re dumping more work for them to do on the counter! Your working-class stud attire could be a fantasy-come-true.<br><br>If you want to be late for work and get the bathroom all steamy, try this: when you`re shaving one morning, stand at the sink completely nude, with the water running, and your face all lathered up with shaving cream. As you shave, be completely oblivious to her staring at you and just talk naturally with her about everyday matters--the more mundane the better. For example, ask, "Shall I pick up the Dijon mustard after I get the stuff from the dry cleaner?" Shave your face slowly--and wait for her reaction . Aries rules sharp instruments, so watching you wield your razor in such a masterful fashion will send her temperature rising--and could be start the start of a wonderful day for you!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Taurus Male</strong><br><br>The Taurus man loves creature comforts. He is sensuous, tactile, giving, practical and stable. When a Taurus man falls in love it is forever, because Taurus guys aren`t wanderers. One of the sexiest characteristics of a Taurus man is his wonderfully sexy, deep voice. Taurus rules the throat, and many Taurus are well known singers.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Taurus men often settle into ruts and aren`t known to be too flexible. You`ll want to coax him into trying sharing new experiences and considering your point of view at decision-making time. Some Tauruses can be very jealous of anyone else you may be dating, so you`ll have to keep an eye out for that too.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>When this man says, "Be mine!" he means it quite literally, for this is a possessive sign. While this may seem charming on the outset, it can get a bit annoying. Deal with this by being a little flirtatious around other guys, but not to the extent that he thinks you would really dump him for someone else. Just tease him a little and reassure him that he is your number one man, and his passion will burn even brighter for you. Feeling secure is important to Taurus, and most of their decisions are based upon how he can increase this feeling. Taurus likes routine (hard to believe anyone does, but it is true.) While he is not a sign known for flexibility, his steadfastness and reliability will more than compensate, and you will find it comforting. So, don`t expect your Taurus lover to understand when plans change at the last minute. He has difficulty turning on a dime and this is something you will simply have to accept. And if you want to have any influence his! thinking, be sure to get your ideas across in early during his long decision-making process, before he becomes "set." Taurus can be quite stubborn!<br><br><strong>Taurus Female</strong><br><br>The Taurus woman is feminine, soft and highly diplomatic. She has a lyrical speaking voice that soothes and comforts you, and she could even have a talented singing voice (Barbara Streisand is a Taurus). Ruled by Venus, Taurus is a sign which adores the arts--from music to painting--and will enthusiastically go to any cultural event her lover suggests. In lovemaking, the Taurus womman is passionate and deeply tender. She may not be as sexually experimental as the other signs, but her fidelity and strong sense of ethics will impress you. Her bed will be the pinnacle of comfort, with piles of pillows and a fluffy comforter. There might be fresh flowers in her bedroom, or she might have a glass wall overlooking a lush garden. She will make her environment so inviting you won`t want to leave, for Taurus adores comfort.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Your Taurus woman will need to see tangible evidence of your love for her--and that means gifts. There is no getting around this and you may have to save up to afford her! She is one of the most loviing and affectionate of all signs, certainly one of the most sensuous, and quite a catch. But first, this lady will want to know that you have a nest egg. Delay popping the question until you can show her your substantial stash of Treasury bills, a solid investment in mutual funds, an impressive stock portfolio and, of course, cash in the bank. Being a earth sign, having some real estate wouldn`t hurt either--it is something which would impress her deeply. (I never said your courtship was going to be easy, did I?)<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>Assure her of your reliability and your stability--traits she values in a person. Being flaky is the surest way to turn her off. She is slow but sure in matters of the heart, so don`t rush her. Treat her well and she`ll be yours for a long, long time.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts Buy<br><br>Always keep in mind that she is ruled by Venus, the planet of decorative arts. Start by sending her flowers. Be prepared to plunk down major money for a large bouquet of rare blooms. Don`t try to get away with something cheap and small--you`ll loose points. Original flowers to try would be white and purple lilacs, which are as fragrant as they are beautiful, and send them to her in an expensive crystal vase. (A Taurus knows quality when she sees it, and she adores objects of beauty. Every time she uses the vase you gave her, she will think of you.)<br><br>Another clever tactic would be to find out the name of her favorite scent. Most Taurus women have an entire arsenal of perfumes, one to suit every mood, and she uses her stash to seduce her chosen male with skill and subtlety. Taurus rules the throat, so a choker of pearls or other stones would go over well too. Princess Di has popularized the choker. This was not surprising since she had Venus in Taurus. This sign likes almost any kind of gem, as long as it is precious and refined, so certainly there must be something that strikes your eye at the jeweler`s. If you can`t afford to get her jewelry, then try for a fine silk or cashmere scarf. She is prone to sore throats and you`ll want to be sure she stays cozy warm in the winter.<br><br>Finally, the influence of Venus gives the Taurus woman a rounded silhouette, perfect "material" for a WonderBra. If you know her well, by all means buy her a selection of this type of bra in various pretty colors, then talk her into giving you a fashion s how. Since the media keeps telling women who have curves (as most Taurus women do) that they are less-than-ideal, you`ll need to counteract that notion. Keep reassuring her that you adore her real-woman curves and that the waif look was never one that turned you on.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Taurus men love the arts, so a Saturday spent poking through art galleries in Soho with a grand dinner at a fine restaurant later would be a perfect day. (Taurus can quite a gourmet, so make the restaurant special.) Taurus is a sensuous and cultured sign, so everything you do should be carefully and subtly orchestrated for the ultimate seduction.<br><br>When making love, remember to stimulate all his senses. Start by surprising him with some special imported dark or white chocolate--Taurus men adore chocolate!--to nibble while consuming their other favorite treat, superb champagne. Other things to have onn hand include: dozens of votive candles, a short, silk charmeuse slip for you in a maddeningly flattering color, such as a pale peach (wear nothing underneath), a jar of warm, satiny cream to rub his shoulders and chest with (the areas Taurus men have the most tension), and his favorite CDs on the stereo. (Surprise him with one or two new titles, too.) Wrap up a new designer men`s cologne and tuck it under his pillow--tell him how much this scent turned you on while you were in Saks Fifth Avenue and how it made you ache to be with him. Now, your seduction is all set. Happily, Taurus men don`t like to rush anything they do, so you're assured that he is yours for that evening! Lucky girl, Taurus is one sign that thoroughly enjoys languorous lovemaking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gemini Male </strong><br><br>Your Gemini man is full of wit and charm, and often the center of attention, as he delights everyone with a new joke he just heard or a story about what happened to him at work. Since Gemini rules Hermes, the messenger of the Gods, Gemini men are often writers or reporters. They are brilliant communicators, and can talk their way into any opportunity or out of any tight spot.<br><br>Your Challenge<br>This guy likes to keep up-to-date on things, so you`ll have to get his head out of The New York Times and all his other daily doses of news. Nobody reads as many current periodicals as a Gemini! His coffee table probably looks like a newsstand. When he gets done reading, he is likely to be switching on the TV news. You will have to do something with this news junkie or he`ll stay wrapped up in current events. The key is to convince him that you are the most interesting event in his life!<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>First of all, be one of his best news sources. Before you meet up with him, call him with something you just heard on Reuters. Leave a voice mail on his office phone with a late-breaking story, or fax over clippings from a newspaper on a topic that interests him greatly. That will get his initial attention and you`ll be able to move on to more intimate matters.<br><br>Keep in mind that Gemini needs constant variety and change; the more surprising and spontaneous you are, the more he will love you. Never reveal everything about yourself to a Gemini, for once they get the idea there is nothing new to discover, they will be tempted to look elsewhere. Gemini men have a deep need to try and figure you out, so keep him guessing!<br><br>Be verbal in bed during lovemaking. This will really turn him on. Don`t be shy! Gemini is a highly-intelligent sign, stimulated by both exciting talk and the written word, and appealing to his mind and imagination will keep your sex life lively. Try reading passages from a sexy novel. (Make sure the novel has some literary value--if it is too trashy, he will wonder about your educational level, another important aspect to smart Gemini). Also, try leaviing love notes in his suit pockets, his briefcase or anywhere he might casually come across them. Few signs appreciate the now-dead art of writing love letters more than a Gemini.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Treat your Gemini man to a massage with a subtly-fragranced oil to reduce his nervous tension. He is ruled by Mercury, the planet controlling the entire nervous system, and his nerves get jangled easily. Pay particular attention to his hands, for they are susceptible to stress (probably because he is at the keyboard so much). Geminis always appear to be far younger than their years and have great charisma. To best bring out this boyish charm, flirt with him. (Gemini is the best flirt of the zodiac and he will flirt right back.) Step up your witty game of verbal Ping-Pong, if you`re ready for wildfire. No doubt he will be sitting at his computer while you talk with him, for Gemini always does two things at once. As he sits there, intently pounding out his great American novel, seduce him while he is working. Slowly unbutton his shirt as you stand behind his chair and rub his chest. Soon he will be putty in your hands.<br><br>Gemini is symbolized by the twins flying through the air, and your Gemini man is happiest when flying to some distant city. Surprise him with tickets for two to a far-away island. Then, use the fact that he`s an air sign to your advantage: seduce him on the flight (the rest room might be small but useful here). He`ll be in his element and more in "in the mood" than anywhere else!<br><br>Do Geminis stray? Only if they get bored. What you need to do is to keep them excited and mentally engaged in you. Therefore, here is the ultimate gift for communication-oriented Gemini: Give him a year of internet access along with at least one sexy e-mail message from you per week! What better way for him to stay focused on you?<br><br><strong>Gemini Female </strong><br><br>The Gemini woman is full of enthusiasm. A vivacious, shining beauty, she can talk about a wide variety of subjects, and she is curious about everything. Don`t advise a Gemini woman that she would be better off doing one thing at a time, for she needs variety and pursues a multitude of interests. She is actually at her best when swamped with things to do! Gemini is an ace communicator too, particularly adept at sharing her emotions and thoughts. (Take away her dial tone and it is like taking away oxygen.) She doesn`t go for a man who crowds her or who limits her space. Gemini is symbolized by the twins flying through the air, and to set limits on a Gemini is like trapping a lovely bird in a small cage.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>This is a busy woman with endless lists of things to accomplish. She does have a tendency to be a bit forgetful too. But who wouldn`t, with her lifestyle? She does more in a week than most of us accomplish in a month! You will need to remain Priority One with her, a hard task, when you`re competing with all her activities, friends and admirers.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>Read up on current issues, whether it is art, technology, movies, or books--anything interesting you that is topical. Then suggest to her that you and she check out a show or meet in a late night cofffee shop to discuss the issues. Gemini adores a lively debate (she was probably captain of her debating team in college). Browse with her in a good bookstore, one that plays music to encourage lingering. (Gemini rules the printed words, thus, she is happy in book shops.) Or, if she has a new laptop, offer to help her set up her system folder. (She has the brains to do it, but prefers to do things like that Ã  deux for the company.) Suggest you go window shopping for a new fax machine one night after work, so that she can choose the best one when she`s ready. Convince her to let you assess the various local cellular phone carriers to choose the best deal for her, then meet to discuss your findings. As you see all these things are communication-oriented, and believe! it or not, as dorky as these things seem, they will really turn her on. She will love you for your thoughtfulness. Trust me on this.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Buy her a cellular phone or a beeper with voice mail messaging, with pre-paid service for a year so you can call her up and leave sexy messages. Or give her an all-expense-paid-trip for two (with you!) to an inland hideaway. (Be sure there are cultural activities and night life available--remember, Gemini needs lots of stimulation). No money? Then fax her a naughty love note if her machine is private or else FeedEx her an overnight letter filled with pink and red rose petals--she will be thrilled by your creativity.<br><br>In bed, whisper words and little stories you`ve imagined or read. She is the most verbal of all the signs, and her strong intellect and rich imagination is your surest way to passionate love. Read portions of steamy novels too while in bed, and don`t be afraid to laugh or have fun with her when making love. She is one of the most spontaneous of all the signs. Since Gemini is the sign which rules versatility, she will appreciate your reading up on different lovemaking positions--and she`ll be willing to try almost anything at least once. One more hint: she is very verbal, and therefore highly oral. Enough said? You lucky dude, you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cancer Male </strong><br><br>A family man at heart, your Cancer loves children, roots, and sees home as a haven. When traveling he is prone to get homesick, even in this day and age. A water sign, Cancer is highly emotional and sympathetic. He can be moody. The changing moods of Cancers are one of their greatest charms, and as mutable as the natural landscape. If is raining, you still know the sun will be out soon. Although they are worriers, they have kind and giving temperaments. Cancers also have excellent memories, so anything special that you do for him won`t be forgotten.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>If he is divorced with children, you may have to work hard to be as important to him as his kids. To Cancer, blood is thicker than water, and you may not have first place in the pecking order. If you are married to a Cancer, he can easily get caught up with family and chores and forget that he is a red-blooded male with sexual needs. It is hard for him to remember romance when he is up on the roof, hammering shingles, so it`s up to you to proposition your handyman with an alternative, naughty use for his duct tape.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>If he is a single dad, see the sexy side of his role as father. Knowing what he`s like when he interacts with his kids heightens, by contrast, the intimacy he shares with you.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Cancer is the only sign that will customarily make a trip to the grocery store to get ready for a big date (even if you are married, you can still have a "big date"). You`ll find him filling up his cart with exotic fruits (mangoes, strawberries) and at the dairy case (whipped cream), among other areas. Making love in the kitchen always ignites his deepest fantasies, so by all means surrender amid the salad makings. He may want to cook and eat together first. As one Cancer man who is very dear to me has whispered more than once: "Cooking isn`t about cooking--it`s pure sex!" And the person who said "The way to a man`s heart is through his stomach" was obviously referring to a Canceer.<br><br>Spilling wine over your breasts and letting him watch as you slowly lick it off will excite him, something which could occur around dessert. Cancer rules the breasts (every astrological sign rules a different part of the body), so don`t wear your high-necked blouse on the night you want to start a private little nuclear reaction. This is man who admires some cleavage and will make you glad you have dÃ©colletage to display!<br><br>If you want to present him a token of your love, frame a new black &amp; white portrait of you in a pure silver frame for his desk. (Cancer rules silver--plus memories and loved ones are also under this sign`s domain.)<br><br>One Last Idea<br><br>If you want some private time with your Cancer man outside of home, seduce him near water (Cancer is a water sign), perhaps on a deserted beach or on a private yacht. Just about every Cancer I have known needs to be near water to feel completely relaxed and ready for love. Kidnap your beloved and whisk him off to the shore, and be sure to pack a basket of goodies and don your little red riding hood cape--with little or nothing on underneath!<br><br><strong>Cancer Female</strong><br><br>With her soft translucent skin and lovely shoulders, your Cancer lover makes a knockout entrance to any club wearing her sleek, dÃ©colletage slip dress, as only a Cancer lady could carry off. But in case you think you can easily date this beauty, be forewarned that she is no pushover. The Cancer woman is careful about who she gives her heart to, because once she commits, she gives her all. Your lunar lady is truly feminine, and lucky for you, of all the signs, Cancer is the most nurturing and protective of those close to her.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Her ruler, the moon, rules the changing emotions--so she can be a moody person. This may make it hard to figure out how she feels about you in the early days of your relationnship, because at times your stock will appear to rise and fall. If you marry her, this will not be a problem for she will be very loyal to you, and often put your interests ahead of hers. Your lunar goddess takes responsibility seriously. If she is a single mother, her children will come first, and you may have to wait in line. Yet it is this side of her--her mothering instincts--that you probably find so appealing in her.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>Nothing comes before her spouse and her children in a Cancer woman`s life and thus, she often she forgets her own needs. Here is where you can lavish attention on her. She is a bit of a worrier, and will often second-guess herself about decisions she has made. Reassure her that her judgment is sound, and help her focus more on the future, less on the past. (Cancer rules tradition, and this why she is so marvelous about creating a warm and loving family life--she knows she is building memories!) Holidays and birthdays are important to her, so don`t put her down for wanting to make them special. Instead, support her.<br><br>If she seems down and suddenly you find yourself on the outs with her, talk gently with her to get back into her good graces. Harsh tactics would be the wrong approach to take with her. Keep your temper under control and don`t be demanding. Her gentle feelings over-respond to criticism and in the heat of argument you could say something which could crush her irreparably. Cancers have excellent memories and she will remember everything you said, unfortunately whether you meant it or not.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>The Cancer woman`s home is her nest and is highly important to her. Offer to paint her living room or to give her a hand moving furniture around if she wants a new look. If she is divorced with kids, take everyone on an outing (she will be thunderstruck that you are attentive of her children, and love you for the gesture). Later, help her locate a baby-sitter and take her to a small and cozy family-run restaurant where the food is delicious and the lights are low. (Cancers are not comfortable in large, high-key, fancy places. She wants to focus on you, not the surroundings.) If your table has a view overlooking water, so much the better, for water rejuvenates Cancer in a way that other signs simply can`t fathom.<br><br>The Cancer woman will enjoy reminiscing, so think about recreating the first time you made love together, perhaps by going back to the same place or by celebrating the anniversary. Or, give her a beautiful album filled with snapshots of the two of you that you`ve been collecting.<br><br>When making love, the Cancer woman is fragile and feminine. Because she often puts others first, a little pampering would be a smart idea. To seduce her properly, whip up a surprise gourmet dinner and serve it to her on a small table decorated with flowers and white table linens set up in the bedroom, a place she isn`t used to eating. Have chocolate-covered strawberries for dessert and feed her each by hand, one by one. Hide a love note or special card under her plate--Cancers are sentimental. Be especially careful about what you say to her during lovemaking, for anything she construes as neegative could hurt her deeply---teasing is not for her.<br><br>Give her an exquisite strand of pearls (Cancer is a crab, a little sea creature like the pearl oyster) or a skimpy, slinky, expensive nightgown in one of her moon colors--silver, creamy white or pale, smoky blue. She would also adore flowers--but instead of sending her red or pink roses, make yyour bouquet a variety of flowers in Cancer`s color--snow white--tied with a gorgeous thick white satin ribbon.<br><br>You`ll eventually discover (if she likes you) that she has beautiful, firm, fully-rounded breasts (the part of the body the sign rules) which, in bed, she adores having her man fondle and admire. Paint them with thousands of kisses and caress them gently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Leo Male</strong><br><br>Ruled by the Sun, giver of life and strength, the Leo man is gregarious and warm-hearted. He is impossible not to notice. His powerful masculinity and commanding presence will be felt immediately, and his sense of showmanship and drama make him sexy and charismatic. He may work in the arts (especially the theater), or do some sort of creative work. He will probably head up a division of a company, if not the entire corporation. Leo men are leaders, not followers.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Leos are a bit self-absorbed and their egos are huge. Yet they are so warmhearted and loving that these faults will look trivial in the grand overview. He is jealous and possessive, especially in the courting stage, so you will need to find ways to derail his wrath if you plan to date others simultaneously. One thing that Leo doesn`t entertain, is the possibility of being Number Two. He`d rather walk.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>Gaining the admiration and respect of others is the single most important aspect of the Leo personality for you to keep in mind. This is their driving force, winning out over money, fame and just about anything else. Another aspect of their nature is their love of children and their intolerance of criticism about them from others. Say something detracting about a Leo`s child and you will get a glimpse of the mighty lion`s temper. If he runs low on cash, he won`t accept a loan from you, so don`t be bewildered or get hurt feelings, if this happens. Leo prides himself in being self-sufficient.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Since Leo likes the best of everything, have some cold champagne (with a good label) on ice nearby, some lightly toasted bread and a tiny jar of imported caviar on a silver tray with your best china and crystal. Your Leo lover likes luxury. Your bedding should be new and fresh -- never threadbare. Leo also appreciates flowers, but since he puts a premium on uniqueness, make them exotic or don`t botherr.<br><br>Leos have a strong sense of drama and presentation, so if you go to a restaurant, choose one which is hotly reviewed, frequented by beautiful people and offers four-star quality. (This is going to be hard on your wallet, I know!) Start the evening off by complementing him on something he did recently or how great he looks. Be sure you look great too--Leo wants someone fabulous on his arm. (You`ll rarely hear a Leo scold his lady for spending too much on herself.) Don`t briing up other beaux or talk about those of your past. Your lion is ruled by the Sun and wants to be the center of your universe. He won`t tolerate competition--present, past or future!<br><br>This sign rules teaching, and no other sign can quite match Leo`s ability here. Use this talent by begging him to show you new things to do together in bed. He likes to be in charge anyway, and this will only enhance his natural inclination. When you become intimately involved with him you will find the Leo male needs a great deal of attention and adoration. An exciting and accomplished lover, he will expect you to spend a considerable time on him. Yet his loyalty, devotion and extreme generosity to you will win you over, and soon you`ll find yourself looking for ways to satisfy his every need.<br><br>Give your Sun-ruled lover a gold pocket watch or sophisticated gold lighter, since Leo rules gold. Or, since this sign rules theater, tickets to the best Broadway show in town, or to the opera. He loves to dress in black tie (he is the ultimate sophisticate), so give him a good reason to dress up.<br><br>Since music is a high priority on his list, check out which new CD titles he would most like to own, but get him Ravel`s Bolero too, if he doesn`t have it. This is perfect for Leo because of the dramatic, throbbing beat. Later that night, show him what Bolero was made for: you, after your slow flamenco-styled strip-tease tango.<br><br><strong>Leo Female</strong><br><br>A Leo woman is easy to spot. She`s the one lighting up the room in her spectacular designer outfit--Leo women love to make an entrance. Her taste is superb and unfailing. Like chic French women (France is ruled by Leo), a lioness would rather have one dazzling outfit than 20 cheap ones. She has a deep and abiding need for respect from others and will work hard to being noticed and remembered. She is naturally extravagant--don`t even try to tell her she spends too much on clothes (or on her kids either, who she loves to pamper). Yet she is warm, spontaneous and creative too, and you are sure to have fun with this vivacious lioness.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>In a nutshell, your challenge will be to afford this jewel of a woman. Her taste is superb and she won`t settle for second best (which she translates as second rate). She will be demanding, so be prepared to lavish lots of attention on her instead of being preoccupied with your spreadsheets or waxing your car. If you are serious about her, bite the bullet and get some personal help. You will need to maximize your efficiency at home and the office to devote time to your lioness--at least until you win her heart.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>In all probability she will be handling you, not the other way around! Leo women have a way of being in control, even if they let you think that is not the case. She`s subtle, but strong. She resists any kind of confinement, so don`t try to box her in. Throughout courtship, the Leo woman loves to tease her man, often playing cat-and-mouse games until you "catch" her. When wed, she will do anything in her power to keep things lively and fun, and will build up an entire wardrobe of imported lingerie to keep her man interested. The Leo woman loves to have her lover run his fingers through her mane. She will rarely go to bed without a touch of makeup, even if it`s just a hint of blush or scented body creme. To increase her passion, whisper to her, "You are the most beautiful woman in the world!" . . . and mean it.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>This is one lady you are going to have to woo with gifts. She expects them, wants them, and enjoys them, so you might as well cave in and buy them for her. She looks stunning and regal in purple, so choose something in that color, whether it be a lace teddy, bra and panty set or drop-dead, killer nightie. She will also sparkle in gold--try getting her a classy knit sweater shot through with golden threads that shimmer in the evening light, then take her to aa four star restaurant for dinner so she can wear it.<br><br>Surprise her with an overnight stay at a rustic hotel with ornate wooden architecture and antique furniture. Make sure to reserve a room with a roaring fireplace. Or send her two dozen long-stemmed roses (don`t even THINK of trying to get away with one dozen), a generous box of imported bittersweet chocolates or a bottle of fine champagne for you both to drink later. Buy her tickets to the opera in New York or Rome (orchestra seats, of course.) If buyin! g her a ring or other jewelry, know that she adores sapphires, the gem ruling her sign. Start saving now! It`s true, loving a Leo can be a second career in itself. But she`ll adore you for your generosity and will insure you both will have a hell of a lot of fun. So what if the American Express bill is gigantic? Yours will be a life fully enjoyed and a love like no other you could imagine.<br><br>Your lioness likes to play games. So, try a serious game of strip poker. Or, if you know each other very well, do a variation on the movie Indecent Proposal. Remember when Demi Moore had to decide whether to take the cool million and bed Robert Redford or stay loyal to Woody Harrelson and give up their dream house? Near the end of the film there is a scene where she and Woody make love on a bed of hundred dollar (or higher) bills. In your own private remake, you are the millionaire, but you don`t have to share her with anyone. For fun, strew her bed with lots of crisp, new crumpled dollar bills (if it`s ones, not fifties or hundreds, who cares?). Leo women have fertile imaginations and a fabulous sense of drama. She`ll adore your little make-believe and beg you to think of more!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Virgo Male</strong><br><br>Your Virgo man is modest, meticulous and discriminating. He is a joy to live with as long as you understand the Virgo man`s obsessive need to bproductive on a daily basis. He is practical, patient and is able to handle detail, and the amount of details he handles would drive others up the wall. The Virgo`s talent is knowing how to make dreams (their own and those of others) a reality.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Virgos are worriers, so your first step will be to calm him down when you have time alone together. Often workaholics, your Virgo will have a hard time detaching from his everyday schedule. But you must, for they are incredibly passionate lovers once his total attention has been turned to you.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>He`s productivity oriented, so "goofing off" might be a foreign idea and too scary for him at the onset. Since Virgo is wonderful at fixing things--his sharp mind hungers for things to take apart and figure out--so ask him to help you out. Tell him that you are hopeless wwith home repairs and he has got to come over and take a look at your air conditioner. His small motor skills are the finest in the zodiac, so many Virgos like to putter around the house, looking for little projects. Puttering takes their minds off more stressful issues.<br><br>Remind him how turned-on you were when you saw him wearing worn jeans and a plaid lumberjack shirt, jump-starting his car. Tell him you fantasize about him walking around your apartment measuring walls for shelving, just wearing his tool belt. (This kind of flattery will accomplish two things: you will have a hot, passionate lover ready to ravish you and no more leaky faucets.) Cruise around Home Depot, just to get him in the mood. Then, one afternoon when he is putting in a new set of florescent lights over your kitchen counter, pounce on him and tell him you are getting hot watching him screw those huge bulbs in. Make love to him right then and there.<br><br><strong>Virgo Female</strong><br><br>The quality people notice first about your Virgo beloved is her alertness and unmistakable intelligence. It has been said that Virgo`s gift is making order out of chaos. Send a Virgo into a hurricane-ravaged town, and in no time they`ve pitched the tents, organized the shipments of food and water, and started clearing the roadways. If it is one thing Virgo does well, it`s organize people and things. If your life is a bit of a hurricane, you`re in luck, for she will provide a willing ear and heaps of amazing practical advice-- ideas you will wish you had thought of long ago.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Virgo women have lists of things to do, and sometimes you could wind up being one more item on her list. Becoming "Priority #10-D" is something to avoid at all costs! Once she writes you into her Filofax as "Sex with James, Thursday @ 9:00 PM" you know you`ve hit bottom, and it is time to do something drastic--and delightful!.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>Your goal is to allow her to take time to relax and gently pull her away from her everyday cares. She hates being lazy, so accomplishing this isn`t going to be as easy. Like the male Virgo, the female Virgo loathes making love in a hovel, so if this describes your place, you`d better spiff it up. Nothing turns off a Virgo faster than dirt or mess. She isn`t impressed with luxury, so don`t worry about having things "good enough" for her--crisp, just laundered cotton sheets and some soft pillows are fine. But if you don`t get organized, before you know it, she``ll be out of bed and cleaning up the place--the last thing you want her to be doing in her Victoria`s Secret teddy! As good as it sounds, to have some lovely geisha cleaning up your pigsty, think about it. If she`s stacking dishes in the dishwasher, she isn`t making love to you, so get your priorities straight, buddy. Besides, god knows where she`ll "neaten up" your collection of half-dirty basketball shorts TO. So take away the clamor of disorder that distracts her and when she`s with you, you will be all that exists in her world.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>She adores high fashion and well-made clothing. As the saying goes, "God in the details," and details are this perfectionist`s forte. Most Virgo women enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest couture trends (she is ruled by Mercury, so she is oriented toward staying current). Yet their appearance will likely be elegant and understated rather than flashy, often choosing neutrals over bright colors. She likes to dress up, so think of a nice restaurant where she can wear some of her new things. Tattered jeans and polo shirts are not her style.<br><br>Buy her an article of clothing or piece jewelry that is high fashion but enduring, top quality, like a Tiffany or Cartier watch that she can treasure for years. (She`s madly punctual, so what better gift?). Her sign rules jade, the stone of fidelity, so a ring or pendant made of that stone is especially meaningful. You could alternatively give her a beauty service, like a year of manicures and pedicures (Virgo likes her nails fastidiously groomed) or six months of a personal trainer (fitness is a big thing with her) and still make a big hit with her.<br><br>In love, she is highly ethical and idealistic, so don`t be surprised if your Virgo comes to you with little sexual experience. She`s just very discriminating about who she will give her heart and body to. Don`t think that means she lacks passion. Quite the contrary! Virgos are just better at controlling their intense, smoldering feelings, but once released, watch out! When she finds a man she is willing to devote her life to, she can be a tiger in bed. Her secret strength is that she communicates her needs well and will also listen closely to, and act on, what her lover needs.<br><br>Since Virgo prizes cleanliness so much, seduce her with a bubble bath for two. Set dozens of softly-scented votive candles around the bathroom and be sure to have some thick, luxurious towels nearby. A bottle of champagne would be good to have on hand, as would a bowl of finger fruits--grapes, strawberries, raspberries--to feed her one by one. After your bath, give her a full body massage. Later, when you maake love, be sure to talk to her during sex because nothing as erotic to her as her vivid imagination. Describe places and situations where you would like to make love to her down to the tiniest details. (When she begins asking questions to keep you taking about a certain scenario, you`re on the right track).<br><br>To thank him for all his home improvement, you might want to take him to dinner. When choosing the restaurant, remember that a Virgo`s digestive system is delicate. Most Virgos dislike overly rich food and try to eat balanced healthful meals. Many are vegetarians.<br><br>Another point to consider is that Virgo has a strong need to be highly organized. So when seducing the Virgo man, be sure you have a neat bedroom and put unnecessary clutter out of sight. (Seeing junk around will make him edgy.) In bed, the Virgo man is like the Gemini (both are ruled by Mercury) in that his need to communicate is strong. Talking during lovemaking will heighten his pleasure and add to his passion for you.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Many Virgos are talented writers. Their reserved nature makes them express in writing what they would have difficulty saying in person. Happily, you may be the lucky recipient of one of the wonderful love letters only a Virgo could write. Drop hints that you would like to receive something written especially for you. A perfect gift for him would be a beautiful fountain pen or engraved stationary. He would also adore a P.D.A. or electronic organizer, a laptop computer, new software, or even a dust buster for his car. You could also buy him a deluxe tool kit (don`t forget those metric socket wrenches too) and let matters take their own course!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Libra Male</strong><br><br>Libra is the natural sign of partnership, so it follows that the Libra man prefers being married (or at least living together) over flying solo. He will work toward making his union strong and happy. True justice is a very important issue with Libra, and sometimes you might find him moping around murmuring "It`s not fair!" No one has yet succeeded to convince him that life in general isn`t fair. Libras have a strong ideas about making life fair, and they make their decisions and arrange their actions around what they feel is the most just and equitable solution. When drawn into a dispute, your Libra lover will quickly state his position and he`s done--there is no hanging on to old arguments, no poking into old wounds, and never any sarcasm. Libras are too refined and gentleemanly to fight dirty. He will expect the same from you.<br><br>Your Libra guy loves to socialize. This is one man you will not have to coax into going to or hosting a party, and, oh, the parties that they give! They are the best! Libras are the ones who know everyone, and there is sure to be a famous face or two at one of their bashes.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Libra men have so many friends and are so charming themselves, that it is hard to know where you stand, at least at the beginning of a relationship. They are very loyal once they commit, but until then, this air sign tends to flirt around like a butterfly and is rather hard to pin down. Initially, what you have to do is draw attention to yourself in a ladylike way and make him realize you are the companion he wants to spend his time with.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>Lovemaking is something Libra will look forward to with relish--rarely will he want anything quick or rushed. He enjoys the process of seduction, something he has elevated to an art form, and he will take his time with his woman, careful to attend to her emotional needs as well as her physical ones. He is quite visual in orientation and likes his to see you dressed in elegant lingerie (Libra is a refined sign, so don`t get too trashy or flashy). When you are getting ready to make love a Libra, wear your most elegant jewelry, like pretty earrings and a fine necklace, with little lacy underthings he can easily remove.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Libra is ruled by Venus, who controls the arts, so music is very important to him and he will have a great stereo system at home. Buying him a good car stereo or auto CD player is a great way to make sure he always picks you up in a wonderful mood.<br><br>Here`s an idea for a Libran seduction: propose a day spent touring a pretty rural locale and tuck some of his favorite music into the glove compartment. Don`t forget to pack a gourmet picnic basket (Libra likes fine food and delicacies). While he is driving and his hands are full, start to touch him--before you know it, you will be pulled over on a small dirt road, the music reaching crescendo, while he makes love to you iin the back seat, just like two high school teenagers. There is something devilishly lovely about doing it in the back seat of his BMW or Lexus (many Libra men are lawyers, so they can afford good cars). Later, suggest you go to a drive-in movie but don`t permit any monkey business there--make him concentrate on the film. Libras appreciate subtle plotting like this. Pet him all the way home as he drives, helpless in his securely fastened seat belt. By time you are inside the door he`ll be ready for you all over again!<br><br><strong>Libra Female </strong><br><br>Libra women have busy social calendars and keep happy by surrounding themselves with adoring friends. Still, this lady wants to be married, so don`t be fooled by her gadding about. Once wed, she will attend to her marriage as fiercely as her career.<br><br>Always fashionably-dressed, she favors an eclectic look, mixing designer things with antique pieces. The final effect is smart and sexy, never dowdy. This Venus-ruled beauty is beautifully groomed, and smells as good as she looks, for she never leaves the house without a light spray of something intoxicating. Her figure is usually curvy, svelte and feminine, so you don`t even stand a chance of resisting her. The most memorable quality about your Libra lover is her quintessential grace; in every movement she makes, every word she utters, she is poetry in motion.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Your mission 007, is to capture her heart. Not an easy task, considering the line of men waiting in line. She has no shortage of opportunities, so competition will be stiff.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>She has powerful talents of persuasion and her lover may not know exactly how she gets her way, but she does every time--in the most charming fashion. Be wary of getting wrapped around her little finger, for although she may protest, she secretlly likes a man who stands up to her now and then. If you are only semi-conscious most of the time, you don`t stand a chance of winning her heart.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Think of the cherubs in old master paintings, flying though the air, holding branches of roses or a lovely harp. This describes your angelic lover. She`d adore anything decorative, from sweetheart roses, soft silk lingerie in a delicate colors, to perfume in a modern or gentle floral tone (nothing jarring for Libra). One of Libra`s favorite gifts is jewelry, but it has to be the real thing. Costume jewelry will tarnish, just like your relationship will if you try to give her this. Robbing a bank may be your only choice to get her what she wants. She might also enjoy a beautiful mirror, framed in gold leaf. Let`s pause a moment --perhaps you`ve just thought of something naughty? Before you get carried away, let me advise you that not all Libras like maaking love in front of a mirror. Venus endowed her with curves and she may be a bit self-conscious about them (silly girl.) Put the mirror up in the bedroom and let her gradually get used to it. Keep telling her how tell her how gorgeous she looks without a stitch on.<br><br>The Libra woman adores lighter foreplay activities and is a world-class kisser. If you haven`t yet tapped into this aspect of her, you are missing one of life`s true experiences. Corner her into a hot necking session somewhere like at the movies, where the other viewers won`t care if you and she are going at one another like two kids hell bent on trouble. If you are lucky, the usher may come with her flashlight and scold you!<br><br>When you finally get her to bed she will want a slow hand, for Libra women never marry cold fish or slam-bam-thank-you-m`am types. She is highly romantic and sensitive and wants you to be that way too. Her bed usually has many fluffy pillows and the most beautiful linens she can afford. She wants music in the bedroom, but no TV (too indelicate--who wants to hear about the Congressional budget or a mugging in Queens when one is in the throes of passion?) One last hintt: Libra rules the lower back and will purr like a kitten when her man massages it with a lightly scented cream. Meow!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Scorpio Male</strong><br><br>The Scorpion is determined, shrewd, protective, jealous, and powerful. It is a sign prone to obsession, and the Scorpio man is not nonchalant about anything, from his career to his love life. Symbolized by the phoenix rising from the ashes, this bird aptly suggests Scorpio`s incredible ability to regenerate from seemingly disastrous situations. Much has been written about how sexy and mysterious Scorpio is. To him sex is very important, and it would be impossible for him to have a happy relationship without great sex. The Scorpio male is macho, a modern day 007: thrilling, strong, silent and handsome.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>One of the challenges of being in love with a Scorpio male is to get him to voice his innermost thoughts and feelings. Sometimes it is impossible know exactly what a Scorpio is thinking! He can be a temperamental, jealous lover, so watch your step. You will have to play by his rules or leave him. With this man, there are no shades of gray.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>Still waters run deep, and you will find him fiercely loyal and deeply passionate. This Pluto ruled-lover would never dream of divulging details of your private life together to others, and expects the same from you. Woe to the woman who strays from his bed to another lover, for he will never forgive her. The Scorpion`s sting is never used casually, only when he feels threatened to the core, for its sting kills not only the victim but the Scorpion itself. Scorpio will never suffer betrayal.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>If you want to get your Scorpio lover a bit more relaxed and focused on you, try taking him to a small, cozy restaurant that serves solid manly food like a juicy steak and fries. Red wine will probably be his choice over champagne. The Scorpio male is no delicate gourmand. He would love a dark, rich chocolate mouse for dessert, if he likes sweets (some Scorpios do, some don`t). Wear your little black dress or something in burgundy, his favorite color.<br><br>Your Scorpio will want you to be uninhibited. Don`t become offended if he suggests viewing a sex video together. He does not see pornography as degrading to women, but as research and stimulus for new things to do. Since this sign rules law enforcement, crime and punishment, suggest he play policeman with you. Give him a gift box containing a blindfold and some handcuffs and you`ll be all set. This man likes trying out a little light S&amp;M playacting too so if you trust him, be cooperative if wants to put his naughty girl over his knee for a little spanking. This intense sign will insist on being the one in control, but surrendering to a Scorpio can be divine rapture.<br><br><strong>Scorpio Female</strong><br><br>The Scorpio woman has great charm, allure, and inner strength, and is able to overcome most any obstacle in life. She comes across as self-confident and self-possessed and men are drawn to her for that reason. There is a mysterious quality about the Scorpio woman, because she is intensely private, discrete and secretive. Soon she will learn everything about you, but later you will realize that she hasn`t given you many details about herself--that`s Scorpio`s natural reticence.<br><br>Finally, the operative word to best understand your Scorpio lover is "passion." One Scorpio once said to me that passion was the single most important ingredient in life, that is, to be passionate about one`s loved ones, one`s career, one`s lifestyle, for without passion, what kind of life would we have in the end? Well said!<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Your Scorpio beauty is attracted to power, so if you have it, you are ahead of the game. Your other challenge will be that this lady has a mind of her own, so if you think you can tame her, forget it.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>Her highly intuitive nature makes her a mind reader extraordinaire, so don`t try to hide anything from her. If you are trying to impress her with power you don`t have, her Pluto-ruled nature will sense it like a homing device. (Certainly you don`t want to activate her seek and destroy mechanism.) In love and friendship, she is true-blue loyal and will expect the same from you. If you show her the slightest reason to distrust you, however, she will never forgive you. On the other hand, treat her well and she will reward you for the rest of your life. Home and family are regarded as sacred, and Scorpio will defend and support her man to the ends of the earth. Like Leo women, Scorpio women are into control, and with her magnetic, femme fatale powers, she will soon have the upper hand. After all, who could resist her famous Scorpion gaze, those memorable bedroom eyes?<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>If you take your Scorpio beloved out for dinner, make it a private little dark rendezvous, overlooking water if possible or better yet, as a guest on a private yacht (preferably yours). The Scorpion woman will always be understated with her powerful sexuality--she doesn`t need to flaunt it, it exudes naturally. In her dress, she is very careful about her accessories, buying only thee finest shoes and handbags, and if she needs one, an elegant leather brief case. She knows these accessories punctuate her entire look and impart a feeling of true elegance. Get her quality things made out of leather (down, boy, not those things). If treating her to perfume, get her a modern oriental or something of musk and subtly sexual.<br><br>While the Scorpio woman is always a lady in public, she loves being her man`s fantasy woman in the bedroom. Buy her some new lingerie in of her most flattering tones: maroon, eggplant or a black. Elegant French and Italian imported lingerie will impress her so buy her a demi-cup push up bra, tiny, sheer g-string bikini and elegant garter belt, complete with a pair of black seamed stockings. She may also be amused and aroused by a lavishly illustrated photography book by Helmut Newton or Doris Kloster. If you get lucky, she may want to experiment a little by lap dancing for you and you alone.<br><br>This sign rules detective work, so plan a mystery for her. She has a rich imagination and this should work whether you`ve known her a month or a decade. Tell her to meet you in the most elegant hotel bar in town. When you spot her, stand at the other end of the bar and have the waiter send over a glass of champagne and a note from you. By now the suggestive nature of your behavior will have the staff murmuring and staring and it will begin to turn her on tremendously. After the second or third drink, send her the key to your room in a small envelope. (Book their best suite ahead of time and stock it with roses and.) When she`s pocketed the key, have her meet you by the elevator. Ride up alone, pushing her against the back wall of the elevator and tell her in great detail what you have planned. Show her the silk ribbons you`ve tucked into your breast pocket--Scorpio is intrigued by bondage. Although she will try her hardest not to show it, she will be aching ! for you to begin. She won`t forget this mystery, and neither will you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saggitarius Male</strong><br><br>Your Sagittarius guy has a strong intellect, penetrating thought process and continual curiosity about the world around him. Your man is ready for a deep discussion on ethics, morality, politics, philosophy, or religion, so go ahead one night and tackle The Meaning Of Life. Unlike Gemini, who focuses on details of the here and now, Sagittarius looks at the entire sweep of collected knowledge and tries to make sense out of the big picture. His most attractive qualities are his faith and optimism, and his customary cheer will endear him to you. This sign also has major wanderlust, so pack your glacier glasses and bug spray if you want to travel with him on his jaunts to the most exotic locales. Finally, this is the sign of the ultimate jock. Many of our most gifted Olympians are born under this sign and he will require lots of physical activity. If he sounds like a handful, it`s because he is, but such an interesting handful!<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Your Sagittarius man likes the bachelor life more than most signs, so getting him to commit may take some doing. Freedom is something he values enormously and it`s crucial for him to be able to do what he wants to do.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>"Mens sanis in corpore Sagittarius" Sag has so much energy he will need some sort of regular exercise to keep him from going completely mental. If he needs to spend what you believe to be inordinate amounts of time at the gym, don`t hassle him-- humor him instead. (You won`t be able to win this one anyway). Enjoy his beautiful shoulders and abs and glutes and tell hiim he looks just like the Diet Coke man.<br><br>Sag is great because they always tell the truth, but sometimes hearing unvarnished truth can be rough on the rest of us. They have no sense of diplomacy, so if you ask their opinion, be ready to hear it! In love, Sag needs lots of sex and sports but he has an equal need for an intellectual partner. He will want his woman to stay up to date on political issues and trends and he will enjoy lively and even heated debates. If he needs regular nights out with the boys, say "fine." Nothing spoils a relationship faster for a Sag than a sense of claustrophobia.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Equipment for his favorite sport or new workout clothing would be good, and if you are feeling generous, a membership to a health club would be ideal (that would be a subtle acknowledgment of his manly physical prowess). This sign adores animals too, so you could surprise him with that pet Dalmatian puppy he wants.<br><br>Sagittarius is a sophisticated sign that enjoys international cuisine. When taking him to dinner read the reviews and find an unusual restaurant such as one that serves Vietnamese, Japanese, Turkish, or Thai cuisine. Afterwards, continue the international theme by going to a foreign flick. Often guys from this sign are good with languages and at the very least enjoy a good debate, so chose a movie with a substantial plot (no, The Bodyguard won`t quite cut it.) This sign loves sports, as participant rather than a spectator. Suggest you go swimming, play tennis or do any sport where you can keep up your end fairly well. His ego is not fragile, this guy doesn`t want you to let him win for he enjoys and admires strong women. So give him a real workout on the courts and you`ll both win!<br><br>The more things you do in the great outdoors, the better, for he likes to be in expansive space. You know where this is all leading in terms of your seduction--your Sagittarius lover would be thrilled if you suggested making love al fresco. This could be a problem if you are moved too do this in winter and live in a freezing region of the country. Since Sag is the sign of the centaur, chances are he likes horseback riding, so how about seducing him in the barn on top of an old-fashioned hay stack? Start by telling him how perfect his riding "seat" is and how you couldn`t get your eyes off him. Since Sagittarius is the sign ruling the thighs, gently stroking him there will drive him wild with desire. If the weather is warmer, seduce him out in the wide open spaces, in a private, lush and green setting, under the full moon and stars. Can you think of anything more romantic?<br><br><strong>Saggitarius Female</strong><br><br>The Sagittarius woman is vivacious, funny, self assured, and sophisticated. She probably had an opportunity to travel as a child, and will need to continue to do so throughout her life. She`s a woman who needs challenge and intellectual stimulation in all parts of her life.<br><br>Sag women are often highly successful at what they set out to do simply because they are so positive they will succeed. Since the sign also rules international communication, they are either known worldwide or deal with matters of global importance. This is not an overly-sensitive sign, and when criticized, they listen carefully to the feedback. She should be careful not to hurt her mate`s feelings by being too direct in her comments; Sag often has no idea of how her words effect others. Her man should also be sure to allow her a sense of freedom which is highly important to the Sag woman.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>To keep her intellectually stimulated will be a lifelong struggle. This is no dumb bunny, and you may have to struggle to keep up with her. (Her idea of fun is listening to National Public Radio.) She gets bored easily, so be forewarned!<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>Her sign rules the centaur, half man, half horse, pointing high, toward the sky, which symbolizes her quest to reach the lofty goals she`s set. She could be "high maintenance" in that you will have to endure all the highs and lows of her existence, for her motto is nothing ventured, nothing gained. Alas, some things just aren`t going too work out, but unlike Cancer, who will try to second-guess themselves, Sag`s optimism will buoy her up. She will be on to Plan B in no time. Sometimes this could be exhausting for you, so keep the vitamins handy.<br><br>Places To Go, Things To Buy Her<br><br>If you`d like to get her a fragrance, choose one of the fresh new uni-sex fragrance, for she won`t wear anything too conventionally flowery or sweet. She is apt to be a runner or do some equally strenuous sport--can you imagine a marathon runner fussing with Arpege? Not quite.<br><br>Her likes her look sporty, preferring pants to skirts and sportswear to anything more formal. Sag generally likes comfortable shoes, the heels not too high. It must have been a Sag who started the trend of wearing her sneakers on the way to work. Often Sag women were tomboys as a kid, and as a woman she manages to keep her enviable figure because of all the exercise she gets. Give her clothing which is body revealing, such as a mini skirt and matching top in lycra or spandex. She is one woman who can carry it off in style! Or treat her to ten weeks with a personal trainer and she`ll be yours for life.<br><br>The Sag woman has no patience with frilly nightgowns but prefers either something plain and natural. What would she most likely wear to bed? A cool, thin, tight white cotton tank top which outlines her breasts, worn with tiny cotton string panties--or nothing at all. She likes men`s wear, so you might catch her putting on your button-down shirt with not much else on but a smile. (Remember how fetching Annette Bening looked in the seduction scene from American President?). She will do more for your shirt than you could ever imagine.<br><br>She will be impressed if you treat your body like a temple too, so try to work out often. Then, you can lounge around in tight bicycle shorts to heat things up. Look at her innocently and say you took a part time job as a messenger and need to wear them for practicality and comfort. (She`d got a good sense of humor.) Since this woman would love a strenuous workout, plan an active, feather-flying pillow fight or try chasing her around the yard. Feeling randy? Toss her into a snow drift. The aim here is to get her pulse rate up then convince her she won`t need her morning run with you around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Capricorn Male</strong><br><br>When Henry Kissinger said "Power is the greatest aphrodisiac" he sounded like a Capricorn, even though he isn`t (he`s Gemini). Your Capricorn lover is highly ambitious and very hardworking, so be prepared to endure some nights alone while he stays late at the office. All those long hours, however, will pay off, and your future lifestyle together is likely to be mighty interesting. Capricorns tend to achieve positions of power and surround themselves with highly successful friends and associates. Unlike Aries who needs to own his own business, Capricorn likes working as part of the team in large corporations and usually climbs up through the ranks there. The Capricorn man is excellent with finances so chances are money will never be a problem with him.<br><br>Your Challenge:<br><br>Your man likes successful women, and will say to himself, "Can I introduce her to my boss?" You will have to reassure him he can, and further, that you`ll actually improve his career prospects. (The higher he goes, the more his significant other will count.)<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>In love, your Capricorn man`s most enduring quality is his unexpected, silly sense of humor. This is such a different side of his ambitious and driven personality that it will catch you off guard. Don`t ever be afraid to laugh in bed, for you will endear yourself to Mr. Capricorn forever. Lovemaking does not have to be serious all the time.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Capricorns are status conscious, so when choosing a gift, be sure to chose something from a fine retailer. Alternatively, Capricorn rules history, so an antique gold coin, rare letter autographed by an American president or a best seller on an historical subject would be terrific.<br><br>When taking him to dinner, suggest that you meet at his college club, country club or even the Republican Club (my apologies to Caps who are Democrats--I`m just trying to make a point). Or choose a fine, established restaurant that looks like a club, with wood paneling and a low-key, moneyed ambiance. Eating chicken and peas doesn`t bother him--he is used to it from all the industry dinners he regularly attends.<br><br>Since he wants a Grace Kelly-type rich girl, beg, borrow or rent a luxurious mink coat (he has no qualms about you wearing fur like Aquarius does). Wear it securely closed with nothing on underneath but your finest jewelry, lacy bra, panties and garter belt with lace top black stockings. Of course you will want to apply your most elegant and sophisticated makeup. Carry a proper handbag, and wear your darkest and most glamorous sunglasses. Don`t forget your stiletto heels, of course--this is no time for sensible shoes. Hail a cab to where he works (he is happy there and in his element) and, walking into hiis office unannounced, close the door purposefully (you`ve told his secretary to hold all calls). Whether you leave the blinds up or down is up to you, but be sure to play out his greatest fantasies. He will never forget this day!<br><br><strong>Capricorn Female</strong><br><br>The Capricorn woman is the one with the good gold jewelry, neutral tweed or classic Brooks Brothers suits and silk shirts. She always looks highly successful, or like she comes from old money (even if she doesn`t.) Your Capricorn woman realizes the value of a solid social network and will join organizations which will help her up the career ladder. Her lover will soon realize that he will need to share her with the world, and will be proud of her long list of accomplishments. She will come across as serious, conservative, shy, detailed, organized and self-disciplined. She delivers on her promises. She keeps her word and everything that bears her name is the best she can muster.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Your Capricorn lover is practical--coming from a good background and having success potential is important to her. Some Capricorn women marry for social positiion, others are just concerned that their husband to be will be able to support her in the manner to which she is accustomed. You`ll need to convince her of your earnest ambition and your solid future. If you`re socially connected, by all means, don`t hide it.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>In love she is slow and careful. Never one to wander from one flirtation to another, the Capricorn woman has her feet well planted on the ground. If her man suggests something new to her and she isn`t sure, he should give her time. Capricorn generally likes to mull things over and get used to ideas. She must never be forced or she will resist for sure.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>When getting her jewelry, think about buying an antique piece of estate jewelry, or give her something handed down from your grandmother. For a lovely dinner, take her to your club or to a restaurant that looks like a grand estate. Afterwards, give her a madly romantic experience, such as a carriage ride through the park in the snow, with warm blanket and brandy afterwards, or plan to meet her on top of a tall building, such as the Empire State building at 11:00 PM (Ã  la An Affair to Remember, but in this version, both of you show up). Kiss her passionately, and promise her your true love.<br><br>Later, take her back to your apartment. Since this sign rules history, buy her a historical romance novel and read steamy portions of it to her in bed. Or, rent a romantic video, set in the days of knights and princes. Your lady is so used to making all the decisions at home and at work that she is tired of it all. She wants to be rescued now and then instead of having to rescue everyone else. Transfer all those feelings to you. Here is your chance to be her real life knight in shining armor and you will have her heart for life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aquarius Male</strong><br><br>The most striking quality in the Aquarius man is fierce independence and creativity. He may also have a scientific bent. Aquarians never care about what has been done in the past because they are totally focused on the future. Your Aquarius lover may also be concerned with humanitarian issues and feel moved to do something about a environmental imbalance or social injustice. Natural and charismatic leaders, most of our presidents have been Aquarians (President Ronald Reagan is one). They usually have many friends, although only few can get into their inner circle.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Friendship is so important to him that you may feel his pals are more important to him than you are. This isn`t the case, but can be hard to cope with at times. Loving an Aquarius is often frustrating because they often act aloof and hard to catch. But as the French say, the one who suffers greatest loves the most. You`ll need to position yourself inside his circle, and not be on the outside looking in.<br><br>How To Handle Them<br><br>In love and marriage, the Aquarius male will need to retain his sense of individuality and freedom. The wise woman in love with an Aquarius will not hem him in. Inside the Aquarius there is often a struggle between wanting to live alone but still craving love and nurturing (a side kept well hidden). This duality could drive you crazy at times, but it is best to ignore it. When they become angry, they will act distant rather than rant and rave, so try to draw him out, and get him used to sharing his innermost thoughts. When there`s a disagreement, reason with him intellectually rather than emotionally; this guy is analytical.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Nothing makes an Aquarius happier than talking about electronics or the internet. They are ruled by Uranus, the planet of the future. He will spend his entire day on the computer, and his only fears are frying his CPU or a power outage. Tell him your VCR needs setting, that your computer fonts are screwed up, or that you haven`t configured your new e-mail software yet. Be<br>a damsel in electronic distress. Over fiberoptic cables and phone modems you can find true love.<br><br>Be sure to send him frequent e-mail to show him you are thinking about him. Meet at one of the new chat rooms, like The Palace or V-Chat, especially if you know one another well, and assume various avatars and speak to one another in a predetermined code language. Attend computer user meetings together, catch the newest 3D flick (complete with 3D glasses) or play a virtual reality game. Meet at a cyber cafe for coffee and surfing www.suck.com a deux. Is all this getting a little too wired for you?<br>Aquarius also likes a good off-line party, so find out where one is happening and bring him along, or throw your own bash.<br><br>Don`t only rely on e-mail to reach your Aquarius, but also leave steamy love notes on his office answering machine (if it`s private), or call him on his car phone early in the day and make a "date" for one another that evening. Say something memorable and get him all worked up. But remember that for an Aquarius to fall deeply in love, they first have to be friends (this sign rules friendship). Don`t rush him, or think you aren`t making "progress" fast enough.<br><br>He likes you wearing something current, short and sexy in a man-made fiber, so greet him tonight wearing nothing but Saran Wrap. For going out, you might choose something in shiny stretch vinyl. Sexually, Aquarius is lots of fun because he is so spontaneous and experimental. He might visit a sexual aid shop and come home with a bag of little toys for you both to enjoy. A sense of playfulness is essential with Aquarius and you`ll have to lighten up a bit to stay popular with him.<br><br><strong>Aquarius Female</strong><br><br>The Aquarius woman is smart, independent, somewhat rebellious and a true original. Part of the reason her man has fallen in love with her is the fact that she`s not a clinging vine. Quite the contrary, she matches wits with her man, has a wide circle of her own friends, and prefers to stand on her own two feet. Many Aquarius women are leaders in their field. She`s analytical and her ability to communicate is highly developed. If you want to get on her good side, use reason and logic rather than emotion.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Your Challenge will be to keep things from becoming boring or routine, which would spell disaster for your relationship. She is not an easy little bird to catch, for once you feel you`ve got her in your hands (or arms) she`s flitted away again. She will need her space, and with so many other guys buzzing around her (she tells you they`re just friends) you will need to steady your nerves.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Her best colors are bright fuchsia, cobalt blue or charcoal gray. Aquarius women tend to wear streamlined, futuristic clothing and some Aquarius women don`t mind if they shock a bit. Her taste in jewelry is unique and individual, even New Age, so you could do well by getting her a special crystal. There is a uniqueness about the Aquarius woman, from her toes to her hair, she is always a bit different, on the cutting edge of what`s new and hot.<br><br>Another gift that would be a hit is a beeper with voice mail capability, all the better for you to leave her intimate love messages. If you take her out to eat, better ask ahead of she likes a certain kind of food, for many Aquarians are vegetarians. She does not need to be wined and dined in a five-star restaurant--she is just as happy in a noisy, lively bistro that serves good food and is a place where she might bump into friends. (To gget an Aquarius alone is a feat unto itself.)<br><br>Never inhibited in bed, Aquarius brings a sense of fun and playfulness to her lovemaking. She may suggest a video to watch beforehand, since Aquarius are so electronically-oriented, or if you know her very well, she might consent to making your private video together, with her ground rules. Since she loves being in the center of the action, tell her that you want make love to her in a semi-public place. Remember the movie set in Vietnam, called The Lover? The lovers meet regularly in an apartment right off the street where city noises and people walking around outside the door are quite audible, and the very closeness of the street has an erotic effect on lovers. Be inspired by this thought, perhaps at the next party you two attend. Choose a room where she can hear other guests but where the two of you can temporarily disappear for some privacy, maybe a closet or pantry. Don`t worry about her reaction to suggesting a quickie--if she knows you well, this is o! ne lady who will be delighted!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pisces Male </strong><br><br>This man`s vivid imagination and sensitivity (matched in intensity only by fellow water sign Cancer) will endear him to you quickly. Pisces` greatest strength is their creativity. Neptune makes them brilliant at expressing themselves in symbols and gestures. They therefore they make outstanding film makers, photographers, and dancers. Their empathetic nature will make you fall in love with him quickly, for it is possible you`ve never met a man who knows the inner you so well.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Pisces sometimes loses himself in his work, especially if he`s in a creative field. He needs a regular outlet to express his powerful emotions and insights on the world, so you will have to learn to be supportive of his efforts. At times he can be hard to pin down, but this is usually due to his not yet having made up his mind about an issue. Being a dual sign like Gemini, he likes to look at both sides of every situation before taking a stand.<br><br>How To Handle Him<br><br>When trying to persuade a Pisces man of anything, do not use facts or logic; appeal to his emotions and intuition. If you press any point too hard or become demanding, he will swim in the other direction. He is gentle to others and expects to be treated in kind. He hates ruts and constricting routines, so a free-form schedule in life is more to his liking.<br><br>Another important fact to remember is that Pisces will give freely of himself whenever he can, but if he feels he has been taken advantage of, he will retreat without warning. At that point, it is hard to win back his trust. The Pisces man needs to be appreciated.<br><br>This man is not materialistic or money-oriented--don`t bug him to ask for a raise or question why he doesn`t make more money. He realizes that possessions and money are onlyy earth-bound, temporal things that don`t matter much in the grand scheme. He is too spiritual to be concerned with such mundane matters. A deeply philosophical sign, money does not motivate him as much as self-expression and creativity do. (Money does have a way of finding a way to Pisces, nevertheless, so don`t think this is a sign doomed to poverty!)<br><br>Since Pisces reads body language better than any other sign, don`t be surprised if he just seems to know much more about you than you`ve ever told him. Of course, verbal communication is important too, but keep it delicate and poetic. When delivering criticism to him be diplomatic rather than direct. Pisces men never like anything too gritty and hard-hitting.<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>An ideal evening to a Pisces man would be to have dinner in an exotic Indian or Asian restaurant, and have a double espresso afterwards in a tiny, dark patisserie, debating a particular moral or ethical issue until the sun comes up. Or take him to the movies--he can`t seem to see enough of them.<br><br>Since Pisces rules the feet, why not delight your man by surprising him with some sppecial peppermint foot cream and a relaxing foot massage? Their feet are the first area of their body to show signs of stress. Now, the Pisces man`s first instinct is to pay attention to you first, so he will have to get used you lavishing attention of him. Be sure to tell him just looking at his body is a wonderful turn-on for you; the Pisces man has less vanity than most signs and may be surprised to hear you say this! Although he may not appear to need it, if you bolster his self-confidence in the bedroom he will turn into a dream lover for you!<br><br>A lush tropical island resort would be the perfect locale to seduce your Pisces beloved because he will feel refreshed and uninhibited near bodies of water. On the appointed day, tell him you`ve packed a picnic lunch and drive him out to the prettiest waterfall you can find on the island (do your research first). Bring along your Polaroid camera (Pisces rules photography) to capture some of the fun. Wearing only a thin T-shirt and string bikini bottom, dare him to follow as you run under the falls. Let yourself become totally drenched, hair and all. Do all this quickly to capture the element of surprise and allow him a moment or two to stare at you in your clingy, now see-though T and skimpy bottom, laughing and beckoning him to join you. Do you honestly not know how this scene ends?<br><br><strong>Pisces Female</strong><br><br>The Pisces temperament is gentle, romantic, caring, compassionate, and spiritual. Pisces rules the subconscious mind, and so it follows that her dreams are vivid and meaningful, even prophetic. You`ve got quite a glamorous sparkler on your hands--Elizabeth Taylor, Sharon Stone and Cindy Crawford are all dazzling Pisces, and each in their own way reflects the reserved aand unpretentious Pisces nature. Your Pisces enchantress almost always has large and beautiful eyes which mirror her feelings openly and she could be prone to cry easily. Soft and ultra-feminine, she will put your needs ahead of hers.<br><br>Your Challenge<br><br>Her feelings are very sensitive and easily hurt, so be careful how you address her. In any relationship, she likes to proceed gradually, perhaps at a slower pace than you would like. But rush her and your little fish will disappear into the depths of the sea.<br><br>How To Handle Her<br><br>She`s mystical and poetic and she needs a regular outlet for her creative expressions. Her sign rules all non-verbal communication--symbols, gesture, dance, art, and poetry--and the Pisces woman is highly intuitive. She trusts her feelings and she reads boody language perfectly, so don`t try to say one thing and mean another--she will catch on quickly. Pisces will need to be alone occasionally to recharge and refresh herself, so allow her time for that.<br><br>She`s caring and sensitive to her man, but can easily be so self-effacing that she forgets her own needs. Her urge to relieve suffering in others is as strong as the life force and it is the single most important element of her nature to understand. Some people will sometimes take advantage of her good nature. Her man should help her by reminding her that it`s OK to say no to favors others ask of her. At times the world can have a wearing-down effect on her self-confidence, which sometimes needs rebuilding in even the strongest Pisces women. When Pisces is hurt, she will build her own version of the world to protect herself, preferring to live in a world of dreams until she feels she is ready for re-entry into reality. Realize this is not a weakness--she will always come back--and the worst thing you could say to this fragile beauty is "Get real!"<br><br>Things To Do, Gifts To Buy<br><br>Don`t be overtly sexual with Pisces--she is subtle and indirect. Come across brash and aggressive and she`ll vanish. Instead, give her a book of romantic poetry,, like that of Edna St. Vincent Millay or a beautiful black &amp; white photograph of a couple kissing. Or give her music, perhaps something soothing and spiritual, such as Enya, Orion or Monks singing Gregorian chant.<br><br>Buy her clothing in one of her favorite shades of violet, blue or sea green. She loves lace, angora sweaters, and prefers flowing, soft chiffon-type fabrics over sharp tailoring. Silk is favored over crisp cotton. Sparkling jewels look especially beautiful on her, so consider surprising her with diamonds, amethysts or aquamarine stones. In choosing a restaurant, pick a dark, private, romantic place filled with flowers. She loves to dance (Pisces rules the feet) so take her to a club with a great band. She also loves the movies, for her ruler, Neptune, rules film and she can easily lose herself in the story. She will also adore tickets to the ballet, an art opening or a poetry reading. Finally, surprise her a deluxe shower head for her bathroom (Pisces is a water sign), promising her that the two of you will play under it soon.<br><br>Sex to Pisces is spiritual. She simply cannot sleep with a man she isn`t in love with. She`s worth waiting for--her natural sense of rhythm and grace in body movement makes her a fabulous lover. This does not preclude her from having fuun with her lover--that is a certainty--but she will need a full commitment of love from you before surrendering.<br><br>No other sign loves costume and fantasy as much as Pisces does, so when you get to know her well, suggest you both go shopping together for an outfit to wear in the bedroom--a French maid? Cleopatra? Elvira, Mistress of the Dark? Her rich imagination needs fantasy, so you will be on the right track. If she is a reserved Pisces, give her a gift-wrapped bottle of her favorite scent tucked inside the pocket of a new luxurious terry robe. She`ll be happy to try her new robe on--just tell her the rules are that she wear nothing else. Then draw her close to you, turn on the water in the bath and take a long, passionate and steamy soak together. Afterwards, be sure to rub on some of the softy scented cream that you bought and let nature take its course!</div>
