            <div class='col-md body'>Honeydew;<br><br>Sophisicated character. you have high tendency to develope crush on people. Do not always fall for them eventually. Leaving you with many loose mess to clear up. You are a sweet-talker. Attracting many people. As much as your sweet-talking is, your committment is as little. Potray yourself as Mr Goody and Girl Next Door very well. Inside of you is however, very wild.<br><br>You do not accept changes easily and is a mysterious person.<br><br>Apple;<br><br>Apple has a wierd temper. Often have unforced blow up at the wrong situations.When there is a reason for a throw of tamtrum, you seemingly held back. Your low self esteem has affected your love life in more ways then you thought. Hence dittering your patner. Once you get a unexpected turn of fortune, your self-esteem will gets overwhelmingly high. Resulting you to become overly popular. If uncontrolled, it might well turn out as flirtish. Apples like to try out many patners or until finding the right one. Once the right person is found, apple will give his/her all. A female apple is a charming person with character. A male apple thought is a talkative and over reacting person.<br><br>Dragon fruit;<br><br>Like the fruit itself suggest, you have a short temper. Often showing too much of your negative sentiments, resulting in your surrounding friends leaving you one by one. Opposite sex though find your temper attractive. Long term relationship gets very rough due to your temper as well. You have amper choices of patners but seldom am serious and committed to them. Making you an unreliable patner, but opposite sex though knowing that, still am attracted to you.<br><br>Melon;<br><br>You appeal more towards opposite sex then of yours, in turn getting more suitors as well as critics. A Melon is a confused character. You fall in love easily but most of the time a wrong move. When you set your mind to love someone, you eventually fall for him. However, you seems to do the right thing in a wrong way, the person you set your mind to love, umtperly isn't the one you should love. Hence, missing out the one you should. By a twist of fate, the one you should love might be the person you once set your mind to forget. You like to take risk when choosing who to love thus missing out someone whom you can thrust your whole life to. Your Cananova or Miss Right has been around you for a long time, and have never once left you even when taken granted by you.<br><br>Pineapple;<br><br>You have a very appealing character. Pineapple does not potray himself well to others in their first few meetings, once they know you well, they eventually like you more than anybody else. In love life, due to your appeal, you will have many admirers. Some pineapples is a disappointing lover, whilst some turn out to be a good patners. The contrast lies on whether you are able to handle the temptation of multiple choices.<br><br>Grape;<br><br>A grape is the most romantic fruit, likewise expressing the romantism of you.

Thus, losing all your confident to pursue the person you love. You are the strongest person, having no fear in life, able to overcome any barriers. However, when it comes to love, you will lose all your bravery and becomes weak at times. A grape seldom falls in love, when you are in love with a person, you may not fall in love with anyone else for a long time. You do not like to shower your love for the one you love openly in fear of pressurising her, choosing to use fake ignorance to cover your real concern for her; admirable but foolish. A wonderful patner, a faithful shoulder to rely on; and a lovely nest to rest upon. Will take extremely good care of your patners.<br><br>Mango;<br><br>Mango is timid in nature; have no courage to back your stand. Thus, opposite sex do not find you attractive. Your feelings change suddenly and easily. You are always lonely. You are sweet and innocent. Trusted by many people but you do not thrust people easily. Its hard for you to find your love, and have trouble mantaining it. If you are engage with a tough patner, you become very well taken care of and eventually bulid up your courage. That person will no doubt be a good patner for you.<br><br>Peach;<br><br>A peach is very sensitive person, you get jealous easily, and complain over little things.You have a capable personality for everyone to trust you and like you. You undoubtly love your patner and willing to go through hardship but due to your overly sensitive character, maintaining a lasting relationship is tough. You are a making of a good partner but lack the mutual thrust in your love. A wrong perception that being a good love can cover your wildfulness in your thrust.<br><br>Jackfruit;<br><br>A good friend and a good listener, jackfruit have many soul friends due to your will to listen. At the early part of your life, you like to try out alot of patners and engage in multiple relationships. You have a very complicating love life due to your fondness of challenges. However, once your finance and life stables down, and is ready to settle down, a jackfruit is a good patner. Once your soul mate is found, you seemingly never will run out of track. Although a very late lover, you are a very stable lover.<br><br>Lemon;<br><br>A lemon is a Vinegar pot. Getting jealous over seemingly harmless gestures. High egoism fails to back step during a tiff. When in love, a lemon is a good lover, when out of love, a lemon have high hatred regardless of any reasoning, and falls in love easily in no time. Rough and tough love life. A thrustworthy and understanding friend. A good friend, bad lover.<br><br>Lime;<br><br>You potray yourself very well as a gentleman, seemingly giving other people a good image. A good listener as well as a good advisor. You seldom commit because of your high expectation. Deep down in you, you are not as good as you potray yourself to be.

A good worker.<br><br>Strawberry;<br><br>A strawberry is someone very nice, hardworking and considerate. Plan your future very well. A female strawberry is a girl next door, a male strawberry however is a multiple lover.
