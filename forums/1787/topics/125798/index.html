It is not that<br>they<br>cannot have children; it is just that they have never had sex.<br><br>The sexless marriage is one of several reasons why experts fear Japan is on<br>the<br>verge of a demographic disaster. In 2003 Japan's birthrate hit a record low<br>of<br>1.29 - the average number of times a woman gives birth during her lifetime -<br>one of the lowest rates in the world, according to the cabinet office. The<br>population will peak next year at about 128 million, then decline to just<br>over<br>100 million by 2050.<br><br>The 200 women a year who seek help at a clinic in the Tokyo suburbs have not<br>had sex with their husbands in up to 20 years, and some never, according to<br>Kim<br>Myong-gan, who runs the clinic.<br><br>"The women who come to see me love their husbands and aren't looking for a<br>divorce," he said. "The problem is that their husbands lose interest in sex<br>or<br>don't want sex from the start.<br><br>"Many men think of their wives as substitute mothers, not as women<br>with emotional and sexual needs."<br><br>Mr Kim's short-term solution is unconventional. After an initial counselling<br>session, he produces photographs of 45 men, mostly professionals in their<br>40s,<br>with whom the women are invited to go on dates and then arrange regular<br>assignations in hotel rooms.<br><br>Mr Kim dismissed accusations that his service was little more than a male<br>prostitution ring. "The men volunteer and pay half the hotel and restaurant<br>bills, so legally there is absolutely nothing wrong with it," he said.<br><br>He had rescued hundreds of women from despair, he said, but his "sex<br>volunteers" would do nothing to cure the malaise that afflicts the<br>institution<br>of marriage in Japan.<br><br>"Men don't even think it is a problem if they don't have sex with their<br>wives,"<br>Mr Kim said. "They have pornography and the sex industry to take care of<br>their<br>needs, but their wives have nowhere to go. They just suffer in silence."<br><br>The number of married couples is in rapid decline. In 2000, almost 70 per<br>cent<br>of men and 54 per cent of women between 25 and 29 were unmarried. That bodes<br>ill for the birthrate, as Japanese society frowns upon having children<br>outside<br>marriage.<br><br>A survey of 600 women found 26 per cent had not had sex with their husbands<br>in<br>the past year.<br><br>"We are sort of room-mates rather than a married couple," one man, who had<br>not<br>had sex with his wife for two years, told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.<br><br>The Government has introduced several measures to lift the birthrate.<br>Fathers<br>will be encouraged to take more than the 47 per cent of annual paid leave<br>they<br>currently use, and their employers will be told to provide more<br>opportunities<br>for them to stay at home with their children.<br><br>Local authorities, meanwhile, are devising novel ways to increase fertility.<br><br>In the town of Yamatsuri, women will receive 1 million yen ($A12,000) if<br>they<br>have a third child, and in Ishikawa prefecture families with three children<br>will get discounts at shops and restaurants.<br><br>The absence of children in so many homes is having an impact.
