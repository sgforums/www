            <div class='col-md body'>If you're like most people, common  everyday items look inert to you. But what you may not know is that many have  a gender. For example..<br><br>Freezer bags - Male, because  they hold everything in but you can see right through them.<br><br>Photocopier - Female, because  once turned off, it takes a while to warm up. It's an effective reproductive  device if the right buttons pushed, but can wreak havoc, if the wrong  buttons are pushed.<br><br>Tyre - Male, because it goes  bald and often it's over inflated.<br><br>Hot Air Balloon - Male,  because to get it to go anywhere you have to light a fire under its arse and,  of course, there's the hot part.<br><br>Sponges - Female, because  they're soft and squeezable and retain water.<br><br>Web page - Female, because  they're always getting hit on.<br><br>London Underground - Male,  because it uses the same old lines to pick people up.<br><br>Hourglass - Female, because  over time, the weight shifts to the bottom.<br><br>Hammer - Male, because it  hasn't evolved much over the last 5,000 years, but it's handy to have around.<br><br>Remote control - Female...  Ha! You thought it'd be male. But consider - It gives a man pleasure, he'd be  lost without it, and while he doesn't always know the right buttons to  push, he keeps trying.</div>

Things like 'chalk' or 'pencil,' she described, would have a gender association although in English these words were neutral.<br><br>Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"<br><br>The teacher wasn't certain which it was, and so divided the class into two groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. One group was comprised of the women in the class, and the other, of men. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation.<br><br>The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in the masculine gender because:<br>In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br>They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br>They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br>As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you might have had a better model.<br><br>The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because:<br>No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br>The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br>Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br>As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</div>
