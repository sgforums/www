Equally sick, he exclaims, "If my wife makes me another sandwich for lunch, IÂ’m going to jump off this building with you!"<br><br>The Irishman opens his lunchbox and sees chicken, which he is also tired of. He says, "Feckin' chicken! If me wife makes one more tomorrow, I'm genna to jump off of this building with ye lads!"<br><br>The next day, the American opens his lunchbox, sees a salad and jumps to his death. The Englishman opens his lunchbox, sees a ham sandwich and jumps too. The Irishman opens his lunchbox, sees the chicken and jumps to his death also.<br><br>At the funeral parlour, the American's wife goes up to speak. She weeps, "If I'd known he didnÂ’t want a salad for lunch, I wouldnÂ’t have made him any. IÂ’d have chosen something else..." She leaves the podium crying.<br><br>The English wife gets up and sighs, "I didn't realise he hated sandwiches I too would've chosen something else..." She also leaves the room in tears.<br><br>Everyone turns to look at the Irishman's wife, who then stands up to speak.<br><br>"Don't look at me like that! He makes his own lunch."</div></blockquote>wicked <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There once lived a staunch atheist. One day though his town is ravaged by a flood, and the water rises so high that he has to climb onto the roof of his house.<br><br>However the floodwaters continue to rise, and in his desperation he decides to give prayer a try. He mutters, "God, if you do exist, please save me!"<br><br>No sooner than he's finished a boat pulls up alongside him. The rescuers on the boat pleads with him to jump on board but he says, "Go away, I'm waiting for God to come and save me!"<br><br>The boat leaves, and soon the water is covering his feet. A rescue helicopter spots him and the rescuers lower a ladder to him. He also yells at them, "Go away, I'm waiting for God to come down and save me!"<br><br>The helicopter leaves, and the atheist gets swept away and drowns. He is taken up into heaven and he sees God for the first time. "Why didn't you save me when I asked you to?" he asks angrily.<br><br>The Lord replies, "I sent a boat and a helicopter to save you, what more did you want?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, "Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong place."<br><br>So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, they've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy.<br><br>One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how's it going down there in hell?"<br><br>Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."<br><br>God replies, "What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here."<br><br>Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him."<br><br>God says, "Send him back up here or I'll sue."<br><br>Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?"</div>
