Really often.

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember the old Church of the Holy Spirit building...I had Catechism classes since I was 7. And the congregation would spill out of the small red building into the carpark at Easter Vigil and midnight Christmas Masses.<br><br>I'd ever eaten at Pizza Hut once, when it occupied the unit which was taken over by McDonald's and now Om Sushi. It was pretty dark inside.<br><br>The tim sum restaurant, 7-Eleven, Dino's and Sweet Secrets (and the pet shop in Thomson Plaza) seem to have been there forever in largely the same form, while the unit in the corner below road level (now the seafood restaurant) kept changing hands.<br><br>Does anyone remember Food Lion? They had an outlet waaaaay back a couple of units from Dino's. I don't know how the Ritz there has survived since the end of the appel strudel craze.</div>
