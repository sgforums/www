Only the sandwiches are worth eating now. And I can 2 enormous scoops from Icekimo for a small premium over a single scoop from Swenson's. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> They've got black sesame, Horlicks, Milo, Nutella, D24, blueberry cheesecake, chempedak, jasmine and lime, among others.<br><br>The only pizza chains left here seem to be Pizza Hut and Canadian, with a few small players...heck, someone enlighten me if the Shakey's/Denny's (can't remember which it is!) in Chinatown is still around!<br><br>Oh, and the French crÃªpe place at Thomson Imperial Court where that obnoxious teacher was thrown out has closed for good.</div></blockquote>I really must go to Icekimo when I get back... ever tried the horlicks icecream?
