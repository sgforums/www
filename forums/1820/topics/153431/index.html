Estonian Martin escaped unhurt.<br><br>The stage was immediately halted and organisers decided shortly afterwards to cancel the remaining two stages. </span><br><br>Police sealed off the stage, as is normal practice in such a situation, and began investigations.<br><br>A statement from the organisers said: "It is with deep regret that we confirm that Michael Park was fatally injured following an accident on special stage 15.<br><br>"The next of kin has been informed. The driver of car number eight, Markko Martin, is uninjured."<br><br>No spectators were involved in the accident.<br><br>Park, nicknamed 'Beef', was a highly-experienced co-driver who had worked with former champions Richard Burns and Colin McRae.<br><br>Married with children, he first began rallying on the world championship circuit in 1994 as Mark Higgins' co-driver.<br><br>Park teamed up with Martin in 2000 when the Estonian was rallying a privately-entered Toyota.<br><br>They stayed together at Subaru and Ford before moving to Peugeot this year. The pair had won five world rallies together.<br><br>Peugeot issued a statement confirming that Martin had hit a tree on the right hand side of the car, fatally injuring Park.<br><br>"Peugeot Automobiles and Peugeot Sport would like to express their feeling of extreme sadness and deep emotion to the family of Michael Park."<br><br>The cancellation of the remaining stages means Citroen's world champion, Sebastien Loeb, wins the rally.</blockquote><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/world_rally/4257438.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/world_rally/4257438.stm</a><br><br>Requescat in pace...thoughts with his family and his friends, including MÃ¤rtin. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>apparently the organisers wanted the results of the rally to stand. Marcus Gronholm was withdrawn by Peugeot so Loeb didn't want the win either, but the governing body is being their usual rigid inflexible self. U know, like Indygate. So Loeb took a time penalty on purpose and Petter Solberg is the reluctant winner of this tragic event. Blow FIA.</div>
