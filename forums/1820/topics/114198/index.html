            <div class='col-md body'>Inflight entertainment-wise, SQ still the best. 30 channels to select from and all on AVOD (Audio Video on-demand - i.e. can start and pause as you like). You never get bore on SQ flight.<br><br>Price and convinence-wise, nothing beats the LCC (Low cost carriers), just book online in the morning and fly in the afternoon. Hassle free travel at low cost  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .

            <div class='col-md body'>I love this topic ... Ok here I go ...<br><br>Singapore Airlines is way way OVERRATED .  What so darn good about SQ ? They are just a normal airline like others like Emirates, JApan airlines, Qantas or British Airways. They have a lot of entertainment in their system.,Emirates , have more in fact. SQ's service is pretty good but I find some of their service very robotic like  but what I really dislike about SQ is the management. The removal of the jubilee, megatop and Leadership titles really disappoints me. A lot of people gave me their different versions... ooo well ....  the conditions of their special airfares that  puts me off..... A lot of publicty of SQ which However I will still support them but I feel there are other good airlines if not better then SQ.<br><br>My favourite airlines is Emirates and Japan Airlines. Flew on them a numerous of times , have nothing but praise the service and entertainment system. Both airlines have the outside camera where u can see take off and landing shots which is great from a passenger point of view.<br><br>I always choose the airline and aircraft type...  My favourite aircrafts to fly on are Boeing 777 , Airbus 330 and Boeing 747-400. However, there are some nice  birds I flew on and perhaps wont get to fly again , they are Boeing 727 and Lockhead L1011. Call me fussy but that what I am .... My next target is to fly the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 , the only airline that is flying to Singapore is Finnair ! Might fly to Bangkok just for the ride !! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
