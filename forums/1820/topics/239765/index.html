Fewer than one-third of French, Poles and Hungarians trust their pensions.<br><br>On the other hand, nearly three-quarters of Danes feel their pension is safe, while two-thirds of Finns and Dutch agree.<br><br>Britain, Spain, Cyprus and Italy were in the middle with roughly half of respondents confident in their pensions.<br><br>Almost half of Europeans said they were dissatisfied with local job opportunities, and 41 percent said their work was too demanding and stressful. Stress levels were highest at about 70 percent in Lithuania, Greece and Romania and lowest at around 25 percent in the Netherlands and Finland.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The survey found low trust in national political institutions and high levels of political indifference across Europe.</span><br><br>While overwhelming majorities said health, family, friends, leisure and work were important to them, only 43 percent rated politics and 52 percent religion as counting in their lives.<br><br>Only local councils scored positive trust figures, while 73 percent of EU citizens distrusted political parties, 62 percent didn't trust their national government and 61 percent tended not to trust their national parliament.<br><br>Respondents were not asked whether they trusted the EU.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Most Europeans think their personal situation will either improve (41 percent) or stay the same (40 percent) in the next five years, with young people the most optimistic and over-55s the most gloomy.</span><br><br>Estonians are the EU's chief optimists, while Hungarians are by far the biggest pessimists. - Reuters<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The grass always seems greener elsewhere, but each place has its own little problems. It's up to us to let politicians dictate our fortunes and moan about them, be content with our lot or try to beat them.<br><br>I know I'd like to raise my kids where they can be surrounded by gracious and open-minded people, and where they can enjoy the countryside, the coasts and the forests.<br><br>What do you think?</span></div>
