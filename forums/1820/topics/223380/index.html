It also drew widespread criticism from religious groups of all faiths and those lobbying against political correctness.<br><br>Staff said they had been inundated with complaints from angry nurses on behalf of disappointed patients but one worker in the hospital kitchens said the decision Â“was due to the manager of the catering department saying he was worried about the ethnic minority that worked here.Â”<br><br>Last night a spokeswoman from Poole Hospital Trust apologised to patients who may have been expecting a bun but said they had merely not been ordered despite it being the main day to give them out.<br><br><strong>John Midgley, co-founder of the Campaign Against Political Correctness, said: Â“I very much doubt if the hospital involved even consulted its ethnic minority staff to see if they were bothered before taking the decision.Â”</strong><br><br>Muslim groups also rejected the reasoning behind the decision staff claim was made.<br><br>Abdul Hamid Qureshi, of the Council of Mosques, said: Â“We have absolutely no problem with hot cross buns. There is no offence whatsoever. Any Muslim could eat them and I actually eat them myself.Â”<br><br>Bournemouth Rabbi Neil Amswych said: Â“I donÂ’t see why they shouldnÂ’t be available. After all, we are in a Christian country and the state religion is Christianity.Â”<br><br>The spokeswoman for Poole Hospital Trust added: Â“We apologise to those who were expecting a bun but, as soon as we realised our mistake, we put it right and there were buns on the wards by Easter Sunday.<br><br><strong>Â“It was nothing to do with religious beliefs, (the catering manager) just didnÂ’t order them. It was an oversight not a ban.Â”</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/4103" rel="nofollow">http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/4103</a></div>

It will also ask whether the applicant has ever been in local authority care.<br><br>Yesterday, Ucas said the changes - which are supported by the Government - were specifically designed to 'support the continuing efforts of universities and colleges to widen participation'.</strong><br><br>But critics claim the move smacks of social engineering and would be an unfair barrier to many of those from middle class backgrounds.<br><br>Pat Langham, president of the Girls' Schools Association, said: "Why collect this information at all? If they are going to use it to discriminate against those who they feel are privileged, those whose parents went to university, then what would be the point in anyone ever trying to improve themselves?<br><br>"I was the first person in my family to go to university - my father was a policeman and my mother a dinner lady. But I'm a headmistress with a degree.<br><br>"Were I to have children applying for university, would they be discriminated against because I have worked hard?"<br><br>Bill Rammell, the Higher Education Minister, has confirmed that the Government backs the questions, which will be on Ucas forms from next year. Although the questions are optional, it is feared that those who do not fill them in will be discriminated against.<br><br><strong>It is also thought that parents could 'cheat' - by claiming, for example, that they are builders instead of property developers - which could render the system unworkable.</strong><br><br>Oxford University said that it had no intention of using the information until after offers had been made to students.<br><br><strong>Mike Nicholson, director of admissions at Oxford, said: "We haven't any evidence to suggest this type of information has any valid relevance to the decisions we have to make.<br><br>"It would be far more useful to know whether a candidate predicted to get good grades goes to a school where few pupils expect to do well."</strong><br><br>But some university leaders said the information would be useful. Drummond Bone, president of the vice chancellors' group Universities UK said it would help institutions understand more about applicants.<br><br>In recent years, the Government has set high targets for universities designed to increase the number of students admitted from workingclass backgrounds.<br><br>But there has been a lack in progress. Between 2002-03 and 2004-05, the proportion of entrants from state schools fell from 87.2 per cent to 86.7 per cent.<br><br>Over the same period, the proportion of students from lower social classes fell from 28.4 per cent to 28.2 per cent.<br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=442672&amp;in_page_id=1770" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=442672&amp;in_page_id=1770</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's getting damn ridiculous. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>Schools are teaching children as young as four about same-sex relationships to comply with new gay rights laws, it emerged yesterday.<br><br>They are introducing youngsters to homosexuality using a series of story books in preparation for controversial regulations coming into force next month.</strong><br><br>Fourteen primary schools are already taking part in a Â£600,000 Government-funded study aimed at familiarising children with gay and lesbian relationships.<br><br>The research team behind the project intends to post the findings on national websites to help all schools use the books in their literacy lessons.<br><br>It also revealed it is leading workshops for local councils across the country which are asking how to implement new laws banning discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.<br><br><strong>The academics working on the study say showing children that homosexuality is part of everyday life helps reduce homophobic bullying in the playground.<br><br>They claim schools need to ensure they are serving the needs of gay pupils and parents to comply with the Equality Act.</strong><br><br><strong>However the scheme sparked alarm among Christian groups who fear the legislation could leave schools open to lawsuits if they refuse to use books with gay characters.</strong><br><br>One story being used in the research project, headed by academics at Sunderland University, is a fairytale about a prince who turns down three princesses before falling in love with one of their brothers. They marry in a book titled 'King &amp; King'.<br><br>In another book, 'Spacegirl Pukes', the main character has two mothers, mummy Loula and mummy Neenee. She is about to set off on a space mission when she falls ill, requiring her mothers to nurse her back to health.<br><br>Another called 'And Tango Makes Three' features two male penguins, Roy and Silo, who fall in love at a New York zoo.<br><br>The latter has sparked fierce debate in the U.S. where some schools already use it.<br><br>The use of the books in England prompted claims that repealing Section 28 - the law banning the promotion of homosexuality in schools - has increased the use of inappropriate teaching materials.<br><br><strong>There are also claims that new gay rights laws, coming into force on April 6, will allow schools to be sued if they do not use homosexual texts.<br><br>The Government insists that schools will still be able to decide what they teach.</strong><br><br>A spokesman said existing guidance already made clear schools must "meet the needs of all young people whatever their family circumstances or developing sexuality", and in a way that is "age appropriate".<br><br>However Dr Elizabeth Atkinson, reader in social and educational inquiry at Sunderland University, said: "The purpose of the project is to support schools in meeting their requirements under the Equality Act, which will require all public institutions to meet the needs of gay and lesbian users.<br><br>"There's very little out there at the moment to enable them to meet the needs of all pupils."<br><br>The No Outsiders project, which has received funding from the Economic and Social Research Council, is run by Sunderland jointly with Exeter University and London's Institute of Education.<br><br>It has been launched in 14 schools across the North East, the South West, London and the Midlands.<br><br>Dr Atkinson added: "We are already finding that books like these are changing attitudes around homosexuality. Pupils are more willing to understand issues of discrimination."<br><br>However Simon Calvert, spokesman for the Christian Institute, said: "The predictions of those who said the repeal of Section 28 would result in the active promotion of homosexuality in schools are coming true."<br><br>His insitute is also warning that the new equality laws would lead to schools being "compelled" to provide books with gay themes and risk litigation if they do not.<br><br>Meanwhile the Christian Voice group has vowed to track down the books and organise a protest to ban them.<br><br>Director Stephen Green said: "The arrogance of people like Elizabeth Atkinson, using children as guinea pigs is outrageous and thoroughly wicked.<br><br>"I am astonished at this project and we are trying to find out where these schools are to empower parents to put pressure on them to remove the books."<br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=441542&amp;in_page_id=1770" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=441542&amp;in_page_id=1770</a><br><br>Letting them be familiar with the existence of homosexual relationships is alright with me...but if they activists decide to sue and all that that's taking things too far.</div>

              <p>A story based on the Three Little Pigs fairy tale has been turned
                                      down by a government agency's awards panel as the subject matter
                                      could offend Muslims.<br> <br> The digital book, re-telling the classic story, was rejected by
                                      judges who warned that "the use of pigs raises cultural
                                      issues".<br> <br> Becta, the government's educational technology agency, is a leading
                                      partner in the annual Bett Award for schools.<br> <br> The judges also attacked Three Little Cowboy Builders for offending
                                      builders.<br> <br> The book's creative director, Anne Curtis, said the idea that
                                      including pigs in a story could be interpreted as racism was "like
                                      a slap in the face".<br> <br> More:<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/7204635.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/7204635.stm</a></p>
