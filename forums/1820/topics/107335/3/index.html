            <div class='col-md body'>For the longest special of the rally, the competitorÂ’s menu offers many novelties. With a mix between navigation difficulties, camel grass and numerous dunes, the bikers and drivers will have to be patient to avoid all kind of mistakes.

The real Â‘marathonÂ’ stages are back on the DakarÂ…<br><br>A specialist of this type of exercise, yesterdayÂ’s winners, Fabrizio Meoni in the bike race and StÃ©phane Peterhansel on four wheels, should be serious contenders for victory on a course where experience will pay.<br></div>

After breaking his transmission box at kilometre 150 of the special, Vatanen spent a good part of his day waiting first of all for his assistance vehicle and then for the reparations on his Nissan Pickup. When finally arriving in Zouerat, the multiple Dakar winner remained calm and composed. Â“We lost seven hours but everything is OK. The moral is still all right, there are far worst things in life. Maybe we didnÂ’t do enough testing on the car. Anyhow now IÂ’ll do my best to make arrive in Dakar and thatÂ’s the most important...<br><br>23h00 Â– Happy birthday Tchaguine<br>Thankfully, Vladimir Tchaguine doesnÂ’t celebrate in the same fashion every time he wins a stage on the Dakar. But the day was special. Not only had the Russian claimed his 32nd ever Dakar special but it was also his Â… birthday. A perfect opportunity to drink champagne and eat caviar in the Kamaz family. A party without the two members of the team that suffered a serious crash last night and were taken to the Layoune hospital for further examination and care. Anyhow, the celebration remained quiet with the difficult upcoming stage to prepare and the long days to come. One can expect a big fiesta if Tchaguine claims a fifth win in Dakar.<br><br>23h30 Â– GordonÂ’s long day<br>Robby Gordon knew what he was coming for on the Dakar. Was he really expecting such a bad day? After his crash (and flip) just before CP2 (km 300), the American eventually made it to the finish of the stage pushed by an assistance truck. Not really the most triumphant of ways to enter the bivouac. The Volkswagen crew remained stranded in the desert awaiting for assistance and eventually saw help come at 17h00 to try and repair the seriously damaged rear part (breaksÂ…) before being pulled through CP2 and most of the special. Once on the bivouac the whole VW team started deconstructing the Race Touareg and change the necessary parts so that Gordon could carry on his Dakar adventure. Â“ItÂ’s a real shame because I think I could have done something good here on this rally. But IÂ’m here to learn.<br><br>0h30 Â– Work for DAF<br>After a very very long night indeed, spent working on Gerard De RooyÂ’s truck (damaged after a crash during stage 5), it was this time father Jan De RooyÂ’s vehicle that needed a special Â‘treatmentÂ’. Indeed the elder of the De Rooy family suffered turbo problems on the special.<br><br>0h50 Â– Sad atmosphere at NissanÂ…<br>With the retirement of Colin McRae and the difficult day of Ari Vatanen, the Nissan clan was feeling rather devastated after the dayÂ’s stage 6. Giniel De Villiers only needed a change of wind screen while the mechanics were still working on VatanenÂ’s car.<br><br>1h10 - Â…busy at Mitsubishi<br>No serious worry hit the Mitsubishi team. The title holders went through an excellent day with the performances of Stephane Peterhansel and Hiroshi Masuoka. But to keep up their Dakar rhythm, the mechanics checked and re-checked all the vehicles, especially for the upcoming marathon stage. Â“Tomorrow, we wonÂ’t be allowed to give a helping hand so we need the cars to be very reliable and work perfectly well for two daysÂ”, explained one of the Mitsu mechanics...<br><br>3h00 Â– Time for a count<br>190 bikes made it to the bivouac of Zouerat, as well as 143 cars and 60 trucks.<br><br></div>

With 12 participations in the organisation or communication staff, and 4 as driver or co-driver in the race, Serge Henninot, 37 years of age, is already an old timer on the Dakar Rally. This rich experience incited Mitsubishi to sign him last year to coach a chinese driver on the Dakar tracks. All of that for one goal: to detect, then train the next Mitsubishi top driver, who will succeed to Masuoka in the next five years.<br><br>"China has an extraordinary commercial potential, It's the future biggest market in the world and it's very important for constructors to be there in time. So to win the fight between brands on this exciting market, Mitsubishi, as well as Nissan, decided to bring a Chinese driver to the leading positions of the Dakar Rally. And Mitsubishi hired me to take care of that, which is a great opportunity for me who loves this event more than anything in the world. " The first attempt last year was with Luo Ding. But he wasn't good enough, eventhoigh they finished the Rally in 47th position of the overall standings. So this year, Serge Henninot has a new driver, the young Guan Yuang Men, 24 years old, but already very good behind the steering wheel. Now, the job of the Frenchman is to teach him all the specificities of the rally. "At the beginning, the most important thing is to make him understand he has to drive keeping the car, the terrain and his brain in harmony. He has to take the time to understand the world around him on a rally. Then we will take care of the real technic, how to drive safely but quickly in the dunes. This experience is a real pleasure for me, because it's a marvellous feeling to share your own experience. It's like looking at your own child growing up. That's fantastic, really! In fact, I like this youngster like a father and my dream will be to bring him to the highest level of rally raid racing and then becoming his racing assistance".<br><br>But before this date, the lessons continued with a flip during the 6th stage. "There was a biker on the first big dune of the day, and Guan didn't want to disturb him so he went a little too fast and the car jumped off the top of the dune. We hit the front of the car, then bumped before landing on the roof. I'm sure it would have been possible to take a picture of the car vertically in the air! " An accident without big consequences, despite the fact they had to carry on without their front screen.<br></div>
