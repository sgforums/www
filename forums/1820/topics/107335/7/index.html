            <div class='col-md body'>At the request of GrÃ©goire de Mevius, currently convalescing, and of his family, and with the agreement of Team Dessoude, this post-surgical report has been published.<br><br>On January 17th in the early afternoon, GrÃ©goire de Mevius underwent surgery at the Clinique Saint Luc de Bouges (Namur). The Nissan driver had suffered an accident a week earlier, during the 10th stage (Atar-Atar) of the 2005 Dakar. The medical service of the organization had initially taken care of him, and he was repatriated to Belgium three days later, with an initial diagnosis of two broken ribs.<br><br>After more in-depth examinations on his arrival at the Clinique Saint Luc on the Sunday evening, it was noted that, as well as the initial injuries noted after the accident, he was suffering from two fractured cervical vertebras, which needed rapid intervention. The operation took place on Monday, and took just over an hour. This allowed a metal plate to be applied to the 5th cervical vertebra, which had an unstable fracture.<br><br>Louis Loodvoet (Doctor, head of orthopedic surgery at the Clinique Saint Luc) : Â«First and foremost, I would like to stress that at no point was Mr de Mevius' life in danger, and that he benefited from favorable circumstances, considering the cervical fractures from which he was suffering. His post-operative condition is satisfactory.<br><br>However, he will have to undergo between six weeks and three months of convalescence. Concerning his left shoulder, which is still suffering from a lack of movement, there are, with all the usual provisos, good hopes of a full recovery. In this case, and at the end of his recovery period, Mr de Mevius should be able, from a medical point of view, to live a normal life.Â”<br><br>Team Nissan France Dessoude wishes GrÃ©goire a speedy recovery, and hopes to see him back in the team as quickly as possible.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TEAM McLAREN MERCEDES MP4-20 TESTS IN BARCELONA<br><br>For Immediate Release: The Team McLaren Mercedes MP4-20 Formula One car took to the track for the first time today at the Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, with Kimi Raikkonen at the wheel. The track debut of the teamÂ’s 2005 challenger marks the start of an intensive five-day test session, which will see Kimi joined by team-mate Juan Pablo Montoya later this week.<br><br>Â“A lot of time, effort and work has been invested in the new car, with the engineers working more for us than ever before,Â” said Kimi. Â“My first impression after these few laps is a good one, however, the work for me and my driver colleagues starts only now.Â” The Finn will continue to drive MP4-20 until Thursday, when Juan Pablo will take the wheel.<br><br>Â“Since MP4-20 was fired up for the first time at 02:30am on the morning of Thursday 20th January at the McLaren Technology Centre, the anticipatory atmosphere of the carÂ’s initial run within the team has been building and we are pleased to have completed its shakedown this morning,Â” said Ron Dennis, Team Principal, Team McLaren Mercedes. Â“TodayÂ’s unveiling is the first tangible demonstration of the teamÂ’s preparations for the 2005 season, a year that has the potential to be exciting and positive for all the teams, our Partners and the fans alike. There is feverish work taking place across the team to achieve the best possible result for this yearÂ”<br><br>The design of the MP4-20 has been heavily influenced by significant revisions to both the sporting and technical regulations that govern Formula One in four key areas: engine lifespan, limitations on tyre use, aerodynamics and race weekend format particularly for qualifying.<br><br>Â“A Formula One car is a fully integrated machine,Â” commented Martin Whitmarsh, CEO Formula One, Team McLaren Mercedes. Â“As a consequence, regulation changes to the extent we have seen ahead of the 2005 season, have had a major impact on the configuration of the entire package. The revisions created an interesting challenge for our design team under Adrian Newey, Mike Coughlan and Neil Oatley, and the result is a car that looks quite different from last year. Mercedes-Ilmor on the engine side has to cope with similar technical and timescale challenges.<br><br>The aerodynamic modifications have led to the most visible differences on the car, to the design of the chassis, which has been exclusively developed in the design office and wind tunnel facilities at the McLaren Technology Centre. These include the raising of the front wing by 50mm, restricting the height of the diffuser to 125mm and bringing the rear wing package forward by 150mm.<br><br>McLaren RacingÂ’s Technical Director Adrian Newey added, Â“With the regulations, particularly on the aerodynamic side, being set comparatively late resulting in even harder and more dedicated work from all members of the team to get MP4-20 on track today. This has seen positive collaboration with all our Technology Partners, particularly Michelin in adapting to the extended use requirements of tyres for the coming season, when they have to last the entire race distance. The spec for MP4-20 was set in May 2004 and this saw the start of wind tunnel work at the McLaren Technology Centre. The timescales have been challenging but that is all part of the excitement of Formula One.<br><br>Norbert Haug, Vice President Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, said: "Formula One of generation 2005 creates a host of new challenges for all the engineers involved, as well as bigger cuts and restrictions overall than ever before during the last decade. The engineÂ’s lifespan is doubled due to a change in the regulations, which allows the engines to be replaced only after two races. This modification was announced extremely late, putting even bigger strain on the engine people. Additional strain was caused by the demand that performance be maintained despite the doubling of the lifespan. The new rules concerning the aerodynamic limitations and the use of only one set of tyres per race are no less challenging; it was therefore an interesting and busy winter not only for our engine technicians but also for the team's chassis engineers. With the West McLaren Mercedes MP4-20 we hope to have created a powerful package of chassis, engine and tyres, which will enable us to resume the performance and results which our team scored in the second half of the year and particularly in the final third of the season with last year's MP4-19B."<br><br>Â“Of course, everyone within our organisation was looking forward to the initial laps and results of the MP4-20 on the first test day,Â” Martin Whitmarsh continued. Â“The focus in these early stages will be systems, aero and component evaluations before we start looking at more comprehensive programmes towards the end of the week. We have an intensive schedule to complete before the cars leave for Australia on Wednesday 23rd February, which will see us test at Valencia, Jerez and back to Barcelona. By the second week in February at Jerez, we will have the second MP4-20 chassis in attendance, with the third due to come on line in the following week.Â”<br><br>Pedro de la Rosa will test alongside Kimi today in the MP4-19B, evaluating components and systems alongside the programme for the 2005 car, sharing driving duties during the week with Alex Wurz.<br><br>MP4-20 FACTS<br><br>Â• Development of MP4-20 began May 2004<br>Â• The first wind tunnel work on MP4-20 also began in May 2004<br>Â• Approximately 3,600 hours of wind tunnel work has been conducted with MP4-20<br>Â• The Mercedes-Benz FO 110R V10 engine has been running on the dyno for about half a year<br>Â• The Team McLaren Mercedes team has completed approximately 11,000 testing kilometres since the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix.<br>Â• So far in testing since the end of the 2004 season, the Team McLaren Mercedes team has used approximately 8,000 litres of Mobil Unleaded fuel, supplied by Technology Partner ExxonMobil<br>Â• Over 4,500 drawings have been created in the design process for MP4-20<br>Â• There are approximately 10,800 components that make up the MP4-20</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Daily F1:<br><br><blockquote>Sponsors involved in Formula One are considered global and market leaders according to annual research conducted by leading sports market research company Sports Marketing Surveys.<br><br>Despite less favourable results in the latter part of the season, the excitement of Formula One is still uppermost in followersÂ’ minds and those companies involved are believed to be trustworthy.<br><br><strong>Repetitive results continues to be a threat to the levels of TV viewing with the number of races watched by fans dropping by 8% over the year.</strong><br><br>These results come from a worldwide annual survey on all aspects of image and awareness of Formula One conducted by Sports Marketing Surveys. </blockquote>Duh - I love how market research states the obvious. Thank god I quit that crummy business.<br><br>Wow, the companies are seen as trustworthy - wonder what the results would have been like if the question had been extended to include Max and Bernie (a lawyer and a used-car salesman, no less).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  The very fact of that particular question being asked says a lot.<br></div>
