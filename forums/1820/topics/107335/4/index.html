Â« We had a problem on the front right wheel. We therefore lost six to seven hours. We were finally able to get the wheel of De Mevius who had to retire after his crash. Luckily, Thierry (Delli-Zotti, his co-driver) who is an excellent mechanic managed to repair and got us out of this problem. IÂ’m really happy to have made it and to be able to carry onÂ”, insisted the Portuguese.<br><br>21h35 Â– G.De Rooy once again<br>Just arrived at the end of the special, Gerard De Rooy once again had troubles during the stage that prevented him from competing until the end with the Kamaz trucks. Â“I managed a very good start to the race but then broke down and lots twice as much time, first of all because we had to try and repair and then because the truck wasnÂ’t working as well. Anyhow, the most important thing now is that we carry on having fun each day and that it lasts until Dakar.<br><br>23h00 Â– Some work at MitsuÂ…<br>In the workshop of the Japanese brand, all are sad about MasuokaÂ’s withdrawal (the first since 1993) but the most important thing is to take care of the two leading cars. The mechanics have done the same checks on both Alphand and PeterhanselÂ’s car after his problems at the end of stage 8. Meanwhile, still no news from Andrea Mayer, stopped on the special with electrical problems.<br><br>23h30 Â– VW with Jutta<br>Volkswagen has lost Juha Kankunnen, who crashed his car on its side on a dune. The back of the Race Touareg being extremely damaged, the Finn has decided to quit the race in Atar despite possibilities to repair.

Andrea Mayer still hasnÂ’t made it to the bivouac or to CP2.<br><br>3h30 Â– Late arrivals<br>116 bikes have made it to the finish out of the 126 that had started the stage. None of the bikers are still on the road. In the car race, 80 crews have arrived on the bivouac and 17 are still expected. 32 trucks out of the 48 have made it to Atar.<br><br>07:25  CHANGES FOR STAGE 11 BETWEEN ATAR AND KIFFA<br><br>The weather conditions that have shaken the rally since the beginning of the event have made the last stages a lot harder than expected for the 2005 edition. Added to that, the information given by the organisation opening teams indicate that the first half of the special will be a lot tougher, especially if the weather remains this way. La rally officials have therefore decided to shorten stage 11 from Atar to Kiffa that was already expected to be one the hardest of the event. The special will stop at the originally planned CP2 shortening the distance from 656 km to 400,48km. From CP2, the competitors will head to the Kiffa bivouac on a liaison via a asphalt road.<br></div>

No longer in the race: Rentero Cano (459),<br>- 37 trucks.<br><br>12:37  Cars Â– Vatanen fastest at CP1<br><br>At the first check point of the car special (km 189), the best time was for late starter Ari Vatanen (NIS). Second fastest was Jutta Kleinschmidt (VW) at 5'51 followed by Carlos Sousa (NIS) at 6'04. Giniel De Villiers (NIS) was fourth at 7'04 after overtaking both the Mitsubishi cars of Alphand and Peterhansel who stopped to get rid of their water protections for the river crossing.<br><br>11:55  Bikes Â– FrÃ©tignÃ© fastest at CP2<br><br>At the second checkpoint of the day (km 25<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, David FrÃ©tignÃ© still had the best time of the bike race. The Frenchman has a 57" lead on Caldecott (who started first and remains alone ahead on the special). Third is Chris Blais at 1'34, followed by Coma at 3'30 and Cox at 3'38.<br>Overall leader, Cyril Despres is at 7'01...<br><br>11:11  Bikes Â– FrÃ©tignÃ© fastest at CP1<br><br>At CP1 (km 189), David FrÃ©tignÃ© had managed the best time of the bike race. The Frenchman on his Yamaha had a 1'04 lead on Caldecott, followed by Blais at 1'55, Coma at 4'17 and Cox at 4'41. Overall leader Cyril Despres was 6'50 adrift.<br><br>11:11  Bikes Â– Leaders at CP1<br><br>The first bikes have made it to the first check point of the day, situated just on small river crossing. The first biker was Andy Caldecott (winner of yesterday's special) who crossed the river on the saddle of his KTM.<br>Shortly after came David FrÃ©tignÃ© who jumped off his bike to cross the 50cm of water. The two first bikers were followed by Chris Blais and Alfie Cox.<br><br>10:33  NIGHT WATCH<br><br>Mechanical worries, late arrivals, injuries, bad luck and withdrawalsÂ… All you need to know about what happened on the bivouac during the night.<br><br>21h45 Â– Servia, the end<br>After having hit a tree during stage 12, Josep-Maria Servia lived another misfortune between Bamako and Kayes when he crashed his car and went for a roll. The damage was so bad that the Spaniard was forced to quit a rally that will have been a nightmare for the Schlesser-Ford team following the withdrawal of boss jean-Louis Schlesser on his V8 buggy. Servia looked rather devastated on the Kayes bivouac. Â“The accident was that bad but I am now forced to go home. I entered a bend too quickly, the car went sideways and it ended up going for a flip. The engine and mechanical parts are fine but the chassis and main cabin are wrecked, and of course we have no more spare parts. ItÂ’s tough to have to quit with just three days left, especially because it was very important for Jean-Louis to have at least one car in Dakar.<br><br>22h20 Â– Dessoude satisfied<br>AndrÃ© Dessoude, team boss of about ten Nissan vehicles on the rally is still directing his 40 mechanics who are working on the cars of his Â‘clientsÂ’. Three days from the finish, the check-up remains impressive. Â“It would be terrible to have to break down now for whoever. So we do the maximum so that the end goes as easily as possible, although weÂ’re all tiredÂ”. So far, Dessoude has quite a few satisfactions on this 2005 Dakar but has regrets for those who havenÂ’t made it. Â“I especially happy for Benoit Rousselot who should finish his first Dakar, as well as for JapanÂ’s Jun Mitsuhashi and the Chinese Lang Xu and Yong Zhou. But, IÂ’m also disappointed for Paul Belmondo, Kenjiro Shinozuka and GrÃ©goire De MeviusÂ”.<br><br>22h45 Â– 'Mitsu' at work<br>In the Mitsubishi team, the perspective of victory to come hasnÂ’t eased the pressure on the mechanics. What happened to Hiroshi Masuoka is still well in the minds of all so everything is done so that Peterhansel doesnÂ’t break his engine. Team boss Dominique Serieys has therefore asked for the pistons on PeterÂ’s engine to be changed again for the remaining three days. Â«One has to be careful because the last days have their traps like the crossing of the Faleme River for exampleÂ…<br><br>23h15 Â– Puy first lady<br>Despite the fact that for this 21-year-old girl the main goal is to get to Dakar for her first participation, Ludivine Puy still has a fierce sense of competition. The only women left in the race with Spaniard Amparo Ausina, she discovered that the penalty time that should have been added to the time of her rival hadnÂ’t been done. FranceÂ’s Enduro champion therefore alerted the officials on this mistake and the standings were immediately modified after many excuses. Ludivine Puy is now in good position to win the womanÂ’s event.<br><br>2h05 Â– Schlesser mechanics give a helping hand<br>Philippe Gache had already seriously damaged his buggy on the previous day but a driving mistake almost cost him deeply. After falling asleep 20kms from the start of the special, his buggy was trapped in a hole and went for a tumble. Â“The chassis is wrecked but the engine is still workingÂ”, admitted the head mechanic while Gache was enjoying some rest. Â“We managed to get the door of and front and rear cap of ErrandoneaÂ’s car that is no longer in the race. The mechanics of Jean-Louis Schlesser have been really nice. They came to help us so that 5 guys could work on the car. Thanks to all the help, Philippe should be able to carry on.<br><br>2h30 Â– Two vehicles still expected<br>All the vehicles expected had made it to the Kayes bivouac except the truck of Roland Hoebeke and the car of Carlos Rentero, stopped between CP 1 and CP 2 because a damaged front wheel.<br><br>07:28  Welcome to Senegal<br><br>Statistically, there are often competitors that are forced to quit in the last stages of the rally. The rule will probably again be applied this year. However, those who will make it to Senegal today will have almost managed their challenge. With few difficulties, the stage will crown the strongest and fittest that will manage to remain focused and enjoy the splendid landscapes of black Africa.<br><br>For the leaders, the bike race can still have some upsets although on a special with no significant navigation, the big KTMs have a serious advantage. In the car race, the Mitsubishi driverÂ’s have a big enough lead to control things until Dakar. But Stephane Peterhansel is well placed to know that Â‘it ainÂ’t over til itÂ’s over!<br><br></div>
