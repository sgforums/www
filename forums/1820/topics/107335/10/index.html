            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Eddie Jordan has cast light on his controversial sacking of German driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 2001, saying that he did it to save his Formula One team's Honda engine supply.</span><br><br>"People didn't understand the Frentzen situation," the Irishman, who sold his team to Russian-born Canadian businessman Alex Shnaider last month, told Ireland's Sunday Independent newspaper.<br><br>"At the time I couldn't let him renew the contract because my only way of holding onto the Honda engine was by giving (Japan's Takuma) Sato the drive.<br><br>"I loved Frentzen. He won more Grands Prix for Jordan than anyone else. But I had to protect the engine situation, that was absolutely crucial.<br><br>"I took it on the chin. Nobody except myself and one or two in Jordan realised why I had to do what I did. I was in a position I hated. I wanted to keep Frentzen but I couldn't."<br><br>Frentzen won two races for Jordan in 1999, helping the team to third place overall in the constructors' championship -- their best ever performance.<br><br>He was fired abruptly by fax on the eve of his home German Grand Prix in July 2001 and replaced by Frenchman Jean Alesi as a stop-gap in a move that stunned many in the sport. No reason was given at the time.<br><br>Sato was signed later that year and had a crash-strewn first season with Jordan before finishing fifth in the final Japanese Grand Prix.<br><br>He joined BAR, now 45 percent owned by Honda, in 2003. Honda severed their contract with Jordan at the end of 2002.<br><br>Jordan, whose team struggled to survive last year, said he was not despondent about his departure from the sport after being one of the leading characters for 14 years.<br><br>"The worst thing would be to stay around and be completely sad about it," he said. "People say, 'oh, you'll be in Australia'. I won't. It's too far away and this team has to stand on its own two feet.<br><br>"They need time to get themselves together and they don't need the confusion of me being there and being seen to interfere."<br><br>Jordan, to be renamed Midland in 2006, will be launching their new car in Moscow's Red Square on Friday.

We will do this through advertising themed on responsible drinking which will be capable of working around the world.<br><br>Â“Consumer engagement at two levels Â– the excitement and status of Formula 1 and the control and judgement necessary to deliver success in this most competitive sport - is the key to Johnnie WalkerÂ’s approach.Â”<br><br>The deal between McLaren and Johnnie Walker has been rumoured for some time, because the teamÂ’s current title sponsor West plan to pull out when tobacco advertising is banned across the EU in August.<br><br>However, speculation that McLarenÂ’s car would be painted gold as part of the deal has proved wide of the mark.<br><br>McLaren have refused to reveal how much they will earn under the terms of the new deal, and will only say that it is Â“a long-term partnering agreementÂ”.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now Red Bull also deny Minardi support.<br><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4310573.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4310573.stm</a><br><br>Minardi's chances of starting Sunday's Australian Grand Prix remain in doubt after Red Bull denied supporting their struggling rivals.<br>Minardi have not been able to afford to comply with new rules aimed at slowing Formula One cars down.<br><br>They can race if all the other teams give their approval and claimed only Ferrari had refused their consent.<br><br>But Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said: "I sympathise with their position but rules are rules."<br><br>He added: "They are there for a reason and we all have to abide by them.<br><br>"My position and that of Red Bull is that nothing would be more frustrating for us in a debut race to finish ninth with a Minardi ahead of us and a point taken from us."<br><br>Minardi team owner Paul Stoddard had claimed that Ferrari were the only team withholding support.<br><br>He said: "I hope that this can all be sorted away from the track. Hopefully by Friday morning I can proudly say there are 10 signatures."<br><br>Stoddard has spoken to Ferrari boss Jean Todt about the issue but failed to make any progress and said he would make a fresh bid later.<br><br>"On Thursday night when Todt gets in I'm going to go to his hotel," the Australian said.<br><br>"Without that signature we're in trouble. They are keeping me out but let's hope that is over."<br><br>Stoddart added: "Todt kept saying it's an FIA problem although Max Mosley has gone on the record and said if we got Ferrari's signature then we can race.<br><br>"I tried to explain that to him rationally.<br><br>"I asked him to delegate the powers to some other member of Ferrari who was actually in Melbourne so we could at least have the discussion.<br><br>"He refused, and the phone call came to an end without a conclusion."<br><br>If the row is not resolved, Minardi's cars are likely to be declared illegal when they are presented for scrutineering by race officials on Thursday in Australia.<br><br>Stoddart would then be faced with the choice of making hurried last-minute changes to the cars - or taking his battle to a higher authority.<br><br>"As a last resort, and I mean last resort, there is always the option of the High Court to challenge the legality of the regulations," he said.<br><br>"But on this, the 10th anniversary of the Melbourne Grand Prix, I would not want to be the one to spoil the party."<br><br>Minardi have been saying for months they want to use an updated version of their 2004 model car for the first three races of the season in Australia, Malaysia and Bahrain.<br><br>They then plan to switch to their 2005 cars for the first European race in San Marino, Italy.<br><br>Ferrari and Jordan are also starting off the season with last year's cars but have made changes in accordance with the FIA regulations, which include extended engine mileage, limited tyre changes and restricted aerodynamics.<br><br>Stoddart said last month that he was confident he would win any court battle over F1's rules.</div>
