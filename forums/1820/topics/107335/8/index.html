He has accepted it.Â”<br><br>However, Midland sporting director Trevor Carlin denied that everything was signed, sealed and delivered.<br><br>He told BBC Sport: Â“He's still got to find some funds, but it's very close. The sponsorship package seems strong.Â”<br><br>Karthikeyan has been linked to a Jordan drive since Midland's takeover of the Silverstone-based outfit, having achieved considerable success with Carlin Motorsport in the junior formulae.<br><br>Carlin added: Â“NarainÂ’s pretty quick, but he's a bit wild as well. HeÂ’ll be quite exciting.Â”<br><br>If the deal comes to fruition, the 28-year-old will become the first Indian driver in F1 history. He is expected to hold a news conference in Bombay later today to confirm that he has been offered the drive.<br><br>Carlin put KarthikeyanÂ’s chances of sealing the drive at Â“about 90 per centÂ”.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Minardi have signed Israeli Chanoch Nissany as an official test driver for the 2005 season.<br><br>The announcement creates a piece of motorsport history for the Middle Eastern country, just 24 hours after the news that Narain Karthikeyan is on the verge of becoming IndiaÂ’s first ever F1 driver.<br><br>Nissany does not fit the profile of a typical F1 aspirant. The Budapest resident is 41 years old and, instead of cutting his teeth pounding around karting tracks, only took up motorsport competitively three years ago.<br><br>He launched his driving career in the Hungarian Formula 2000 National Championship and Central European Zone Circuit Trophy in 2002 before graduating to the World Series Light by Nissan championship the following year, where his best result was an underwhelming seventh place at the Lausitzring.<br><br>He also served as a test driver for the Coloni F3000 team in 2004, competing in the last three races of the season, and has conducted several F1 tests for Jordan and Minardi.<br><br>Nissany will participate in MinardiÂ’s (limited) testing programme away from races, but will not be pressed into service as a third driver on the Fridays of grand prix weekends.<br><br>Minardi boss Paul Stoddart hailed the signing as a groundbreaking development for Israeli motorsport. He said: Â“WeÂ’re very pleased to be able to announce here in Israel that we have signed Chanoch as a test driver.<br><br>Â“In the course of the two recent test sessions in which he has participated, he has impressed us with his enthusiasm, his willingness to learn and his fitness.<br><br>Â“Although Chanoch has not competed in single-seater racing for that long, he nonetheless has experience of a wide range of machinery. As a result, we feel he could be of real assistance with the teamÂ’s test programme this year.<br><br>Â“On a personal note, I derive considerable satisfaction from the fact that, once again, Minardi is able to contribute in a practical way to the very worthwhile goal of raising the awareness of Formula 1 in an area of the world where the sport has not previously had a significant profile. That can only be a good thing.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>McLarenÂ’s Alex Wurz topped the times for the second day running at Valencia on Wednesday, but the big story was the pace of the Renaults.<br><br>While Wurz ripped off a lap of 1m09.201s in a 2004-spec MP4-19B, Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella were comfortably quickest of those running new cars conforming to the more restrictive 2005 aero rules.<br><br>Both Renault drivers suffered mechanical problems but there was no denying the speed and consistency of the V-keel R25, which was officially unveiled in Monaco yesterday.<br><br>Alonso posted a best time of 1m09.992s, around one second shy of the outright track record set by Kimi RaikkonenÂ’s McLaren last February (with the benefit of much more downforce, of course).<br><br>The SpaniardÂ’s running was interrupted by an engine failure directly in front of the pits, but he still completed some 129 laps of the twisty 2.5-mile circuit.<br><br>Team-mate Fisichella was a hair slower on a 1m10.135s and was delighted with the behaviour and performance of the car, despite losing time with a clutch-related problem.<br><br>He singled out the engine as being a major improvement over last yearÂ’s unit, combining its predecessorÂ’s user-friendly Â‘tractabilityÂ’ with more power further up the rev range.<br><br>Nick Heidfeld appears to be settling nicely into his new environment at Williams and was a strong fourth quickest, 0.3s faster than team-mate Mark Webber.<br><br>Heidfeld confessed that his life has been in such a whirlwind over the last 48 hours that his promotion to one of the most coveted drives in F1 hasnÂ’t really sunk in yet.<br><br>BAR were the busiest team on Wednesday, with no fewer than four drivers on hand Â– race driver Takuma Sato, tester Anthony Davidson, plus Young Driver Programme hopefuls James Rossiter and Alan van der Merwe, whose evaluation runs with the team before Christmas had to be aborted due to bad weather.<br><br>Ferrari had a low-key start to the test with Rubens Barrichello setting the 10th fastest time in the hybrid car and Marc Gene two places behind aboard the F2004.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The prize for candid quote of the day goes to Davidson. When asked by autosport.com about his impression of the flying Renaults, the Brit replied: Â“Bloody hell, they are so fast... I couldnÂ’t keep up with them. I thought they were in the low fuel zone but in fact they were doing 25-lap runs!Â”</span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Problems Here, There And Everywhere!</strong></span><br><br><strong>Sauber</strong><br><br>Sauber are investigating the possibility that their new C24 chassis may have a fundamental design flaw.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Team boss Peter Sauber has admitted that he is concerned about the carÂ’s pace following the recent Barcelona test, in which Jacques Villeneuve and Felipe Massa were giving away a whopping three seconds per lap to the Â‘newÂ’ interim Ferrari F2004M.</span><br><br>The tardy lap times alarmed the Swiss outfit, especially because initial indications about the carÂ’s performance had been encouraging. In its first runs at Valencia the C24 had been on a par with the BAR Â‘concept carÂ’ and the initial feedback from the drivers was positive.<br><br>An explanation for the mixed signals may lie in the very different characteristics of the two circuits. <span style="color: blue;">Valencia is a twisty track comprising mostly slow corners, and tends to disguise weaknesses in a carÂ’s aerodynamic department, whereas Barcelona has a number of long, fast sweepers that put a premium on downforce.</span><br><br>Teams have been led astray by promising results from Valencia in previous years Â– notably McLaren last year, when the ill-fated MP4-19 set lap records in winter testing and then proved woefully uncompetitive once the season got underway on more aerodynamically-demanding circuits.<br><br>Reflecting on the Barcelona test, Sauber said: Â“Contrary to what we experienced at Valencia, we do not seem able to find a good balance on the Barcelona track. We lack speed and we presume there must be a hiccup somewhere. We will have to work even harder to find out whatÂ’s wrong.Â”<br><br><span style="color: blue;">SauberÂ’s problems are surprising because the C24 is the first chassis to have gained the full benefits of the new $55 million state-of-the-art wind tunnel at their Hinwil factory.</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Toyota</strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Jarno Trulli has admitted to the Italian press that he is worried about tyre wear on the Toyota TF105 Â– a potentially major problem given the new-for-2005 rule that requires the same set of rubber to be used over a whole race distance.</span><br><br>During this weekÂ’s intensive Valencia test, the first in which the majority of 2005 cars took part, the new Toyota proved reasonably quick in low-fuel trim but suffered a big performance drop-off within a handful of laps.<br><br>Trulli says the TF105Â’s main problem is rear tyre degradation, but admits that <span style="color: blue;">the team havenÂ’t yet pinpointed the cause.</span><br><br>He told SaturdayÂ’s Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper: Â“The car seems quick and competitive, but not over the distance. The problem is excessive rear tyre wear; we have three weeks left and we hope to resolve it.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s definitely not due to the weight distribution. But we still havenÂ’t worked out whether it is an aerodynamic problem or mechanical.Â”<br><br>Inauspiciously for his new employers, Trulli compared the ToyotaÂ’s characteristics with the Jordans he campaigned in 2000-01.<br><br>Â“After three laps the car becomes difficult to drive, and in that it reminds me of my old Jordan,Â” he said. Â“ItÂ’s a shame because the car is easy to handle and the problems of engine reliability have been resolved.Â”<br><br>Toyota are under huge pressure to perform this year from their Japanese paymasters. The Cologne-based team have one of the biggest budgets in F1 but have delivered little in the way of tangible results during their first three seasons in the sport.<br><br>They were the first team to launch their new car early in the New Year and much is expected of it as it is the first chassis to have been overseen from beginning to end by highly-rated technical director Mike Gascoyne.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The team have said that they will bring a revised aerodynamic package to the season-opening Australian GP on March 6.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BAR</strong><br><br>BAR have joined a growing list of teams admitting to concerns about the performance of their 2005 cars.<br><br>The BAR engineers were left scratching their heads after an inconclusive weekÂ’s testing at Valencia.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The outright pace of the 007 was reasonable but it was outclassed by McLaren, Ferrari and especially Renault, whose R25 was impressively quick and consistent over long runs.<br><br>Moreover, no fewer than five engine failures have sparked serious reliability concerns over the latest Honda power unit, which has yet to clear the 1300km target equating to two grand prix weekends (as per the 2005 rules on engine life).</span><br><br>The team press release following the Valencia test downplayed the problems, but an insider admitted to autosport.com: <span style="color: blue;">Â“The car is lacking in downforce and there is a basic lack of aerodynamic grip.Â”</span><br><br>Jenson Button was an encouraging second quickest on the final day of the test, sandwiched between FerrariÂ’s 2004 and hybrid cars, but by then Renault and McLaren had already packed up and gone home Â– and his time was still 1.5s off Kimi RaikkonenÂ’s Thursday benchmark.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Team-mate Takuma Sato believes that the problem is not with the balance of the car, but rather a lack of overall grip.</span><br><br>Â“I have had no problems with the balance of the car, the handling is okay Â– but some of the other cars are quicker,Â” he told autosport.com. Â“When I saw the Renault time my jaw dropped and when I saw the McLaren it dropped even further.<br><br>Â“I know we have got a rev-limit on the engine and we have not made the best use of the tyres we have been given, but it is true to say that there is some grip missing Â– there is much less than we had hoped for.Â”<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The team is hoping that a significantly revised aerodynamic package scheduled for introduction later this month will address the speed deficit, while Honda are building new engine parts which they hope will be ready in time for this weekÂ’s Jerez test.</span></div>
