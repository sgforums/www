Massa.. DRINK!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>here's something i just posted up in another site. lists some of the highlights of the race  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Oh it was another exciting race! Alonso led almost the whole race. In a way, it was a lights to flag victory, with nobody else ever looking like they were threatening his lead the whole race. Trulli put in a wonderful performance to give Toyota their 1st ever podium finish, although it remains to be seen if the pace of Toyota would hold throughout the year. With Ralf Schumacher finishing in 5th, Toyota has jumped to 2nd in the constructor's championship. A magnificent 3rd place for Nick, who drove some exciting and awesome stints during the race, when he, teammate Mark and Ralf diced for 4th place.<br><br>In one of the exciting moments of the race, Mark Webber of Williams caught a twitchy Giancarlo Fisichella in 3rd place who was fighting with unwanted oversteer. Fisi was finding it hard to commit in the corners, thus allowing Mark, Ralf and Nick in that order to come up behind him. Mark then tried to overtake around turns 13 and 14, but was too far back to make it work. This put him slightly out of shape exiting turn 14, which gave Ralf a shot down the inside of the back straight into turn 15. Ralf locked up slightly and the 2 of them touched in turn 15, but were otherwise unscathed. This allowed Nick back in 6th to catch up with both of them and have a go at his team mate out of Turn 15 and down the main straight. Mark got the better of Nick into turn 1 and as they fought a recovered Ralf sneaked down the inside of turn 1 and was side by side with Nick into turn 2, but ultimately conceded the place. What an incredible piece of driving from all 3 men.<br><br>In another exciting moment, Mark and Nick, having recovered from the earlier excitement, set about hunting Fisi down again, who'd gained a brief respite when the 2 Williams diced with the Toyota. Once again Mark got the better of Fisi somewhere between Turns 11 to 14, and Nick was looking for a gap when Fisi ran down the inside of Mark as they blasted down the back straight. Fisi dived into turn 15, Mark went around the outside and put the squeeze on him as they entered turn 15. Fisi being on the dirty side of the track, was unable to brake and locked up into a 4 wheel drift. Mark suddenly realised that he wasn't leaving Fisi enough space and started to go wide but it was too late. They touched and Mark started sliding, b4 Fisi collected him, and then bounced right over the front of the Williams when the rear wheels of the Renault slammed into the front wheels of Mark's car. Pieces shattered off Fisi's Renault as it slammed back onto the ground, as Mark's Williams lay in the grass off turn 15 with both front suspensions broken. A gleeful Nick then slipped past to take 3rd.<br><br>Kimi was one of the people who drove excellently today, but was rewarded with no points after a right rear puncture on his outlap after his 1st pitstop put paid to his chances of a podium. At that point he was running 3rd, having started 6th with a much heavier fuel load. There is no doubt, that had the right rear not blown, the McLaren would have easily passed the problematic Renault of Fisichella for 3rd. Kimi nursed the stricken McLaren back to pits for a new right rear and rejoined in 14th, where he fought back up to 9th, less than 2 seconds behind the 7th and 8th place finishers. Meanwhile Montoya started from 11th and somehow sneaked his way up to finish 4th, helped along the way by a good fuel strategy and a few moments of inspired driving. Perhaps if he had qualified higher, a podium might have been on the cards, but there is no hiding the fact that Kimi thus far retains the upper hand where pace is concerned.<br><br>David Coulthard finished 6th for Red Bull Racing, while Klien brought the other RBR car home in 8th. Yet another double points finish for the team, who are currently lying in a surprise 3rd in the constructor's table. This is growing to be one of my favored teams. I was cheering when David overtook Michael in his Ferrari. Michael finished in a lowly 7th, and looked lacklustre the whole weekend. His points position finish was largely due to the misfortunes that befell several of the front runners. Had Fisi and Mark not had their accident, and Kimi's tyre did not blow, MS would have finished 10th. As it is, his teammate Rubens didn't finish the race at all, retiring 7 laps from the end with excessive tyre blistering. Seems the Bridgestones are crap again this year.<br><br>Bringing up the rear of the finishers were the Saubers of Massa, the Jordans of Karthikeyan and Monteiro and the Minardi of Christijan Albers. An observation: Karthikeyan finished the race a whole lap ahead of his teammate. I do believe he has significantly outpaced his teammate considering they were both in the same machinery. And Friesacher in Minardi also outpaced his teammate Albers by over a second a lap. Thus it was a real pity he slid off on Button's oil.<br><br>AH YES. BAR. dual engine failures 3 laps into the race. Jenson's Honda engine let gol, spewing its oil everywhere on the racing line. Anthony Davidson who was sub-ing for a feverish Takuma Sato had a more dramatic failure, with his engine bursting into flames. Seems ironic considering the fact that BAR was the only team to exploit the loophole in the rules to allow them to skirt around the "2 weekend engine" rule. Anyways it seems that everything in the team that is Japanese was laid low by the Sepang heat, from the driver to the engine... LOL. Poor Anthony, a chance to shine squandered.<br><br>Finally. Jacques... the 97 world champion. Spent most of the race driving behind MS and finally had a spin at turn 1 and retired b4 he had run half the race. It does seem funny, that the only 2 former world champions on the grid all performed terribly the whole afternoon. It would seem that the balance of power in F1 is finally shifting.</div>
