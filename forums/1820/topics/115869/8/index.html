"Frank Williams is aware of that. The overall strategy is that all engine manufacturers will be asked to supply at least two teams... for the 2006 season."<br><br>Ferrari, who announced last month that they would be supplying Red Bull Racing with engines, currently equip Sauber under the Petronas badge. BMW are envious and frustrated at the success rival manufacturers like Ferrari and Renault enjoy in the lucrative world of Grand Prix racing.<br><br>"The performance of the BMW-Williams team up to now has not been such a high performance that we will expect easily to become champions this season. Formula One is the premium league in motor sports. This is why BMW will continue to be in there. This is why it will have to find a way to be successful and achieve a way to become champion in Formula One. I clearly say that with the current 'midfield position' of BMW, we are not happy."<br><br>As to BMW going it alone Panke said: "The question of having our own team has come up over and over, because whenever, for example, Renault does very well, people say, 'look, Ferrari and Renault, they are the ones who show us what should be done.'"<br><br>Williams are equal fourth with Ferrari on 18 points in the race for the constructor's title ahead of Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gianmaria Bruni wins from Scott Speed<br>Barcelona - GP2 - Race 1<br><br>Gianmaria Bruni showed it to Speed in GP2<br><br>Former Minardi F1 racer Gianmaria Bruni won todayÂ’s GP2 series race after a dominant drive in an exciting race. The Coloni Motorsport driver led from the start and held off a late charge from iSport InternationalÂ’s Scott Speed in the final laps to take a great win. Heikki Kovalainen took the final podium position in third, following another great drive, this time from eleventh.<br><br>As the five red lights were extinguished at the start, it was Bruni who got the jump on pole sitter Scott Speed. They diced side by side down the main straight, but it was Bruni who made it through turn one first. From there, he pulled out a two second lead from Jose Maria Lopez, who had also managed to get past Speed at the first turn.<br><br>By lap 18 however, Speed had caught up to the back of Lopez, and as the DAMS driver fought with the American, Bruni pulled out a commanding lead. On lap 24 Lopez pitted, leaving Speed in free air to try and pull back BruniÂ’s advantage. When Bruni stopped three laps later, Speed put the hammer down.<br><br>He led for five laps, before pitting himself at the end of lap 31. His pit crew got him back on the road quickly and he emerged less than five seconds behind the Italian. The next time past the pits the gap was down to 3.3 seconds, then 1.9, and with just four laps to go, Speed was less than a second behind Bruni. Gimmi, however, had something in reserve, and put in his two personal quickest laps of the race to pull the smallest of margins back out again, crossing the finish line 1.203 ahead of the American.<br><br>KovalainenÂ’s third podium in a row came after a similarly determined fight. Having made an early compulsory pitstop, the Finn was left in clean air to set some fast lap times. When the pitstops played out, he was in fourth, but a mistake by Lopez saw Heikki snatch third place. Neel Jani and Nelson Piquet Jr also swept past the DAMS to take fourth and fifth, with Lopez taking sixth, Carroll seventh and NegrÃ£o eighth. Nico Rosberg set the fastest lap of the race with a 1:25.875 on the penultimate lap.<br><br>Kovalainen therefore maintains his lead in the championship standings on 20 points, followed by Bruni with 18 and Speed on 16.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Schumacher talks down Alonso title hopes<br>McLaren Mercedes the ones to watch out for<br><br>Tough times for Schumacher<br>and the Italian Champions<br><br>Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher talked down the title hopes of Fernando Alonso here Saturday as the Spanish driver continued his chase for victory on home soil in the Spanish Grand Prix. Alonso has been tipped as heir apparent to Schumacher after winning the last three races but the German, whose Ferrari team are struggling this year, insists Alonso is just one in a queue of drivers lining up to take his crown.<br><br>"I know this comparison (between Schumacher and Alonso) is fashionable at the moment but I have to say I have a bit of a problem with it," said Schumacher. "There are a lot of other guys who are very fast. Clearly it would be an advantage for us if we scored more points than him but again there are also other drivers that I see fighting for the championship. I still believe McLaren Mercedes will have a big chance."<br><br>Alonso set himself up for another strong challenge in Sunday's race at the Circuit de Catalunya when he finished second to provisional pole position winner Jarno Trulli in first qualifying here Saturday. Schumacher, who pushed Alonso hard for victory at the last race in San Marino, was a disappointing seventh fastest of the 18 drivers but he insisted his pace in the race will allow him to close on his rivals.<br><br>"For one lap we are not strong enough, but I am certainly much happier on race pace, we are much more competitive then," said Schumacher, before admitting his hopes of victory are still slim. "We are strong in long runs but not that much compared to the others and it will be extremely difficult to win, but in racing nothing is certain."<br><br>Schumacher, who started 13th at the last race after a mistake in second qualifying, faces the first task of securing seventh place on the grid or improving his position in final qualifying Sunday morning. But he admitted: "We have already proven that we have struggled on the one-lap qualifying and you have to say whatever happens in final qualifying, this is not the ideal position on the grid."<br><br>Team boss Jean Todt remained philosophical after the opening qualifying run, insisting that making race predictions was futile and suggesting that he is hoping to capitalize on reliability problems of their rivals. "We are not really surprised by qualifying," said Todt. "We know what are our strong and our weak points and it is clear that in tomorrow's qualifying we will not be able to do much to move up the order. But if Michael can stay pretty much where he is at the moment, then we have a fighting chance, given that reliability and consistency of performance of the various car-engine-tyre packages will play a key role."<br><br>"So far this season, our performance levels in the races have come from both ends of the spectrum, so it is hard to make predictions about what might happen in the race."</div>
