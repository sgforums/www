Â“He then went to test in Barcelona and the actual rib fractured there. But he didnÂ’t have any [medical] tests or anything because he was so busy.Â”<br><br>The injury came to light in the run-up to the Australian GP when, after experiencing discomfort, Webber went to hospital while visiting his parents near Canberra.<br><br>He did not make the news public, said Neal, because Â“he didnÂ’t want to make a fuss.Â”<br><br>He was given pain-killing injections and went on to finish fifth in Melbourne. The major concern was that he would have to miss the much more physically taxing Malaysian GP Â– but fortunately that proved unfounded.</div>
