We know MS loves putting people into the grass. British GP last year? Alonso? Need I say more? Nick has no effective braking power when he's on the grass, I'd say it's less a case of Nick trying to be optimistic and more like Nick not having control anymore. I any event, it IS clear Nick was faster out of the last corner and that MS moved off the racing line wayyyyy b4 the corner to squeeze Nick off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll quote Klavs since he was there:<br><blockquote>Okay, as having the best view of everyone (I was right there, it happened in front of me) it was MS's fault, however it wasn't a deliberate "lets push him off the track" move.<br><br>Nick went for the inside line, and MS wanted to defend it just was a bit too tardy getting over and therefore forced him onto the grass... and the rest is history. Michael's fault, no doubt there. But not having read the entire thread I am just going to guess that there are a few allegations of him "cheating" and it was a deliberate move to force him off the road... THIS WASN'T THE CASE.</blockquote>Yes, Schumacher has done his 'chops' many times in the past (like Silverstone '03 as you've mentioned, Heng). I just cannot be certain that that's all there is to it in this incident. By the time he made the move it was too late for Heidfeld to switch to the wider line.<br><br>We can't blame Heidfeld for wanting to take advantage on warmer tyres and a lighter fuel load since a few points were at stake, but I'd like to know if he was just a passenger or if there was something he could do about it. Or he could have spotted the wider racing line which Schu was a mile away from.<br><br>It was a gamble that didn't pay off (like Sato's attempt at the 'Ring last year), both drivers paid for it but for many of the fans it was probably better to <span style="font-style: italic;">watch</span> than Kimi sitting behind MS for 20-odd laps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't think there's much he could have done to prevent the hit. sure there was a wider racing line. but u do know that he was more or less alongside MS, and that to try to steer on the grass at racing speeds will probably lead to disaster. U saw Kimi almost spin on sunday 2nd qualifying as he steered off the grass. Nick wouldn't be crazy enuf to try that with a strip of Armco alongside the narrow grass strip he was on. If anything, he's probably praying that MS leaves him a nice gap to shoot off into the gravel trap.</div>

The plane burst into flames, causing its fuel tanks to explode. Five families who lived nearby were evacuated as a precaution, and the fire was eventually extinguished, he said.<br><br>The Canadair MI-DPCK had left Rome at about 4.30 p.m. (15:30 GMT) to help fight a forest fire on the hills near the beach resort of Forte dei Marmi, about 20km north of Pisa, and had twice already fetched sea water to dump on the fire when it struck electric power lines, Falcone said.<br><br>A helicopter that also was helping fight the fire warned the pilots "that they had hit the power lines and to aim for the sea," Falcone said.<br><br>Witnesses told the ANSA news agency that the plane appeared to be experiencing some difficulties and caught fire before crashing into the building in the tiny village of Ripa, ANSA said.<br><br>Falcone identified the two pilots as Stefano Bandini and Claudio Rosseti. He said the two had recently returned from Sri Lanka, where they had been sent to assist with aid efforts there following the deadly tsunami.<br><br>SEPANG, Malaysia, March 19 (Reuters) - Toyota's Jarno Trulli choked back tears on Saturday as he dedicated his fine showing in qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix to a friend who was killed in a freak accident in Italy.<br><br>"I'm shocked because I've just heard the news that a friend of mine has just died," Trulli said after he was second quickest in the first qualifying session for Sunday's race in Sepang.<br><br>"I want to dedicate this front row to Stefano."<br><br>Trulli, then with Renault, dedicated his maiden Formula One victory in Monaco last year to former race engineer Dino Toso who was battling a serious illness.<br><br>"Stefano was a rescue pilot," Trulli said. "Yesterday there was a fire I think in Italy and he was really unlucky.<br><br>"After landing on the water and taking off I think he has hit electrical cables."<br><br>Trulli posted an impressive time of one minute 32.672 in the fierce Malaysia heat to split the Renaults of Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella.<br><br></div>
