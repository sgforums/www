            <div class='col-md body'>by Ruth Smythers, beloved wife of the Reverend L.D. Smythers of the Arcadian Methodist Church of the Eastern Regional Conference. Published in the year of our Lord, 1894, Spiritual Guidance Press, New York City.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I read it with nicky and i thought it was really funny... </span><br><br>To the sensitive young woman who has had benefits of proper upbringing, the wedding day is ironically, both the happiest and the most terrifying day of her life. On the positive side, there is the wedding itself, in which the bride is the central attraction in a beautiful and inspiring ceremony, symbolizing her triumph in securing a male to provide for all her needs for the rest of her life. On the negative side, there is the wedding night, during which the bride must pay the piper, so to speak, by facing for the first time the terrible experience of sex.<br><br>At this point, dear reader, let me concede one shocking truth. Some young women actually anticipate the wedding night with curiousity and pleasure! Beware such an attitude! A selfish and sensual husband can easily take advantage of such a bride. <span style="color: green;">One cardinal rule of marriage should never be forgotten: GIVE LITTLE, GIVE SELDOM, AND ABOVE ALL, GIVE GRUDGINGLY.  </span>Otherwise, what could have been a proper marriage could become an orgy of sexual lust.<br><br>On the other hand, the bride's terror need not be extreme. While sex is at best revolting and at worse rather painful, it has to be endured, and has been by women since the beginning of time, and is compensated for by the monogamous home and by the children produced through it.<br><br>It is useless, in most cases, for the bride to prevail upon the groom to forego the sexual initiation. While the ideal husband would be one who would approach his bride only at her request and only for the purpose of begetting offspring, such nobility and unselfishness cannot be expected from the average man.<br><br>Most men, if not denied, would demand sex almost every day. The wise bride will permit a maximum of two brief sexual experiences weekly during the first months of marriage. As time goes by she should make every effort to reduce this frequency.<br><br>Feigned illness, sleepiness, and headaches are among the wife's best friends in this matter. Arguements, nagging, scolding, and bickering also probe very effective, if used in the late evening about an hour before the husband would normally commence his seduction.<br><br>Clever wives are ever on the alert for new and better methods of denying and discouraging the amorous overtures of the husband. A good wife should expect to have reduced sexual contacts to one a week by the end of the first year of marriage.<br><br>By the tenth anniversary many wives have managed to complete their child bearing and have achieved the ultimate goal of terminating all sexual contacts with the husband. By this time she can depend upon his love for the children and social pressure to hold the husband in the home.<br><br>Just as she should be ever alert to keep the quantity of sex as low as possible, the wise bride will pay equal attention to limiting the kind and degree of sexual contacts. <span style="color: green;">Most men are by nature rather perverted, and if given half a chance, would engage in quite a variety of the most revolting practices. </span> These practices include among others performing the normal act in abnormal positions: mouthing the female body: and offering their own vile bodies to be mouthed in turn.<br><br>Nudity, talking about sex, reading stories about sex, viewing photographs and drawings depicting or suggesting sex are other obnoxious habits the male is likely to aquire if permitted.<br><br>A wise bride will make it her goal never to allow her husband to see her unclothed body, and never allow him to display his unclothed body to her. Sex, when it cannot be prevented, should be practiced only in total darkness. Many women have found it useful to have thick cotton nightgowns for themselves and pajamas for their husbands. These should be donned in seperate rooms. They need not be removed during the sex act. Thus, a minimum of flesh is exposed.<br><br>Once a bride has donned her gown and turned off all the lights, she should lie quietly upon the bed and await her groom. When he comes groping into the room she should make no sound to guide him in her direction, lest he take this as a sigh of encouragement. She should let him grope in the dark. There is always the hope that he will stumble and incur some slight injury which she can use as an excuse to deny him sexual access.<br><br>When he finds her; the wife should lie as still as possible. Bodily motion on her part could be interpreted as sexual excitement by the optimistic husband.<br><br>If he attempts to kiss her on the lips she shuld turn her head slightly so that the kiss falls harmlessly on her cheek instead. If he attempts to kiss her anyplace else she should quickly pull the gown back in place, spring from the bed, and announce that nature calls her to the toilet. This will generally dampen his desire to kiss in the forbidden territory.<br><br>If the husband attempts to seduce her with lascivious talk, the wise wife will suddenly remember some trivial nonsexual question to ask him. Once he answers she should keep the conversation going, no matter how frivolous it may seem at the time.<br><br>Eventually, the husband will learn that if he insists on having sexual contact, he must get on with it without amorous embellishment. The wise wife will allow him to pull the gown up no farther than the waist, and only permit him to open the front of his pajamas to thus make connection.<br><br>She will be absolutely silent or babble about her housework while he is huffing and puffing away. Above all, she will lie perfectly still and never under any circumstances grunt or groan while the act is in progress.<br><br>As soon as the husband has completed the act the wise wife will start nagging him about various minor tasks she wishes him to perform on the 'morrow. Many men obtain a major portion of their sexual satisfaction from the peaceful exhaustion immediately after the act is over. Thus the wife must insure that there is no peace in this period from him to enjoy. Otherwise, he might be encouraged to soon try for more.<br><br>One heartening factor for which the wife can be grateful is the fact that the husband's home, school, church and social environment have been working together all through his life to instill in him a deep sense of guilt in regardst to his sexual feelings, so that he comes to the marriage couch apologetically and subdued. <span style="color: green;">The wise wife seizes upon this advantage and relentlessly pursues her goal first to limit, later to annihilate completely, her husband's desire for sexual expression.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal ready on time for his return from work. This is a way of letting him know you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs.<br><br>Prepare yourself. Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting for him. His boring day may need a little lift and one of your duties is to provide it.<br><br>Greet him with a warm smile and show sincerity in your desire to please him.<br><br>Don't complain if he is late for dinner or even stays out all night. Count this as minor to what he might have already gone through that day. Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair. Or have him lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready for him.<span style="color: green;">Arrange the pillow and offer to take off his shoes.</span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Don't ask him questions about his actions or question his judgement or integrity. <span style="color: green;">Remember, he is master of the house and as such will always exercise his will with fairness and truthfulness.<br></span><br><br>Encourage your husband to pursue his hobbies and interests and be supportive without seeming to encroach.  <span style="color: green;">If you have little hobbies of your own, try not to bore him speaking of these, as woman's interests are often rather trivial compared to men's.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>When it comes to the possibility of intimate relations it is important to remember your wedding vows and in particular your commitment to obey. If he feels the need to sleep immediately then so be it. In all things be lead by your husband's wishes, do not pressure him in any way to stimulate intimacy.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Should your husband suggest congress then accede humbly all the while being mindful that a man's satisfaction is more important than a woman's. When he reaches his moment of fulfilment a small moan from yourself is encouraging to him and quite sufficient to indicate any enjoyment you may have found. Should your husband suggest any of the more unusual practices be obedient and uncomplaining.</span><br><br>After relations it is likely that your husband will fall promptly asleep, so adjust your clothing, freshen up and apply your face and hair care products.<br><br><span style="color: green;">You may then set the alarm so that you can arise shortly before him in the morning. This will enable you to have his morning cup of tea ready when he awakes.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> yeah right...like that will ever happen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
