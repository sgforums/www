            <div class='col-md body'>Well, nowadays airline companies or even the Air Force are on the lookout for potential female pilots, probably because they want to even out the high male to female ratio, after all, gender equality gaining a foothold on society.<br><br>Still, male pilots are preferred over females ones. One reason being the females have a very high potential of leaving the company/airforce after getting married or giving birth to a child, so the large amount of money that was spent on training the female pilot would somehow not get as much worth from a male pilot that is able to commit for decades at a time.</div>

If you apply to go SIA and succeed, they'll send you to their flying college in Seletar to receive basic flying training.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>afaik, there are no females in SIA mainline, though it doesn't say anywhere that they don't hire them. Its sort of like an unwritten policy, probably due to image concerns. Most female applicants to the SIA cadet pilot scheme get posted to silkair, though i'm not sure whether any of them end up in SIA Cargo.<br><br>Air Force is different though. They're encouraging females to sign on as pilots, and there's even one female F-16 pilot</div>
