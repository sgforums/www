              <p>Many times I had heard people talking about the airplane's autopilot system ( AP ) as if it's a magic button. press one button and the aircraft flies the plane from take-off to landing. 
                      This is a misconception. I would like to clear this up as layman as I can.I am sure many had heard of the following joke :
                      Pilot's  job is to feed the dog in cockpit who will inturn bite the pilot if he attempts to touch anything.
                      
                      The autopilot system is designed to assist pilots in reducing most of the mundane workload of flying. It cannot do an auto-take-off, that is still a manual human action. THink of it as your secretary or personal assistant, they  cannot make decisions for the bosses but will assist in completing most of coordination, typing, administrative functions.
                      the pilots still monitor, perceive and COMMAND an action, to either allow AP system to take over or DISENGAGED to do do hands on flying because certain actions are beyond what the AP system is designed to do.
                      For instance, AP can assist to hold an aircraft at an assigned altitude as well as speed and also to warn of abnormal actions so crew can make a decision to respond .
                      AP does not work alone, it works with others computers to make decisions n usually they vote to see who has majority votes.
                      Most modern airplane has 3 AP system, meaning one for Captain side, one for Co-pilot and one backup. usually only one AP is in control. When both AP are engaged, or what we called DUAL, then it can perform autoland function on its own.
                      Main functions of the AP was to reduce crew workload there by reducing fatigue which could lead to errors, flying today is so stressful in comparison, airspace are conjested, slots are back to back, separations are 15mins, there are so many restrictions n requirements from ground to airspace performance that without the AP , crew would have stressed out at Top of Climb, imagine flying nowadays for 18 hours up there.
                      
                      The Trident was the first airplane to have a triplex Auto pilot system because it was designed to land in foggy conditions in UK.
                      There are Dual Active failure, Passive failure AP systems , meaning when the AP system gives up it will show Fail Passive, when there is a problem n the AP can take recovery functions because it is within its parameters, it will show Fail-Active. ( crew to monitor n finger on red button to take over ). Airbus is at the forefront with its Alpha Floor protection, etc.
                      I am sure if one is to google, one may find some notes on it. too long for me to write it.
                      
                      Now, the AP system is only as good as the Flight Data Computer brain. if the Nav DB has a stored waypoints n company routes built-in, the AP system can fly the aircraft together with the INS and other flight control systems after airborne to landing.
                      However, AP systems has its limitations. n crew must know its limitations. for example, while AP or autoland system can land an aircraft in thick fog, or what we call a CAT 3 landing, ( i will spare the details about Autoland Minimums ), it cannot be initiated in tailwind or crosswinds conditions. Usually not all airports will allow autoland. Usually when airplane is lined up ( meaning straight on runway at final approach phase ) crew will disengaged AP ( there will be a crickety aural warning ) n land hands-on.
                      
                      So I hope folks will not think AP   is just press a button n do all. The human intervention will still be in place for many years to come.
                      As simple as I can, I hope it clears up the misconception.
                      I do welcome comments from other pilots or forumers  to add in accordingly. I have a pic of a Flight Director Control Panel with AP instrumentations but I do not know how to upload it. Perhaps some kind souls can help?</p>

              <p>Cool, I didn't know the AP system could land the plane. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>I thought TO and Landing had to be done by the pilot.</p>
