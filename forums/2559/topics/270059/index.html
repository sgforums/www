But these engines have very little ground clearance, check out the 737NGs and are prone to FOD(foreign object damage)<br><br>For rear mounted engines, they're better for landing at terrible runways, where FOD is a constant issue, as engine is lower to ground, less likely injest random things on the ground (also means push-back tractor not req.). They also reduce cabin noise.<br>However, rear mounted engines mean the Cg is shifted WAY aft, making aircraft balancing an issue. Also accessing the rear engines in the case of B727 / MD family, is a serious issue. Another prob. would be compressor stalls, at high angles of attack, the wing would be horizontal to the engines, but the air flowing over the wing is no longer laminar and is now turbulent. turbulent air may cause a compressor stall, and the most likely time for this will be on T/O landing<br><br>hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

An aerodynamically cleaner wing (i.e., you don't have the engine pylon and nacelle interrupting airflow over and under the wing),<br><br>2. Better engine-out performance due to reduced asymmetric thrust as the engines are closer to the fuselage centerline,<br><br>3. Reduced chances of FOD as the engines have greater ground clearance, allowing operations from unprepared strips,<br><br>4. Increased chances of a successful ditching in an emergency, and<br><br>5.

An aerodynamically cleaner wing (i.e., you don't have the engine pylon and nacelle interrupting airflow over and under the wing),<br><br>2. Better engine-out performance due to reduced asymmetric thrust as the engines are closer to the fuselage centerline,<br><br>3. Reduced chances of FOD as the engines have greater ground clearance, allowing operations from unprepared strips,<br><br>4. Increased chances of a successful ditching in an emergency, and<br><br>5. A quieter cabin.<br><br>From what I can recall, the French-made Sud-Aviation Caravelle was the first commercial airliner to sport rear-mounted engines, but my favourite still remains the <a href="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/types/uk/vickers/vc10/G-ASG0-01.jpg" rel="nofollow">Vickers VC10</a>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ETA:</span> Oops, I see someone posted before me already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>rear engines also increase survivability when ditching. engines on the wing will scoop the water and act as a pivot, causing the inertia to force the nose down - smashing it into the water and breaking the aircraft up.<br><br>with a rear engine, the plane can land "smoothly" on the water surface with wheels up - this keeps much of the plane intact and has in aviation history saved several lives in at least one crash.<br><br>engines mounted below the wings can be dropped? when its on fire o.0<br><br>no ideas about the cockpit thing though</div>

I have the utmost respect for technicians, ames/LAEs, ground staff, crew, catering, checkin- dispatchers, AICs, ATCs, almost 99% of all who helps to maintain n turn a plane around &amp; in continuine airworthiness.N u better know MORE than pilots ! haha<br><br>SO rest assured its not wat u are thinking bro.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kopiosatu:</div><div class="quote_body">is it me, or do i see this line insulting as a technician?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br>Im not sure where u get that from but I most certainly aprec engineers n everyone else. even the  Makcik who came in to vacuum the flight deck n clear e rubbish.  ANd if that were true, then it's not just the engineers, a lot of those who work behind the scene will b under-appreciated!<br>that is why we need Crew/Team resource management coupled with Human Factors &amp; EMT.<br>FYI, airworthiness of an aircraft is not just the machine but a whole network of systems, certification..paperwork, trained staff..etc<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Idle_King:</div><div class="quote_body">such is the life of the engineer, the under-appreciated few who keep the aircraft in airworthy shape...</div></blockquote></div>
