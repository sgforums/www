            <div class='col-md body'>it looks like there was a crosswind from the direction the smoke was blowing. the Manchester 737 accident showed the critical importance of crosswind in respect to ground fires of stationary aircraft. although the fire damage is seriously worse on the left side, this could easily have been due to crossover of the heat source and it is indeed very possible the cause of the problem was the right engine.<br><br>just my 2 cents.</div>
