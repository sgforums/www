            <div class='col-md body'>Viewed the video of the touchdown and subsequent gear collapse. Pretty impressive! Apparently, when the starboard prop contacted the ground and fragmented, pieces of it penetrated the fuselage, but fortunately none of the passengers were struck by them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SAS Grounds Dash 8-400 Fleet After Second Accident This Week</strong></span><br><br>Bombardier has recommended immediate inspections of all Bombardier Q400s with more than 10,000 landing-gear cycles after SAS suffered a <strong>second accident on landing within three days.</strong><br><br>The extent of the work required was not immediately clear, but at least 60 aircraft are expected to be affected. SAS describes the aircraft as being "grounded" pending the individual inspections.<br><br>The aircraft had been operating flight SK2748 from Copenhagen to Palanga in Lithuania when the accident occurred at 01:36 today, 12 September.<br><br>SAS says: "The aircraft experienced technical difficulties and the crew decided to divert to Vilnius Airport in Lithuania where the accident occurred at 01:36 local time today.<br><br>"Although no further details of the accident are available at the moment we can confirm that there are 48 passengers and four crew onboard. All passengers were evacuated after landing and no injuries are reported."<br><br>SAS had already began inspecting its Q400 fleet Â– operated by its Scandinavian Airlines and Wideroe units - following the main-gear collapse on one of the type during touchdown at Aalborg on 9 September.<br><br>It says: "The Canadian manufacturer of the Q400, Bombardier, is in the process of developing an inspection programme. As a precautionary measure, Bombardier is highly recommending that all aircraft worldwide of this type with 10,000 landing gear cycles or more will be grounded until the recommended inspection is carried out.<br><br>"Scandinavian Airlines and Wideroe have already decided to ground the entire fleet of Q400s aircraft until further notice. No aircraft will be released for operations until these inspections have been carried out on all aircraft."<br><br>FlightÂ’s ACAS database lists 61 aircraft with more than 10,000 airframe cycles. SAS itself, with 20, and Alaska AirÂ’s Seattle-based Horizon Air subsidiary with 17 are the worst affected carriers.<br><br>Augsburg Airways of Germany and Austrian AirlinesÂ’ regional unit Austrian Arrows each have six aircraft affected, and there are smaller numbers at Air Nippon Network and Japan Air Commuter in Japan, Flybe of the UK, and Royal Jordanian Xpress in Jordan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SAS confirms gear collapsed in Vilnius Q400 accident </strong></span><br><br>SAS has confirmed that this morningÂ’s Vilnius Bombardier Q400 accident bore a strong resemblance to its 9 September Aalborg crash, with both aircraft suffering a right landing gear collapse.<br><br>This morning a Scandinavian Airlines Q400, which was operating between Copenhagen to Palanga in Lithuania, diverted to Vilnius in Lithuania where it suffered a gear collapse on landing. None of the 48 passengers and four crew onboard were injured.<br><br>A SAS Group spokeswoman says: "When they landed the right landing gear collapsed in a very similar way to what happened in Aalborg in Denmark on [9 September].<br><br>"Those two accidents are unfortunately very similar. ThatÂ’s why Bombardier now has become more highly involved. They have recommended that this type of aircraft with more than 10,000 landing-gear cycles should be inspected and until that is done, they should be grounded."<br><br>She says the timeframes of the two accidents - between landing and gear collapse Â– were very similar. But the spokeswoman was unable to give details of the weather at the time, the exact nature of the technical problem or the extent of the damage to the aircraft. The aircraft remains on the ground at Vilnius.<br><br>"We donÂ’t really have any information [about the state of the aircraft], but you would assess that after having the landing gear break there would be substantial damage."<br><br>SAS Group operates 27 Q400s. Of these, 23 are operated by Scandinavian Airlines Â– including the two damaged aircraft. The remainder are operated by Wideroe in Norway.<br><br>Recent events have prompted Scandinavian Airlines and Wideroe to ground their Q400 fleets. The spokeswoman says this has caused a huge challenge for the carriers, with 100 cancellations in Denmark today and around 20 across the remainder of its operation.<br><br>Its Danish and Swedish domestic and European short-haul services are bearing the brunt of the operational disruption.<br><br>The spokeswoman says it is unclear how long the aircraft will be grounded for. "It is going to be a bit bigger than a five minute check. ThatÂ’s not what weÂ’re talking about this time. It is definitely affecting traffic today and for the next couple of days. We donÂ’t know how long we will have to keep the fleet on the ground."<br><br>She adds that neither SAS nor Bombardier had seen similar problems before the 9 September landing gear collapse at Aalborg.</div>
