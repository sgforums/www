No point spending time behind bars.</div></blockquote>what to do? we singapore bus/railway/aviation fans lan lan got to accept such damned stupid restrictions lo! our govt kept say they going to improve and be more flexible - but look...<br><br>Many organisations and authorities in Singapore are still very rigid and not flexible enough. for eg HDB - if downstairs residents complain their toilet ceiling leak, HDB officers will pressure you to accept their HDB repair method style and demand you to demolish all your toilet fittings and floor and re-waterproof; whereas there are several other available methods of leak repair without "open-surgery" method. hence dragging the dispute cases for ages! coz these people lacks confident and "kiasi", die die stick to their rigid and outdated policies and never improve!<br><br>Look at Australia - the authorities recognise and respect the presence of railway fans but also do not compromise the need for security. Hence, railway fans got to apply for photography permit and also inform the station staff before and after photography. They are able to met the needs of railway fans and are still confident of providing ample security for their country. However, photography ban in Spore gives me the impression our authorities are weak not confident enough of providing ample security to safeguard us from terrorist threats as yet.<br><br>For Singapore - they just chop it off and close topic and that's it! Have the authorities ever wondered why and how bus photography can be a security threat before simply slapping a ban? I believe terrorists won't be that stupid to use cameras photograph sensitive things anymore. Even if they want, i think they rather use those spy cams used by PIs rather than those used by us bus fans. I also believe they can now do away with the need to photograph and just plan where to hide the bomb and strike liao. I believe those bombings in Bali, Jarkata, Philippines, etc - terrorists don't need to photograph before striking la!<br><br>BUT - what is important for security safeguard is to look out for suspicious behaviours and people leaving their baggage behind, suspicious haversacks, bags, and improve police intelligence. **THAT IS REAL POTENTIAL DANGER!** Bus photography is banned - but I can see pax on eg svc 858 buses placing luggages at the standing area and go to the rear to sit. Policemen come up the bus - look at the bags and alight. MAY I ASK WHICH IS REAL POTENTIAL DANGER?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, regarding the bags on services going into the airport compound, there are many times, in fact majority, that the policeman would ask whose bag it is, and sometimes people would just raise hands like primary school.<br>Flexibility, Sg is much like by-the-book, you won't crash, yes, but you would not know how to deal with a situation that does not appear in the book. What if there is a fire outside of the building? It is different from fire within the building, no evacuation unless there are back doors, and its would be best to execute sealed protection until help arrives. Are security guards/management knowledgble to deal with such special cases? Some building I visited does not apply such rules, and many have their fire escape blocked as well!<br>About HDB houses, they gave excuses like 'living together harmonously' and 'interaction between neighbours during emergencies' as the main reason to help and follow their way of doing things. No reason also can help, but provide a practical one lah...</div>

I guess not! Terrorists can always monitor, watch and familarise themselves their targets without any photography too!<br><br>And what about people and tourists photographing in busy streets? If photography is also a terrorist threat, wouldn't the authorities be afraid if they photograph and then use the photos to prepare for an attack?<br><br>The most important thing our security forces got to tackle are:<br>- monitoring and controlling substances or ingredients that causes terrorist attacks and making sure they do not fall into the wrong hands (classified under Controlled Items and be accounted for).<br>- Only allow companies that got adequate safeguards and protective measures to handle such items for non-evil intentions<br>- beef up intelligence against suspected terrorists<br>- training the public to look out for suspicious bags or articles</div>
