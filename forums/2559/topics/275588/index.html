            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, I guess its a prudent action to close the runway, although it caused a bit of inconvenience to the pax.<br>Plus there are also such cases where low fuel brought about by natural/animals that forced planes to land at alternative.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ah.. isn't that just normal procedure to go to the alternative airport? not china airline's fault that they closed the runway cause some other plane got bird strike what.<br><br>they planned enough fuel to get to their airport and their alternative airport including circling so quite alright what..<br><br>i think sometimes the news can be stupid?
