There were no injuries.<br><br>After more than a one-year delay due to production problems, Airbus is scheduled to deliver its first A380, which seats 555, to Singapore Airlines in October. The plane that arrived in Bangkok Friday from Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, is making a demonstration tour of Asia. It also will visit Vietnam, Hong Kong, and South Korea.<br><br>Officials said the accident at Suvarnabhumi Airport was related to the unusually long wingspan of the plane, for which the hanger whose door it hit had not been designed. "It was not due to problems with traffic control or human error of the captain," said Thai Airways President Apinan Sumanaseni.<br><br>He said that the left winglet of the plane had been damaged, but that engineers would remove the winglets ahead of the postponed flight.<br><br>"The device removed is useful but we can fly without it ... I don't think it will affect the operation of the aircraft at all," said Terry Lutz, the plane's captain and head test pilot for Airbus.<br><br>A winglet tips up and back from the end of a wing, improving aerodynamic efficiency.<br><br>In press release last month, Airbus said its demonstration tours are meant to help prepare the A380 "for a smooth entry into service."<br><br>"Operating under typical airline conditions, (the) aircraft will undergo airport compatibility checks, ground handling and maintenance procedures to confirm its readiness to enter service," it said.<br><br>By mid-August, the A380 already had visited more than 45 airports worldwide, and more than 70 airports will be ready for the plane by 2011, it said.<br><br>"Total orders and commitments for the A380 are 173 by 14 customers," it said, adding that delivery schedules for Singapore Airlines, Emirates Airlines and Qantas are on track.<br><br>An Airbus representative said that Saturday's incident would not affect the profile of the plane in Asia.<br><br>"This kind of incident happens at every airport around the world. It is just a minor incident," said Edouard Ullmo, Airbus sales executive vice president for Asia-Pacific and Africa. </blockquote>[/quote]</div>
