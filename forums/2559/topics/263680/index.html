            <div class='col-md body'>I am so surprised no one mentioned about this especially this coming from the Paris air show.<br><br>Singapore Airlines has signed a contract for the purchase of 20 A350-900 XWBs to meet its requirements on medium to long-range routes across the Asia-Pacific region from 2013 onwards. This order, which firms up the Letter of Intent placed in July 2006, represents another major commitment to the expansion of the airlineÂ’s Airbus fleet, which is already destined to include 19 A380s and 19 A330s.<br><br>The A350 XWB (extra wide-body) is AirbusÂ’ response to market demand for a medium capacity long range wide-body family. Available from 2013, it will have an entirely new, uncompromised, 21st Century design with a new and wider fuselage for extra space and passenger comfort. It will also be extra efficient, extra environmentally friendly and quiet, as it will feature all the advanced technologies available in the first part of the 21st Century, bringing the A380 experience to a new level.<br><br>The all-new A350 XWB will offer Singapore Airlines unrivalled operating performance and economics, whilst passengers will enjoy outstanding comfort and amenities in a highly advanced and spacious cabin environment.<br><br>Â“We are very proud to have Singapore Airlines as a very early customer for the all new A350 XWB, particularly since it follows the announcement for nine additional A380 orders and 19 A330 leases. As one of the undisputed leaders of the global air transport industry, Singapore Airlines sets the most demanding standards to ensure that its aircraft combine outstanding passenger appeal, unbeatable efficiency and exceptional environmental friendliness. This makes it all the more gratifying for the A350 XWB to have been selected to meet the airline's requirement for future fleet growth and global network expansion,Â” said Louis Gallois, President and CEO, Airbus.<br><br>Conceived from the outset to become a comprehensive airliner Family, the A350 XWB will be available in three basic passenger versions, the A350-800 which can fly 270 passengers in a spacious three-class configuration up to 8,500 nm / 15,750 km, the A350-900 seating 314, and the A350-1000 which is designed for 350, both with ranges of up to 8,300nm / 15,400 km. The exact seating configuration for Singapore AirlinesÂ’ A350-900 XWBs will be announced by the airline at a later date.<br><br>With a cross section of 232 inches / 5.9 meters, the A350 XWB will benefit from the widest fuselage in its category, offering unprecedented levels of comfort in this market segment. It will also offer the lowest operating costs and lowest seat mile cost of any aircraft in that category. The Family is designed to confront the challenges of high fuel prices, rising passenger expectations, and environmental concerns in that market segment.<br><br>Airbus is an EADS company.<br><br>http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/pressreleases_items/07_06_22_sia_a350.html</div>

The original A350 is miserable but the redesign of the A350XWB has definately attract lots of customers. SQ is very particular with their planes and with their firm order of 20 along with Qatar Airways of 80, that definately gave Airbus and the A350XWB a big boost.

Love the A330 follow by B777. Great planes from both manufacturers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Total sales yeah, 787 has the lead but I am very glad Airbus didn't wave the white flag. I suspect they will gain more order. The original A350 design didn't appeal to many airlines (low orders) because it's so similar to the A330 (Just improvement in the engines and other minor details).<br><br>I can't see GE offering powerplant for the A350XWB as it's directly competing with the 772LR and 773ER's aircrafts (Sole engine supplier). Makes no sense to compete with it's ownself.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The A350XWB still has 5 years to EIS. It's amazing that the A350 was able to garner this number even before the design is frozen. Boeing 787 looks set to book around 700 units before EIS. Who knows if the A350 will match that number, or even surpass that? Even if Airbus managed to book at least 400 orders for the A350, it is still commendable. Anything can happen by then. It might look miserable now, but if rumours with the likes of EK comes true, the backlog will jump by a considerable margin. Nevermind that SQ remains the major blue-chip airline to place a firm order at the moment. It's a major boost to the programme in its own right, although that can't be said should SQ repeats the MD-11 saga.<br><br>There are many more airlines in line to order either the A350XWB or the 787. MH, TG, PR, CX, FAX, UL, SV, and dozens more. Time will tell.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Airbus has made several changes to XWB, certainly seems more attractive. Don't think XWB is to be pitted against the 787. Although Airbus has it's oversight in concentrating too much in A380 but that doesn't mean it will lose the race. It made just be a tortoise and hare race.</div>
