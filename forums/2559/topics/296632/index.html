            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,<br><br>tuesday, 2100LT on NatGeo, you have the Air Crash Investigation series. i figured out it would be a good way to keep the forum going with the discussion with regards to the latest episodes so everyone can give them 2 cents worth and talk about.<br><br>for those who do not have NatGeo, i supposed topics can be wikipedia-ed and all can actively participate in the forums.<br><br>hopefully, moderators can help keep this thread alive by giving your 2 cents worth!<br><br>anyway.

            <div class='col-md body'>B4 I leave here frm my Moderator post, allow me to answer some of ur qns:<br><br>1. In this case , we are talking about a Single pilot flying his part 135/PPL plane, so yes it is a handful if u have to refer to ur 10-1 /Area charts or let down charts.Whe n a pilot is in approach or TMA , he should no longer be looking at his Area or H/L charts but rather either flying the Vector( as per ATC ) or flying his STAR or his IAP until he is aligned with the runway n then he shoots the approach.<br>2. When u have 2 pilots flying, one will be PF ( Pilot Flying ) and the other will be PNF ( Pilot Not Flying ), each will have  his/her own set of  functions , for example, the PF will fly n ask for speed or flaps "positive Rate of Climb" GEAR UP please !or speedbrakes settings and the PNF will actuate these for him. PNF will also read charts , do the communications n also monitor outside traffic and the instruments. At all time , both crew MUST maintain CRM and SA.( Situational Awareness).<br>3. No 2 pilots will read charts, eat, eat the same food, drink ,talk , sianz charbor, touch the controls or call out speed at the same time!<br>4. That particular errant pilot in this case disregards his VFR, FAR , SA n ATC instructions. he was in a class A airspace n should COMPLY with ATC instructions as well as monitor his TCAS. all US registered plane &amp; all planes entering U.S. FIR MUST have TCAS II , plus GPS  esp when entering TMA conjested area.<br><br>5. u mention visual reference, of course he MUST have visual reference! because he filed for VFR FPL. BUT having Visual references does not help u to determine if that plot of area is Prohibited or Restricted, there is no marking on the ground that says" Hey, GET OUT! PROHIBITED HERE@!".  . All prohibited and restricted areas are clearly marked on charts. Prohibited is for all time , restricted areas are temporal.<br><br>6. I never had an issue  with charts even doing single flying or VFR or VFR on top or IFR. It's all about pre flight planning n organising your trip folder.<br>7. In Singapore ,  VFR traffic is prohibited in/out of Changi  Airport.  Seletar &amp; PLA allows VFR/IFR but even having IFR in Seletar is useless because it doesn;t have precision approaches. Only NDB to land.<br><br>I hope it answers ur qns.  MG will be a better person,as far as I know to answer u on the FAA regulations as he flies in US. I'm more a JAR/EASA/CAA Uk person..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by expeditious-:</div><div class="quote_body">if i am not wrong, they have around 3 episodes of Air Crash Investigation per week, with one on tuesday, and another two on Sunday.<br><br>anyway. we can all sit here and brush aside the fact that it is all repeat, and i guess this thread, and possibly this forum will die off pretty soon.<br><br>on the other hand, active discussion would be helpful to everyone here ranging from people interested in aviation, to those guys out there with a PPL, to pilots, and to even air traffic controllers.<br><br>i guess tuesday's episode is a good lesson to be learnt for air traffic controllers and pilots, with regards to the flying within TMA.<br><br>straying into a prohibited, restricted or even danger area is a very dangerous thing, and as much as controllers are supposed to maintain a lookout for such "incursion", pilots, as the captain of the aircraft is ultimately responsible for his aircraft.<br><br>questions to pilots here, does the usage of charts really help determine your position when flying VFR? of course if you hae visual reference, it would be good, but it too much of a handful to be checking your charts and flying at the same time?</div></blockquote></div>
