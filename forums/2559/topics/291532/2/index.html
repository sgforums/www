If they so scared they can send more soldier to patrol the viewing mall too.<br><br>Viewing aircraft also scared terror , then why dont the whole airport made of metal , wood , or plastic instead of building glass pannel<br><br>They might as well say glass pannel at departure and arrival zone is dangerous , terror might record video of inside or they break glass and sneak in<br><br>Do thing that make no sense one</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Too bad the $1 deal is only up to 12 Dec. Come Jan 9, those not going overseas would have to live with the crap design of the viewing mall. I would rather go changi beach if they would not do anything to change it.<br><br>The least they could do is to open the T1 west section. That place has fantastic views (unobstructed of course!). It brings back old memories of how my parents brought me there to watch planes and play at the playground there!<br><br>CAAS only know how to destroy things.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And yes, the $850 chairs? My god. I tried them today, and i would prefer my sub  $100 chair that i am seating right now! The chairs are normal, you would get them on buses or mcdonal's cushion seats which i believe cost much less but is durable and cheaper. If they would just spend the saved money buying cheaper chairs and build a better viewing mall for T3 (but not necsecarily more expensive), then i would very well make T3 my thrid home (after Home Sweet Home and School).<br>Even MM Lee Kuan Yew has doubts about the $850 chairs. Buck up CAAS!<br><br>The cheapest option is to build an open air viewing mall. It saves on loads of things! No need to build roof, no need build glass, no need clean glass (just look at how dirty T2's glass is!), no need install crap sunshades, no need pay Aircon bills. = Save $$$$$ !! Use the money to reduce airport tax! Then Changi will become the truly world class airport that it always aspires!<br><br>Sometimes, the govt want to be so high tech that they forgot the more pratical and cheaper options. Sad but true! - Sigh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

For planes landing at Runway 02L, you can see the touchdone zone where the plane lands and tyres will puff out smoke and trust reversers will be activated.<br><br>If they were to get rid of the disgusting sight of those sunshades, the view would be great.<br><br>The open house ends at 12 Dec 2007. You have to pay $1 at least to enter the transit area (airside) The transit area has the best view, no sunshades whatsoever!<br><br>The public areas (including the sucky viewing mall and the check in counters area) is free though. Don't miss the chance to catch a fantastic view in the transit area. After 12 Dec, the only way you are getting in is either you are travelling thorugh T3 or working there.</div>

T1 &amp; T2 used to have wonderful viewing galleries but not now. At least T1 still remain a small section of a wonderful viewing gallery, but no longer for T2. and i really missed the T1 section that used to have Swensens and overseeing the taxiway and runway!<br><br>besides anti-terror security concerns, i believe they removed the viewing gallery because a lot of students went there and sit everywhere on the floor to sleep or study in the past; esp the old T2 viewing gallery.</div>
