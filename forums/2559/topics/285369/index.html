He could not speak English, and was not hostile.<br><br>The jet was an hour into a seven-hour flight from Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to Amsterdam on Tuesday morning when the stowaway was discovered.<br><br>The first officer informed the captain, who turned back to Sharjah, where the man was handed over to the police.<br><br>Confirming the incident yesterday, SIA spokesman Stephen Forshaw said the airline was concerned that an unauthorised passenger had entered an aircraft, and had taken up the issue with the Sharjah Airport authorities.<br><br>' Singapore Airlines Cargo security staff have travelled to Sharjah to work with the airport authorities to identify how this lapse in security has occurred and ensure measures are put in place to ensure it does not recur,' he added.<br><br>This was the second stowaway found on an SIA plane in a month. On Oct 11, a Palestinian fell out of the nose wheel well at Changi Airport after a passenger flight from Kuala Lumpur landed. He was handed over to Malaysian authorities and charged with trespassing on a protected area of the airport.<br><br>In this week's incident, it is not known yet where the man got on the Boeing 747-400F.<br><br>The flight had originated in Bangalore, India, and stopped over at Sharjah Airport before taking off on Tuesday morning for Amsterdam.<br><br>It is believed that the man entered the cargo hold and, while the aircraft was in flight, climbed up a ladder inside to get to the cabin seats.<br><br>If he had sneaked on in Bangalore, he might have escaped detection at Sharjah because not all the cargo was unloaded there.<br><br>How he got inside is being investigated because the entrance to the cargo area is usually guarded by armed airport security personnel.<br><br>Pilots get on the Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft via a staircase from outside the plane. Once inside, they go up a ladder to the upper deck, where the cockpit and cabin seats are located.<br><br>Only two people were supposed to be on this flight - the captain and the first officer.<br><br>The Straits Times learnt that the stowaway was calm after being discovered.<br><br>To make sure he remained that way, the captain asked the first officer to serve the man some food and drinks, and to pull down the window shades so he would not suspect that the plane was returning to Sharjah.<br><br>This incident has raised safety concerns for pilots because there is no cockpit door on cargo aircraft.<br><br>An aviation safety expert said that, given the busy airport environments these days, it could be easy for people 'to walk in, look like they were doing something legitimate and not be challenged'.<br><br>Said Dr John Harrison, head of terrorism research at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at the Nanyang Technological University's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies: 'But we have to challenge, and it is important to use this case as an important example of how security can be breached.'<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Shublaq, 28.<br><br>'We were told that the government withdrew the charge on humanitarian grounds,' Osama's lawyer, Ms Latheefa Koya, told The Straits Times.<br><br>Osama, who allegedly suffered from depression, had hoped to seek political asylum in Malaysia after fleeing from a conflict-ridden area.<br><br>The Palestinian is said to have entered Malaysia on a social visit pass on Sept 15.<br><br>Last month, he was charged with trespassing in a protected area in the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) on Oct 11. He was believed to have evaded security by scaling the airport's perimeter fences.<br><br>Osama will be held at an immigration detention centre and is expected to be deported later this week.<br><br>A senior officer with the Selangor prosecutor's office said the instructions to withdraw the charge came from the Attorney-General's Chambers.<br><br>'The A-G agreed to use his discretionary powers in this case,' said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br><br>He added that police had also questioned Osama on how he managed to escape detection and sneak on to the SIA plane headed for Singapore.<br><br>Mr Ahmed Metani, a Palestinian Embassy official, said Osama would be sent back to Gaza City, where he is expected to be interrogated by the Palestinian authorities.<br><br>On Oct 11, the Palestinian shocked ground crew at Singapore's Changi Airport when he fell out of the Boeing 777-200's nose wheel well when the plane landed.<br><br>He was cold and dizzy from lack of oxygen after the 55- minute flight but was otherwise unhurt.<br><br>The next day, he was charged with entering Singapore without valid documentation. But a few days later, the charge was withdrawn and he was deported to Malaysia.<br><br>The case caused some embarrassment to the Malaysian government when it emerged that KLIA's closed-circuit cameras had failed to capture images of Osama entering the airport's security area.<br><br>kumhor@sph.com.sg<br><br>WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
