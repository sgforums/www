Its  new six screen configuration has two central displays mounted one above the other (the lower one on the centre console in front of the thrust levers) and a single primary flight/navigation display in front of each pilot with an on-board information system screen adjacent to it.<br><br>McConnell says that there were two main drivers behind the decision to revamp the cockpit: Â“The ability to share some of this airport and navigation information on the centre display is seen as advantage for the pilots because it means they can be looking at the same display together."<br><br>He adds that it will also allow Airbus Â“to put some more advances in navigation technology on to the displays in the futureÂ”.<br><br><img src="http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5701/a350cr0.gif"></div>

These are between 1,000 and 4,000lb lower than previous estimates, says A350 XWB chief engineer Gordon McConnell.<br><br>"After windtunnel and development work on low speed performance, weÂ’ve improved our level of prediction and believe we have better performance than anticipated at the start of the programme," says McConnell.<br><br>"We found that we were well, well inside our targets for take-off field length and so on," he adds. "WeÂ’ve also improved the braking of the aircraft which has allowed us to reduce the thrust levels."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Metallic strips will ensure electrical continuity in A350's carbon frame</strong></span><br><br>Airbus's decision to switch the fuselage frames from aluminium to carbonfibre has eliminated one advantage that the former offered - the provision of a natural "electrical system network" throughout the fuselage to dissipate lightning strikes and to provide a current return path for systems.<br><br>A350 XWB chief engineer Gordon McConnell says that Airbus has modelled how to retain the electrical continuity with the switch to carbonfibre and decided "to fit metallic strips around the frames, which gives an equivalent electrical network to a metallic frame".<br><br>McConnell says the switch to carbon frames is "relatively weight-neutral" as any savings from the lighter material is offset by the need to add the metallic strips. The move addresses concerns about corrosion risks between the metallic frames and carbonfibre fuselage panels.<br><br>"Our customers saw this as a disadvantage as there would have to be a cost later on in the aircraft's life to access this area to carry out inspections," says McConnell.</div>

Other major packages to be allocated include avionics and the power-generation system.<br><br>Evrard says that work packages for production of the A350's airframe have been defined and number "around 10". These will be awarded to Airbus factories and outside suppliers.<br><br>In parallel with bidding processes for XWB packages, partners are being sought for Airbus's French facilities at Meaulte and St Nazaire Ville, its German sites at Nordenham and Varel, and Filton in the UK as part of the airframer's Power8 restructuring programme.<br><br>Airbus says it has narrowed the shortlist of bidders from an initial 11 to five companies: GKN, Latecoere, MT Aerospace, Spirit AeroSystems and Voith.<br><br>"In line with Airbus' strategy to develop a network of first-tier suppliers to support the A350 XWB, the partners would share investment risks but also the benefits resulting from their participation in the A350 programme," says Airbus.<br><br>Germany's MT Aerospace and Voith have each been linked with the Varel and Nordenham facilities, while Latecoere is pursuing Meaulte and Saint Nazaire Ville.<br><br>Spirit has said that it would be interested in the German and French locations, and UK-based GKN has confirmed interest in Filton.<br><br>Airbus' German facility at Laupheim is also being sold and another German site, Augsburg, is under consideration for inclusion. Adding Augsburg to the programme would require Airbus to extend the sale period to give interested parties time to adjust their bids.</div>
