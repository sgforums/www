            <div class='col-md body'>I see. How about when faced with the 2nd case, where you probably know (through atc) that there's a good altitude separation between your aircraft and another that is on a converging track with yours, and the TCAS sounds telling you to climb/descend though you know that would put you and the aircraft into greater danger? Would be a rare occurence of course, but under such circumstances, would you still trust your TCAS, or would you trust that both aircraft adhered to the separation given by ATC? Assuming that closure rate is high and you cannot visually judge it yourself?<br><br>haha no la just reading up myself.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the pilot himself also should be able to make a judgement for himself... not too over reliant on either. If he senses something wrong, he should always think twice, be more flexible. Like instead of climbing, why not bank instead? Unless for some reason he can't..? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I am not sayin do not trust ATC, but it is proven n certified now that in this sort of situation, pilots will rely on TCAS.<br>I wont comment on 2nd case of 2 B744 in S.China sea as there are sensitivites<br><br>Human Factors &amp; EMT has proven that it is human error tat contributes mostly today to accidents.<br><br>Now, can u guys teach this old bird here how to upload pictures.? so I can upload the TCAS II pics , voice call and procs.<br><br>Cheers n thanks for reading.<br><br>uote]Originally posted by polarsnake:<br><strong><br><br><img src="http://www.air-europa.com/img/galeria/ID00284487.jpg"></strong>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is an excerpt from my company's FOM:<br><br>Â•  ATC may not know when TCAS issues RAs. It is possible for ATC to<br>unknowingly issue instructions that are contrary to the TCAS RA indications.<br>Safe vertical separation may be lost during TCAS coordination when one<br>aircraft maneuvers opposite the vertical direction indicated by TCAS and the<br>other aircraft maneuvers as indicated by TCAS. Accordingly, during an RA, do<br>not maneuver contrary to the RA based solely upon ATC instructions.<br><br>Â• Maneuvering in a direction opposite to a TCAS RA will negate safe separation<br>as a TCAS-equipped intruder follows its RA, which has been coordinated to be<br>in the opposite direction.<br><br>If a pilot makes the decision to not follow an RA, the crew should be certain that they have identified the correct aircraft and should consider that the intruder may be TCAS-equipped and may be maneuvering toward the aircraft in response to a coordinated RA.<br><br>TCAS Use on PRM Approaches<br><br>The TCAS mode should remain set to TA/RA while conducting ILS PRM<br>approaches. Flight crews should be aware, however, that ATC instructions are the primary means of providing separation. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory conflict with an ATC instruction - comply with the instruction. If a reaction to a TCAS alert causes the crew to deviate from an assigned clearance, inform ATC immediately.</div>
