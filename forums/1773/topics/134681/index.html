            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, I've done some research on Taoism recently. As I really know nothing about Taoism (except perhaps Tao Te Ching <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) I did a search on Taoist sects and history.<br><br>So basically Zhang Dao Ling formed the Zheng Yi sect (focusing on ritual, alchemy, and respects the spirits), while the Wang Chonghang formed the Quan Zhen sect, focusing on renunciation, practise, meditations, etc.<br><br>I'm guessing that Zheng Yi sect is the predominant form of Taoism in Singapore (am I right?) - if so, how do we recognise if a Taoist temple belongs to Zhengyi or Quan Zhen? Also is Quan Zhen Taoism common in Singapore?<br><br>Also just as Buddhism conducts dharma talks on Buddhist teachings, do the Taoist temples (especially Quan Zhen side) also conduct talks on Taoist teachings? Where can I find them? Also do you go to a particular temple most often? Do you all have a "spiritual guide" like a Taoist master?<br><br>I often ask my friend Thusness on some spiritual matters. He also posted in my forum topics especially on conversations with longchen. He experienced what is called commonly known as "Tao", "Pure Presence", "Pure Consciousness", "Pure Awareness", "Brahman" (hindu), "God" (christian mysticism), "True Self", "Buddha Nature", about 20 years ago and has since entered into many forms of spirituality (even many different cults etc). From ming jian xing yang, he entered Christianity, left, then Taoism. (he was also interested in Hinduism although he notes that Buddhist 'Emptiness' doctrine supercedes the concept of Brahman) Until 12 years back he was under an "experienced Taoist master" although he has now focused on Buddhist meditations. He has commented that Lao Tzu was an enlightened being (as did my master), although my master was not too supportive of Zhang Tian Shi's sect (I believed I mention it before) bcos of certain practices.<br><br>In the past I have also asked my friend Thusness (who mentioned that Taoism is different from Tao sect), about these matters before,<br><br>[15:34]  hi Thusness.. last time u say not all sects are Tao sect? but someone say Quan Zhen and Zheng Yi taoist sect, the two main branches, have their core values and teachings based on lao zi's teachings.<br>[15:40]  yes.  There is a diff between Tao Jia and Tao Sect.<br>[15:41]  I think Quan Zhen is but I am not exactly sure of Zheng Yi.<br>[16:03]  icic..<br>[16:04]  but Quan Zhen has a doctrine "The secret of golden flower".  It is a good read. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Can you elaborate more on this? (Tao Jia and Tao Sect)<br><br>Thanks.<br><br></div>
