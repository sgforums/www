            <div class='col-md body'>hi everyone,<br><br>i have a question to ask here.<br><br>in fact, i came from a christian family but i m not very religious and my hubby and his family are taoist/buddhist and i am staying in their house. sometimes, they will ask me to do some praying and i will do it becos i know they meant well for me. but i think they are a bit too far on this thingy.<br><br>my mother-in-law likes to take my shirts without my permission to chop and i am very stressed because they can't be washed away. she even take my working clothes to chop and there are times i am embarrassed wearing them to work without knowing they have been chop. i do not mind if she ask my permission and she do it once in a bluemoon but she always do that once in a few months.<br><br>she also kept asking me go for "bridge crossing" ceremony. when i ask her what ceremony it is, she said hard to describe and then she would say the best way is for me to go myself.<br><br>i respect their religion and i think i want to reach an agreement with her through logical discussion, but i need to know their religion well first. so my questions are:<br>1) is it very common for taoist/buddhist to have their clothes chop? what is the reason or purpose to chop their clothes? does anyone here chop before?<br>2) what is "bridge crossing" ceremony? what do they do there, like what kind of ritual or events they do? does anyone here take part before?<br><br>Thank YOU very much</div>

Knowing now that she really cares a lot about me, i really can't bear to give her false hopes. Hmm....i have an idea! If i can know in advance all the rituals i have to do, then i will be able to judge if i am comfortable in doing them or not. if not, then i will not agree to go with her. but if i think i can do them, then i will promise to go with her.<br><br>Can you please list down all the rituals for the bridge crossing ceremony, if it is not too much of a trouble?
