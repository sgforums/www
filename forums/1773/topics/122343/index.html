            <div class='col-md body'>Laozi's Teachings:<br><br>The 5,000-word Book of Dao and its Virtue written by Laozi discusses ways of personal cultivation, political opinions, and philosophical explanations to Dao. Examples are given below for a brief explanation:<br><br>Laozi's explanations to Dao:<br><br>"There is a whole formed and born earlier than Heaven and Earth. Silent and empty, it relies on nothing, moving around forever. We may regard it as the mother of all things. I do not know its name, so I name it as Dao, and further name it as the Great. The Great is moving forward without stopping, extending to the remotest distance, and then returning to where it was. That is why I say Dao is Great, Heaven is Great, Earth is Great, and Man is Great. There are four things that are Great, of them Man is one. Man takes Earth as his model, Earth takes heaven as its model, Heaven takes Dao as its model, and Dao takes Spontaneity as its model." -- Chapter 25<br><br>More than 2,500 years ago, in the whole world, only Laozi could imagine that the original earth was but chaotic breath. Heaven and Earth are not divided, and the earth revolves in circles along a certain orbit, silently and permanently. This idea coincides with the phenomenon of the beginning of the earth observed by scientists today. We can only say that Laozi is a sage, a superman.<br><br>Laozi called the first phenomenon of the earth he imagined as the "Great Dao". The Great Dao constantly moves, it is the endless movement of the brain. The Great extends distantly, it is the imagination of the remotest nature and even the imagination of the truth -- Dao. One can return to simplicity and perfection after attaining Dao.<br><br>Therefore, Dao is limitless, and Heaven, Earth and Man are all limitless. This limitless phenomenon is called Spontaneity. Man takes Earth as his model, Earth takes Heaven as its model, Heaven takes Dao as its model, and Dao takes what is Spontaneous as its model. We study Dao from spontaneity, while spontaneity is limitless without any artificial thoughts or behaviors. To get rid of bad thoughts and behaviours that are harmful to the human body and mind means "Non-Interference". When this is achieved, the mind and nature are omnipotent and can take every action. Being able to take every action is Dao expressed through spontaneity.<br></div>
