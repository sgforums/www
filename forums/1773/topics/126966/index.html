            <div class='col-md body'>Matriarch of Sea - Ma Zu, birthday : 23rd of the 3rd lunar month<br><br><img src="http://www.gb.taoism.org.hk/taoist-immortal/image/a00431.jpg"><br><br>Origin of the Matriarch of Sea<br><br>As the sea protector worshiped by people in the southeastern coastal area as well as by overseas Chinese, the Ma Zu was also known as Heavenly Consort(Tian Fei), Queen of Heaven(Tian Hou) , Lady Heavenly Consort(Tian Fei Niang Niang) and Goddess of Heaven(Tian Shang Sheng Mu), etc.<br><br>According to the Supreme Lord Tai Shang Lao Jun' Book of the Miracles of the Heavenly Consort Who Saves from Disasters, the Supreme Lord Tai Shang Lao Jun conferred on the Matriarch of the Sea the title of -<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> 'Heavenly Consort of Universal Salvation, Demonstrator of Benevolence in Brilliant Communion, Sublime and Numinous Protector of People, Guardian of the Kingdom, Trustworthy Saviour in Numinous Communion, Pure and Orthodox Promoter of Filial Piety, and Assistant of the Big Dipper'. </span><br><br>The records about the Matriarch of the Sea started to appear in the Northern Song dynasty. It is said that the she was born in the first Jiannong year of the first Song emperor (AD 960) and was the daughter of Lin Yuan, who was a high-ranking military official. The Motherly Matriarch's personal name was Moliang. She died in the fourth Yongxi year of the Song emperor Tai (AD 984) at the age of 28. It is said that when she was born, the room was filled with red light and strange smoke. She was born one month old and didn't cry even once. So she was called Moniang, which means 'Silent Girl' (Mo Niang). She started to attend a village school at the age of eight and showed a special interest in burning incense and worshiping the Divines. She was taught Taoist books and secret skills at the age of thirteen, and granted a mysterious talisman at sixteen.<br><br>Since then, she was able to stretch a straw mat to sea, saving people in danger. After her ascension, she always responded quickly to prayers. Since the Xuanhe year, between the Northern and Southern Song dynasties, she was granted various titles nine times, which continually increased her importance and prestige. Her original title 'Madam' was replaced by 'Higher Consort' in the Shaoxi year of Southern Song dynasty emperor Guang (AD 1190). Then her title was changed to 'Heavenly Consort' during the first Yuan emperor's reign, then, further, to 'Queen of Heaven' during reign of the Qing emperor Kangxi. During reign of the Qing emperor Jiaqing, the titles conferred on the Ma Zu added up to 28 Chinese characters.<br><br>Salvation for People:<br><br>Most stories about the Ma Zu were related to her salvation of people stranded in the sea. It is said that she could save people from far away with the help of two aids: Penetrating Eyes and Penetrating Ears. (Qian Li Yan and Shun Feng Er)<br><br>Usually dressed in red, the Ma Zu traveled among the islands on clouds. When ships sailing on the sea were hit by storms and people on board recited the Ma Zus sacred titles, she would emerge to help.<br><br>According to the Supreme Lord Tai Shang Lao Jun Book of the Miracles of the Heavenly Consort Who Saves from Disasters, the Matriarch of the Sea's obligations included saving wrecks, people in danger, and innocent souls seeking for release.<br><br>In later periods, her obligation was enlarged. In the Taoist book mentioned above, she claimed to save businessmen, farmers, craftsmen, soldiers, women suffering from difficult labor, and patients if they call her name piously and let her know their wishes. So in folk culture, she was also called 'Auntie Who Delivers Babies'. (Song Zi Niang Niang)<br><br><img src="http://www.gb.taoism.org.hk/taoist-immortal/image/a00432.jpg"></div>
