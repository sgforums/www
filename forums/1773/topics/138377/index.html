            <div class='col-md body'>Taoist seal and crossing the bridge ceremonies<br><br>In Taoist temples, they have seals for the respective deities. For example, Guan Yin temple will have a guan yin seal, cheng huang temple(temple of the City deity) will have a cheng huang seal.<br><br>Seals are symbol of power and authority.<br><br>Taoist priests, when they write petitions, talismans etc, will have their seals chopped on it. Different sects the priests belongs to, will have different seals.<br><br>The deities' seals represent the power and blessings from the deity. Chopping onto the shirt symbolizes the divine bestowing blessings on the person. It is out of goodwill, and nother sinister at all.<br><br>Just like every Emperor, magistrates, officials, they have seals. Just like every companies, govt bodies, they have seals. It is a symbol of authority and authentication, trust and power.<br><br>It wil be less superstitous and logical if we think like this.<br><br>'bridge crossing' ceremonies, are when temples are having celebrations, they wil engage taoist priests or medium(in tranced) to lead devotees and the public in crossing this wooden bridge. It is a ritual to avert disasters and bring blessings. Symbolizing the blessings from divines will help us cross over every obstacles in life. It certainly boast the morale of the devotees and give them comfort in life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi wisely_xu,<br><br>Thanks you so much for the great info! It is indeed very educational for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>One curious question pop up in my mind after reading your post:<br>Is there a reason why the deity seal must be stamped on the back of our shirt, at the topmost centre position?<br><br>Since the deity seal's mark symbolizes the divine bestowing blessings on the person, it should not matter where the seal's mark is. Having a seal's mark on the back of our shirt is very conspicuous (especially at the topmost central position) and wouldn't it be great if it can be stamped on less conspicuous part of our clothes, or even better still, stamp on our arms/hands (like those entry chops in disco/pubs) and I think the blessings we received will be even more greater because the seal's mark is directly on our body.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok. stamping on the shirt is a tradition taoist custom.<br><br>There is one rites on 'improving one's luck' in folk Taoism. Which require the Taoist to bring along the person's clothing.<br>Clothings that the person often wear, they represent the person as well as his or her daily lives. So it has a symbolic meaning to it.<br><br>stamping on the top, symbolizes the blessing showering from the divines on top. The seal is sacred and need to be place on a more prominent and higer position.<br><br>However, there are cases where some medium stamp on people's palm too.<br><br>The common practice is on the top of the shirt. Actually u can bring ur hse shirt instead of outing shirt. bring those u only wear at home mah. haha..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh i see. But why must be at the back but not at the front of the shirt huh?<br><br>Can i bring those shirt that have been chop before to chop again? Especially those shirts having chop marks that can't be completely washed off. (since you mentioned that the seal is sacred and must be on top, if a new seal is chop on the old chop, wouldn't it be unrespectful to the old chop)<br><br>Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its the more conventional way of having it on the back. u bow down when u pray mah. so it is better to have  it on ur back.<br><br>u can use the shirt again, but its best to be after a year and have it wash clean. one may ask the temple on this issue to double confirm.<br><br>it is not regarded as disrespect. dun worry. the act of stamping is a symbolic rite to bless the person. what impt is the divine power within.</div>
