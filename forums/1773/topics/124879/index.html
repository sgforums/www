            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>Cheng Huang Deity, is also known as City Deity. They are previously great men who had done alot to their society and country and thus, after they died, their spirits are honoured as divines and the Jade Emperor bestowed them the rank of city deity.<br><br>They are divines that crosses the yin and yang realm(netherworld and human realm).<br><br>In the mortal realm. City deities are able to bestow blessings to man and helps to avert disasters. They are like those magistrates in the past, in charge of a district or province. They are believed to be fair and righteous divines.<br><br>When a person died, his/her soul will report to the Earth Deity and He will submit the name/s to the City deity. After which He will send the soul to the respective place in netherworld. Thus during Service Rituals, a memo will be submited to City deity thru rituals, to allow spirits to come to the mortal world to recieve blessings and offerings.<br><br>As for da er ye bo, or aka Tua de ah pek, they are the hell guards of impermenances (hei bai wu chang).<br><br>They were previously righteous man, and Taoism actually has a story behind them. It is believed that they were good friends but were both sabotage and died. After their death, their spirits were promoted to be hell guards. as they were righteous and loyal during their lifetime.<br><br>Yup, actually they are more then 1 tua de ah pek. diff temples, their tua de ah pek may be different.different courts of hell got different tua de ah pek.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if one is righteous and upright, with a clear conciencous, i think we need not be afriad of them.<br><br>they are the yin divines, also known as divines of the netherworld. sort of like hell guards.<br><br>They are higher rank then the  OX head and Horse Face guards, but still, they are no in the 'management' side - which consist of the Lord OF feng Du, Lord Dongyue of Mt Tai Shan and the 10 courts of Yama. In heaven we have the ruling Jade Emperor and his subjects such as the North Dipper and Southern Constellation deities, the four heavenly ministers etc, who are in charged of the mortal world's big and small affairs.<br>Lord tai Yi of salvation, is similar to to di zang wang of buddhism, who is in charged of salvation btw.<br><br>Tua De Ah pek, in Taiwan is known as Seven and Eight Uncles also. They are active in Tang ki possessions and Tua Ah Pek is also famous to bestow windfall too.<br><br></div>
