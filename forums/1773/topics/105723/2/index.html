Supporting karma is that which comes near the peproductive karma and support it.It is either good or bad and it assists or maintains the action of the reproductive kamma,in the course of one's lifetime.Immediately after the conception till the death moment,this assists in giving health,waeth,happiness,etc.,to the person concerned.An immoral supportive karma,on the other hand,assists in giving pain,sorrow,etc,to the person born with an immoral reproductive karma as,ffor instance ,to a beast of burden.<br><br>c. Obstructive or counteractive karma<br><br>Obstructive or counteractive karma which,unlike the former,tends to weaken,interrupt and retard the fruition of the reproductive karma.For instance,a person born with a good reproductive karma,may lead a comfortable life by getting good,lodging,etc as a result of his good counteractive karma preventing the fruition of the evil reproductive karma.<br><br>Destructive Karma<br><br>d. According to the law of karma,the potential enegry of the reproductive karma could be nulified by a more powerful opposing karma of the past,which,seeking an opportunity,may quite unexpectedly operate.Just as a counteractive powerful force can obstruct the path of a flying arrow and bring it down to the ground.Such an action is called destructive karma which is more effective than the previous two,in that if not only obstructs but also destroy the whole force.The destructive karma may be either good or bad.<br><br>2. karma order to take effect<br><br>a. Weighty karma which either weighty or serious,may be either good or bad.It produces its result in this life or in the next for certain.If good,it is purely mental as in the case of the jhanas.Otherwise it is either vertal or bodily.The five kinds of weighty karma according to their gravity are:<br><br>(1) The creation of a schism in the holy sect.<br>(2) The wounding of the enlightened one.<br>(3) The murder of an Enlightened one.<br>(4) Matricide (Killing of mother)<br>(5) Parricide (killing of father)<br><br>b. Proximate Karma - Asanna or Death, is that which one does or remembers immediately before the dying moment. Owing to its significance in determining the future birth, the custom of reminding the dying person of his good deeds and making him do good acts on his death-bed still prevails in religions countries.<br><br>(i) Sometimes a bad person may die happily and receive a good birth, if fortunately he remembers or does a good act at the last moment. A story runs that a certain executioner, who casually happened to give some alms to the Venerable Sariputta, remembered this good act at the dying moment and was born in a state of bliss. This does not mean that although he enjoys a good birth, he will be exempted from the effects of the evil deeds, accumulated during his lifetime. They will have their due effects as the occasion arises.<br><br>(ii) At times a good person may die unhappily by suddenly remembering an evil act or by harbouring some unpleasant thoughts, Queen Mallika, the consort of King Kosala, led a righteous life, but at her death moment, she remembered a lie which she had uttered she had to suffer for about seven days in a state of misery.<br><br>The examples are only exceptional cases. Such reverse changes of birth account for the birth of virtuous children to vicious parents and of vicious children to virtuous parents. As a rule, the last thought-process is conditioned by the general conduct of a person.<br><br>HABITUAL KARMA<br><br>Habitual Karma is that which one habitually performs and recollects, and for which one has a great liking. Habits whether good or bad become second nature. They tend to form the character of a person. At leisure moments we often engage ourselves in our habitual thoughts and deeds. In the same way at the death-moment, unless influenced by other circumstances, as a rule, we recall such thoughts and deeds.<br><br>RESERVE OR CUMULATIVE KARMA<br><br>Reserve or cumulative karma refers to all actions that are done once and soon forgotten belong to this category. This is as it were the reserve fund of a particular being.<br><br>KARMA AND REBIRTH<br><br>Procedure with regard to Decease<br><br>The advent of death is fourfold, namely:<br><br>1. through the expiration of the age-limit<br>2. through the expiration of the (Reproductive) kammic force<br>3. through the (simultaneous) expiration of both age limit and kammic force<br>4. through (the intervention of) Destructive Karma<br><br>Illustration:<br><br>An oil lamp, for instance, may be extinguished owing to any of the following four causes, namely:<br><br>(1) the exhaustion of the wick;<br>(2) the exhaustion of oil;<br>(3) simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil; and<br>(4) some extraneous cause like the gust of a wind.<br><br>Death of a person may similarly be caused by any of the aforesaid four ways.<br><br>To those who are about to die, at the moment of death, by the power of Karma, one of the followings will present itself through any of the six-sense doors:-<br><br>(1) A Karma that produces rebirth in the subsequent birth enters (the mind door) according to circumstances.<br><br>(2) An object such as a pre-perceived form and the like, or anything that was instrumental in the performance of the Karma.<br><br>(3) A symbolic sign indicating where one would be going and experiencing in the subsequent birth place.<br><br>Death is not the complete annihilation of a being.<br>Death in one place means the birth in another place, just as, in conventional terms,<br>the rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in an other place.<br>Death is the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon.<br><br>Thus Death means the extinction of<br><br>- psychic and physical life<br>- heat; and<br>- consciousness of one individual in a particular existence.<br><br>anyone would like to share karma theories here..as is incomplete info<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>hi Oceanos<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>me not so young la...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet water_rat,<br><br>Nice to see you again in here...thanks for sharing through post.
