They shared everything and anything and spent lots of time together in and after school.<br><br>But...the friendship never develops more than friends. Diane kept a<br>secret... her admiration and love for Jack. She has her reasons for keeping it a secret.<br><br>FEAR! Fear of rejection...fear that he might not feel the same...fear that he might not want to be her best friend anymore...fear of losing someone that she can find comfort in. At least if she keeps her feelings to herself... she might still be able to spend time with him...and hopefully, he might be the one to tell her how he feels towards her.<br><br>Time passes by and soon...school days was over. Jack and Diane went separate ways. Jack continued his studies overseas while Diane got herself a job. They still kept in touch though...penned letters, sent each other photographs and mailed each other gifts. Diane longed for Jack to be back. She had decided that she<br>would have the courage to tell him her feelings once he's back. And then...out of the blue...the mails from Jack stopped coming.<br><br><span style="color: green;">to be continued ....... </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Add some salt to your coffee and see how it tastes like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><span style="color: brown;">The salty coffee</span></strong><br><br>He met her on a party, she was so outstanding, many guys chasing after her,while he was so normal, nobody paid attention to him.<br><br>At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him, she was surprised, but due to polite, she promised.<br><br>They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything, She felt uncomfortable, she thought, please, let me back home..s<br><br>Suddenly he asked the waiter: "<span style="color: blue;">Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee</span>."<br><br>Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red, but, still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it.<br><br>She asked him curiously: "<span style="color: violet;">Why you have this hobby?</span>"<br><br>He replied: "<span style="color: blue;">When I was a little boy, I was living near the sea, I like playing in the sea, I could felt the taste of the sea, salty and bite, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee. I will think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who still living there.</span>" Saying that, tears filled his eyes.<br><br>She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his homesick, he must be a man loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of home..<br><br>Then she also started to talk, talked about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story.<br><br>They continue to date. She found actually he was a man who meets all her demands: he was tolerance, kind hearted, warm, careful...he was such a good guy but she almost missed him!<br><br>Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story: "The princess married to the prince, then they were living the happy life..." And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked.<br><br>After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter which said:<br>"<span style="color: blue;">My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my whole life lie. This was the only lie I said to you----the salty coffee.<br><br>Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It's hard for me to change so I just go ahead.<br><br>I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything..<br><br>Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange bad taste but I have the salty coffee for my whole life since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you.<br><br>Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for the second time, I still want to know you and have you as my whole life wife, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again.</span>"<br><br>Her tears made the letter totally wet.<br><br>Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty<br>coffee?<br><br>"<span style="color: violet;">It's sweet.</span>"<br>She replied.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>
