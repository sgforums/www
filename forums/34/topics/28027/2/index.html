            <div class='col-md body'>[color= blue]During the years of the depression in a small southeastern Idaho community, I used to stop by Mr. Miller's roadside stand for farm-fresh produce as the season made it available. Food and money were still extremely scarce and bartering was used, extensively.<br><br>One particular day Mr. Miller was bagging some early potatoes for me. I noticed a small boy, delicate of bone and feature, ragged but clean, hungrily apprising a basket of freshly picked green peas. I paid for my potatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh green peas. I am a pushover for creamed peas and new potatoes.<br><br>Pondering the peas, I couldn't help overhearing the conversation between Mr. Miller and the ragged boy next to me. "Hello Barry, how are you today?"<br>"H'lo, Mr. Miller. Fine, thank ya. Jus' admirin' them peas ... sure look<br>good."<br>"They are good, Barry. How's your Ma?"<br>"Fine. Gittin' stronger alla' time."<br>"Good. Anything I can help you with?"<br>"No, Sir. Jus' admirin' them peas."<br>"Would you like to take some home?"<br>"No, Sir. Got nuthin' to pay for 'em with."<br>"Well, what have you to trade me for some of those peas?"<br>"All I got's my prize marble here."<br>"Is that right? Let me see it."<br>"Here 'tis. She's a dandy."<br>"I can see that. Hmmmm, only thing is this one is blue and I sort of go for red. Do you have a red one like this at home?"<br>"Not 'zackley .....but, almost."<br>"Tell you what. Take this sack of peas home with you and next trip this way let me look at that red marble."<br>"Sure will. Thanks, Mr. Miller."<br><br>Mrs. Miller, who had been standing nearby, came over to help me. With a smile she said: "There are two other boys like him in our community, all three are in very poor circumstances. Jim just loves to bargain with them for peas, apples, tomatoes or whatever. When they come back with their red marbles, and they always do, he decides he doesn't like red after all and he sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an orange one, perhaps."<br><br>I left the stand, smiling to myself, impressed with this man.<br><br>A short time later I moved to Colorado but I never forgot the story of this man, the boys and their bartering. Several years went by each more rapidthan the previous one. Just recently I had occasion to visit some old friends in that Idaho community and while I was there learned that Mr. Miller had died. They were having his viewing that evening and knowing my friends wanted to go, I agreed to accompany them. Upon our arrival at the mortuary we fell into line to meet the relatives of the deceased and to offer whatever words of comfort we could. Ahead of us in line were three<br>young men. One was in an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts, dark suits and white shirts ... very professional looking.<br><br>They approached Mrs. Miller, standing smiling and composed, by her husband's casket. Each of the young men hugged her, kissed her on the cheek, spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket. Her misty light blue eyes followed them as, one by one, each young man stopped briefly and placed his own warm hand over the cold pale hand in the casket. Each left the mortuary, awkwardly, wiping his eyes.<br><br>Our turn came to meet Mrs. Miller. I told her who I was and mentioned the story she had told me about the marbles. Eyes glistening she took my hand and led me to the casket. "Those three young men, who just left, were the<br>boys I told you about. They just told me how they appreciated the things Jim "traded" them. Now, at last when Jim could not change his mind about color or size ... they came to pay their debt. "We've never had a great deal of the wealth of this world," she confided, "but, right now, Jim would consider himself the richest man in Idaho."<br><br>With loving gentleness she lifted the lifeless fingers of her deceased<br>husband. Resting underneath were three, exquisitely shined, red marbles.<br><br>[color=dark blue]<span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Moral: We will not be remembered by our words, but by our kind deeds.

            <div class='col-md body'>There was once a guy who suffered from cancer... a cancer<br>that can't be treated. He was 18 years old and he could die anytime. All his<br>life, he was stuck in his house being taken cared by his mother. He never<br>went outside but he was sick of staying home and wanted to go out for once.<br><br>So he asked his mother and she gave him permission. He walked<br>down his block and found a lot of stores. He passed a CD store and<br>looked through the front door for a second as he walked. He stopped and went<br>back to look into the store.<br><br>He saw a young girl about his age and he knew it was love at first sight. He<br>opened the door and walked in, not looking at anything else but her. He<br>walked closer and closer until he was finally at the front desk where she<br>sat. She looked up and asked "Can I help you?" She smiled and he thought it<br>was the most beautiful smile he has ever seen before and wanted to kiss her<br>right there. He said "Uh... Yeah... Umm... I would like to buy a CD." He<br>picked one out and gave her money for it.<br><br>Would you like me to wrap it for you?" she asked, smiling<br>her cute smile again. He nodded and she went to the back. She came back with<br>the wrapped CD and gave it to him. He took it and walked out of the store.<br>He went home and from then on, he went to that store everyday and bought a<br>CD, and she wrapped it for him. He took the CD home and put it in his<br>closet. He was still too shy to ask her out and he really wanted to but he<br>couldn't. His mother found out about this and told him to just ask her.<br><br>So the next day, he took all his courage and went to the store. He bought a<br>CD like he did everyday and once again she went to the back of the store and<br>came back with it wrapped. He took it and when she wasn't looking, he left<br>his phone number on the desk and ran out...<br><br>RRRRRING!!! The mother picked up the phone and said, "Hello?"<br><br>It was the girl!!! She asked for the boy and the mother started to cry and<br>said, "You don't know? He passed away yesterday... The line was quiet except<br>for the cries of the boy's mother.<br><br>Later in the day. The mother went into the boy's room because she wanted to<br>remember him. She thought she would start by looking at his clothes. So she<br>opened the closet.<br><br>She was face to face with piles and piles and piles of unopened CDs. She was<br>surprised to find all those CDs and she picked one up and sat down on the<br>bed and she started to open one.<br><br>Inside, there was a CD and as she took it out of the wrapper, out fell a<br>piece of paper. The mother picked it up and started to read it.<br><br>It said: Hi... I think you are really cute. Do u wanna go out<br>with me? Love, Jacelyn<br><br>The mother opened another CD...<br><br>Again there was a piece of paper. It said: Hi... I think you are<br>really cute. Do u wanna go out with me? Love, Jacelyn<br><br>Love is... when you've had a huge fight but then decide to put aside<br>your egos, hold hands and say, "I Love You"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>HE works in mysterious ways</strong><br>A woman received a phone call that her daughter was very sick with a fever. She left work and stopped by the pharmacy for some medication for her daughter. She returned to her car to find she had locked her keys inside. She had to get home to her sick daughter, and did not know what to do. She called her home to the baby sitter, and was told her daughter was getting worse.<br>"You might find a coat hanger and use that to open the door." Suggested the baby sitter.<br>The woman found an old rusty coat hanger on the ground, as if someone else had locked their keys in their car. Then she looked at the hanger and said,<br>"I don't know how to use this."<br>She bowed her head and asked God for help. An old rusty car pulled up, driven by a dirty, greasy, bearded man with a biker skull rag on his head. The woman thought,<br>"Great God. This is what you sent to help me?"<br>But she was desperate, and thankful. The man got out of his car and asked if he could help.<br>"Yes, my daughter is very sick. I must get home to her. Please, can you use this hanger to unlock my car."<br>"Sure."<br>He walked over to the car and in seconds the car was opened. She hugged the man and through her tears she said,<br>"Thank you so much ...You are a very nice man."<br>"Lady, I ain't a nice man. I just got out of prison for grand theft auto."<br>The woman hugged the man again and cried out loud,<br>"Thank you God for sending me a professional!"</div>

Saying that it has got to do with family background, &amp; that Gin will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.<br><br>Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrel very often. Thou Gin love the guy deeply, but she always asks him: "How deep is your love for me?"<br><br>As the guy is not good with his words, this often causes Gin to be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, Gin often vent her anger on him. As for him... he only endures it in silence.<br><br>After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to further his studies in overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to Gin: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?" she agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married. So before he leaves, they got engaged.<br><br>Gin went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas,<br>continuing his studies. They sent their love thru emails &amp; phone calls. Thou it's hard, but both never thought of giving up.<br><br>One day, Gin was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realised that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. She has lost her voice....<br><br>The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to loss her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry, it's still just silence cry that accompanied her.<br><br>Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart every time it rang.<br><br>She does not wish to let the guy know. &amp; Not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.<br><br>With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent<br>millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phone alls, all that Gin<br>could do, besides crying, is still crying....<br><br>The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything &amp; be happy.<br><br>With a new environment, Gin learns sign language &amp; started a new life.   Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her fren came &amp; told her that he's back. She asked her fren not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't any more news of him.<br><br>A year has passed &amp; her fren came with an envelope, containing an<br>invitation card for the guy's wedding.<br><br>Gin was shattered. When she opens the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her fren whatÂ’s going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.<br><br>He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to learn<br>sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. Gin finally smiled.<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">thereforE~.....*Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know how to Give **Treat every moment as is it's the last day, then you'll know how to treasure*</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Something worth reading through..... it makes you understand a lot of  things..... enjoy!</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>My husband was an engineer. Since I met him, he was always an unflappable rock in my life. I knew he always had his feet firmly planted on the  ground, and it seemed that no matter what else went crazy, he would be the one constant.<br><br>Three years of romance, and two years of marriage later, I got tired.<br><br>He was the most unromantic man I know. He never bought me flowers, he never surprised me, and nothing changed in our marriage.    After some time, I finally found the courage to tell him that I wanted to leave him. He just sat there, speechless. My heart froze... what kind of man<br>was I married to that didn't even know what to say to make me stay?<br><br>After a while, he spoke, "What can I do to change your mind?".<br><br>"I will  stay if you can give me a good answer to this question," I replied coldly. "If I asked for a flower that grew on a cliff, and you knew that getting it for me means certain death, would you get it for me?".<br><br>His face grew troubled.<br><br>"Can I give you an answer tomorrow morning?" he asked.<br><br>Hearing that kind of answer, my heart died. I knew that I could never be happy with a man who<br>couldn't even give me a answer straight away.<br><br>The next morning, when I woke up, he was missing. In the living room,  under a warm glass of milk, was a note. My eyes grew misty as I read it...<br><br>"Dear, I have my answer. I will never pick the flower for you if it  meant certain death. But before you leave, I hope you can give me a chance to give you my reasons....<br><br>You will always sit in front of the computer and type about for the whole day, but everytime you will end up in tears cause your formatting will  always go all over the place... I need my fingers, to do the formatting for you, so your tears will become smiles.<br><br>You like to travel, but would always get lost... I need my eyes, so that I can bring you to the nicest places on earth.  Everytime you leave the house, you would always forget your keys... I need my legs, so that I can run home to open the door for you.<br><br>You never knew how to take care of yourself... I need my hands to help you get rid of the  pesky white hair you hate so much when you grow old, to trim your nails, to feed you.  So you see, that's why I can't pick the flower for you.<br><br>Until I find  someone who loves you more than I do, I will need my body to take care of you.<br>If you accept my reasons, then open the door, where I will be waiting with your favourite muffin."<br><br>With tears streaming from my eyes, I opened the door, and there he stood, with a extremely  worried look on his face. He still had nothing to say, but just stood there waving the packet he had in his hand in front of me.<br><br>And then I knew for a fact that I will never find another man who will ever love me as much as he does.  Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean that they don't love you with all they have...<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: darkblue;">Dearie, I love you... </span><img src="http://skins.hotbar.com/skins/mailskins/em/033102/033102kiss_1_prv.gif"></div>
