            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: brown;">Oreo Psycho-Personality Test </span></strong><br><br>Psychologists have discovered that the manner in which people eat Oreo cookies provides great insight into their personalities. Choose which method best describes your favorite method of eating Oreos:<br><br>1. The whole thing all at once.<br>2. One bite at a time<br>3. Slow and methodical nibbles examining the results of each bite<br>afterwards.<br>4. In little feverish nibbles.<br>5. Dunked in some liquid (milk, coffee...).<br>6. Twisted apart, the inside, then the cookie.<br>7. Twisted apart, the inside, and toss the cookie.<br>8. Just the cookie, not the inside.<br>9. I just like to lick them, not eat them.<br>10. I don't have a favorite way because I don't like Oreos.<br><br>Your Personality:<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">1. The whole thing </span></strong>- this means you consume life with abandon, you are fun to be with, exciting, carefree with some hint of recklessness. You are totally irresponsible. No one should trust you with their children.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">2. One bite at a time. </span></strong>You are lucky to be one of the 5.4 billion other people who eat their Oreos this very same way. Just like them, you lack imagination, but that's OK, not to worry, you're normal.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">3. Slow and Methodical. </span></strong>You follow the rules. You're very tidy and orderly. You're very meticulous in every detail with every thing you do to the Point of being anal retentive and irritating to others. Stay out of the fast lane if you're only going to go the speed limit<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">4. Feverish Nibbles. </span></strong>Your boss likes you because you get your work done quickly. You always have a million things to do and never enough time to do them. Mental break downs run in your family. Valium and Ritalin would do you good.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">5. Dunked. </span></strong>Every one likes you because you are always upbeat. You like to  sugar coat unpleasant experiences and rationalize bad situations in to good ones. You are in total denial about the shambles you call a life. You have a propensity towards narcotic addiction.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">6. Twisted apart, the inside, and then the cookie. </span></strong>You have a highly curious nature. You take pleasure in breaking things apart to find out how they work, though not always able to put them back together, so you destroy all the evidence of your activities. You deny your involvement when things go wrong. You are a compulsive liar and exhibit deviant, if not criminal,behavior.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">7. Twisted apart, the inside, and then toss the cookie. </span></strong>You are good at business and take risk that pay off. You take what you want and throw the rest away. You are greedy, selfish, mean, and lack feelings for others. You should be ashamed of yourself. But that's OK, you don't care, you got yours.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">8. Just the cookie, not the inside. </span></strong>You enjoy pain.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">9. I just like to lick them, not eat them. </span></strong>Stay away from small furry<br>animals and seek professional medical help- immediately.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">10. I don't have a favorite way, I don't like Oreo cookies. </span></strong>You probably come from a rich family, and like to wear nice things, and go to up-scale restaurants. You are particular and fussy about the things you buy, own, and wear. Things have to be just right. You like to be pampered. You are a prima donna. There's just no pleasing you.<br></div>

Yes (G-type) B. No (F-type)<br><br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>The Result<br><br>A-type Cinderella Type<br>Just like Cinderella, you were the heroine of a beautiful and happy love<br>story in your former life. This does not mean that you were born with<br>this privilege or that you necessarily had this happiness until the end of<br>your life. You actually witnessed the harshness of reality as child,<br>including the loss of your parents and poverty. But all this darkness disappeared<br>the moment you met the love of your life and a new bright light started to<br>shine toward your way. You ultimately gained happiness and honor through love.<br>Both of you genuinely loved each other and enjoyed a blissful life for a<br>very long time. It is just natural that this genuine life in your previous existence can<br>only be a blessing in this present moment. This may be the opportunity<br>to work for charity by helping out other people in need and to be thankful.<br><br>B-type The Charitable type<br>You were the devoted lover in your former existence that dedicated your<br>whole being to the object of affection. When you fell in love, you forgot<br>about everything else including your own self. You experienced a lot of pain<br>because many people took advantage of your kindness. All your lovers<br>were beautiful people but they possessed narcissist qualities,which was the<br>result of your breakups. Their selfishness never allowed them to return the<br>love that you continuously provided for them. But you never despised<br>them for the wounds they left on you. What you should do in this life-time is<br>to become more sensible, rational, and calculative, so that you will not have<br>to endure so much pain as you did in the past. Don't just settle for anyone<br>who crosses your path but wait patiently for someone who will provide you<br>with a reciprocal love.<br><br>C-type The Lascivi! ous type<br>You were a very fickle person in your previous life, who could not stay<br>with one partner for a long time. Love was something you had to experience<br>through as many people as possible and only then were you happy a person.<br>You met many, diverse people whom you shared an intimate relationship with.<br>Although you were an amorous lover, you possessed cold and rational<br>mind. It gave you this power of never being hurt by someone. It will be<br>difficult to settle down completely for you unless you meet a very<br>charismatic person who will capture your entire heart. And a journey for you<br>would not completely end with marriage either.<br><br>D-type The Reckless type<br>You were the center of a love triangle or an immoral love that was destined<br>to end tragically. Your rash and independent spirit set the stage for a love<br>story like this. You were an egocentric character who broke many people's<br>hearts. In this way, you were much like the C-type that was previously<br>mentioned. You moved on from one person to another as soon as that spark<br>or passion for you faded. A person who existed as this type in the past is<br>bound to be affected by these remnant qualities today. This is why it is<br>vital to appreciate the other person in your relationship now and to<br>become more mature. Getting rid of your selfish desires may be the key to happy<br>relationship for you.<br><br>E-type The Romeo and Juliet type.<br>You are one of the few people who experienced the most passionate love<br>affair in your former life. It was love at first sight and both of you could<br>not think of anything else during the day than to dream about each other.<br>It was a Romeo and Juliet love affair, which may not have ended in disaster<br>just like in the story.Your families may even have been very accepting<br>about your relationship. But the likelihood of a passionate love increases the<br>more obstacles are between the two lovers.But the affection tends to fade<br>when there is no conflicting element involved. Therefore, it is important<br>for you to be more patient in your present relationship. The challenge is<br>to keep that passion going by constantly introducing new and interesting ideas.<br><br>F-type The Plain type<br>You did not find love through your own actions but with the help of other<br>people. You were in your own comfort zone, so that it was not necessary<br>for you to find someone special. This is why you were far away from experiencing<br>a fervent love affair. Everybody accepted your relationship with your<br>partner and stability may be have been the pivotal characteristic of<br>your love. Many people would not even consider this peaceful and simple<br>relationship to be love but it may just be the true essence. You may<br>feel perfectly comfortable with an arranged marriage.<br><br>G-type The Abusive type<br>There is no human being who perfect and therefore a certain contradiction<br>exists within us. Thus, an internal conflict between cruelty and kindness is apparent in us. You were familiar with this conflict in your previous life, where mistreatment<br>was used on people. There was a lot of anger in you and this may be a reason<br>why you were open to challenges without a blink of an eye. You often found this sardonic pleasure when you made a person feel sad or perplexed. Monotony did not exist in your vocabulary and so you looked for excitement. A little child exists in you<br>that is waiting for stability and you have shot at finding love when you find the person who is able toprovide this comfort for you.<br><br>H-type The Glass Marble type<br>You were a purely naive person who was scared to be hurt. This led you to<br>love a person from afar but the chance that you came together was very slim.<br>You were a sociable person but oddly enough, you became the shy and quiet<br>person in front of the person you liked. The painful event occurred the day<br>your object of affection became another person's mate and moved to another<br>far away place. You have to accept the fact that you will not see a relationship in the future if you don't start gaining some courage to make that crucial advance. You can start with taking subtle steps toward that person.</div>
