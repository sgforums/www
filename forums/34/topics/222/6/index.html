When they get there, St. Peter says, "We only have one rule here in heaven ...don't step on the ducks."<br><br>So they enter heaven, and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck, and although they try their best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on one.<br><br>Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says, "Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity with this ugly man!"<br><br>The next day, the second woman accidentally steps on a duck, and along come St. Peter, who doesn't miss a thing, and with him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same punishment as the first woman.<br><br>The third woman has observed all this and, not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man, is very, VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months without stepping on any<br>ducks, but one day St. Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on ... very tall, tan, muscular, and with good hair. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word.<br><br>The woman remarks, "I wonder what I did to deserve<br>being with you for all of eternity?" And the guy says, "Well, I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck."<br></div>

Did he attend church?<br>Was he generous? Did he give money to the poor, to<br>charities? Did he do any good deeds? Did he help his neighbor?<br><br>The man answered, "No".<br><br>St. Peter said, "Not good, not good."<br>Exasperated, St. Peter says, "Look, everybody<br>does something nice sometime. Work with me,<br>I'm trying to help. Now think!"<br><br>The man says, "There was this little old lady. I<br>came out of a store and found her surrounded by<br>a dozen Hell's Angels. They had taken her purse and were<br>shoving her, taunting and abusing her. I got so mad I<br>threw my bags down, fought my way through the crowd and<br>got her purse back. I helped her to her feet.<br>Then I went up to the biggest, meanest biker<br>and told him how despicable, cowardly and mean<br>he was and then I spit in his face."<br><br>"Wow, said St. Peter,<br>"That's impressive.

            <div class='col-md body'>A little boy about 12 years old is walking down the street<br>dragging a flattened frog on a string behind him. He came up tothe<br>doorstep of a house of ill repute and knocked on the door.<br><br>When the Madam answered it, she saw the little<br>boy and asked what he wanted. He said, "I want to have sex with one of the<br>women inside. I have the money to buy it, and I'm not leaving until I get it." The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in.<br><br>Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked. He<br>asked, "Do any of the girls have any diseases?" Of course the Madam said no.<br>He said, "I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after<br>making love with Amber.<br>THAT'S the girl I want."<br><br>Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on<br>the right. He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him.<br><br>Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door. The Madam stopped him and asked, "Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?"<br><br>He said, "Well if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with a baby-sitter.After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of cute little boys.She will then get the disease that I just caught. When Mum and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll give her one in the car and he'll catch<br>the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitter's, he and Mum will go to bed andhave sex, and Mum will catch it.In the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with Mum and catch the disease, and<br>HE'S the bastard who ran over my FROG!"</div>

The genie clapped his hands with a deafening crash, and immediately the entire sea turned into the finest brew ever sampled by mortals.<br><br>Simultaneously, the genie vanished. Only the gentle lapping of beer on the hull broke the stillness as the men considered their circumstances.<br><br>One man looked disgustedly at the other whose wish had been granted. After a long, tension filled moment, he spoke: "Nice going idiot! Now we're going to have to piss in the boat!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was getting a little crowded in Heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was, that in order to get into Heaven,you had to have a really awful day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.<br><br>The next day at 12.01pm, the first person came to the gates of<br>Heaven.The Angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, said to the man, "Before I can let you in, you have to tell me what was happening in your life the day on which you died."<br><br>"No problem," the man said. "I came home to my 25th floor apartment during my lunch hour and found my wife half-naked. I thought she was having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. Immediately, I began searching for him. My wife was shouting at me as I searched the apartment. Just as I was going to give up the search, I looked out onto the balcony and saw there was a man hanging over the edge by his fingertips!<br><br>Well, I ran out onto the balcony and jumped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But he landed in some tress and bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die! I was so mad that I went back inside to fetch something that I could throw at him. Strangely, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. So I unplugged it, pushed it to the balcony and tipped over the side. It fell the 25 storeys and crushed the man.Unfortunately all this excitement was too much and I had a heart attack and died instantly!!"<br><br>The Angel sat and thought for a moment. Technically, the man did have a bad day. It was crime of passion. So he announced, "Okay, sir.Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven," and let him in.<br><br>A few seconds later the next person came up. The Angel said, "Before I can et you enter, I need to know what was happening to you on the day you died."<br><br>"No problem," said the second man. "But you are not going to believe this!!" "I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure, so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I think I got a little carried away,slipped and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But suddenly,this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, swears at me, and jumps on my fingers! Well, I fell and just before I hit the ground, I landed in some trees or bushes which I broke my fall. But I didn't die immediately.<br><br>As I am lying there, looking up, unable to move, and in great pain, I notice the crazy man push his REFRIGERATOR off the balcony. It falls 25 floors and lands on top of me - killing me instantly!"<br><br>The Angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. "I think I like this new policy," he says to himself. "Okay," say the Angel to the second man. "Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven." And he lets the man in.<br><br>A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gates. The Angel says,"Please tell me how you died."<br>The third man says, "You will never believe this. I am naked,hiding inside a refrigerator................."<br><br></div>

Finally, after many visits, the doc sat down<br>and said, "You know, John, why don't you try something unusual. Why don't you do<br>something that I always do when I have a headache like that. I phone my wife and tell<br>her I'm coming home; she waits for me in the bedroom, with her blouse off, and I nestle<br>my head between those two beautiful breasts and soon the headache disappears!<br>You ought to try something like that--I don't know what else to do for you. It wouldn't hurt."<br><br>"Well I might try something like that," said John.<br><br>A month later, John is back in the clinic, seeing another doctor on another unrelated matter,<br>and he and Dr. Smith pass each other in the hallway. "John!" says the doc, "Haven't seen<br>you in a while! How's those headaches?"<br><br>"Great! They're all gone! Thanks for your advice!" said John.<br>"Hey, that's fantastic!" said Dr. Smith, walking on down the hallway.<br><br>"Say, Doc!" yelled John, down the hall, "Nice place you got there!"<br></div>
