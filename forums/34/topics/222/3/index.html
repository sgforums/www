            <div class='col-md body'>#1 Genie and the 2 Golfers<br><br>A guy is golfing with his pretty wife, who is a very poor golfer.<br>On the first hole she sends the ball smashing through the window of a nearby house.<br><br>The couple goes to the house to investigate the damage and finds the door open. They go inside<br>and find a man sitting on a couch next to the broken window. There is also a broken oil-lamp.<br><br>The husband asks: "Did we break that too?"<br>"Yes", replies the man.<br><br>"Sorry. Do you live here?" the husband asks.<br>"No, actually, I'm a genie." The man states. "I was sleeping in that lamp when your golf ball smashed it.<br>Now, I'm supposed to give you three wishes, but I'm keeping one for myself since you smashed my lamp.<br>OK, what'll they be?"<br><br>The husband thinks a moment: "First, make my wife a better golfer."<br>"Poof! She's a better golfer", the genie announces.<br><br>"Second, I want a million bucks a week for life."<br>"Poof! you get a million bucks a week", the genie announces.<br><br>"Good. OK, what do you want?" asks the husband.<br>"For my wish. I want to have my way with your pretty wife," grins the genie.<br><br>"Hmmm", the husband hesitated, "I guess that's all right. After all, she broke your lamp,<br>you've made us rich, and our golf games will be much more interesting. Go ahead."<br><br>So the genie and the wife retire the bedroom. After several steamy hours the "genie" says to the wife:<br>"How long have you known your husband?"<br>"Ten years," she replies.<br>"How long has he believed in this genie stuff?"<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>#2 Ding Dong<br><br>A woman's husband has died. After a few months, she decides she wants a new one.<br>She submits a classified ad as follows: "Widow looking for a new husband.

She opens the door and a man without<br>any arms and or legs is sitting in a wheel chair.<br><br>"Can I help you?" she says.<br>"I'm here about your ad in the paper."<br><br>"Which ad is that?"<br>"The one looking for a husband."<br><br>She says, "Uhm, well, there were certain criteria..."<br>"Yes, I know. Obviously, I could never beat you... I have no arms."<br><br>"Well, yes, I see that... but there were other criteria."<br>"And, as you can see, I could never run around on you...

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: orange;">How true is this?<br><br>Is this happening to you???<br><br>Something to keep you smiling,  advise from Helpdesk, see below:</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Dear Tech Support:<br><br>Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slow-down in the performance of flowers and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs such as Romance 9.9 and Mr. Fix It 4.2 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes<br>the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do?<br><br>Signed,<br>Desperate</span><br><br>+++++++++++++++<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Dear Desperate:<br><br>First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to enter the command: C:\THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then automatically run applications Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create Snoring Loudly<br>WAV files. DO NOT install Mother-in-Law 1.2 or another Boyfriend program.<br><br>These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.<br>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.<br><br>Good luck,<br>Tech Support</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Keys To Business Success...</strong><br><br>1. Never walk down the hall without a document in your hands. People with documents in their hands look like hardworking employees heading for important meetings. People with nothing in their hands look like they're heading for the cafeteria. People with the newspaper in their hands look like they're heading for the bathroom. Above all, make sure you carry loads of stuff home with you at night, thus generating the false impression that you work longer hours than you do.<br><br>2. Use computers to look busy. Any time you use a computer, it looks like work to the casual observer. You can send and receive personal e-mail, calculate your finances and generally have a blast without doing anything remotely related to work. These aren't exactly the societal benefits that everybody from the computer revolution expected but they're not bad either. When you get caught by your boss--and you will get caught--your best defense is to claim you're teaching yourself to use the new software, thus saving valuable training dollars. You're not a loafer, you're a self-starter. Offer to show your boss what you learned. That will make your boss scurry away like a frightened salamander.<br><br>3. Messy desk. Top management can get away with a clean desk. For the rest of us, it looks like you're not working hard enough. Build huge piles of documents around your workspace. To the observer, last year's work looks the same as today's work; it's volume that counts. Pile them high and wide. If you know somebody is coming to your cubicle, bury the document you'll need halfway down in an existing stack and rummage for it when he/she arrives.<br><br>4. Voice mail. Never answer your phone if you have voice mail. People don't call you just because they want to give you something for nothing--they call because they want YOU to do work for THEM. That's to way to live. Screen all your calls through voice mail. If somebody leaves a voice mail message for you and it sounds like impending work, respond during lunch hour. That way, you're hardworking and conscientious even though you're being a devious weasel. If you diligently employ the method of screening incoming calls and then returning calls when nobody is there, this will greatly increase the odds that they will give up or look for a solution that doesn't involve you.<br><br>The sweetest voice mail message you can ever hear is "Ignore my last message. I took care of it." If your voice mailbox has a limit on the number of messages it can hold, make sure you reach that limit frequently. One way to do that is to never erase any incoming messages. If that takes too long, send yourself a few messages. Your callers will hear a recorded message that says, "Sorry, this mailbox is full"--a sure sign that you are a hardworking employee in high demand.<br></span>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tech Support,<br><br>Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of new space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure.<br><br>In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where it monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Drunken Boys Night 2.5 and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected.<br><br>I cannot seem to keep wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run some of my other favorite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall does not work on this program.<br><br>Can you please help me !!!???<br><br>Thanks,<br>A TROUBLED USER<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>Dear TROUBLED USER,<br><br>This is a very common problem men complain about, but is mostly due to a primary misconception. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by it's creator to run everything.<br><br>It is unlikely you would be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0. Hidden operating files within your system would cause Girlfriend 7.0 to emulate Wife 1.0 so nothing is gained. It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this.<br><br>Some have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than the original system. Look in your manual under "Warnings- Alimony/Child support". I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and deal with the situation.<br><br>I suggest installing background application program C:\YES DEAR to alleviate software augmentation. Having installed Wife 1.0 myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Partnership Faults (GPFs). You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of their cause. The best course of action will be to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE.

The husband, although very much in love, could not wait to go out on the town and party with his old buddies. So, he said to his new wife,<br>Â“Honey, IÂ’ll be right back...Â”<br>Â“Where are you going, coochy cooh...?Â” asked the wife.<br>Â“IÂ’m going to the bar, pretty face. IÂ’m going to have a beer.Â”<br>Â“You want a beer, my love?Â”<br>She opened the door of the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc. The husband did not know what to do, and the only thing that he could think of saying was,<br>Â“Yes, loolie loolie...but at the bar...you know...they have frozen glasses...Â”<br>He did not get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by saying,<br>Â“You want a frozen glass, puppy face?Â”<br>She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it. The husband, looking a bit pale, said,<br>Â“Yes, tootsie roll, but at the bar they have those hors dÂ’oeuvres that are really delicious...  I wonÂ’t be long. IÂ’ll be right back. I promise. Okay?Â”<br>Â“You want hors dÂ’oeuvres, poochi pooh?Â”<br>She opened the oven and took out 15 dishes of different hors dÂ’oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.<br>Â“But sweet honey...at the bar...you know... thereÂ’s swearing, dirty words and all that...Â”<br>Â“You want dirty words, cutie pie?...<br>Â“LISTEN, DICKHEAD! DRINK YOUR FUCKING BEER IN YOUR GOD-DAMN FROZEN MUG AND EAT YOUR MOTHER FUCKING SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!  GOT IT ASSHOLE!Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Four lessons to learn for the day</span></strong><br><br>A young executive was leaving the office at 6 p.m. then he found the CEO standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his hand.<br>Â“Listen,Â” said the CEO, Â“this is a very sensitive and important document, and my secretary has left. Can you make this thing work?Â”<br>Â“Certainly,Â” said the young executive.<br>He turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and pressed the start button.<br>Â“Excellent, excellent!Â” said the CEO as his paper disappeared inside the machine. Â“I just need one copy.Â”<br><br><strong>Lesson I - Never, never assume that your BOSS knows everything.</strong><br><br>A crusty old man walked into a bank and said to the teller at the window.<br>Â“I want to open a damn account.Â”<br>To which the astonished woman replied,<br>Â“I beg your pardon, sir, I must have misunderstood you. What did you say?Â”<br>Â“Listen up bitch! I said, I want to open a damn account right now!Â”<br>Â“IÂ’m very sorry sir, but we do not tolerate that kind of language in this bank.Â”<br>Having said this, the teller left the window and went over to the bank manager to tell him about her problem customer. They both returned and the manager asked the old geezer,<br>Â“What seems to be the problem here?Â”<br>Â“ThereÂ’s no damn problem, sonny,Â” the elderly man said. Â“I just won 50 million bucks in the damn lottery and I want to open a damn account in this damn bank!Â”<br>Â“I see,Â” said the manager thoughtfully. Â“And youÂ’re saying that this bitch here is giving you a hard time?Â”<br><br><strong>Lesson II - If you are RICH, you can get away with almost anything.</strong><br><br>An American and a Japanese were sitting on the plane on the way to L.A. when the American turned to the Japanese and asked,<br>Â“What kind of Â–ese are you?Â”<br>The Japanese confused, replied,<br>Â“Sorry but I donÂ’t understand what you mean.Â”<br>The American repeated, Â“What kind of -ese are you?Â”<br>Again, the Japanese was confused over the question. The American, now irritated, then yelled,<br>Â“What kind of -ese are you ... Are you a Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc...?Â”<br>Â“Oh, I am a Japanese.Â”<br>A while later the Japanese turned to the American and asked,<br>Â“What kind of Â‘keyÂ’ are you?Â”<br>The American, frustrated, yelled,<br>Â“What do you mean what kind of -key am I?!Â”<br>Â“Are you a Yankee, donkee, or monkee?Â”<br><br><strong>Lesson III - Never insult anyone.</strong><br><br>There were these four guys, a Russian, a German, an American and a French, who found this small genie bottle. When they rubbed the bottle, a genie appeared. Thankful that the four guys had released him out of the bottle, he said,<br>Â“Next to you all are four swimming pools, I will give each of you a wish. When you run towards the pool and jump, you shout what you want the pool of water to become, then your wish will come true.Â”<br>The French wanted to start. He ran towards the pool, jumped and shouted,<br>Â“WINE!Â”<br>The pool immediately changed into a pool of wine. The Frenchman was so happy swimming and drinking from the pool. Next is the RussianÂ’s turn, he did the same and shouted,<br>Â“VODKA!Â”<br>And immersed himself into a pool of vodka. The German was next and he jumped and shouted,<br>Â“BEER!Â”<br>He was so contented with his beer pool. The last is the American. He was running towards the pool when suddenly he steps on a banana peel. He slipped towards the pool and shouted,<br>Â“SHIT!Â”<br><br><strong>Lesson IV - Think twice before you say something, because sometimes accidents do happen. </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><strong>How to Lie to Your Bathroom Weighing Scale</strong></span><br><br>1. Weigh yourself with clothes on, after dinner ... as well as in the morning, without clothes, before breakfast, because it's nice to see how much weight you've lost overnight.<br>2. Never weigh yourself with wet hair.<br>3. When weighing, remove everything, including glasses. In this case, blurred vision is an asset. Don't forget the earrings, these things can weigh at least a pound.<br>4. Use cheap scales only, never the medical kind, because they are always five pounds off... to your advantage.<br>5. Always go to the bathroom first.<br>6. Stand with arms raised, making pressure on the scale lighter.<br>7. Don't eat or drink in the morning until AFTER you've weighed in, completely naked, of course.<br>8. Weigh yourself after a haircut; this is good for at least half a pound of hair (hopefully).<br>9. Exhale with all your might BEFORE stepping onto the scale (air has to weigh something, right?).<br>10. Start out with just one foot on the scale, then holding onto the towel rack in front of you, slowly edge your other foot on and slowly let off of the rack. Admittedly, this takes time, but it's worth it. You will weigh at least two pounds less than if you'd stepped on normally.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Singapore National Car...<br><br>PRESS RELEASE<br><br>Kia Motors of Korea and Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation have announced plans to enter into a joint venture project to design and build Singapore's first national car, and are to incorporate a company here with 50-50 ownership.<br><br>The new car company will be called KiaSu Motors Singapore Pte Ltd. Company insiders are excited about the project, which has secretly been in the works for years. "We're expecting thousands of KiaSu customers" said a Kia executive. "All KiaSu cars will be specially-designed to meet the needs of Singaporean motorists." Asked to reveal some of the features expected on the first KiaSu model, the executive said: "Er, better not. What if I lose my job?"<br><br>Sources from Suzuki had more to say, however. "For years, Singapore's best-selling car has been the Nissan Sunny. We'll just copy that car and watch the suckers queue up for days in advance outside our showroom," said Project Manager Tan Wah Low. But the KiaSu car will outdo the Sunny in various important ways, boasted Tan. While the Nissan has a 1596cc engine, the KiaSu will have one that is exactly 1600cc in size, the maximum that would allow it to fall in the Category A COE bracket.<br><br>To draw needless attention to its superiority, the Singapore car will also be launched as the 'KiaSu Sunnier'. In order to reduce costs, the Sunnier will also do away with the need for superfluous features found on the Nissan Sunny and other cars, such as turn signals, side and rear-view mirrors, and rear seatbelts, which local motorists do not use.<br><br>"Think of the convenience," said Tan smugly. "When you drive a KiaSu, you need never adjust your mirrors or bother to signal before making a turn. Why pay for things you never use?" Aside from that, the KiaSu Sunnier's main selling point will be a special windscreen that no local driver would want to be without.<br><br>"We are working on a giving one corner of the windscreen special optical distortions. When you place your parking coupon under this part of the windscreen, it becomes <strong>almost impossible to tell from the outside if you have torn off the coupon tabs completely or merely bent them backwards</strong>," revealed Tan with glee.<br></div>
