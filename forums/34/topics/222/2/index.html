            <div class='col-md body'>Well, driving in Singapore can be stressful, on you... and your car. It is important to have your car maintained regularly ... Especially having the oil changed. OK, here is a handy guide for ladies and gents on how to change the oil in your car.<br><br>Guide for Women<br>1. When the mileage reaches 5000 KM since the last oil change, tell your husband, and he will tell you to go to the nearest petrol kiosk.<br>2. Give your keys to the mechanic, tell him to take care of your baby and drink a cup of coffee.<br>3. 12 minutes 37 seconds later, pay with your credit card and leave with a properly maintained vehicle.<br>Money Spent<br>$40.00 Oil Change<br>$1.00 Coffee<br>Total: $41.00<br><br>Guide for Men<br>1. Go to auto cum hardware-shop and write and lay out $80 cash for oil, filter, sawdust, hand cleaner and scented tree.<br>2. Discover that the used oil container is full. Instead of taking it back to shop to recycle, dump in the drain in the garage ... if none, in the kitchen sink.<br>3. Open a beer and drink it.<br>4. Spend 30 minutes looking for jack. Find jack under kid's pedal car. Jack up car.<br>5. In frustration, open another beer and drink it.<br>6. Look for 9/16 box-end wrench.<br>7. Give up and use crescent wrench.<br>8. Unscrew drain plug. Yell "Oh F**k" when the crescent wrench slips and you lacerate your finger.<br>9. Place drain pan under engine.<br>10. Drop drain-plug in pan of hot oil; get hot oil on you in process. Yell out "F**king bastard".<br>11. Have another beer while oil is draining.<br>12. Look for oil filter wrench.<br>13. Call wife to see if she wants to give you a blow-job. Yell " Aw F**k" when you get the answer.<br>14. Have another beer, Clean up.<br>15. Give up; poke oil filter with screwdriver and twist it off.<br>16. Beer.<br>17. Buddy shows up; finish case with him. Finish oil change tomorrow.<br>18. Next day, drag pan full of old oil out from underneath car.<br>19. Throw sawdust on oil spilled during step 18.<br>20. Beer. Oops, drank it all yesterday.<br>21. Walk to 7-11; buy beer.<br>22. Install new oil filter making sure to apply thin coat of clean oil to gasket first.<br>23. Dump first litre of fresh oil into engine.<br>24. Remember drain plug from step 11. Scream out "F**king Shit"...repeat step 19<br>25. Hurry to find drain plug in drain pan.<br>26. Hurry to replace drain plug before the whole quart of fresh oil drains onto floor.<br>27. Slip with wrench and bang knuckles on frame. Cry. "Yell Oh F**k" when you realize your wife is watching. Repeat Step 13 &amp; 14.<br>28. Bang head on floorboard in reaction.<br>29. Begin swearing uncontrollably....Way more than before.<br>30. Throw wrench.<br>31. Yell out "Goddamned F**king Shit c**k-sucking bastard mother f**ker" over and over again for additional 10 minutes because wrench hit Miss December (1992) in the left tit.<br>32. Clean up. Then apply Band-Aid to knuckle.<br>33. Beer.<br>34. Beer.<br>35. Dump in additional 5 litres of oil.<br>36. Beer.<br>37. Lower car from jack.<br>38. Accidentally crush one toe in process. Cry.<br>39. Move car back to apply more sawdust to fresh oil spilled during step 23.<br>40. Test drive car.<br>41. Get pulled over; arrested for driving under the influence.<br>42. Car gets impounded.<br>43. Make bail; get car from impound yard.<br><br>Money Spent<br>$80 parts<br>$35 beer<br>$1000 Bail<br>$200 Impound and towing fee<br>$125 Wife's new dress (For bailing you out)<br>Total: $1440<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A family in the Southern Province of China were puzzled when the<br>coffin of their dead mother arrived from the States. It was sent by one of the<br>daughters.<br>The dead body was so tightly squeezed inside the coffin, with no space<br>left in it ! When they opened the lid , they found a letter on top which<br>read as follows:<br>Dear brothers and sisters, I am sending our mother's body to you<br>since it was her wish that she should be cremated in The compound of our<br>ancestral home in Tung Shin . Sorry, I could not come along as all of my paid<br>leaves are consumed. You will find inside the coffin, under Ahma's body, 12<br>cans of Yohmeitsu, 10 packets of chocolates and packets of Lap Chong.<br>Please divide these among all of you. On Ahma's feet you will find a new pair of Reebok shoes(size 10) for Ah&amp;nbs! p;boy.<br>Also, there are 2 pairs of shoes for Ah Mei's and Ah Lien's sons.<br>Hope the sizes are correct. Ahma is wearing 6 American T-Shirts. The large<br>size is for Ah Bak and the others are for my nephews. Just distribute them<br>among yourselves. The 2 new Jeans that Ahma is wearing are for the boys.<br>The Swiss watch that Lee Ah Bai wanted is on Ahma's left wrist. Kiasu Aunty, Ahma is wearing the necklace, earrings and ring that you asked for. Please take them. The 6 white cotton socks that Ahma is wearing must be divided among my teenager nephews. Please distribute all these uniformly and if anything more required let me know, since our Ah Pa is also not keeping well nowadays I can send all required things when our Ah Pa also.............<br></div>
