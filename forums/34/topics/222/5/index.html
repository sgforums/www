            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Billy joe Bob,<br>I'm writting this slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your Pa read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 minutes of your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn't have to change their address.<br><br>This place is really nice. I even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well, though, Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain, we haven't seen it since.<br><br>The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for fourdays.<br><br>About that coat you wanted me to send; your Uncle Bubba said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.<br><br>Bubba locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.<br><br>Your sister had a baby this morning,but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you are an aunt or uncle. The baby looks just like your brother.<br><br>Uncle Bobby Ray fell into a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out but he fought them off and drowned. We had him cremated; he burned for three days.<br><br>Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Butch was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in the back, they drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down.<br><br>Your Favorite Aunt</div>

The priest, keeping watch at the side of his bed leaned quietly over and asked,<br>"Do you have something you would like to say?"<br>The man nodded to the affirmative, and the preist handed him a pad And pen.<br>"I know you can't speak, but use this to write a note and I will give it to your wife. She's waiting just outside."<br>Gathering his last bit of strength, the man took them and scrawled his message upon the pad which he stuffed into the priest's hands. Then, moments later, the man died. After administering the last rites, the priest left to break the sad news to the wife. After consoling her a bit, the priest handed her the note.<br>"Here were his last words. Just before passing on, he wrote this message to you."<br>The wife tearfully opened the note which read:<br>"GET OFF MY FUCKING OXYGEN HOSE!"</div>

Five hours later she staggered out of the theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.<br><br>Right to a McDonald's they went,where her husband ordered a Big Mac for her along with extra fries and a large chocolate shake.

"You idiot, I meant my dress size."<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The moral of this story is: If a woman speaks and a man is there to listen to her, he will still get it wrong anyway.</span></strong></span></div>

"We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and<br>once you find what you are looking for, you can stay<br>there. It's easy to decide since each floor has a sign<br>telling you what's inside."<br><br>So they start going up and on the first floor the sign<br>reads: "All the men on this floor are short and plain."<br>The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the<br>next floor.<br><br>The sign on the second floor reads: "All the men here<br>are short and handsome." Still, this isn't good enough,<br>so the friends continue on up.<br><br>They reach the third floor and the sign reads: "All the<br>men here are tall and plain."<br>They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are<br>still two floors left, they continued on up.<br><br>On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: "All the men<br>here are tall and handsome." The women get all excited<br>and are going in when they realize that there is still<br>one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they<br>head on up to the fifth floor.<br><br>There they find a sign that reads: "There are no men<br>here. This floor was built only to prove that there is<br>no way to please a woman."<br></div>

The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag.<br><br>At the end of the day, just when the teacher says, "Here's this week's<br>question,"<br>Johnny empties the bag to the floor sending the ping-pong balls rolling to the<br>front<br>of the room. Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class<br>amusing,<br>the entire class starts laughing.<br><br>The teacher says, " Okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?"<br>Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, "Bill Cosby, see ya on Tuesday!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man observed a woman in the grocery store with a three year old girl in her basket. As they passed the cookie section, the child asked for cookies and her mother told her "no." The little girl immediately began to whine and fuss, and the mother said quietly, "Now Ellen, we just have half of the aisles left to go through; don't be upset. It won't be long."<br><br>He passed the mother again in the candy aisle. Of course, the little girl began to shout for candy. When she was told she couldn't have any, she began to cry. The mother said, "There, there, Ellen, don't cry. Only two more aisles to go, and then we'll be checking out."<br><br>The man again happened to be behind the pair at the check-out, where the little girl immediately began to clamor for gum and burst into a terrible tantrum upon discovering there would be no gum purchased today. The mother patiently said, "Ellen, we'll be through this check out stand in five minutes, and then you can go home and have a nice nap."<br><br>The man followed them out to the parking lot and stopped the woman to compliment her.

She<br>asks him why he is staring and he replies, "I have a<br>question to ask you but I don't want to offend you."<br><br>She answers: "My dear son, you cannot offend me.<br>When you're as old as I am and have been a nun as long<br>as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about<br>everything.

The "kit of parts" allows employees to customize their workspaces according to their needs. Along with practical solutions for common work necessities like storage, counter space, etc. the design includes a hammock, an aquarium, a floor cooler, rotating floor modules, a Wall Flower fold-down chair, a coat hanger and locker, and a motorized shoe polisher.<br><br>Other features include:<br>Boss Monitor - An icon that, when pressed, lets you see the boss's office door in order to keep tabs on his activities, moods, etc.<br><br>Pink Gerber Daisy -  "Wilts" when cubicle is empty and springs up when a person enters the space.<br><br>Trash can - Vibrates (as if tickled), and speaks and/or giggles when trash is placed in bin.<br><br>Self-timing Guest Seat - A micro-switch that, when triggered by the seat being unfolded, will set off a timing circuit, which will then dial the extension of the phone in the workspace. This provides the inhabitant with an excuse to get rid of the guest.<br><br>Sun Lights - Over the course of a day, the lights in the top modules glow or fade to simulate the movement of the sun.<br><br>Drink Temperature Control - A plate on the desk that acts as a cooling or heating unit.<br><br>Screen / computer monitor - A split screen.

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=Indigo]Things You Would Never Know Without Indian Movies<br>=========================================<br>1.   A man will show no pain while taking the most ferocious beating but will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds.<br><br>2.   If a large pane of glass is visible, someone will be thrown through it before long.<br><br>3.   The hero cannot fall in love with the heroine (&amp; vice versa) unless they first perform a dance number in the rain.<br><br>4.   Once applied, make-up is permanent. Even in the rain.<br><br>5.       A group of goondoos can be shooting at the hero, but he will never be hit, unless of  course he is attempting to save the heroine.<br><br>6.       Enemies shooting the hero will always miss but every shot the hero takes from his small revolver will kill an opponent.<br><br>7.       Two lovers can be dancing in the field and out of nowhere, 100  people will appear from God-knows-where and join them in the dance.<br><br>8.       The heroine will have time to change outfits several times in one song, however short the song may be.<br><br>9.       If the hero starts dancing in a field, everyone you bump into will know all the steps, and will be wearing coordinated outfits.<br><br>10.   It does not matter if the hero is heavily outnumbered in a martial arts fighting - the enemies will wait patiently to attack him one by one by  moving around in a threatening manner until he has knocked out his current opponent then the next one will come up.<br><br>11.   In the final scene, the hero will discover that the bad guy who he  is up against is actually his brother and the maid who looked after him is  his mother and the chief inspector is his father and the Judge is his uncle<br>and so forth.<br><br>12.   Key English words used in the movie (usually said out loud between sentences) are No Problem!, My God!, Get Out!, Shut-up!, Impossible!, Please forgive me!<br><br>13.   They drop down on the ground and roll about while singing and come<br>out with different clothing.<br><br>14.   They can run around the coconut trees, singing, batting eye-lids, throwing glances at each other and changing clothes all at the same time without being out of breath.<br><br>[color=Blue]Things You Would Never Know Without Chinese Swordsman Movies<br>=================================================<br><br>1.         The hero's parents will always be unlucky and they will usually be killed by enemies when the hero is young, and the hero will become an orphan.<br><br>2.         When a man is wounded and dying, he manages to catch his breath and speak a few sentences to reveal the killer before dropping his head to die.<br><br>3.         When an old man is dying after being attacked by villains, while lying down he will ask the hero (kneeling beside him) to take care of his beautiful daughter (who will be crying).<br><br>4.         When fighting with the enemy, instead of hitting each other, the villain and the hero will choose to hit each other's palm and stand there for some time before pushing each other away..... and one of them will spill blood out of his mouth<br><br>5.         Sword fighters are able to fly over roof tops, up trees and across distances without any sweat. But when travelling to towns and villages, they still have to walk or ride horses.<br><br>6.         When saying goodbye to other sword fighters, they will cover their right fist with their left palm and jump out of the camera screen. You were supposed to know that they actually flew off into the sky.<br><br>7.         The heroes need not have to work for money, but will always have gold and silver coins with them to pay for their meals.<br><br>8.         The inn is such an up-to-date information-centre that when having lunch at the inn, you can always overhear gossip on what's happening in the pugilistic-world. And usually the gossip comes from a few goons at the next table.<br><br>9.         Assassins seem to come from the same employment agency - they all wear the standard uniform- black cloth all over revealing only the eyes.<br><br>10.     The heroes and villains will meet each other very often no matter how big the country is and no matter where they are.<br><br>11.     It's easy to immobilize someone - just touch him with your fore finger and middle finger anywhere on his body and he will not move... but he can still curse.<br><br>12.     To remove an immobilization, just tap your fingers all over his body again.<br><br>13.     Healing internal wounds in the body is easy - just sit down cross-legged, palms on the knees and smoke will come out from the head.<br><br>14.     People like to pass short messages on paper with flying darts to show off their darting skills.<br><br>15.     The villains usually stay in a secret underground compartment just behind the walls of their room....usually opened up by turning a small statue.<br><br>16.     When chasing someone, they will shout at the runner and order him to stop...as if he will obey !<br><br>17.     Nobel's invention of explosives in 1866 is useless. Sword fighters in the pugilistic world in olden times already knew how to cause explosions with their bare hands.<br><br>18.     Sword fighters have the power to destroy rocks, but do not have  the power to kill the hero.<br><br>19.     If you are so nervous before your duel, mock your opponent before starting the fight.<br><br>20.     People in the pugilistic world don't seem to have to work. They spend their time attending meetings and nose around other people's business.<br><br>21.    They can keep a lot of stuff up their sleeves and waistband and never drop them. Especially gold and silver ingots...<br><br></div>
