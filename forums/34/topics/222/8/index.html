They seem to prefer taking a flying butt leap towards<br>the bowl and then chewing men out because they "left the seat up" instead of taking two seconds<br>and lowering it themselves.<br><br>Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear them clamoring to be let into the draft to cover the<br>responsibilities that go with those rights. All women seek equality with men until it comes to:<br>sharing the closet, taking out the trash, and picking up the check.<br><br>All women are overweight by definition; don't agree with them about it.<br>Women always have 5 pounds to lose, but don't bring this up unless they really have 5 pounds to gain.<br><br>PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter.

            <div class='col-md body'>One afternoon, a wealthy lawyer was riding in the back of his limousine when he saw two pathetic men eating grass by the road side. He ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate, and asked, "Why are you eating grass?""We don't have no money for food," the first man replied. "Oh, well, you can come with me to my house," insisted the lawyer."But, sir, I got a wife and three kids here.""Bring them along!" replied the lawyer."But how 'bout my friend?" The lawyer turned to the other man and said, "You come with us, too.""But, sir," said the friend, "I got a wife and six kids!" "Bring them as well!" answered the lawyer as he headed for his limo.They all climbed into the car, and once underway, one of the poor fellows says: "Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."The lawyer replied, "Glad to do it. You'll love my place. The grass is almost a foot tall."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that when God was making the world, he called man over and<br>bestowed upon him twenty years of normal sex life. Man was horrified.<br>"Only twenty years of normal sex life?" but the Lord was very adamant<br>that was all man could have.<br><br>Then the Lord called the monkey and gave him twenty years.<br>"But I don't need twenty years", he protested, "Ten is plenty for me."<br>Man spoke up eagerly. "Can I have the other ten?" The monkey graciously agreed.<br><br>Then the Lord called the lion and gave him twenty years, and the lion,<br>like the monkey, wanted only ten. Again the man spoke up,<br>"Can I have the other ten?" The lion said of course he could.<br><br>Then came the donkey and he was given twenty years - but like the others,<br>ten was sufficient - and again man pleaded, "Can I have the other ten?"<br><br>This explains why man has twenty years of normal sex life...<br>plus ten years of monkeying around, ten years of lion about it,<br>and ten years of making an ass of himself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; SAVING<br>&gt; There are these 3 friends who play golf together every Saturday. One<br>&gt; Saturday they are getting ready to tee off when a guy, by himself, asks if<br>&gt; he can join them. The friends look at each other and then look at the guy<br>&gt; and say, sure.<br>&gt; They tee off and about two holes into the game, the friends get curious<br>&gt; about what the guy does for a living. So they ask him.<br>&gt; The stranger tells them he's a hitman. The friends all laugh.<br>&gt; The guy says, "No really, I am a hitman. My gun is in my golf bag. I carry<br>&gt; it everywhere. You can take a look at it if you like."<br>&gt; One of the friends decides to check it out. He opened the bag and, sure<br>&gt; enough, there is a rifle with a huge scope attached. He gets all excited<br>&gt; and says, "WOW I bet I can see my house through here, May I look?" The hit<br>&gt; man replies, "Sure."<br>&gt; The guy looks for a second and says, "YEAH You can see my house I can even<br>&gt; see through the windows into my bedroom. There's my wife, naked. Isn't she<br>&gt; beautiful? WAIT! There's my next door neighbor and he's naked too!"<br>&gt; This really upsets the guy, so he asks the hitman how much it would be for<br>&gt; a hit.<br>&gt; The hitman replies, "I get $1000 every time I pull the trigger."<br>&gt; The guy responds, "$1000?, well ok I want two hits. I want you to shoot my<br>&gt; wife right in the mouth. She's always nagging at me and I can't stand it.<br>&gt; Second, I want you to shoot my neighbor in the penis, just for screwing<br>&gt; around with my wife."<br>&gt; The hit man agrees, gears up and looks through the scope. He's looking for<br>&gt; about five minutes.<br>&gt; Finally the man starts to get really impatient and asks, "What the hell<br>are<br>&gt; you waiting for?"<br>&gt; The hitman replies, "Just hold on.... I'm about to save you a thousand<br>&gt; bucks."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An attractive woman entered a pet shop. When the clerk offered assistance, she<br>explained that she was recently divorced, and was looking for a small-ish dog for company.<br><br>The clerk explained that the name of the store was 'Exotic Pets' and that, unfortunately,<br>they did not stock cats, dogs, fish or any commonplace pets.<br><br>He did say, however, that he had something which might be ideal. He took the woman into a back room.<br>He walked over to a terrarium, and pointed proudly to a large bullfrog which sat inside it.<br><br>"Would that suit your needs?" he asked.<br><br>The woman answered, scornfully, that she hardly thought an amphibian would be a suitable companion.<br><br>"Ah," replied the salesman, leering, "but this 'amphibian' has been carefully trained ...<br>to perform oral sex upon women."<br><br>At this the woman's eyes lit up.She eagerly negotiated a price of $500 for the frog, and left<br>with it in her expectant possession. Arriving home, she drew a bubble bath, poured a glass<br>of champagne and relaxed in anticipation. When she was thoroughly mellow, she dried herself,<br>and arranged herself, nude, upon her bed. Parting her thighs, she placed the frog between them,<br>closed her eyes, and waited.<br><br>Nothing happened. She prodded the frog. Still nothing. She moved it Up further toward her body.<br>Nothing. She ordered it to perform. No response.<br><br>After an hour of this frustration, she lifted the phone, and called the pet shop.<br>When the clerk answered, she complained loudly that she had been cheated.<br>The clerk apologized profusely, wrote down her address, and said he'd be right over.<br><br>Ten minutes later, he knocked on the door, and the woman answered, wearing a nightgown.<br>He asked her to demonstrate the problem. She obliged, by disrobing and assuming her former<br>position, with the frog in place. The frog made no movement.<br><br>"You see?" she asked, petulantly.<br>"Yes, I do," said the man.<br>Then, addressing the frog as he removed his necktie and shirt, he said sternly -<br>"Now, I'm only going to show you this one more time! ..."</div>

The hero cannot fall in love with the heroine (vice versa) unless<br>they first perform a dance number in the rain.<br><br>04. Once applied, make-up is permanent, in rain or in any other<br>situation.<br><br>05. A large group of goondoos can be shooting at the hero, but he will never be hit, unless of course he is attempting to save the heroine.<br><br>06. Enemies shooting the hero will always miss but every shot the hero takes from his small revolver will kill an opponent.<br><br>07. Two lovers can be dancing in the field and out of nowhere, 100 people will appear from god-knows-where and joins them in the dance.<br><br>08. The heroine will have time to change outfits several times in one<br>song,however short the song will be.<br><br>09. If the hero start dancing in a field, everyone you bump into will<br>know all the steps, and will be wearing coordinated outfits.<br><br>10. It does not matter if the hero is heavily outnumbered in a martial<br>arts fighting - the enemies will wait patiently to attack him one by one by moving around in a threatening manner until he has knocked out his current opponent then the next one will follow up.<br><br>11. In the final scene, the hero will discover that the bad guy who he is up against is actually his brother and the maid who looked after him is his mother and the chief inspector is his father and the Judge is his uncle and so forth.<br><br>12. Key English words used in the movie (usually said out loud between sentences) are No Problem!, My God!, Get Out!, Shut-up!, Impossible!, Please forgive me!<br><br>13.They drop down on grounds and roll and roll while singing and came out with different clothings.<br><br>14.They can run around the coconut trees, singing, battling eyelid, and throwing glances at each other and change clothes all at the same time without being out of breath.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things You Would Never Know Without Chinese Swordsman Movies<br>=====================================================<br><br>01. Being the hero's parents will always be unlucky and will usually be killed by enemies when the hero is young, and the hero will become an orphan.<br><br>02. When a man is wounded and dying, he always manage to catch his breath and speak a few sentences to reveal the killer before dropping his head and declare dead.<br><br>03. When an old man is dying after being attacked by villains, while<br>lying down he will ask the hero (kneeling beside him) to take care of his beautiful daughter, who will be crying.<br><br>04. When fighting with the enemy, instead of hitting each other, the<br>villain and the hero will choose to hit each other's palm and stone there for sometime before pushing each other away..... and one of them will spill blood out of his mouth.<br><br>05. Skilled people are able to fly over roof tops, up trees and across distances without any sweat. But when travelling to towns and villages, they still have to walk or ride horses.<br><br>06. When saying goodbye to other skilled fighters, they will cover their right fist with their left palm and jumping out of camera screen assuming you know they actually fly off into the sky.<br><br>07. The heroes need not have to work for money, but will always have golds and silvers with them to pay for their dishes.<br><br>08. The inn is such an up-to-date information-centre that when having lunch at the inn, you can always overhear gossips of latest news on what's happening in the pugilistic-world. And usually the gossips come from a few goons exactly at the next table.<br><br>09. Assassins seem to have some kind of agency for employments - they always wear the same standard uniform, black cloth all over revealing only the eyes.<br><br>10. The heroes and villains will meet each other very often no matter how big the country is and no matter where they are.<br><br>11. It's easy to immobilize someone - just touch someone with your fore finger and middle finger anywhere on his body and he will not move... but he still can curse and swear.<br><br>12. To cure an immobilization, just anyhow tap your fingers all over his body again.<br><br>13. Healing internal wounds in the body is as easy as sitting down<br>cross-legged, palms on the knees and smoke coming out from the head.<br><br>14. People like to pass short messages on paper with flying darts to show off their darting skills.<br><br>15. When committing suicide, people are so lazy that they choose to hit the forehead with their own palm.<br><br>16. The villains have some kind of strange habit that they like to stay in a secret underground compartment just behind the walls of their room....usually opened up by turning a small statue.<br><br>17. When chasing someone, people tend to shout at the runner and order him to stop... as if he will obey.<br><br>18. Nobel's invention of explosives in 1866 is in fact useless. Highly<br>skilled people in the pugilistic world during ancient times already know how to cause explosions with bare hands.<br><br>19. Highly skilled villains have the power to destroy rocks, but do not have the power to kill the hero.<br><br>20. Two highly skilled person are so nervous in their duel that they keep talking and criticizing each other before they actually start the fight.<br><br>21. People in the pugilistic world are so free that they don't have to work. They attend gatherings, meetings every time and nose round other people's matter.<br><br>22. They can keep a lot of stuff in their sleeves and waistband and never drop them, especially a lot of gold and silver ingots...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
