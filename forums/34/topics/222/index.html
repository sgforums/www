            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Picking the wrong store...</strong><br>A young man goes into a drug store to buy condoms. The pharmacist says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants.<br><br>"Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot. I want the condoms because I think tonight's <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> night. We're having dinner with her parents, and then we're going out and I've got a feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that. Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack."<br>The young man makes his purchase and leaves. Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her parents.<br>He asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree. He begins the prayer, but continues praying for several minutes. The girl leans over and says,<br>"You never told me that you were such a religious person."<br>He leans over to her and says...<br>"And you never told me that your father is a pharmacist!"</div>

The Lone Ranger pointed to a spot on the ground and said,<br>"Bug."<br>Tonto looked and nodded.<br>"Ladybug," said the Lone Ranger.<br>Tanto looked again and replied,<br>"Good eye."<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>The Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding across the plains when Tonto suddenly stopped, climbed down off his horse and put his ear to the ground.

WhatÂ’s in the bag?" asked Eve.<br>"These are a couple of things that I have left over from creation." God rummaged around in the bag a moment. "Who wants to be able to pee standing up?"<br>Adam immediately put his hand up in the air, waving frantically.<br>"Me! Me! Me! Oh, oh, PLEASE, God, let me have it! Just think of how much more work I could get done in the fields if I could pee standing up! And it would help so much when I'm out hunting! Oh, please, please, please let me have it!"<br>"Well, all right," said God. "Now, letÂ’s see what we have for you, Eve."<br>God rummaged about a bit more in the bag.<br>"Ah, right. Multiple orgasms."<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>King Arthur was in MerlinÂ’s laboratory where the good wizard was showing him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt, except it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place.<br>"This is no good, Merlin!" the king exclaimed, "Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect mÂ’lady, the Queen?"<br>"Ah, sire, just observe," said Merlin.<br>He then selected his most worn out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two.<br>"Merlin, you are a genius!" said the grateful monarch. "Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected."<br>After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest.<br>Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he assembled all of his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal "short arm" inspection. Sure enough, each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All of them, except Sir Galahad.<br>"Sir Galahad," exclaimed King Arthur. "My one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!"<br>But, alas, Sir Galahad was speechless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

He swerved to avoid hitting the rabbit, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of the car and was hit. The driver,<br>being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road and got out to see what had become of the rabbit. Much to his dismay, the rabbit was dead. The driver felt so awful he began to<br>cry. A woman driving down the highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong.<br><br>"I feel terrible," he explained. "I accidentally hit this rabbit and killed it."<br><br>The woman told the man not to worry. She knew what to do. She went to her car trunk and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead rabbit, and sprayed the<br>contents of the can onto the rabbit. Miraculously, the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped down the road. 50 meters away the rabbit stopped, turned around, waved at the two again, hopped down the road another 50 meters, turned, waved, and hopped another 50 meters.<br><br>The man was astonished. He couldn't figure out what substance could be in the woman's spray can! He ran over to the woman and demanded, "What was in your spray can?<br>What did you spray onto that rabbit?"<br><br>The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said: "'Hare Spray' Restores Life to Dead Hare. Adds Permanent Wave."</div>

In vain, he tried one word after another.<br>Finally, he remembered the correct command and screamed "AMEN!!!!!" just as the horse<br>approached the edge of the cliff.<br><br>The Pastor was so thrilled that his life had been saved that he raised his hands<br>to the sky and shouted, "PRAISE THE LORD!"</div>
