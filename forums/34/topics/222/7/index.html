Your Mom, she's the administrator of the household, so we'll call her the 'Government.' We are here to take care of YOUR needs, so we'll call you 'The People.'  The nanny, well, she works hard all day for very little money, so we'll consider her 'The Working Class.'   And, finally, your baby brother...we'll call him 'The Future.'  Now, think about that and see if it makes sense."<br>The little boy goes off to bed thinking about what his dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him.  He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.<br>So the little boy goes to his parent's room and finds his mother sound sleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room.  Finding the door locked, he peeks into the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny.  He gives up and goes back to bed.<br>The next morning, the little boy says to his father,<br>"Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now."<br>The father says,<br>"Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about."<br>The little boy replies,<br>"Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored, and the Future is in deep shit."<br><br>p.s : XAvier...the person you talking about is Ding and not me rite?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Men have higher body temperatures than women. If your heating goes out in winter,<br>I recommend sleeping next to a man.

That's why the men's department is usually on the first floor<br>of a department store, two inches from the door.<br><br>If a man prepares dinner for you &amp; the salad contains three or more types of lettuce, he's serious.<br><br>Men own basketball teams. Every year cheerleaders' outfits get tighter and briefer,<br>and players' shorts get baggier and longer.<br><br>When four or more men get together, they talk about sports.<br>When four or more women get together, they talk about men.<br>Not one man in a beer commercial has a beer belly.<br><br>Men are less sentimental than women. No man has ever seen the movie<br>'The Way We Were' twice, voluntarily.<br><br>Most women are introspective: "Am I in love? Am I emotionally and creatively fulfilled?"<br>Most men are outrospective: "Did my team win? How's my car?"<br><br>Men hate to lose. I once beat my husband at tennis. I asked him,<br>"Are we going to have sex again?" He said, "Yes, but not with each other."<br><br>Getting rid of a man without hurting his masculinity is a problem. "Get out" and<br>"I never want to see you again" might sound like a challenge. If you want to get<br>rid of a man, I suggest saying, "I love you... I want to marry you... I want to have<br>your children." Sometimes they leave skid marks.<br><br>Men who listen to classical music tend not to spit.<br><br>Only men who have worn a ski suit understand how complicated it is for a woman<br>to go to the bathroom when she's wearing a jumpsuit.<br><br>When a woman tries on clothing from her closet that feels tight, she will assume<br>she has gained weight. When a man tries something from his closet that feels tight,<br>he will assume the clothing has shrunk.<br><br>Male menopause is a lot more fun than female menopause. With female menopause<br>you gain weight and get hot flashes. Male menopause - you get to date young girls<br>and drive motorcycles.<br><br>Men forget everything; women remember everything.<br>That's why men need instant replays in sports. They've already forgotten what happened.<br>Men would like monogamy better if it sounded less like monotony.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once, there was a man who was upset by his past deeds that he decided to<br>visit a church and confess all of his sins.<br>When he arrived at the church, he walked to the confession area and<br>spoke to the pastor. "Father, I am sinful.<br>"Yes son, just tell me what have you done, the Lord will forgive you."<br><br>"Father, I have a steady relationship with my girlfriend, it's been 3 years<br>and nothing serious ever happened between us.<br>Yesterday, I visited her house, nobody was at home except for<br>her sister. We were alone and I slept with her.<br>"That's bad my boy, fortunately you realize your mistake."<br><br>"Father, last week I went to her office to look for her, but nobody was<br>around except for one of her colleagues, so I slept with her too."<br>"That's not very good of you."<br><br>"Father, last month, I went to her uncle's house to look for her, nobody<br>was around except for her auntie, and I slept with her too"<br><br>"Father? ......... Father?" suddenly this guy realized that there was no<br>response from the Father, he walked over<br>and discovered that the Pastor was not there. So he went searching for him.<br>"Father? Where are you?"<br>He searched high and low, and finally he found him hiding under the table ...<br>behind the piano.<br>"Father, why are you hiding here?"<br>"Sorry son, suddenly I remembered there is nobody around here except me."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man was sick and tired of going to work<br>every day while his wife stayed  home. He<br>wanted her to see what he went through so<br>he prayed:<br><br>Dear Lord, I go to work every day and put<br>in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home.<br>I want her to know what I go through, so please<br>allow her body to switch with mine for a day Amen.<br><br>God, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish.<br><br>The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a<br>woman. He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate,<br>awakened the kids, set out their school clothes,<br>fed them breakfast packed their lunches, drove<br>them to school, came home and picked up the dry<br>cleaning, took it to the cleaners and stopped<br>the bank to make a deposit, went grocery shopping,<br>then drove home to put away the groceries,<br>paid the bills and balance the check book.<br><br>He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog.<br>Then it was already 1 P. M. and he hurried to make<br>the beds, do the laundry, vacuum,  dust, and sweep<br>and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick<br>up the kids and got into an argument with them on the<br>way home. Set out cookies and milk and got the kids<br>organized to do their homework, then set up the<br>ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing.<br><br>At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables<br>for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh<br>beans for supper. After supper he cleaned the kitchen,<br>ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids,<br>and put them to bed.<br><br>At 9 P. M. he was exhausted and, though his daily chores<br>weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected<br>to make love which he managed to get through without<br>complaint.<br><br>The next morning he awoke and immediately knelt by the<br>bed and said, "Lord, I don't know what I was thinking.<br>I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay<br>home all day. Please, oh please, let us trade back."<br><br>God answered: "Glad you have learned your lesson and<br>I will be happy to change things back to the way they<br>were. You'll just have to wait nine months, though.<br>You got pregnant last night."<br><br>Don't you just love it?<br></div>
