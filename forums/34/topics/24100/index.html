            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>"15 Golden Fengshui Tips for the Office"</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>"Master Lynn Yap's written articles with<br>Institute of Estate Agents(IEA) Newsletter" </strong></span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">01) If you wish to be the leader in your industry, place a Golden Dragon on the right hand side of your worktable looking into the window or the door. The Golden Water Dragon can also look into your water fountain. A Dragon always chases after a pearl, hence the window, water fountain can signify the pearl. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">02) In the office always place the fax machines , telephones and some computers in the wealth area and future wealth area for MORE Businesses.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">03) The arrangement of tables and chairs should be in a harmonious position so that chi is able to flow smoothly. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">04) As a manager, always sit with a solid wall behind your back to ensure that you have customers support, bosses' support and staff support. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">05) The company safe can also be placed in the wealth area as anything that is placed there will grow (double or triple) depending on your "four pillars of destiny" (ba zhi). If that year is a great year for you then your wealth could be four fold. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">06) There should not be any cactus or sharp looking plants in the office as these plants have small sharp leaves and therefore causes "shar chi" in the office. The chi that rides on the wind will have to pass through them causing chi to be fierce and sharp. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">07) If your staff always fall sick in that area, then use a metal windchime made of 6 or 7 metal rods about 1ft long are the best as the sound of metal is the best fengshui cure. Others like a metal sculpture or metal object would not be that effective although they are also metal in nature.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">08 ) In your office room, never have the main door opening into your table as the chi coming in will hit at your face causing you not to have good luck but instead more obstacles and problems. Either shift your table or shift the door. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">09) For a Managing Director's room, never insist that there should be a side door for you to get to the secretary's room as this means that you will have two doors in your room and this is bad as chi cannot stay long in your room. And when the chi do not stay long but is dispersed because of the two doors then you will not be able to keep your good luck as chi is dispersed by wind or movement. Ideally chi should be allowed to stay. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">10) The chi from the main entrance of your office should not meet a wall inside the office. This is because the chi once it hits the wall has to turn and therefore causing it to slow down hence your businesses will be slow and not vibrant. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">11) Do not place the photocopy machine near to the main door. Heat near the main door is usually not preferred and causes the chi to be hot and dispersed easily as more people are likely to walk in and out thus carryng chi in and out too fast because the chi is not allowed to stay for some time. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">12) Do not place the cutter machine next to the main door. Cutter machine is to cut papers. Therefore if placed here will cause staff to back stab each other and fight too if one is not careful. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">13) Do not place an empty vase next to the main door as the new chi once it enters your office will be sucked into the vase causing nothing much left for the environment. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">14) For corporate clients a five feet fish tank placed in the wealth area is the best for great results and success. However there are strict criterias for the fish tank that one has to follow. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">15) The company signboard should be in the wealth area so that no other competitors can be strong enough to beat you at your game. </span></div>
