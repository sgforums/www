You think that your sudden timidity may be the<br>underlying weakness.<br>Yes//E-Type No//F-Type</span><br><br><strong><br><span style="color: green;">RESULTS</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">A-Type<br>You are mentally about 65 years old. A few more years<br>and your peers will consider you to belong at a<br>nursing home. Regretfully, you are really living a<br>life of a 65 year-old senior citizen. You are lacking<br>a great amount of ambitious spirit and cringe at the<br>thought of accomplishing, what is otherwise a fun<br>task. But your human warmth is as deep as the ocean<br>and your resilience doesn't fluctuate whatever you are<br>working. Keep these strong points in mind and think<br>about mental attitude.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">B-Type<br>You are mentally about 35 years old! Your behavior is<br>in the 20's but you don't experience the many<br>embarrassing moments anymore, which make you mentally<br>an older person. You think you no longer have time to<br>waste anymore and smiling doesn't get you far anymore.<br>It is understandable to ignore strangers in that way<br>but you have to be aware of others around you with a<br>certain politeness or they will perceive you to be of<br>bad character. Supposedly, it is very common for<br>people in their late 30's to experience sudden<br>emotional explosion. Bring your mental age down by<br>becoming aware of your innocence. Try wearing white<br>clothes, which will present a pure, youthful<br>appearance. You should also temporarily get rid of<br>your long lasting pen and start using a pencil (symbol<br>of clarity/purity) to further enhance a younger state<br>of mind.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">C-Type<br>You are mentally in the Late 20's. If you are teen and<br>got this result, you are associated to an old baby<br>(oxymoron). You are a motherly character to your<br>friends, looking after them and wanting to protect<br>them. Your mental age is about 26 at this point.<br>People feel very comfortable around you because you<br>fuss around.But you should remember not to become idle<br>about your appearance. The clothes you wear also match<br>the mature age you are at. Bright clothes, such as<br>yellow, could make you feel younger if you ever think<br>about returning to your early 20's. How about chatting<br>with your friends over greasy hamburgers at a fast<br>food place? Remember that it is up to you to create a<br>vibrant atmosphere.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">D-Type<br>You are mentally about 20 years old. Your actual age<br>and mental age are at the same level, which is the<br>ideal. This means that you are a well-balanced person.<br>At this point there is nothing to worry about when you<br>show immature signs at times because that is normal<br>for your age. Remember to live happily day-by-day and<br>not to lose your confidence or self-esteem. The color<br>of confidence is brown, so grab a pair of shoes.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">E-Type<br>You are mentally in the teens. It is your naive that<br>leads you to act selfishly and without concerning<br>about others. The world revolves around you and you<br>have the tendency to steer towards the other direction<br>if you don't agree with others. It is important to<br>listen to other people's opinion or advice but they<br>just don't sit well in your stomach. If you would like<br>to hear compliments, you should try to curb your<br>temper and to be less selfish. Try wearing blue clothes and<br>musky perfume, which may help pacify your impatient<br>mood.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">F-Type<br>You are mentally a baby. You have to realize that<br>you are the only person who is responsible for your<br>life's decisions. It is inexcusable to call out your<br>mother's name for every little problem and this is the<br>obvious reason why you are a joke to others. Question<br>yourself how much you should depend on others and when<br>you are your own person. Green is a sign of maturity.<br>Carrying around a snakeskin or crocodile skin wallet<br>may give off an aura of elegance. Choosing a religious<br>faith or becoming more serious with your current faith<br>may help you achieve a more mature you.</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">If you can't change your fate, change your attitude..</span></strong></div>
