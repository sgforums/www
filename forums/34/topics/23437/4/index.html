            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>[color=indigo]]<strong>Scorpio Male </strong><br>The Scorpion is determined, shrewd, protective, jealous, and powerful. It is a sign prone to obsession, and the Scorpio man is not nonchalant about anything, from his career to his love life.  Symbolized by the phoenix rising from the ashes, this bird aptly suggests Scorpio`s incredible ability to regenerate from seemingly disastrous situations.  Much has been written about how sexy and mysterious Scorpio is.  To him sex is very important, and it would be impossible for him to have a happy relationship without great sex.  The Scorpio male is macho, a modern day 007: thrilling, strong, silent and handsome.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>One of the challenges of being in love with a Scorpio male is to get him to voice his innermost thoughts and feelings.  Sometimes it is impossible know exactly what a Scorpio is thinking!  He can be a temperamental, jealous lover, so watch your step.  You will have to play by his rules or leave him. With this man, there are no shades of gray.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>Still waters run deep, and you will find him fiercely loyal and deeply passionate.  This Pluto ruled-lover would never dream of divulging details of your private life together to others, and expects the same from you.  Woe to the woman who strays from his bed to another lover, for he will never forgive her.  The Scorpion`s sting is never used casually, only when he feels threatened to the core, for its sting kills not only the victim but the Scorpion itself.  Scorpio will never suffer betrayal.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>If you want to get your Scorpio lover a bit more relaxed and focused on you, try taking him to a small, cozy restaurant that serves solid manly food like a juicy steak and fries.  Red wine will probably be his choice over champagne.  The Scorpio male is no delicate gourmand.  He would love a dark, rich chocolate mouse for dessert, if he likes sweets (some Scorpios do, some don`t).  Wear your little black dress or something in burgundy, his favorite color.<br><br>Your Scorpio will want you to be uninhibited.  Don`t become offended if he suggests viewing a sex video together.  He does not see pornography as degrading to women, but as research and stimulus for new things to do.  Since this sign rules law enforcement, crime and punishment, suggest he play policeman with you.  Give him a gift box containing a blindfold and some handcuffs and you`ll be all set.  This man likes trying out a little light S&amp;M playacting too so if you trust him, be cooperative if wants to put his naughty girl over his knee for a little spanking.  This intense sign will insist on being the one in control, but surrendering to a Scorpio can be divine rapture.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=black]<strong>Scorpio Female </strong><br>The Scorpio woman has great charm, allure, and inner strength, and is able to overcome most any obstacle in life.  She comes across as self-confident and self-possessed and men are drawn to her for that reason.<br><br>There is a mysterious quality about the Scorpio woman, because she is intensely private, discrete and secretive.  Soon she will learn everything about you, but later you will realize that she hasn`t given you many details about herself--that`s Scorpio`s natural reticence.  Finally, the operative word to best understand your Scorpio lover is "passion."  One Scorpio once said to me that passion was the single most important ingredient in life, that is, to be passionate about one`s loved ones, one`s career, one`s lifestyle, for without passion, what kind of life would we have in the end?  Well said!<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Your Scorpio beauty is attracted to power, so if you have it, you are ahead of the game.  Your other challenge will be that this lady has a mind of her own, so if you think you can tame her, forget it.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>Her highly intuitive nature makes her a mind reader extraordinaire, so don`t try to hide anything from her.  If you are trying to impress her with power you don`t have, her Pluto-ruled nature will sense it like a homing device.  (Certainly you don`t want to activate her seek and destroy mechanism.) In love and friendship, she is true-blue loyal and will expect the same from you.  If you show her the slightest reason to distrust you, however, she will never forgive you.  On the other hand, treat her well and she will reward you for the rest of your life.  Home and family are regarded as sacred, and Scorpio will defend and support her man to the ends of the earth.  Like Leo women, Scorpio women are into control, and with her magnetic, femme fatale powers, she will soon have the upper hand.  After all, who could resist her famous Scorpion gaze, those memorable bedroom eyes?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>If you take your Scorpio beloved out for dinner, make it a private little dark rendezvous, overlooking water if possible or better yet, as a guest on a private yacht (preferably yours).  The Scorpion woman will always be understated with her powerful sexuality--she doesn`t need to flaunt it, it exudes naturally. In her dress, she is very careful about her accessories, buying only the finest shoes and handbags, and if she needs one, an elegant leather brief case.  She knows these accessories punctuate her entire look and impart a feeling of true elegance.  Get her quality things made out of leather (down, boy, not those things).  If treating her to perfume, get her a modern oriental or something of musk and subtly sexual.<br><br>While the Scorpio woman is always a lady in public, she loves being her man`s fantasy woman in the bedroom.  Buy her some new lingerie in of her most flattering tones: maroon, eggplant or a black.  Elegant French and Italian imported lingerie will impress her so buy her a demi-cup push up bra, tiny, sheer g-string bikini and elegant garter belt, complete with a pair of black seamed stockings.  She may also be amused and aroused by a lavishly illustrated photography book by Helmut Newton or Doris Kloster.  If you get lucky, she may want to experiment a little by lap dancing for you and you alone.<br><br>This sign rules detective work, so plan a mystery for her.  She has a rich imagination and this should work whether you`ve known her a month or a decade.  Tell her to meet you in the most elegant hotel bar in town. When you spot her, stand at the other end of the bar and have the waiter send over a glass of champagne and a note from you.  By now the suggestive nature of your behavior will have the staff murmuring and staring and it will begin to turn her on tremendously.  After the second or third drink, send her the key to your room in a small envelope.  (Book their best suite ahead of time and stock it with roses and.) When she`s pocketed the key, have her meet you by the elevator.  Ride up alone, pushing her against the back wall of the elevator and tell her in great detail what you have planned.  Show her the silk ribbons you`ve tucked into your breast pocket--Scorpio is intrigued by bondage.  Although she will try her hardest not to show it, she will be aching for you to begin.  She won`t forget this mystery, and neither will you!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=DarkBlue]<strong>Saggitarius Male </strong><br>Your Sagittarius guy has a strong intellect, penetrating thought process and continual curiosity about the world around him.  Your man is ready for a deep discussion on ethics, morality, politics, philosophy, or religion, so go ahead one night and tackle The Meaning Of Life.  Unlike Gemini, who focuses on details of the here and now, Sagittarius looks at the entire sweep of collected knowledge and tries to make sense out of the big picture.  His most attractive qualities are his faith and optimism, and his customary cheer will endear him to you.  This sign also has major wanderlust, so pack your glacier glasses and bug spray if you want to travel with him on his jaunts to the most exotic locales.  Finally, this is the sign of the ultimate jock.  Many of our most gifted Olympians are born under this sign and he will require lots of physical activity.  If he sounds like a handful, it`s because he is, but such an interesting handful!<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Your Sagittarius man likes the bachelor life more than most signs, so getting him to commit may take some doing.  Freedom is something he values enormously and it`s crucial for him to be able to do what he wants to do.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>"Mens sanis in corpore Sagittarius" Sag has so much energy he will need some sort of regular exercise to keep him from going completely mental.  If he needs to spend what you believe to be inordinate amounts of time at the gym, don`t hassle him-- humor him instead.  (You won`t be able to win this one anyway). Enjoy his beautiful shoulders and abs and glutes and tell him he looks just like the Diet Coke man.<br><br>Sag is great because they always tell the truth, but sometimes hearing unvarnished truth can be rough on the rest of us.  They have no sense of diplomacy, so if you ask their opinion, be ready to hear it! In love, Sag needs lots of sex and sports but he has an equal need for an intellectual partner.  He will want his woman to stay up to date on political issues and trends and he will enjoy lively and even heated debates.  If he needs regular nights out with the boys, say "fine."  Nothing spoils a relationship faster for a Sag than a sense of claustrophobia.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Equipment for his favorite sport or new workout clothing would be good, and if you are feeling generous, a membership to a health club would be ideal (that would be a subtle acknowledgment of his manly physical prowess).  This sign adores animals too, so you could surprise him with that pet Dalmatian puppy he wants.<br><br>Sagittarius is a sophisticated sign that enjoys international cuisine.  When taking him to dinner read the reviews and find an unusual restaurant such as one that serves Vietnamese, Japanese, Turkish, or Thai cuisine.  Afterwards, continue the international theme by going to a foreign flick.  Often guys from this sign are good with languages and at the very least enjoy a good debate, so chose a movie with a substantial plot (no, The Bodyguard won`t quite cut it.)  This sign loves sports, as participant rather than a spectator.  Suggest you go swimming, play tennis or do any sport where you can keep up your end fairly well.  His ego is not fragile, this guy doesn`t want you to let him win for he enjoys and admires strong women.  So give him a real workout on the courts and you`ll both win!<br><br>The more things you do in the great outdoors, the better, for he likes to be in expansive space.  You know where this is all leading in terms of your seduction--your Sagittarius lover would be thrilled if you suggested making love al fresco.  This could be a problem if you are moved to do this in winter and live in a freezing region of the country.  Since Sag is the sign of the centaur, chances are he likes horseback riding, so how about seducing him in the barn on top of an old-fashioned hay stack?  Start by telling him how perfect his riding "seat" is and how you couldn`t get your eyes off him.  Since Sagittarius is the sign ruling the thighs, gently stroking him there will drive him wild with desire.  If the weather is warmer, seduce him out in the wide open spaces, in a private, lush and green setting, under the full moon and stars.  Can you think of anything more romantic?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=DarkRed]<strong>Saggitarius Female </strong><br>The Sagittarius woman is vivacious, funny, self assured, and sophisticated.  She probably had an opportunity to travel as a child, and will need to continue to do so throughout her life.  She`s a woman who needs challenge and intellectual stimulation in all parts of her life.<br><br>Sag women are often highly successful at what they set out to do simply because they are so positive they will succeed.  Since the sign also rules international communication, they are either known worldwide or deal with matters of global importance.  This is not an overly-sensitive sign, and when criticized, they listen carefully to the feedback.  She should be careful not to hurt her mate`s feelings by being too direct in her comments; Sag often has no idea of how her words effect others.  Her man should also be sure to allow her a sense of freedom which is highly important to the Sag woman.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>To keep her intellectually stimulated will be a lifelong struggle.  This is no dumb bunny, and you may have to struggle to keep up with her.  (Her idea of fun is listening to National Public Radio.) She gets bored easily, so be forewarned!<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>Her sign rules the centaur, half man, half horse, pointing high, toward the sky, which symbolizes her quest to reach the lofty goals she`s set.  She could be "high maintenance" in that you will have to endure all the highs and lows of her existence, for her motto is nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Alas, some things just aren`t going too work out, but unlike Cancer, who will try to second-guess themselves, Sag`s optimism will buoy her up.  She will be on to Plan B in no time.  Sometimes this could be exhausting for you, so keep the vitamins handy.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Places To Go, Things To Buy Her </span></strong><br>If you`d like to get her a fragrance, choose one of the fresh new uni-sex fragrance, for she won`t wear anything too conventionally flowery or sweet.  She is apt to be a runner or do some equally strenuous sport--can you imagine a marathon runner fussing with Arpege?  Not quite.<br><br>Her likes her look sporty, preferring pants to skirts and sportswear to anything more formal.  Sag generally likes comfortable shoes, the heels not too high.  It must have been a Sag who started the trend of wearing her sneakers on the way to work.  Often Sag women were tomboys as a kid, and as a woman she manages to keep her enviable figure because of all the exercise she gets.  Give her clothing which is body revealing, such as a mini skirt and matching top in lycra or spandex.  She is one woman who can carry it off in style!  Or treat her to ten weeks with a personal trainer and she`ll be yours for life.<br><br>The Sag woman has no patience with frilly nightgowns but prefers either something plain and natural.  What would she most likely wear to bed?  A cool, thin, tight white cotton tank top which outlines her breasts, worn with tiny cotton string panties--or nothing at all.  She likes men`s wear, so you might catch her putting on your button-down shirt with not much else on but a smile. (Remember how fetching Annette Bening looked in the seduction scene from American President?). She will do more for your shirt than you could ever imagine.<br><br>She will be impressed if you treat your body like a temple too, so try to work out often.  Then, you can lounge around in tight bicycle shorts to heat things up.  Look at her innocently and say you took a part time job as a messenger and need to wear them for practicality and comfort.  (She`d got a good sense of humor.)  Since this woman would love a strenuous workout, plan an active, feather-flying pillow fight or try chasing her around the yard.  Feeling randy?  Toss her into a snow drift.  The aim here is to get her pulse rate up then convince her she won`t need her morning run with you around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=Green]<strong>Capricorn Male </strong><br>When Henry Kissinger said "Power is the greatest aphrodisiac" he sounded like a Capricorn, even though he isn`t (he`s Gemini).  Your Capricorn lover is highly ambitious and very hardworking, so be prepared to endure some nights alone while he stays late at the office.  All those long hours, however, will pay off, and your future lifestyle together is likely to be mighty interesting. Capricorns tend to achieve positions of power and surround themselves with highly successful friends and associates.  Unlike Aries who needs to own his own business, Capricorn likes working as part of the team in large corporations and usually climbs up through the ranks there.  The Capricorn man is excellent with finances so chances are money will never be a problem with him.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge: </span></strong><br>Your man likes successful women, and will say to himself, "Can I introduce her to my boss?" You will have to reassure him he can, and further, that you`ll actually improve his career prospects. (The higher he goes, the more his significant other will count.)<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>In love, your Capricorn man`s most enduring quality is his unexpected, silly sense of humor.  This is such a different side of his ambitious and driven personality that it will catch you off guard.  Don`t ever be afraid to laugh in bed, for you will endear yourself to Mr. Capricorn forever.  Lovemaking does not have to be serious all the time.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Capricorns are status conscious, so when choosing a gift, be sure to chose something from a fine retailer.  Alternatively, Capricorn rules history, so an antique gold coin, rare letter autographed by an American president or a best seller on an historical subject would be terrific.<br><br>When taking him to dinner, suggest that you meet at his college club, country club or even the Republican Club (my apologies to Caps who are Democrats--I`m just trying to make a point).  Or choose a fine, established restaurant that looks like a club, with wood paneling and a low-key, moneyed ambiance.  Eating chicken and peas doesn`t bother him--he is used to it from all the industry dinners he regularly attends.<br><br>Since he wants a Grace Kelly-type rich girl, beg, borrow or rent a luxurious mink coat (he has no qualms about you wearing fur like Aquarius does).  Wear it securely closed with nothing on underneath but your finest jewelry, lacy bra, panties and garter belt with lace top black stockings.  Of course you will want to apply your most elegant and sophisticated makeup.  Carry a proper handbag, and wear your darkest and most glamorous sunglasses.  Don`t forget your stiletto heels, of course--this is no time for sensible shoes.  Hail a cab to where he works (he is happy there and in his element) and, walking into his office unannounced, close the door purposefully (you`ve told his secretary to hold all calls).  Whether you leave the blinds up or down is up to you, but be sure to play out his greatest fantasies. He will never forget this day!<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>Capricorn Female </strong><br>The Capricorn woman is the one with the good gold jewelry, neutral tweed or classic Brooks Brothers suits and silk shirts.  She always looks highly successful, or like she comes from old money (even if she doesn`t.)  Your Capricorn woman realizes the value of a solid social network and will join organizations which will help her up the career ladder. Her lover will soon realize that he will need to share her with the world, and will be proud of her long list of accomplishments.  She will come across as serious, conservative, shy, detailed, organized and self-disciplined.  She delivers on her promises.  She keeps her word and everything that bears her name is the best she can muster.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Your Capricorn lover is practical--coming from a good background and having success potential is important to her.  Some Capricorn women marry for social position, others are just concerned that their husband to be will be able to support her in the manner to which she is accustomed.  You`ll need to convince her of your earnest ambition and your solid future.  If you`re socially connected, by all means, don`t hide it.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>In love she is slow and careful.  Never one to wander from one flirtation to another, the Capricorn woman has her feet well planted on the ground.  If her man suggests something new to her and she isn`t sure, he should give her time.  Capricorn generally likes to mull things over and get used to ideas.  She must never be forced or she will resist for sure.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>When getting her jewelry, think about buying an antique piece of estate jewelry, or give her something handed down from your grandmother.  For a lovely dinner, take her to your club or to a restaurant that looks like a grand estate.  Afterwards, give her a madly romantic experience, such as a carriage ride through the park in the snow, with warm blanket and brandy afterwards, or plan to meet her on top of a tall building, such as the Empire State building at 11:00 PM (Ã  la An Affair to Remember, but in this version, both of you show up).  Kiss her passionately, and promise her your true love.<br><br>Later, take her back to your apartment.  Since this sign rules history, buy her a historical romance novel and read steamy portions of it to her in bed.  Or, rent a romantic video, set in the days of knights and princes.  Your lady is so used to making all the decisions at home and at work that she is tired of it all.  She wants to be rescued now and then instead of having to rescue everyone else.  Transfer all those feelings to you.  Here is your chance to be her real life knight in shining armor and you will have her heart for life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=olive]<strong>Aquarius Male </strong><br>The most striking quality in the Aquarius man is fierce independence and creativity.  He may also have a scientific bent.  Aquarians never care about what has been done in the past because they are totally focused on the future.  Your Aquarius lover may also be concerned with humanitarian issues and feel moved to do something about a environmental imbalance or social injustice.  Natural and charismatic leaders, most of our presidents have been Aquarians (President Ronald Reagan is one).  They usually have many friends, although only few can get into their inner circle.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Friendship is so important to him that you may feel his pals are more important to him than you are.  This isn`t the case, but can be hard to cope with at times.  Loving an Aquarius is often frustrating because they often act aloof and hard to catch.  But as the French say, the one who suffers greatest loves the most.  You`ll need to position yourself inside his circle, and not be on the outside looking in.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Them </span></strong><br>In love and marriage, the Aquarius male will need to retain his sense of individuality and freedom.  The wise woman in love with an Aquarius will not hem him in.  Inside the Aquarius there is often a struggle between wanting to live alone but still craving love and nurturing (a side kept well hidden).  This duality could drive you crazy at times, but it is best to ignore it.  When they become angry, they will act distant rather than rant and rave, so try to draw him out, and get him used to sharing his innermost thoughts.  When there`s a disagreement, reason with him intellectually rather than emotionally; this guy is analytical.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Nothing makes an Aquarius happier than talking about electronics or the internet.  They are ruled by Uranus, the planet of the future.  He will spend his entire day on the computer, and his only fears are frying his CPU or a power outage.  Tell him your VCR needs setting, that your computer fonts are screwed up, or that you haven`t configured your new e-mail software yet.  Be a damsel in electronic distress. Over fiberoptic cables and phone modems you can find true love.<br><br>Be sure to send him frequent e-mail to show him you are thinking about him.  Meet at one of the new chat rooms, like The Palace or V-Chat, especially if you know one another well, and assume various avatars and speak to one another in a predetermined code language.  Attend computer user meetings together, catch the newest 3D flick (complete with 3D glasses) or play a virtual reality game.  Meet at a cyber cafe for coffee and surfing www.suck.com a deux.  Is all this getting a little too wired for you?  Aquarius also likes a good off-line party, so find out where one is happening and bring him along, or throw your own bash.<br><br>Don`t only rely on e-mail to reach your Aquarius, but also leave steamy love notes on his office answering machine (if it`s private), or call him on his car phone early in the day and make a "date" for one another that evening.  Say something memorable and get him all worked up.  But remember that for an Aquarius to fall deeply in love, they first have to be friends (this sign rules friendship).  Don`t rush him, or think you aren`t making "progress" fast enough.<br><br>He likes you wearing something current, short and sexy in a man-made fiber, so greet him tonight wearing nothing but Saran Wrap.  For going out, you might choose something in shiny stretch vinyl.  Sexually, Aquarius is lots of fun because he is so spontaneous and experimental.  He might visit a sexual aid shop and come home with a bag of little toys for you both to enjoy.  A sense of playfulness is essential with Aquarius and you`ll have to lighten up a bit to stay popular with him.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=blue]<strong>Aquarius Female </strong><br>The Aquarius woman is smart, independent, somewhat rebellious and a true original.  Part of the reason her man has fallen in love with her is the fact that she`s not a clinging vine.  Quite the contrary, she matches wits with her man, has a wide circle of her own friends, and prefers to stand on her own two feet.  Many Aquarius women are leaders in their field.  She`s analytical and her ability to communicate is highly developed.  If you want to get on her good side, use reason and logic rather than emotion.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Your Challenge will be to keep things from becoming boring or routine, which would spell disaster for your relationship.  She is not an easy little bird to catch, for once you feel you`ve got her in your hands (or arms) she`s flitted away again.  She will need her space, and with so many other guys buzzing around her (she tells you they`re just friends) you will need to steady your nerves.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Her best colors are bright fuchsia, cobalt blue or charcoal gray.  Aquarius women tend to wear streamlined, futuristic clothing and some Aquarius women don`t mind if they shock a bit.  Her taste in jewelry is unique and individual, even New Age, so you could do well by getting her a special crystal.  There is a uniqueness about the Aquarius woman, from her toes to her hair, she is always a bit different, on the cutting edge of what`s new and hot.<br><br>Another gift that would be a hit is a beeper with voice mail capability, all the better for you to leave her intimate love messages.  If you take her out to eat, better ask ahead of she likes a certain kind of food, for many Aquarians are vegetarians.  She does not need to be wined and dined in a five-star restaurant--she is just as happy in a noisy, lively bistro that serves good food and is a place where she might bump into friends.  (To get an Aquarius alone is a feat unto itself.)<br><br>Never inhibited in bed, Aquarius brings a sense of fun and playfulness to her lovemaking.  She may suggest a video to watch beforehand, since Aquarius are so electronically-oriented, or if you know her very well, she might consent to making your private video together, with her ground rules.  Since she loves being in the center of the action, tell her that you want make love to her in a semi-public place. Remember the movie set in Vietnam, called The Lover?  The lovers meet regularly in an apartment right off the street where city noises and people walking around outside the door are quite audible, and the very closeness of the street has an erotic effect on lovers.  Be inspired by this thought, perhaps at the next party you two attend.  Choose a room where she can hear other guests but where the two of you can temporarily disappear for some privacy, maybe a closet or pantry.  Don`t worry about her reaction to suggesting a quickie--if she knows you well, this is one lady who will be delighted!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=black]<strong>Pisces Male </strong><br>This man`s vivid imagination and sensitivity (matched in intensity only by fellow water sign Cancer) will endear him to you quickly.  Pisces` greatest strength is their creativity.  Neptune makes them brilliant at expressing themselves in symbols and gestures.  They therefore they make outstanding film makers, photographers, and dancers.  Their empathetic nature will make you fall in love with him quickly, for it is possible you`ve never met a man who knows the inner you so well.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Pisces sometimes loses himself in his work, especially if he`s in a creative field.  He needs a regular outlet to express his powerful emotions and insights on the world, so you will have to learn to be supportive of his efforts.  At times he can be hard to pin down, but this is usually due to his not yet having made up his mind about an issue.  Being a dual sign like Gemini, he likes to look at both sides of every situation before taking a stand.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>When trying to persuade a Pisces man of anything, do not use facts or logic; appeal to his emotions and intuition.  If you press any point too hard or become demanding, he will swim in the other direction.  He is gentle to others and expects to be treated in kind.  He hates ruts and constricting routines, so a free-form schedule in life is more to his liking.<br><br>Another important fact to remember is that Pisces will give freely of himself whenever he can, but if he feels he has been taken advantage of, he will retreat without warning.  At that point, it is hard to win back his trust.  The Pisces man needs to be appreciated.<br><br>This man is not materialistic or money-oriented--don`t bug him to ask for a raise or question why he doesn`t make more money.  He realizes that possessions and money are only earth-bound, temporal things that don`t matter much in the grand scheme.  He is too spiritual to be concerned with such mundane matters.  A deeply philosophical sign, money does not motivate him as much as self-_expression and creativity do.  (Money does have a way of finding a way to Pisces, nevertheless, so don`t think this is a sign doomed to poverty!)<br><br>Since Pisces reads body language better than any other sign, don`t be surprised if he just seems to know much more about you than you`ve ever told him.  Of course, verbal communication is important too, but keep it delicate and poetic.  When delivering criticism to him be diplomatic rather than direct.  Pisces men never like anything too gritty and hard-hitting.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>An ideal evening to a Pisces man would be to have dinner in an exotic Indian or Asian restaurant, and have a double espresso afterwards in a tiny, dark patisserie, debating a particular moral or ethical issue until the sun comes up.  Or take him to the movies--he can`t seem to see enough of them.<br><br>Since Pisces rules the feet, why not delight your man by surprising him with some special peppermint foot cream and a relaxing foot massage?  Their feet are the first area of their body to show signs of stress.  Now, the Pisces man`s first instinct is to pay attention to you first, so he will have to get used you lavishing attention of him.  Be sure to tell him just looking at his body is a wonderful turn-on for you; the Pisces man has less vanity than most signs and may be surprised to hear you say this!  Although he may not appear to need it, if you bolster his self-confidence in the bedroom he will turn into a dream lover for you!<br><br>A lush tropical island resort would be the perfect locale to seduce your Pisces beloved because he will feel refreshed and uninhibited near bodies of water.  On the appointed day, tell him you`ve packed a picnic lunch and drive him out to the prettiest waterfall you can find on the island (do your research first).  Bring along your Polaroid camera (Pisces rules photography) to capture some of the fun.  Wearing only a thin T-shirt and string bikini bottom, dare him to follow as you run under the falls.  Let yourself become totally drenched, hair and all.  Do all this quickly to capture the element of surprise and allow him a moment or two to stare at you in your clingy, now see-though T and skimpy bottom, laughing and beckoning him to join you.  Do you honestly not know how this scene ends?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=indigo]<strong>Pisces Female </strong><br>The Pisces temperament is gentle, romantic, caring, compassionate, and spiritual.  Pisces rules the subconscious mind, and so it follows that her dreams are vivid and meaningful, even prophetic.  You`ve got quite a glamorous sparkler on your hands--Elizabeth Taylor, Sharon Stone and Cindy Crawford are all dazzling Pisces, and each in their own way reflects the reserved and unpretentious Pisces nature.  Your Pisces enchantress almost always has large and beautiful eyes which mirror her feelings openly and she could be prone to cry easily.  Soft and ultra-feminine, she will put your needs ahead of hers.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Her feelings are very sensitive and easily hurt, so be careful how you address her.  In any relationship, she likes to proceed gradually, perhaps at a slower pace than you would like.  But rush her and your little fish will disappear into the depths of the sea.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>She`s mystical and poetic and she needs a regular outlet for her creative expressions.  Her sign rules all non-verbal communication--symbols, gesture, dance, art, and poetry--and the Pisces woman is highly intuitive.  She trusts her feelings and she reads body language perfectly, so don`t try to say one thing and mean another--she will catch on quickly.  Pisces will need to be alone occasionally to recharge and refresh herself, so allow her time for that.<br><br>She`s caring and sensitive to her man, but can easily be so self-effacing that she forgets her own needs.  Her urge to relieve suffering in others is as strong as the life force and it is the single most<br>important element of her nature to understand.  Some people will sometimes take advantage of her good nature.  Her man should help her by reminding her that it`s OK to say no to favors others ask of her.  At times the world can have a wearing-down effect on her self-confidence, which sometimes needs rebuilding in even the strongest Pisces women.  When Pisces is hurt, she will build her own version of the world to protect herself, preferring to live in a world of dreams until she feels she is ready for re-entry into reality.  Realize this is not a weakness--she will always come back--and the worst thing you could say to this fragile beauty is "Get real!"<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Don`t be overtly sexual with Pisces--she is subtle and indirect.  Come across brash and aggressive and she`ll vanish.  Instead, give her a book of romantic poetry, like that of Edna St. Vincent Millay or a beautiful black &amp; white photograph of a couple kissing.  Or give her music, perhaps something soothing and spiritual, such as Enya, Orion or Monks singing Gregorian chant.<br><br>Buy her clothing in one of her favorite shades of violet, blue or sea green.  She loves lace, angora sweaters, and prefers flowing, soft chiffon-type fabrics over sharp tailoring.  Silk is favored over crisp cotton.  Sparkling jewels look especially beautiful on her, so consider surprising her with diamonds, amethysts or aquamarine stones.  In choosing a restaurant, pick a dark, private, romantic place filled with flowers.  She loves to dance (Pisces rules the feet) so take her to a club with a great band.  She also loves the movies, for her ruler, Neptune, rules film and she can easily lose herself in the story.  She will also adore tickets to the ballet, an art opening or a poetry reading.  Finally, surprise her a deluxe shower head for her bathroom (Pisces is a water sign), promising her that the two of you will play under it soon.<br><br>Sex to Pisces is spiritual.  She simply cannot sleep with a man she isn`t in love with.  She`s worth waiting for--her natural sense of rhythm and grace in body movement makes her a fabulous lover.  This does not preclude her from having fun with her lover--that is a certainty--but she will need a full commitment of love from you before surrendering.<br><br>No other sign loves costume and fantasy as much as Pisces does, so when you get to know her well, suggest you both go shopping together for an outfit to wear in the bedroom--a French maid?  Cleopatra? Elvira, Mistress of the Dark?  Her rich imagination needs fantasy, so you will be on the right track.  If she is a reserved Pisces, give her a gift-wrapped bottle of her favorite scent tucked inside the pocket of a new luxurious terry robe.  She`ll be happy to try her new robe on--just tell her the rules are that she wear nothing else.  Then draw her close to you, turn on the water in the bath and take a long, passionate and steamy soak together.  Afterwards, be sure to rub on some of the softy scented cream that you bought and let nature take its course!</div>
