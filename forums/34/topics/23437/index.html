            <div class='col-md body'>ARIES March 21 - April 20<br><br>Nothing seems to ruffle you more than a lack of discipline,disloyalty<br>and decorum. But Arians are also known to go into a rage very easily<br>when challenged. Those of you who have been on the receiving end of the Aries<br>temper know that if not calmed down they can even get violent. But one<br>thing is certain - if the opponent remains calm and does not react to<br>their outburst, Arians cool down very fast. They are also the first to<br>apologise, which makes them easier to forgive.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>TAURUS April 21 - May 20<br><br>You are generally quiet and have control over your emotions. It is<br>difficult to predict what will upset you, so when you do lose your cool,<br>people don't know how to react. Your temper is like that of a raging<br>bull,and anyone trying to pacify you will be the first one to get a<br>verbal!  bashing. You generally get upset when you are cornered or when people<br>accuse you of doing something wrong. You also hate being reminded about<br>mistakes you've made in the past. You also have the potential to be<br>terribly vindictive if rubbed the wrong way.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>GEMINI May 21 - June 20<br><br>You are recognised by your cheerful disposition and your jovial nature<br>is not easily susceptible to anger. In fact, you are the best person to<br>have around when there is an ugly scene at a party - you can bring the<br>warring factions together quite diplomatically.. But when you lose your<br>cool, you yell and scream and will not listen to reason. You must have<br>the last word in a wordy duel. Your capacity to argue aggressively is<br>matched only by your seductive charm.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------! -------------------<br>CANCER June 21 - July 21<br><br>Considering how charming, caring, and kind you are, you dislike<br>unpleasant scenes, much less creating one yourself. You have great<br>tolerance and rarely get provoked into losing your temper. If someone is<br>unreasonable or trying to create trouble, you are more likely to walk<br>away quietly. But that does not mean you do not have a temper. When angry, in<br>your effort control your emotions, you tremble, your hands get sweaty, and<br>sometimes you fumble for words. Tears roll down your eyes easily and the<br>opponent is touched by your innocence and will seek an apology immediately.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>LEO July 22 - August 21<br><br>If anyone has total control over their emotions, it is you. But then,<br>you can be described as stiff, cold and uncaring. You are known to lack<br>spontaneity but you really ! don't care about opinions. You don't like to<br>create scenes and will never accept invitations to a party where you<br>suspect the presence of an unruly lot. But your very presence seems<br>challenging to some and they take vicarious pleasure in your disquiet.<br>When angry you can use very critical language. A dressing-down can<br>humiliate your opponent, causing a strain between both of you forever<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>VIRGO August 22 - September 21<br><br>Most of you are gentle and have full control over your emotions, but<br>those of you given to temper tantrums can certainly get violent. When<br>seething with rage, you yell and shout and tend to break things lying<br>close at hand. You can even harm yourself by banging your hands on a<br>glass top table or wall. You should never get into any argument, for you are a<br>sore loser. You feel that othe! rs are trying to persecute you and don't<br>quite respect your opinions. When hurt, you can also hold grudges forever.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>LIBRA September 22 - October 22<br><br>Did someone say that you are the charmers of the zodiac? Well, it's<br>true. Few have ever seen you ruffled or angry. You are very conscious of<br>your image, and you believe that anger distorts your face and personality.<br>You also think you are above things like anger. But wait before you get<br>into self-congratulatory mood. Your family or those very close to you<br>know you better. You have an unmatched temper amongst all the zodiac signs,<br>and what makes it worse is your capacity to justify it. (i think this is<br>right isnt it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>SCORPIO October 23 - November 21<br><br>Of course you don't lose! your cool. But your very demeanour projects<br>haughtiness, pride and grand disdain for lesser mortals. Others are often<br>found saying that anger sits on your nose, and you are raring to give<br>your peace of mind to the first person who tries to act funny with you. You<br>are selective in the choice of your friends, and have a low tolerance for<br>the superfluous types. Your tongue-lashing generally in a soft hissing tone,<br>for when you scream your voice tends to get shrill and loud, and you do<br>hate drawing attention to yourself! When upset, you are angrier with<br>yourself for having shown weakness, for the last thing that Scorpio<br>wants to show is being out of control.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>SAGITTARIUS November 22 - December 20<br><br>You are gentle and generally have complete control over your emotions.<br>You do not get angry quickly and others marv! el at your tolerance levels<br>even when provoked. Actually, you get tongue-tied when angry and you<br>will walk away from an ugly scene waiting for the other person to calm down.<br>Then you will reason with your opponent and convince the other person in<br>a very gentle manner that the whole thing was just a silly mistake .<br>You're also likely to totally sever ties with someone when you're upset with them.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>CAPRICORN December 21 - January 19<br><br>Few will believe that a hardcore practical and materialistic person like<br>you is capable of sensitivity and genuine emotions. You project a hard<br>exterior but are actually very sensitive, a trait you successfully hide<br>from others. You can be seething with anger but will not betray your<br>feelings. But then there are times that even you cannot control your<br>temper. Und! er such circumstances you can shout and scream, more with<br>frustration at the situation than with anger at any particular person.<br>Your outbursts can shock others and can make them feel guilty too.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>AQUARIUS January 20 - February 18<br><br>You are noble and kind and dislike losing control over your emotions.<br>It is very rare for you to get angry. You are also the pacifier in<br>situations that involve arguments. It is always your endeavour to be perfect and<br>socially correct in your behaviour and attitude, but if misunderstood and<br>slighted you can give in to an angry outburst. You will shout and scream<br>and then walk out from the scene. You cannot easily forget the situation<br>and will be bitter about it for a long time.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>PISCES February 19 - March 20!<br><br>The only thing that can be said about you dreamers is that you appear<br>even more attractive when angry. You are very sensitive to others'<br>feelings,so you rarely hurt them. But when others tend to hurt you, then<br>things take a nasty turn. You will yell and use harsh words, and feel<br>inclined to shake everything and everyone up. Your creative imagery is<br>at its best when angry, and you tend to get pretty dramatic. When upset,<br>you refuse to listen to reason and wish to be left alone. But once you calm<br>down, you repent your tantrums and seek forgiveness. So nobody can be<br>upset with you for too long.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: DarkRed;"><strong>Believe in horoscope?</strong></span><br><br>You As A Friend<br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Aries</strong><br>Your friendship must be warm and on the level. Let me put it this way. You are a fine friend and a formidable foe. With Aries, things are never done by halves. Aries expects total devotion and sincerity in friendship. In turn, he/she extends a loving and strong hand.</span><br><br><span style="color: Indigo;"><strong>Taurus</strong><br>A good friend, though not a particularly brilliant one. Many times, family members and close relatives end up as friends. Yes, a Taurean can give himself/herself freely with time, and money, and practical advise. The Taurean likes friends, to be happy and in comfort. The Taurean hates to lose a friend, as the attachment is strong, and will often go out of the way to maintain a relationship. Taurean can be patient, persuasive, persistent with friends.</span><br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Gemini</strong><br>An amusing friend and according to me a good one. Gemini can return love, responds beautifully to a little appreciation. Gemini often feels --but wrongly so -- that others don't do enough for him/her. Young at heart, you could be the life of a group. Whatever others might say about you, I do maintain that you excel in human relationships.</span><br><br><span style="color: Indigo;"><strong>Cancer</strong><br>Your loyalty and attachments to people make you a friend worth his or her weight in gold. However, see that you do not expect too much out of friendship. Always ready to give, you are likely to be bitterly disappointed when friends do not live up to your own image of them. However, you will seldom cut your friendship ties and do much more for friends than they did for you. A good, solid friend!</span><br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Leo</strong><br>As a friend you are worth your weight in pure gold. Leo is a mighty good friend. He / She does not ditch people. Leo is very warm hearted and sincere. Your idealism and romanticism comes through very strongly here. Blessed is the person who has a Leo friend.</span><br><br><span style="color: Indigo;"><strong>Virgo</strong><br>Understand, Virgo, that yours is a sign of service and communal living. It is a humane sign. Therefore, you need friends, though you may acknowledge it. In friendship, Virgo is at his best. Virgo may not be a hearty type. But Virgo will be steady and extremely reliable as a friend. Whatever advice and suggestions Virgo gives will be practical and to the point. Virgo hates to break off any relationship. A Virgo friend is a solid friend. He/She is worth the price in platinum.</span><br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Libra</strong><br>You can give good advice to a friend and any friend who follows up will never come to grief. But if you expect Libra to give the heart also, you could be disillusioned. This does not mean that Libra is cold. It only means that you Libreans are often detached. You can be a good friend. It only means that one should not  expect the impossible from a Libra. But Libra is excellent company. Libra has finesse and grace. Let me say, Libra is the lubricant in all human relationship.</span><br><br><span style="color: Indigo;"><strong>Scorpio</strong><br>There's explosive element here, pure dynamite, if you ask me. However good friend you may be -- and you are good - do not be secretive and wear a mask. Yes ,you are discriminative in friendship and psychologically speaking, a disturbed family background, sometimes tragically so, is responsible for it. In friendships, you are intensely loyal. Though you do and can appear detached, you are ultra-sensitive, specially in pride and self-respect. You are a little too over- bearing, never a happy ground for a stable friendship. Secrets will be well kept. Do not attach too much importance to minor lapses on the part of friends. You could be betrayed, resulting in a complete severing of all ties. </span><br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Sagittarius</strong><br>Generous to a fault and very helpful, you evidently make a good  friend. If friends follow your advise they will be happy. Yes, you can guide them very well. Your intuition comes into full play in friendship. You will do more for them than they do for you. Even if your friends fail you - and many of them will -- there will be no resentment and hatred. But your own  prejudices will blind you on many occasions. With Sagittarius likes and dislikes are intense. </span><br><br><span style="color: Indigo;"><strong>Capricorn</strong><br>Once the initial hurdles are crossed, you will prove to be the old faithful. See that snobbery does not come into the way of true friendship. While you may not be very tactful and polished in  your manners and talk, you won't fail a friend in an emergency. Try to reach out more, please.</span><br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Aquarius</strong><br>Aquarians can be better counselors than friends. The reason is that, though emotionally involved, they can think clearly and visualize situations and problems creatively. As yours is the sign of friendship, It do predict that your friends will receive both warmth and guidance from you.</span><br><br><span style="color: Indigo;"><strong>Pisces</strong><br>A good friend ,humane, understanding, if slightly unconventional. Yes, you can understand a person intuitively, help him without a show of exuberance. The friendship may have an unworldly touch about it. But your advise should be worth following. A word of warning. Do not expect the impossible here. People have feet of clay and so, I am afraid , do you. Accept them for what they are worth, and let not idealism crowd judgement our innate grace and diplomacy could help save an unpleasant situation.</span><br><br><span style="color: DarkRed;"><strong>A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.-- Walter Winchell</strong></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Dos And Don'ts For All Zodiac Signs</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Aries (Mar 21 - Apr 19)</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Aries are naturally active and vibrant people and they tend to like such people too. You will have to increase your pace to be in step with them. They like and appreciate frank and straightforward persons. With them you can be your true self (but don't try your luck being over frank-they are volatile). If you are in love with an Arien, then you have to show your enthusiasm in all their activities (you can always yawn later!).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not tell an Aries that s/he may be wrong. Any such statement may stir a storm in a teacup. Aries are very faithful and passionate lovers. Do not give air to the smouldering fire within them by making them jealous. No flirtation or fooling around with others in their presence unless of course you wish to write your death wish (you will be granted!).<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Taurus  (Apr 20 - May 20)</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Stability and dependability characterise Taurus. They like people who can blend and grow with them. If you have a Taurus partner you should appreciate all things bright and beautiful. They have an inherent artistic sense and are fond of colour and music. Judge life with them from a purely materialistic point of view. Enjoy everything luxurious that money can provide. Enjoy good food (better if you can cook to please them) and good drinks with them.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Taurus do not loose their temper easily (in fact you may spend the whole life with them and still no spark) but you should not push your luck too much. Being unreasonable or aggressive with them may get you into trouble. Do not press him/her into a corner, and if you do, be prepared for a violent rage. Taurus is capable of violent outbursts though such an event is is very rare occasions. They can be suffocating when they are possessive about you.<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Gemini (May 21 - June 21)</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Gemini is a highly intellectual and versatile person. If you have a Gemini partner you have to match your wits with his/her wits to keep the zing in the relationship. They want to be mentally stimulated so you have to be good at conversing. Your sense of humour will get you a permanent residence in the heart of a Gemini. Be more communicative with them, and if you are good at this, you will never know how hours pass by holding each other's hand.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Gemini's like to do many things at the same time, so if unfortunately you are the type who is looking for stability you may get disappointed. Do not hold back a Gemini or you may lose him/her, as they are restless and need change in life constantly. You should try to adopt yourself with the ever-changing Gemini. Orthodox or conservative old fashion ideas are no-no in their dictionary. Change with the ever-changing Gemini and do not flow against the current.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Cancer (Jun22 - July 22)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Try to adapt yourself with the changing moods of the Cancer. At one moment they may be laughing and enjoying and in another they may sulk. You may have to adjust with the moody and sensitive Cancer. They are like the tides in the ocean, always fluctuating. Cancerians love food, so if you know how to cook and can be poetic and romantic (added Bonus) then you know the way to their heart.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Cancerians are very sensitive people and can get easily hurt. So do not play with their emotions and sentiments. They are like tides that can sweep you along. They form emotional bonds with even inanimate things, so do not ask them to discard old caps or souvenirs. Such things hold special meaning to them. You have to realise that the crabs have a soft heart and are vulnerable. Do not contradict their tested line of thought and action, it would only lead to confusion.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Leo (Sep 22 - Oct23)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>If you have Leo partner respect him and his majestic manners. Accept the advice of Leo, the lion, as he is the king of the jungle. It is the sign of a showman, so if your partner does everything in grand style enjoy it. They fall easily for flattery and want to be centre of attraction of all eyes (sometimes they can be quiet theatrical too).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Never ever hurt the ego of a Leo. Pride, ego and vanity are some of the bags Leo's always carry with them. Do not touch these bags. An authoritative Leo is even more difficult to handle in such circumstances. Leo is a sunny sign so they do not like people who are gloomy or depressed. Even if you are crying at heart keep a sunny smile on your lips and then let the lion take charge and remove all worries from your life.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept22)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Virgo's are very methodical and have a great sense of duty. Howver, they are blind to their own faults. So, if you have a Virgo partner emphasise more on their qualities. Take keen interest in what they are doing and you will realise that they will go out of their way to help you. Do rely and appreciate their mental powers rather than their physical powers. They can turn even an unsuccessful venture into a success.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not push a Virgo into limelight or on the centre stage unless of course they do so on their own. They are shy and reserved by nature and do not like to be the cynosure of all eyes. Virgo's have secrets that they would not like to bring out in the open. So, even if you have the key to their secret skeleton-closet, hide it; do not even admit that you know anything about it. Virgo, the virgins, do not want to tarnish their public image.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Libra (Sep 22 - Oct 23)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Librans need peace and harmony in all their relationships, so help them maintain that. Venus, the ruling planet, gives them beauty and they have weakness for people who can compliment them about their beauty (you will not have to make an effort to do that anyway). You can help Libra seek union and partnership in life. If you have a Libra partner you can be sure to share beautiful and pleasurable moments together.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Libra is kind and gentle soul but very argumentative. Hence, do not start an argument or discussion unless, of course, you are free and do not know how to pass your time. They hate to lose and most probably during an argument may change sides too (remember scales can tilt) and still continue arguing from the other side. Do not push your Libra partner into making decisions. They will keep weighing pros and cons and may still not be able to come to any decision. Have patience!<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Novr 21)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Scorpio's are full of passion and zest for life. They have tremendous drive that can involve you too. Tune in to their wavelength and you can enjoy the harmony and music of life with them. Scorpio's are loyal and never forget a kind deed done by you. If you want to enjoy life with your Scorpio lover, share their passion and intensity and you will be fascinated by how beautiful life can be with them.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Scorpio's are very passionate and intense but they are also fiercely possessive and would like to possess your mind, body and soul. Do not let seeds of jealousy grow in them because then you may have to suffer agonies of jealousy and discontentment in life. Scorpio's have explosive tempers Â– be careful how you handle them. They never let anyone know what is going on in their mind till they strike and you may be caught unawares. Do not flirt around in the presence of your Scorpio lover.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Sagittarius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Sagittarius is basically a happy go lucky kind. You can enjoy with them their zest and enthusiasm for life. They bubble with excitement. And if you share the same interests and hobbies, life can be great fun together. They are frank and straightforward so if you want some truthful opinion about anything or anyone Â– go to them. Be optimistic as they are and view life as glass half full.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Sagittarius is fiercely independent and cannot tolerate restriction. Hence, do not try to hold them back in life. Let them enjoy their freedom because if you hold any special place in their heart they will always come back for you. Do not feel irritated by the exaggeration in their speech. They may go on and on, talking about certain things that may not even interest you, but its their way of trying to communicate with you. They are basically frank and outspoken (to the point of being rude), so do not feel offended by their talks.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 20)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Capricornians are strong and dependable. Hence, if you want to put your money on anyone it is of course this zodiac sign. They are practical and conservative in their outlook and they expect you to blend in their colour. They set certain standards for themselves in their life and they will always try to maintain those standards. For them social status and image is very important in life.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not expect a Capricorn mate to open his/her heart and pour everything to you. They are very secretive and reserved people. They are very thorough in all their affairs and hate any kind of sloppiness. People born under this zodiac are very tight-fisted and economical. Do not expect lavish gifts from them and if they do give you any gift (that is very rare) it will have some practical use (no romance please) but that does not mean you will be deprived of anything; on the contrary you will be well provided.<br><strong><br><span style="color: indigo;">Aquarius (Jan 21 - Feb 21)</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Aquarius are friendly and fascinating people. They have in-depth knowledge about various subjects and you can converse with them for hours without getting bored. They are capable of giving a lot of love that can be amazing. They have a very broad outlook of life and you can relax in their presence. They will always welcome your ideas and actions about humanitarian causes. To keep an Aquarius lover interested you must possess that mysterious and intriguing quality. Once hooked they will always be very faithful to you.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not expect or plan a normal, simple and predictable life with an Aquarius partner. Aquarians are totally unpredictable. They can go to any direction without giving any advance notice. They are basically very restless and get bored easily. Though they are very friendly, do not expect them to reveal their inner most feelings to you (they never will). They can be detached and impersonal, which may seem strange to others.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Pisces (Feb 22 - Mar 21)</strong></span><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Pisceans are sensitive and charming. If you are looking for someone who is understanding and can understand your feelings then you have met the right person. You should appreciate their feelings too, as in your time of need they are sure to help you. Pisces have a keenly developed sixth sense and have great intuitive powers. Their hunches may usually be right on mark. But they can exhaust their physical and mental energies. They are born dreamers and you can build palaces with your dream lover (only in real life it may become a little difficult preposition).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Pisces are dreamers and you should not expect them to have worldly ambitions. They are not materialistic in nature. It is not that they like living below the poverty line but they have no earnest desire to accumulate wealth. They are very sensitive and you have to be always careful about their feelings. The fishes are capable of drowning you in their tears (even men born under this sign).<br></div>

Your Virgo male won't divorce you, once in love, it's for keeps!</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Libra Female [September 24-October 23 - Libra]<br><br>If you are dating a Libra female, take her to a wine tasting, the theatre, your Cousin's wedding, anyplace sociable. She likes elegance and beauty.<br><br>Dress in your Sunday best. Bring her flowers, cards and special little feminine gifts. She'll be thoughtful too. Although Libra women are the ultimate in fashion and femininity, they are big flirts. However, underneath it all, they really want to be married to one darling man, who will romance them eternally.<br><br>Flirt back with her, she loves little games. You can fall in love anytime you want to with her. Your car isn't as important, as how you treat her. Gently please, no conflict! Your Libra female probably won't have children, but she will have her fluffy lap dog, everywhere you go.<br><br>She isn't the type to cheat on you, unless you forget about romance. Your occupation isn't that important. Be sure to earn enough money to support her frequent shopping trips to the mall. She loves to decorate, so step back at home. You can do the outside domestic duties. You get to wash the car and mow the lawn. When you propose to her, present her with your poetic love vows, and promise to hire a maid for her. Libra females love to be married!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Libra Male [September 24-October 23 - Libra]<br><br>If you are dating a Libra male, your first date will be in a romantic restaurant, highlighted with a wonderful wine list. During dinner just smile and be sweet. Libra men don't like vulgarity in any form. Dress tastefully, and do use your flower scented perfume. He loves women who dress up, wear jewelry, use makeup, and are happy being feminine. He is fascinated with fantasy, including sexual fantasy. Don't discuss your recent love life, or ex-husbands. He could care less about your children, or desire to have them.<br><br>Don't be argumentative. Libra males hate conflict. You can discuss your latest painting, the last book you read, or what your plans are for interior decorating. Libra males love cozy fires, and sensuous females near it.<br><br>Fore play is a big high for Libra males. He is not a wimp, by any means, although, he loves to please!

Show up wearing black clothes that fit you well. Arrive in your black car with the dark tinted windows. She likes the dark places, so take her to the bars, a casino would be fab! Don't tell her about the drugs you are on, she won't tell you about hers either.<br><br>There needs to be caution exercised here, because Scorpios are one of two extremes. One the saint, the other the sinner. The first type of Scorpio is very religious, and does not smoke, drink, or do drugs. If you are on a blind date, you will know which version you are dating. Neither type is hung up on what you wear, but more how you wear it. Have sex appeal.<br><br>Be interested in occult matters, be deep. She won't offer you much information about herself, you will have to guess. Scorpio females will pry your whole life story out of you. To keep her interested, be hard to get. You won't know if you are pleasing her, or where you stand.<br><br>A fatal mistake is to anger a Scorpio female. Scorpio women will get you! She has a passionate nature and can have more than one love interest. They are not usually domestic, nor want to be involved with parenthood. She will put all of her intense energy into either partying or getting to the top. Female Scorpios are "all or nothing", even when it comes to marriage.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Scorpio Male [October 24-November 22 - Scorpio]<br><br>If you are dating a Scorpio male, make sure you love secrets! He loves for you to be sexy and downright sleazy works for him too. He can make love to you, and not be in love with you. His passion can fool women, don't mistake it for love. Oftentimes, they are most in love when they can't possess or own you. Jealousy is a big issue with him. He stays jealous. He does not care what you do for an occupation, nor your financial status.<br><br>Scorpio males want to control you to conform to their ideas of living. So, if you aren't strong in your own identity, then you will lose him. Scorpio males like the challenge of ownership. They love you most when they can't have complete control over you. Only the fearless need apply here. One type of Scorpio will marry you and stay put and dominates the household. Whereas, the other type will just disappear on you without warning or reason. Be true to yourself with Scorpio males, and let your personality stay on top!</span><br><span style="color: indigo;">Sagittarius Female [November 23-December 21 - Sagittarius]<br><br>If you are dating a Sagittarius Female, be ready willing and able to go anywhere.

She'll want to go with you.<br><br>Don't do the same things twice in a row. She won't care who you are dating, because she has plenty of men friends. Sagittarius women can be ready for a date on a momentÂ’s notice. She'll be great at men's activities, like softball, and eating the worm from a Tequila bottle. She will have been everywhere, but darn, Sagittarius females are fun to be around. You can win her heart with variety in your lovemaking.<br><br>She isn't the type to spend time in the kitchen or babysitting. Show her you want to be a companion in all of her zany schemes. When she falls for you, she will ask you to do things with her. Marriage is not on her mind, but she would marry you, if she felt you were compatible enough. Sagittarius women love their freedom!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Sagittarius Male [November 23-December 21 - Sagittarius]<br><br>If you are dating a Sagittarius male, expect anything and everything. He is not very reliable about schedules, dates, or you. Not in the beginning anyway. He likes talkative women and female jocks. He wants a buddy to join him in his pursuits.<br><br>Most Sagittarius males are employed in sales/traveling jobs. They can have a gal in every port. Let him tell you he is serious about you first. Sagittarius males only get married when they have to, and then they can't seem to stay married. They love the thrill and adventure of chasing a woman, similar to their love of hunting, fishing, and sports. You rank in there somewhere. You can get used to being a hunting widow, sports widow, etc., with a Sagittarius male! You should love the same things he does.<br><br>Sagittarius men can be very funny and interesting.

Sagittarius men dread the thought of a tuxedo, and the stares from wedding guests. You will have to drag your Sagittarius male to the altar!</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Capricorn Female [December 22-January 20 - Capricorn]<br><br>If you are dating a Capricorn female, take her to dinner at the best restaurant in town, arrive in a limousine with flowers. Dress in your designer clothes, and be impeccable. Pinstripes and subtle scents arouse her. Be successful at whatever you are undertaking. Let her know about it.<br><br>It's ok, to tell her you made two million last year. Don't be cheap. Tell her you have been saving yourself for the right woman, and that you have been working your buns off, to build your empire. Tell her you need someone to share this big business burden with, and that your thoughts are about expanding your business. Hint that a woman would be perfect as a manager in your new expansion. She will be so intrigued, that she will offer you sound business suggestions. She is SMART! Capricorn females won't compete with you, they'll help climb the ladder. Don't forget about her. She loves expensive presents with thought behind them. Her little "black book" is filled with business appointments, not telephone numbers. Capricorn women are almost always successful in whatever they undertake. They don't take enough time to eat, so take her to lunch, dinner and your next corporate meeting. Business thrills them. She may seem cold emotionally, but don't be fooled. She has those sexual infernos, looking for a release!<br><br>She does not trust men entirely, so don't give her the bums rush, or you will be part of the homeless. She would be a great wife to a success-oriented man.<br><br>She can entertain your clients, and friends. Capricorn females, can be boss in marriage too.

He will take you to places with class and ambience. He will pick you up in his black, luxury car. You will be treated like a lady. Therefore, you should let him open the doors, etc.<br><br>Dress in style, but be sure you show some cleavage. Still waters run deep with Capricorn males. Your first dates will seem like business meetings, but eventually you will get to know him. He is insecure about his emotions and likes to keep them under control. Of course, he won't make this obvious.<br><br>Compliment him on his achievements and he will open up to you. He would be strict as a parent, and holds very traditional beliefs about relationships. Don't be an airhead or aimless. He appreciates a hard working woman, whom he can consider an equal.<br><br>He does not know how to play, so you will have to lighten him up with your humorous antics and fun loving side. Once your Capricorn man commits, he will not leave you. Divorce is a nasty word in his vocabulary. Capricorn males make good husbands and breadwinners.<br><br>They are extravagant with gifts to those whom they love. Marriage will have to be his idea, not yours! </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Aquarius Female [January 21-February 19 - Aquarius]<br><br>If you are dating an Aquarius female, arrive in your restored classic. Wear a funky hat and clothes that shouldn't go together, but somehow do.<br><br>Take her to an out of the way coffee house, featuring jazz. Feel free to discuss anything and everything. She is an intelligent listener, and will have some bizarre insight of her own. You'll never truly understand her, so bring a tape recorder for instant replay to sort it out later.<br><br>Aquarius women are unusual, not necessarily hippies, but aware of the entire globe. She won't be ready to jump in the sack on the first date, she has to get to know you. Be fascinating, tell her that you are going to Spain to run with the bulls. Explain your philosophy on combining chemicals to combat radiation.<br><br>Tell her about your thesis which was published in the "International Who Dunnit Magazine". Don't tell her you are in love with her too soon. You will know when she has taken a strong liking to you. That is when your Aquarius female will invite you to her abode. Then you will see the real Aquarius female.<br><br>There will be many unusual pictures, and books. There is a story connected to all of her belongings. When your Aquarius female commits to you, she will not necessarily be ready for marriage. That is just her way of saying she likes you. You must have like minds, or there will be no future Mrs. Anybody!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Aquarius Male [January 21-February 19 - Aquarius]<br><br>If you are dating an Aquarius male, consider yourself lucky to even get the first date. Aquarius males don't date much. They would rather be an observer, hanging out on the scene. He would prefer to go to your house and have long talks into the night, and possibly just stay over.<br><br>He may tell you that he just videotaped an erotica video featuring wild animals at the zoo with some vacationing starlets. He may stay at your house, never cook or clean, but just be there, when you come home from work. Then one day, without warning, he will be gone.<br><br>If he is employed, he can be quite selfish with his money. He likes his freedom, in every way.

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=DarkBlue]<strong>Aries in Love</strong> [ March 21-April 19 ] [ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Aries is the cardinal-fire sign which translates into life loving and highly energized and this describes their needs concerning love as well. As a partner they make life exciting, albeit occasionally tiring, and you cannot help but feel rather joyful and light hearted when you're in their company. It's that blend of innocence (the lamb) with pure power (the ram) that is so captivating about an Aries mate. They don't understand the meaning of the word routine, however, and boredom is the number one killer of Aries romances. Aries loves as boldly and as strongly as it experiences life. From sports to personal challenges Aries are usually not happy unless they are moving after something. With Mars as their ruling planet oftentimes their entire lives are about channeling and putting that immense power to work for them. It's not uncommon to find an Aries firmly committed to a long term volatile arrangement that leaves those around them wondering why they would stay. The truth is they often thrive on that kind of intensity and it can do far less damage than existing within a relationship that has grown routine and stagnant.<br>When an Aries loves they LOVE. The partner is hoisted up onto a pedestal whether they want to be there or not and they become a treasure to be protected and guarded passionately. The love of an Aries life often becomes the driving motivation for their challenging goals and the phrase, "I did this for YOU" is one heard in many of the best Aries relationships.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Aries Sexuality:</span></strong> An Aries sexuality is driven, powerful and almost a feat of showmanship when they are truly captivated. Since Aries tend to be action/goal oriented sex can become a series of higher plateaus involving anything their fertile imaginations can conjure up. Aries are the zodiac show-off and the bedroom isn't excluded from their dramatic and captivating ability to get partners undivided attention. The more appreciated they feel the more they invest in their lovemaking and private boundaries exist only to give an Aries something to leap over. Marathons of passion, spontaneous liaisons in the most unexpected places and inexhaustible stamina are all part of the Aries basic sexual make-up.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story:</span></strong> Lots of pampering and a lot of attention is needed with an Aries lover as they thrive on feeling they are number one in your life. They love to do the initial chasing and are usually not attracted to being chased but once their heart is given you can't ever over-do your displays of affection. While they can be jealous and possessive you cannot show the same qualities and any kind of clinging is a sure fire way to drive them into new pastures. Under all the Aries bravado and show is actually a rather innocent child who simply wants to explore the wonderful world around them and to be appreciated. The more encouraged they are in either area the more exuberant they become.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love:</span></strong> Exuberance, expressiveness, passion, generosity, adoration, protectiveness, adventuress, fun loving, creative and energized lovemaking, and devotion.<br>Negative traits: Temperamental, jealous, possessive, ego oriented, inconsiderate, reckless, fickle<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What an Aries likes:</span></strong><br>Being number one, A positive attitude, A life loving comrade, A. partner who has style or a 'look', Being Seen Getting gifts, Loyalty, Being active together. Romance and dazzle.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What an Aries Dislikes:</span></strong><br>Being bored, Being chased, Sloppiness in a mate, Criticism, Anything mundane, Feeling unappreciated, Feeling inferior, Losing, Having to repeat things. Displays of insecurity.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Aries Love Keywords:</span></strong><br>Dramatic, romantic, original, passionate, energized, creative, spontaneous.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Taurus in Love</strong> [ April 20-May 20 ] [ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Taurus is a stable and earthy sign and their partnerships require an equally strong and centered base. There is a definite serious approach to life which is held by every Taurus in one degree or another and a partner who can at least understand this facet of them is important. They make generous, loyal and extremely supportive mates when they feel the relationship is true and secure but getting them to that point generally takes a great deal of time and effort. Taurus cherishes waiting, watching and being assured of something's value before they invest their heart and feelings. They will retreat at any sign of flakiness or instability and once a Taurus retreats getting them back to the point they started at is difficult, if not impossible. Although they are slow to trust and give once they do their trust is almost a magical thing and very little can shake it. Even when the generosity is not earned a Taurus deeply committed will very often hold on to the smallest shred of hope that everything is all right. As partners they are homebodies and enjoy their surroundings and all things which they can possess and embrace. They intuitively collect and protect and their 'people' often fall into this category. A Taurus expects loyalty and support from their mate and also to be the boss in the relationship.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Taurus Sexuality:</span></strong> Earthy, sensual and caring are hallmarks of Taurus sexuality. For Taurus sex is a natural, healthy and all important part of their relationship and they immerse themselves in it. Love and sex are one and the same to a Taurus and it is only when firmly committed that most can truly let go and enjoy. Bedroom Olympics and exciting kinky escapades are not their cup of tea and they tend to hold onto their personal favorites. But they believe in sharing their pleasure and work diligently to make sure their partner enjoys the passion as much as they do.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The Long-term story:</span></strong> Keeping it together over the long term requires a thorough understanding of the Taurean ways. As a fixed earth sign they are almost immovable, especially if they feel they are being forced into something. Knowing their ways and encouraging any change ever so slowly assures the relationship of moving forward and remaining vibrant. It takes a great deal to truly anger a Taurus once it is in love but disloyalty will usually be the ultimate factor. Yet as slow as they are to attach they are equally slow to detach and break-ups tend to hang on eternally. Once a Taurus truly closes its heart, however, there is very little chance they will open back up.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The Problem Zone:</span></strong> In a relationship with a Taurus most of the troubles will emerge over jealousy, possessiveness and inability to change. They can be immovable forces when they so desire and if they have decided they are perfectly happy with something exactly as it is no one can force them to change. There is a tendency for them to see people they love as cherished personal objects and this can turn into a very strong jealousy factor. Letting go can also be a problem for the same reasons.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive traits in love:</span></strong> Loyal, dedicated, generous, protective, caring, doting, understanding, stability.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative Traits in love:</span></strong> Jealousy, possessiveness, control, immobility, over-seriousness.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">A Taurus Likes:</span></strong>Feeling secure, Being pampered, Kept promises, Sensibility, Being on time, Together time at home, Sharing good meals, Unhurried affection, Commitments, Stability in a mate, Getting special gifts.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">A Taurus Dislikes:</span></strong> Being hurried, Being told what to do, Flightiness in a partner, Unexpected changes in plans, Loud, noisy party scenes, Careless or unappealing environments, Forgetfulness in a mate.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Taurus Love Keywords:</span></strong>Loyal, stable, sentimental, sexual, loving, possessive, jealous, controlling.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=DarkRed]<strong>Gemini in Love</strong> [ May 21-June 21 ] [ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Gemini is the mutable air sign ruled by the planet Mercury and that describes much of their lively and thought oriented approach to love. They treasure being mentally captivated, excited and dynamically active and the mates they choose tend to be friends, first and foremost, and lovers second. Being able to share and discuss new thoughts, new ideals and everything they conceive and learn is an important quality they need to have in place within a relationship. This is the talkative, communicative sign and their minds are constantly sifting through information. As such they often speak before they think and their words, usually not intended to hurt, can fall flat when they fail to carry through on an intention or promise. A lover often feels left behind and unimportant as the Gemini discovers a fascinating new subject or person to explore and words from the past become empty and hurtful. At their best, however, a Gemini lover is the most fascinating, joyful and enjoyable partner of the zodiac. When that is backed up by their own feelings of wholeness and completeness (often the very thing they are seeking from a partnership) they are dynamic and loyal mates.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Gemini Sexuality:</span></strong> Sex is a mind voyage for most Gemini's and they experience the height of their passion through their thoughts and what the feelings mean to them. They are open minded and experimental ,yet not necessarily driven by passion to try out the new techniques and adventures, but more out of the hungry curiosity that propels them to simply...discover something. They bring their wit and laughter directly into the bedroom and can be disheartened (and even shocked) that their partners may not always go along with their ever present sense of humor. Their lust and their needs tend to come and go with speed and suddenness and they can turn off as quickly as they turn on. Gemini's seldom wait for anyone and that includes a lover who takes a little more time to feel stimulated.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story:</span></strong> Gemini's need friendship and companionship and a partner who can share their mind explorations and journeys as deeply as they need a lover and heart mate. They generally need someone who is secure or open enough to not feel threatened by their quickly changing interests or whole hearted experiments but one who can also help them ground out to penetrate one of their intrigues in depth. Because Gemini is a dual sign they often project part of them when they are attracted to a mate and the relationship becomes an external way for them to work towards their merging of their two very different sides. This polarity creates an intriguing and exciting spark in the beginning of the relationship but can burn out once the Gemini has 'owned' up to its other half or has grown bored and retreated back within self.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love:</span></strong> Joyful, good natured, broad minded, experimental, radiant, friendly, enthusiastic, flexibility, gentleness.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits:</span></strong> Unreliability, fickleness, duality, insincerity, self focus, restlessness, critical and temperamental.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What a Gemini likes:</span></strong>Intellectual stimulation, Ideas and thoughts, New trends to investigate, Friends and socializing, Talking, Sharing ideals, Learning, Upbeat, lively mates.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What a Gemini Dislikes:</span></strong>Routines and ruts, Feeling ignored, Being confined, Apathy, Being the one to make all the decisions, Slowness, Being directed.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Gemini Love Keywords:</span></strong> Friendly, mind oriented, pontaneous, verbal, joyful, experimental, open minded, enthusiastic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=Green]<strong>Cancer in Love</strong> [ June 22-July 22 ] [ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Cancer is the cardinal water sign indicating that strong and rushing feelings and emotions guide their actions. When they love they love forever...period. Their extremely tough outer shell makes it hard to truly get into their heart but once in the loved one becomes pampered, adored and prone to being the intense focus of their feelings and moods. A Cancer lover instinctively nourishes and dotes on the object of their heart and can be all encompassing in all ways. Being traditional and home oriented means male Cancers like to follow the proper rules and ways to court, to fall in love and to make it permanent. Likewise for females who tend to wait until the man makes his move regardless of how strongly they may want to make a move. No one can do love and give love like a Cancer can, but it is heart and maternally oriented as opposed to sexually oriented and its worse tendency is to be smothering. A Cancer who feels insecure in a relationship is apt to become demanding: either sulking silently hurt or verbally making it clear what is wrong and why. The outer shell protects them from giving too soon and too often but those outer claws (another Crab attribute) serve to hold onto a loved one with a tenacious grasp that is almost impossible to break. Yet their actions are always driven by the true depth of their feelings and the loved one almost always holds a cherished spot in their heart even long after the union is over. When it comes to protection...not even Leo can outdo the fierce and loyal strength that a Cancer wields in the name of protecting a loved one.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Cancers Sexuality:</span></strong> Sex is not definable without emotions for most Cancers and they must feel something with relative strength for their truest feelings to come out in a romantic and sexual interlude. They are tender and partner oriented lovers and more concerned with pleasing their mates and feeling the returning emotions as nurturing proof of the partners love. Sex for cancer is attached to all things which mean security and loyalty and truth of the heart. Their needs tend to fluctuate according to their moods and emotional state as does their intensity and their desire levels. In many ways sexuality is an empowered field for Cancer as they are the zodiacs maternal nurturers it is the literal act of sex which has molded their 'job'. A cancer who is in love and feels secure will intuitively understand that and will treat it as the joyful gift it is.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story:</span></strong> In a solid, secure relationship a Cancer can easily support the nuances of a long term relationship as they naturally nourish and supplement the changing nature of the union. On a lovers part it is important to understand their emotional vulnerability and how they cope with that through their built in defense mechanisms. Cancers are, undeniably, prone to a certain moodiness and such is the way they can learn to bend and flow and give what is needed to nurture those around them. The more a partner learns to enhance a cancers ability to detach from what is going around them and to learn the truth of their own power of emotional freedom the less this natural moodiness will manifest in overt ways.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love:</span></strong> Loyal, supportive, nurturing, compassionate, caring, dedication, faithfulness of emotions, tenderness, pampering, adoration.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits:</span></strong> Possessiveness, jealousy, moodiness, volatility, control issues, dependency issues, depression<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Cancer likes:</span></strong>Feeling appreciated, Sincerity, Tradition, Stability, Routine, Loyalty, Commitment, Laughing, Feeling supported.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Cancer Dislikes:</span></strong>Erratic ness, Sudden, unexpected changes, Insincerity, Being ignored, Dishonesty, Not knowing how you feel, Being uncomfortable<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Cancer Love Keywords:</span></strong>Emotional, fluid, nurturing, supportive, moody, insecure, loving, loyal, tradition oriented, modest, generous, sincere.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=indigo]<strong>Leo in Love</strong> [ July 23-August 22 ] [Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Leo is the fixed fire sign. Think contained flames. Like a campfire that needs constant attention to keep alive and warm. There is a deep love for life and all of its possibilities...including its luxuries and that love transfers over beautifully into how a Leo expresses their feelings. Love with a Leo is like a magnificent encounter with the sun. They are warm and supportive when their heart is given and their affections grow stronger the more they feel that their partners care about them and adore them in return. Leo's are dramatically romantic and not afraid to show it. They enjoy pulling their loved ones out into their world and radiate when they feel their partners compliment some quality about themselves. Love becomes a thing of luxury and the partner receives the abundance of their personal Leo's attention,. lust and emotions. Because Leo's judge themselves on what they have around them (hence their love of luxury) they can be too appearance conscious at times and too critical of a mates qualities, appearance or talents. Because they truly need constant input to maintain their vitality they can sometimes become self-serving...occasionally to a point that it becomes egotistical.<br>You'll find that love with a Leo is like no other love...and when they decide to give you their heart....they also give you every inch of their soul. In this lies the Leo vulnerability....when their trust is broken they crumble. They, again, base their own self judgements on those they adore. Take away the loved one...and you've taken away their own identity in many ways. When Leos feel let down (and it usually takes a great deal) they either fall into an abyss of pain and depression..or they get utterly cold and without feeling. The lion....in protective mode.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Leo Sexuality:</span></strong> Leo's sexuality is as light filled and life filled as their ruling planet, The Sun. They are usually full of showmanship and expressive displays of attention. They enjoy the height of all feelings in life and sexual pleasure is just another glorious field to explore the luxuries of the body through. Leo's can be aggressive, passionate and encompassing lovers with exotic tastes...remember it is the love of life that inspires Leo and they can be wonderfully creative and experimental, especially when they feel secure. They are as proud in passion as they are in any other area of life and perhaps more so. The more appreciated and cherished they feel the more expressive and passionate they become.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long-term story:</span></strong> Leos being fire signs are rather high maintenance partners. They require attention, nurturing and pampering. A mate has to be personally strong in them to enhance the partnership but also willing to step occasionally into their Leo's shadow. Leos are protective to the death for those they love and they are generous and expressive in a long term union that is constantly stoked and fed. Keep the campfire metaphor in mind. Unattended it dies out...mistreated it flares into unpredictable life and burns...but kept constant and tended it turns into a life giving warmth that is undying.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love:</span></strong> Protective, adoring, playful, inventive, generous, supportive, sensual, warm, joyful.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits:</span></strong> Possessive, jealous, control issues, coldness, cruelty, selfishness, egotistical, self serving.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Leo likes:</span></strong>Feeling Pampered, Being noticed, Being appreciated, Being the boss, Dramatic unions, Mate with a love of life, Receiving gifts Socializing/parties.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Leo Dislikes:</span></strong>Apathy, Being ignored, Being criticized, Nagging, One up-manship, Competition, Lying/deceit, Laziness<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Leo Love Keywords:</span></strong>Expressive, demonstrative, engulfing, proud, sensual, adoring, control, egotistical, self-serving, jealousy, coldness, and cruelty.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: olive;"><strong>Virgo in Love</strong> [ August 23-September 22 ] [Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Virgo is the mutable earth-sign. There is movement but it is controlled, thought oriented and grounded. Virgo is a mind ruled person and they give their love slowly and with great seriousness. They dislike overt and grand standing displays of attention or emotion and will retreat inside themselves to escape it. They are a controlled person and their emotions fall into that category. When their heart is captured their loved on becomes a receptor to all the feelings and passions that Virgo has been keeping inside. At times even more expectations and conditions can be piled onto the lover simply because they are now holding the Virgos cherished feelings and dreams. In love they are devoted, loyal and nurturing. They have high self expectations and equally high expectations of their loved ones. They adore strength especially the dignified and quiet kind. They will tend to and take care of their loved one with diligence and focus.....it has become their 'job'. Love has to make sense for the Virgo...it has to fit into their idea and ideal of what their life is about. Once a lover has managed to slip into one of their dreams or plans the Virgo will hold onto that picture forever. They will go out of their way to make the union work and will spare no sacrifice in keeping it alive.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Virgo Sexuality:</span></strong> Virgos needs a certain setting, a definite layer of built up trust and privacy to allow their sexual sides to come out and play. Cleanliness is always important as is the 'right' setting. Virgo is inherently shy especially about their sensual needs but don't let that shyness fool you into thinking there is no fire lurking below the surface. They can become as devoted and focused on exploring their sexuality with a trusted lover as they are about making their life work. They have a completely uninhibited (yes this word applies to Virgo) potential that is lust filled and yet still retains a sense of purity. Virgos are notorious for their high standards in selecting a sexual partner but once those standards have been met pure sensual pleasure is the reward.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story:</span></strong> Life is orderly with a Virgo. Some may live in a messy house with overflowing laundry and unorganized shelves but within your mate there is some sense of strict control that is directed into some facet of life. They are caretakers and need to feel comfortable enough to slip into that role. They can nag and criticize but they usually have their loversÂ’ best interests at heart. They don't mind taking on more than their share of work and once committed they stay committed. They are time oriented, schedule craving souls who cannot tolerate a late mate or a scattered life energy.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love:</span></strong> Nurturing, devoted, uninhibited, caring, loving, sacrificial, quiet, considerate, protective.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits:</span></strong> Coldness, inability to be demonstrative, calculating, hard edged, overly critical, judgmental, compulsive.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Virgo likes:</span></strong>Feeling secure, Personal cleanliness, Routines, Loyalty, Being pampered when down, Equality, Subtle<br>displays of romance, Dedication, Being active,<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Virgo Dislikes:</span></strong>Tardiness, Vulgarity, Loud displays of affection, Personal untidiness, Hypocrisy, Weakness, Complaining, Idleness.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Virgo Love Keywords:</span></strong>Loyal, loving, caring, nurturing, dedicated, devoted, cold, critical, unfeeling, and self-serving.</span></div>

This means heart processes through the mind. Libra is an active and sociable lover who enjoys having people around them as much as their intimacy. They are generally sensual and passionate lovers whose love of luxury and beauty penetrates the bedroom and the relationship. They are the peacekeepers of the zodiac and weigh all sides and situations equally as such they often have difficulties in making hard and fast decisions. This can be frustrating for their loved ones as they vacillate between this and that...one way and another. Libra needs attention and the company of other people and when deprived of that they can sink into a very real depression and lose their inspiration. They are people oriented and enjoy the stimulation of having their loved ones and friends an active part of their life. This often creates a problem when the lover feels no more important then their best friend. Libras are all around charming and good natured even when they don't want to be and they can actively stifle any personal complaints until they reach the boiling point. When a Libra has allowed the scales to become unfairly tipped they often lash out explosively. Surprising their mates who have come to see only their gentle and peaceable exterior. Libras love romance and all of its finest attributes from flowers, to poetry to love songs.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Scorpio in Love</strong> [ October 23-November 21 ] [ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Scorpio is the fixed-water sign indicating still waters that run very, very deep. There is an intense and smoldering sexuality and sensuality within every Scorpio as there's is the sign that rules lust and sex. There are three very different types of Scorpio from the scorpion, to the eagle to either the phoenix or the dove (depending on which symbolism one prefers). Yet each will have a profound depth and attraction to love and what accompanies love in their life. They are passionate when they invest their feelings and life is never boring with a Scorpio lover. They thrive when they feel secure and stable within a relationship and enjoy the physical gifts of being in love as much as the emotional ones. They are mysterious...always....and you'll never know what is on your Scorpio Lovers mind....except when it is being expressed through their passion. They are watchful, quiet and dedicated mates who can be as protective of the ones they love as they are of their own vulnerable emotions and feelings. They tend to be the dominate one in any relationship even if it is done very on inherently below the surface levels as feeling in control of a relationship is one of the ways they can invest their hearts. They have a notorious jealousy and possessiveness that has been well earned in Scorpio-Scorpios but which turns into an unequaled level of trust and faith in the eagle and the phoenix/dove.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Scorpio Sexuality:</span></strong> Scorpio is the sign that rules sexuality and the powers of lust. But their passion is only as deep and profound as it is because it is connected with the ultimate gift of sex.....life. And these are the beings unafraid to face either life or death and that fearlessness translates into their sexual expressions. They can reach the highest highs or the lowest lows in whatever passion they pursue and they are the most intense, uninhibited and dynamic lovers in the zodiac. It comes with deep attachment and needs and a driving urge to come to terms with the enormity of life.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story:</span></strong> Scorpios require a solid security within a relationship without feeling that they have a doormat as a mate. This is precarious balance and is learned over time. The longer a relationship lasts with a Scorpio...the more secure it tends to become. They are naturally suspicious (remember they feel and see things the rest of us work to ignore) and with that depth comes the need for some equally powerful self protective mechanisms. Their insecurity and jealousy are by products of self preservation. Scorpios like to be in control and are very seldom found in subservient roles unless they've opted to move into that spot. They need passionate mates who can keep up with their desires and they need someone capable of both maintaining a loyalty and their own sense of individuality in order to keep the relationship balanced. They are basically homebodies feeling most comfortable when they are within their own domains. They despise being surprised, embarrassed or humiliated and retaliate with swiftness...and strength. Scorpios are capable of some amazing turn around and growth. Even a Scorpio who seems entrenched in the scorpion phase can suddenly and dramatically grow wings and sail up into the heavens. Never under estimate their powers of rejuvenation on either physical, spiritual or emotional planes.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love:</span></strong> Loyal, supportive, protective, generous with their strength and knowledge, humble, quiet, unshakable, passionate, encompassing.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits:</span></strong> Jealousy, possessiveness, obsessive, angry, suspicious, mistrusting, secretive and unreliable.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Scorpio likes:</span></strong> Mystery, Secrets, Privacy, Trust/loyalty, Sensuality/passion, Strength, Knowing where they stand, Being acknowledged Honesty/integrity<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Scorpio Dislikes:</span></strong> Surprises, Lying and deceit, Apathy, Being analyzed/questioned, Being 'understood', Excessive compliments, Insincerity, Being embarrassed, Passivity<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Scorpio Love Keywords: </span></strong>Intense, compelling, magnetic, sexual, sensual, intriguing, profound, loyal, tenacious, possessive, jealous, obsessive, bad tempered, secretive.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=brown]<strong>Sagittarius in Love</strong> [ November 22-December 21 ] [ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Sagittarius treats love like any other adventure in their lives and embraces the opportunities to discover new plateaus in the experience of love, lust and passion. They are funny, charming, gregarious and usually highly intelligent begins who make genuinely enjoyable company and are captivating in their sparkling personalities. They have big dreams and far reaching goals and they easily share what their minds are experiencing often forgetting that for some words are meant to become reality. Sagittarius is not always capable of bringing reality to their words and such is the way it is meant to be. They infuse us with inspiration and allow us to see all the possibilities in the world around us. In close personal relationships that can often cause troubles as they promise more than they can deliver....or....have changes of emotions that put them into completely different mind sets from one day to another. They are active and vibrant and expect their loved ones to enjoy the same kind of physical adventures. They are appearance conscious and Their wit is one of their greatest assets and they enjoy the attention of others..this makes them the natural flirts of the zodiac and most of it is harmless and meaningless.<br>Sagittarius Sexuality: Like the other fire signs Sagittarius has a definite sense of passion and a love of physical connections but for them it becomes almost a spiritual experience...or another occasion to have 'fun'. The more exotic the local or the setting the more inspired a Sagittarian is and an inspired Sagittarian is the consummate lover. There's is the sense of a dare devil in them and they love walking on the risquÃ© side...playing with rules and regulations usually just nudging the line rather than crossing it. They are attracted to far away places and intriguing sexual imagery and fantasy is an important component as Sagittarius needs to be inspired to inspire.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story:</span></strong> Feeling trusted and free to pursue their adventures is a pre-requisite to a long term encounter with a Sagittarian. They use words as both weapons and tools and can be either supportive and uplifting or remarkably sarcastic and cutting and sometimes both in the same breath. They are naturally flirtatious but usually bottom line loyal and the more they feel 'understood' the more they focus on the benefits of the relationship. Even a stay at home Sagittarius will enjoy adventures through the mind and if they are not physically taking on life challenges for adrenalin rushes they are arm chair quarterbacks or avid game players. Their sense of competition is acute and it is also one of the things that keeps them moving forward in life.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love: </span></strong> Joyful, playful, spontaneous, generous, captivating, enchanting, supportive, good-natured.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits: </span></strong> Unreliable, fickle, sarcastic, temperamental, unable to commit, freedom loving to the extreme, self centered, vain.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Sagittarius likes: </span></strong> A sense of adventure, Honesty, Freedom, Intellectual compatibility, Taking risks, Flirting, Socializing, Feeling trusted, Active partner, Daydreaming<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Sagittarius Dislikes: </span></strong>Jealousy, Possessiveness, Routine, Being doubted, Having to explain self, Control, Being forced to make promises, Apathy/laziness<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Sagittarius Love Keywords: </span></strong>Exuberant, charming, funny, far sighted, adventuress, adoring, non-possessive, flighty, sarcastic, unreliable, self centered, dogmatic, judgmental.<br></div>
