            <div class='col-md body'>[color=green]<strong>Capricorn in Love</strong> [ December 22-January 19 ]<br>[ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>There is a rumor that Capricorns are the best lovers of the zodiac when they feel stable and secure and can see the long term purpose of the union they are in. The focused determination of Saturn as a guiding light brings the same unequaled force into the bedroom and into the relationship as they apply to building their life and their security. Capricorn is slow to trust and even slower to love but once their heart is given there is very little they won't do to back up and support and love their mate. The symbolism of Capricorn is the Seagoat...a useful metaphor is the ability to penetrate both environments on earth....water and land. Spiritually...they can conquer both the spirit and the body. Love is nothing less than a goal and they are capable of approaching it with the same dedication as they approach any other important endeavor in their life. They are loyal, nurturing caregivers and supporters at their best. Cold, calculating and emotionally repressed at their worst. The realm of feelings is the hardest plane for Capricorns to come to terms with as it is based on an energy that they cannot control . Once they accept and embrace their emotional beings they are human dynamos who add strength, conviction and longevity to love.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Capricorn Sexuality: </span></strong> When they are secure within themselves and within a partnership they can take their lover to the peaks of sexual mountaintops. They know how to apply patience and dedication to discovering how to please and their leisurely approach to getting to know a mates intimate secrets promises that they possess an almost push button control of their partners sexual desires. It is not the pure and raw driving sexuality of Scorpio...nor the romantic and enchanting passion of Libra...it is a combination of the human physical need for sex and the spirits need to experience the height of a pleasure and to merge it into one. A soul moving encounter that brings the primal...into the spiritual.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story: </span></strong> Capricorns require patience and dedication. They are often shy and awkward in their emotions early on growing in strength and acceptance the longer they stay within a union. They need to have a purpose behind their actions and a purpose behind the relationship. They take the initial investment of heart to the building of a long term commitment with the same serious intent that they conquer all their mountains in life. They can be domineering and cold if they are not in touch with their feeling centers. Materialistic and self serving as well. Once committed most Capricorns stay committed as they are bound to a sense of responsibility. It takes a lot to sever a serious Capricorn tie but once it is severed...they can be vengeful and hateful. They are not always the best judge of character and so let downs and relationship break ups become personal mistakes that they often repress and refuse to accept. They provide one of the most secure and empowering bonds when they are completely in love.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love: </span></strong> Loyal, dedicated, patient, kind, generous, supportive, serious, dependable, tolerant, attentive.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits: </span></strong> Possessiveness, control, coldness and aloofness, lack of emotional tolerance or depth, materialistic, narrow minded, vindictive, bitter, melancholy.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Capricorn likes: </span></strong>Loyalty, Feeling secure, Financial/material stability, Ambitious mates, Feeling committed, Making long term relationship plans, Dependability, Reliability, Perseverance<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What Capricorn Dislikes: </span></strong> Flightiness, Being bossed around, Crudeness/coarseness, Dominance, Game playing, Ego displays, Extravagance, Being challenged by a lover, Indecisiveness<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> Capricorn Love Keywords: </span></strong>Loyal, ambitious, dedicated, focused, honesty, disciplined, severe, possessive, controlling, cold, calculating</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=indigo]<strong>Aquarius in Love</strong> [ January 20-February 18 ] [ Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Aquarius is the fixed-air sign. They are progressive, liberal 'thinkers' who also tend to hold onto their thoughts and ideals with tenacity. (The fixed influence) They are generally more comfortable with a friendly love partnership where they feel secure enough to continue pursuing their many varied interests. They are hard to pin down and even harder to get into a solid commitment but once there that fixed influence makes them loyal and trustworthy companions. Albeit with an eclectic influence. Aquarians adore friendships of the impersonal type and usually have a revolving door of buddies. They can be completely enchanted by any one of their new acquaintances and the group they attract runs the gamut from the off-beat and 'odd' to the powerful and the wealthy. Your Aquarian doesn't judge people by 'what' they have rather by their principals and actions. Aquarians require someone pretty secure within themselves as they are inherently self motivated and need the freedom to pursue their latest ideal or whim.<br>Yet they can be focused and dedicated to a relationship, especially if they feel accepted and understood. They delight...in delighting and they regale in having a companion who is eager to explore the world of thought and possibilities with them. Freedom fighters with a shared cause build a bond that the Aquarian will guard with strength and conviction. They are also tolerant, lacking in jealousy or possessiveness and will over-look and understand all kinds of human follies and mistakes from their partner. Once they are hurt however....their emotions go off with a flip of the switch that does not ever....go back on. Coldness is the opposite of Aquarians enchanting friendship/commitment.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Aquarius Sexuality: </span></strong> Aquarius is the sign most likely to forget about sex entirely. It isn't that they don't enjoy it....they do when they feel comfortable and secure....but there are so many other things to explore with their minds and so little time. When caught in the 'mood' they are explorative, frisky and playful. They take obvious delight in the attention their partner gives them. They can be extremely self conscious about their bodies or their sexuality or completely uninhibited and sometimes both. The bedroom becomes a playground to further solidify the bond of friendship that the Aquarian needs in their life and they are delightful companions when they feel good about the union..and about themselves.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The long term story: </span></strong> Lots of open mindedness, freedom to pursue their interests and constant input to the friendship are the building blocks for maintaining a long term relationship with an Aquarian. Remember that they are the rebels of the zodiac and if they feel they are being controlled or ignored their defense can be to automatically rebel against any incoming input from their partner. Their natural instinct tells them to do the opposite of what is expected. They jump wholeheartedly into their latest cause but can do about faces so suddenly it takes ones breath away. It's important to have a 'go with the flow' system in place and gradually the Aquarian learns to be more vocal and explanatory about their thoughts, their movements and their actions. They make dedicated and genuinely sincere and warm mates once they commit and they possess the spark that can keep the friendship a dynamic and ever growing platform to journey into eternity on.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love: </span></strong> Playful, friendly, spontaneous, open minded, caring, devoted, liberal, understanding, tolerant, benevolent.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits: </span></strong> Erratic, undependable, self oriented, cold, aloof, mean, self centered, unable to commit, judgmental, fickle.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What an Aquarius likes: </span></strong>Friendship, Freedom, Intellectual stimulation, Camaraderie, Surprises, Companionship, Feeling understood and Emotional safety<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What an Aquarius Dislikes: </span></strong> Jealousy, Possessiveness, Control, Ego plays, Narrow mindedness, Being ridiculed, Routines, Fighting/violence Inequality, Being taken for granted, Being understood (note: this makes the Likes list as well...they're unique but you already know that)<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Aquarius Love Keywords: </span></strong>Friendly, charming, open minded, liberal, accepting, non-judgmental, playful, spontaneous, erratic, eccentric, undependable, non-committal, aloof.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=olive]<strong>Pisces in Love</strong> [ February 19-March 20 ] [Â© 2001 Linda Rankin ]<br>Pisces is the mutable water sign and very much exist in their own universe, tuned into the emotional, receptive qualities of life that most of us cannot see, touch nor feel. In love they are dream filled and romantic, full of enchanted visions and hopeful fantasies. They're eager to share their thoughts and reveries when they feel secure, understood and appreciated. Of all the signs Pisces needs the most encouragement to feel true within themselves and to learn the validity of their own thoughts and needs. They make the most delightful companions and are generally soft, gentle and easy going, especially if they have a role model to look up to within the relationship. This is a delicate balance that Pisces learns to control as they go through life as their projections onto their mate can be helpful if it encourages them to motivate their own lives and resources but can turn into tenacious co-dependency if the Pisces refuses to embrace their own lives, needs and thoughts. They can be confusing creatures never able to define their roles within the relationship and constantly turning to sources outside of the union for definition and explanation. This can slowly erode the bond between the lovers/partners as the partner. A Pisces encouraged to find and embrace their answers within themselves and one who has learned to trust their own thoughts, feelings and perceptions make one of the most loving, sensual and devoted mates their is.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Pisces Sexuality: </span></strong> Pisces sexuality is always wrapped around those inner worlds they exist in and becomes an emotional experience that can take them on voyages into ecstasy and passion. But because they do exist within this world where things are nebulous, mystical and emotion oriented if they are projecting outwards to find validity of what they are seeing and feeling inside rather than combining the experience of the physical intimacy with the thoughts and dreams they can feel disappointed...or saddened. If they've learned to simply using what is inside to inspire their participation in the literal reality based world they can take their lover on their enchanted voyages with them..and create an exciting and enchanting sexual companionship.<br>The long term story: There is a certain amount of inner strength combined with outer strength that is needed when involved long term with a Pisces, as they must learn to become their own sources of joy, inspiration and answers. A weak mate who goes along with every Piscean whim or fantasy is as destructive as a mate who cannot see the validity of those things they are experiencing internally. One can create a union with no solidity or reality underneath of it and the other can cause the Pisces to further doubt their own truth and inner strength. At the best the Pisces brings to the relationship a touch of all that is universal and mysterious. They are dreamy, poetic and romance filled beings who make life a true sojourn through the world of feelings and passions. At worst they release any semblance of inner belief and become attached to the partner or other form of projection in an attempt to capture outside..what goes on inside.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive Traits in Love: </span></strong> Playful, friendly, spontaneous, open minded, caring, devoted, liberal, understanding, tolerant, benevolent.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative traits: </span></strong> Erratic, undependable, self oriented, cold, aloof, mean, self centered, unable to commit, judgmental, fickle.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What a Pisces likes: </span></strong>Romance, Feeling appreciated, Stability, Feeling needed, Mystical settings/enchantment, Being encouraged to dream, Sharing thoughts/dreams, Having their input valued, A role model, Feeling loved<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">What a Pisces Dislikes: </span></strong>Feeling vulnerable, Feeling alone/unloved, Having no goals to project towards, Feeling invalidated, Being ignored, Crude/harsh behavior, Noisy scenes/displays, Having no dreams, Having no sense of structure<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Pisces Love Keywords: </span></strong>Mystical, enchanting, emotional, loving, devoted, reverent, creative, confused, depressed, irresponsible, goal-less, lack of motivation or push, co-dependency issues.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Repost : The Dos And Don'ts For All Zodiac Signs Part I</strong><br>Originally contributed by JaNy<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Aries (Mar 21 - Apr 19)</span></strong><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_aries.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Aries are naturally active and vibrant people and they tend to like such people too. You will have to increase your pace to be in step with them. They like and appreciate frank and straightforward persons. With them you can be your true self (but don't try your luck being over frank-they are volatile). If you are in love with an Arien, then you have to show your enthusiasm in all their activities (you can always yawn later!).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not tell an Aries that s/he may be wrong. Any such statement may stir a storm in a teacup. Aries are very faithful and passionate lovers. Do not give air to the smouldering fire within them by making them jealous. No flirtation or fooling around with others in their presence unless of course you wish to write your death wish (you will be granted!).<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Taurus  (Apr 20 - May 20)</span></strong><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_taurus.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Stability and dependability characterise Taurus. They like people who can blend and grow with them. If you have a Taurus partner you should appreciate all things bright and beautiful. They have an inherent artistic sense and are fond of colour and music. Judge life with them from a purely materialistic point of view. Enjoy everything luxurious that money can provide. Enjoy good food (better if you can cook to please them) and good drinks with them.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Taurus do not loose their temper easily (in fact you may spend the whole life with them and still no spark) but you should not push your luck too much. Being unreasonable or aggressive with them may get you into trouble. Do not press him/her into a corner, and if you do, be prepared for a violent rage. Taurus is capable of violent outbursts though such an event is is very rare occasions. They can be suffocating when they are possessive about you.<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Gemini (May 21 - June 21)</span></strong><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_gemini.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Gemini is a highly intellectual and versatile person. If you have a Gemini partner you have to match your wits with his/her wits to keep the zing in the relationship. They want to be mentally stimulated so you have to be good at conversing. Your sense of humour will get you a permanent residence in the heart of a Gemini. Be more communicative with them, and if you are good at this, you will never know how hours pass by holding each other's hand.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Gemini's like to do many things at the same time, so if unfortunately you are the type who is looking for stability you may get disappointed. Do not hold back a Gemini or you may lose him/her, as they are restless and need change in life constantly. You should try to adopt yourself with the ever-changing Gemini. Orthodox or conservative old fashion ideas are no-no in their dictionary. Change with the ever-changing Gemini and do not flow against the current.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Repost : The Dos And Don'ts For All Zodiac Signs Part II</strong><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Cancer (Jun22 - July 22)</strong></span><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_cancer.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Try to adapt yourself with the changing moods of the Cancer. At one moment they may be laughing and enjoying and in another they may sulk. You may have to adjust with the moody and sensitive Cancer. They are like the tides in the ocean, always fluctuating. Cancerians love food, so if you know how to cook and can be poetic and romantic (added Bonus) then you know the way to their heart.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Cancerians are very sensitive people and can get easily hurt. So do not play with their emotions and sentiments. They are like tides that can sweep you along. They form emotional bonds with even inanimate things, so do not ask them to discard old caps or souvenirs. Such things hold special meaning to them. You have to realise that the crabs have a soft heart and are vulnerable. Do not contradict their tested line of thought and action, it would only lead to confusion.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Leo (Sep 22 - Oct23)</strong></span><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_leo.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>If you have Leo partner respect him and his majestic manners. Accept the advice of Leo, the lion, as he is the king of the jungle. It is the sign of a showman, so if your partner does everything in grand style enjoy it. They fall easily for flattery and want to be centre of attraction of all eyes (sometimes they can be quiet theatrical too).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Never ever hurt the ego of a Leo. Pride, ego and vanity are some of the bags Leo's always carry with them. Do not touch these bags. An authoritative Leo is even more difficult to handle in such circumstances. Leo is a sunny sign so they do not like people who are gloomy or depressed. Even if you are crying at heart keep a sunny smile on your lips and then let the lion take charge and remove all worries from your life.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept22)</strong></span><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_virgo.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Virgo's are very methodical and have a great sense of duty. Howver, they are blind to their own faults. So, if you have a Virgo partner emphasise more on their qualities. Take keen interest in what they are doing and you will realise that they will go out of their way to help you. Do rely and appreciate their mental powers rather than their physical powers. They can turn even an unsuccessful venture into a success.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not push a Virgo into limelight or on the centre stage unless of course they do so on their own. They are shy and reserved by nature and do not like to be the cynosure of all eyes. Virgo's have secrets that they would not like to bring out in the open. So, even if you have the key to their secret skeleton-closet, hide it; do not even admit that you know anything about it. Virgo, the virgins, do not want to tarnish their public image.</div>

Venus, the ruling planet, gives them beauty and they have weakness for people who can compliment them about their beauty (you will not have to make an effort to do that anyway). You can help Libra seek union and partnership in life. If you have a Libra partner you can be sure to share beautiful and pleasurable moments together.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Libra is kind and gentle soul but very argumentative. Hence, do not start an argument or discussion unless, of course, you are free and do not know how to pass your time. They hate to lose and most probably during an argument may change sides too (remember scales can tilt) and still continue arguing from the other side. Do not push your Libra partner into making decisions. They will keep weighing pros and cons and may still not be able to come to any decision. Have patience!<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Novr 21)</strong></span><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_scorpio.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Scorpio's are full of passion and zest for life. They have tremendous drive that can involve you too. Tune in to their wavelength and you can enjoy the harmony and music of life with them. Scorpio's are loyal and never forget a kind deed done by you. If you want to enjoy life with your Scorpio lover, share their passion and intensity and you will be fascinated by how beautiful life can be with them.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Scorpio's are very passionate and intense but they are also fiercely possessive and would like to possess your mind, body and soul. Do not let seeds of jealousy grow in them because then you may have to suffer agonies of jealousy and discontentment in life. Scorpio's have explosive tempers Â– be careful how you handle them. They never let anyone know what is going on in their mind till they strike and you may be caught unawares. Do not flirt around in the presence of your Scorpio lover.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Sagittarius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</strong></span><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_sagitarrius.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Sagittarius is basically a happy go lucky kind. You can enjoy with them their zest and enthusiasm for life. They bubble with excitement. And if you share the same interests and hobbies, life can be great fun together. They are frank and straightforward so if you want some truthful opinion about anything or anyone Â– go to them. Be optimistic as they are and view life as glass half full.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Sagittarius is fiercely independent and cannot tolerate restriction. Hence, do not try to hold them back in life. Let them enjoy their freedom because if you hold any special place in their heart they will always come back for you. Do not feel irritated by the exaggeration in their speech. They may go on and on, talking about certain things that may not even interest you, but its their way of trying to communicate with you. They are basically frank and outspoken (to the point of being rude), so do not feel offended by their talks.</div>

Hence, if you want to put your money on anyone it is of course this zodiac sign. They are practical and conservative in their outlook and they expect you to blend in their colour. They set certain standards for themselves in their life and they will always try to maintain those standards. For them social status and image is very important in life.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not expect a Capricorn mate to open his/her heart and pour everything to you. They are very secretive and reserved people. They are very thorough in all their affairs and hate any kind of sloppiness. People born under this zodiac are very tight-fisted and economical. Do not expect lavish gifts from them and if they do give you any gift (that is very rare) it will have some practical use (no romance please) but that does not mean you will be deprived of anything; on the contrary you will be well provided.<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">Aquarius (Jan 21 - Feb 21)</span></strong><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_aquarius.gif"><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Aquarius are friendly and fascinating people. They have in-depth knowledge about various subjects and you can converse with them for hours without getting bored. They are capable of giving a lot of love that can be amazing. They have a very broad outlook of life and you can relax in their presence. They will always welcome your ideas and actions about humanitarian causes. To keep an Aquarius lover interested you must possess that mysterious and intriguing quality. Once hooked they will always be very faithful to you.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Do not expect or plan a normal, simple and predictable life with an Aquarius partner. Aquarians are totally unpredictable. They can go to any direction without giving any advance notice. They are basically very restless and get bored easily. Though they are very friendly, do not expect them to reveal their inner most feelings to you (they never will). They can be detached and impersonal, which may seem strange to others.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Pisces (Feb 22 - Mar 21)</strong></span><br><img src="http://www.scorpiosite69.freeserve.co.uk/AG_pisces.gif"><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">DO'S</span></strong><br>Pisceans are sensitive and charming. If you are looking for someone who is understanding and can understand your feelings then you have met the right person. You should appreciate their feelings too, as in your time of need they are sure to help you. Pisces have a keenly developed sixth sense and have great intuitive powers. Their hunches may usually be right on mark. But they can exhaust their physical and mental energies. They are born dreamers and you can build palaces with your dream lover (only in real life it may become a little difficult preposition).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">DON'TS</span></strong><br>Pisces are dreamers and you should not expect them to have worldly ambitions. They are not materialistic in nature. It is not that they like living below the poverty line but they have no earnest desire to accumulate wealth. They are very sensitive and you have to be always careful about their feelings. The fishes are capable of drowning you in their tears (even men born under this sign).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><strong>** How to date? **</strong></span><br>Originally posted by JaNy<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Aries Female [March 21-April 20 - Aries]</strong><br>If you are dating an Aries female, take her out to the shooting range. Bring an extra gun for her to shoot with you. (She is capable of shooting at you, if you rile her anger) Wear tight jeans, a red shirt and look manly. Pick her up on your Harley Davidson, but remind her you have a private race car collection. Be Macho! Do not talk about old girlfriends! Aries females must be the only "one". Cooking isn't her goal in life, but adventure will get her attention! Don't be a pushover, she'll lose interest, and look for another challenge. Tell her she is really cool, and the most fun and exciting woman you were ever with. (This will probably not be a lie) She values honesty, don't fabricate! Be careful though, if this Aries female really likes you, she'll chase you until she can propose to you. Aries females mean business and are not recommended for timid men!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Aries Male [March 21-April 20 - Aries]</strong><br>If you are dating an Aries male, allow him to decide where to go and what to do. Let him know that you have never dated a man with such confidence and brains. You can be the dumb blonde with this guy, he'll save you. If you are out with him and you flirt with someone else, be prepared to call a cab to get home. Aries males do like skin and cleavage, therefore, you could win him back. It will not work a second time. He can argue with you, and when you think you have won, he will still do it his way. He wants to chase you, so let him do the calling and guesswork. Don't tell him you love him, until he proposes. To catch this hot-blooded Aries man, give the Ram his head and follow his head. Everyday is an adventure to an Aries male, marriage also. Rest up!</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Taurus Female [April 21-May 21 - Taurus]</strong><br>If you are dating a Taurus female, take her to an expensive steak house, rub on your soft musk, wear your corporate suit, and arrive in your four-door sedan. If it is paid for, you may drop that subtlety in your conversation during dinner. Taurus females prefer tender hugs and quiet candlelight dinners at home, prepared by you. She'll return the love by cooking for you at her home. When mentioning the house you would like to build, make sure you tell her about the large wooded lot with room for kids and dogs. If you are serious about her, let her know that it wouldn't be complete without a woman's touch. She will interpret your comment and hint about a cute little 20-carat diamond she spotted at the mall. Taurus females are warm and loving! (Unless you make her mad or jealous. Don't tell her you spent your rent money to buy drugs) Taurus Females are security minded, and will stick by you!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Taurus Male [April 21-May 21 - Taurus]</strong><br>If you are dating a Taurus male, be prepared to watch lots of movies at his home. His dog will eventually accept the two of you being together. A real treat will be when he takes you out to dinner to a four star restaurant. Taurus males will think you look great in forest green, however, they like nudity above all. Taurus males have the buddy teddy bear approach to love. He will certainly have his arm around you, during the movies. If you want to win his heart, get him a cold beer without him asking you. He will of course, apologizes for his messy home. He would know he had your love, if you surprised him by cleaning it up, and making the chili when he entertains his friends for Monday night football. He likes to take his own sweet time, so don't push him. He is the marrying kind. Visualize Mr. Taurus, watching television from his recliner, dog at his feet, a child under each arm, complete with TV guide and beer can pyramid.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Gemini Female [May 22-June 21 - Gemini]</strong><br>If you are dating a Gemini female, arrive on your mountain bike built for two. Ask her if she would like to ride over to the bar, and shoot a game of pool, because a lot of your buddies hang out there and they are fun! If that doesn't work, then suggest skating, a coffeehouse, or hanging out at the bookstore. Wear casual clothes and be prepared to talk a lot. Talk about the fascinating people you know, the intellectual types preferably. Tell her about the book that you are going to write. Have some original thoughts and be inventive. Creativity ranks high on your Gemini females list. YouÂ’ll never know what she is thinking. She is full of surprises. You can take her to the neighborhood dive bar, or to the Governor's Ball. She won't embarrass you. You can find out what she really thinks of you by locating her journal, where all her secrets are kept. Gemini females are not tidy, so it should be lying around in plain sight. There's lots of time before an engagement ring is necessary. Gemini females have to fall in love with your brain first!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Gemini Male [May 22-June 21 - Gemini]</strong><br>If you are dating a Gemini male, you can expect him to stand you up on your first date, but if you are lucky, he will call, say he is running late, and that the plans for the date have changed. Bring an overnight bag, he can get carried away and forget that you need to go home. He will have the cutest twinkling eyes, and you will forgive him. He will slightly ignore you in public, as he always knows everyone, wherever he takes you, and speaks to each one. Somehow, you can't picture him in a tuxedo, going down the aisle. Gemini males won't call you everyday. Gemini men are witty, fun, and can play, lay, and play! These men thrive in occupations where they can meet the public, and talk. Gemini males are great as disc jockeys. If you want to catch this guy, don't lean on him, don't get pregnant, or talk marriage. Be a challenge do your own thing and let your Gemini male chase you. It's ok to date others.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><strong>** How to date ??? **</strong></span><br>Originally posted by JaNy<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Cancer Female [June 22-July 22 - Cancer]</strong><br>If you are dating a Cancer female, dine out for pizza, and afterwards take her to Baskin Robbins. Be sure to call her mother and check on the kids. She'll think you are really a nice guy. Dress casual, and drive a suburban, or mini-van. It's ok, if you got the kids from your last divorce that won't stop her from dating you. Offer to barbecue at her house and compliment her cooking. (That way you get to come back for more.) Bring the family with you, Cancer females can take it. Cancer females are very sensitive about everything near and dear to them. Never say bad things about her family members-ever! They do possess humor. Pay attention to all her handmade quilts and home crafts. Cancer women are great homemakers. Let her know you like women with a "little meat" on their bones. (They taste everything they cook...yummy!) If you are not marriage minded, don't play games with Cancer women.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Cancer Male [June 22-July 22 - Cancer]</strong><br>If you are dating a Cancer male, be prepared to go to swap meets, and garage sales. Of course, he will take you out to eat, at least on your first date. He is pretty thrifty, so be sure you have a little stash of tip money in your purse. Of course, if you want to pay for your own, that would be fine. Just be yourself around him. Looks aren't that important to Cancer males, but do know some fabulous recipes! Talk about your love of children. Display an interest in his hobbies. Don't go into his garage, it will take the rest of the century to go through all of his bargains and collectibles. Your Cancer man will be dating just you, and possibly his ex-wife. He is extremely stable, and loves to eat. If you think you need to diet, he won't. He loves chesty women! You will receive flowers from him, out of his garden, naturally. He will remember all the holidays and treat you well. Tell him all your funny stories, he likes to laugh. It's ok, to say you are pro marriage and to openly discuss it. He's there for you. He knows how to treat women, afterall, his best friend is his mother. When you marry a Cancer man, you get them both!</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Leo Female [July 23-August 22 - Leo]</strong><br>If you are dating a Leo female, take her to the movies, a concert, a Broadway show, a plush restaurant. Getting the picture? She wants to be seen out with you. If men notice her, she will love that. If you don't act a little jealous, she will try harder to make you so. She thinks jealousy is a compliment. Bring her flowers, wear your gold chains, and wear something that shows off those muscles you worked so hard to get. That will excite her. Don't forget to splash on your Giorgio cologne. Tell her how much you love redheads, and ask her if all that gorgeous hair is hers? (If she isn't a redhead, then switch to blondes, or dark hair, but don't forget this.) Compliment her constantly, and drive something sporty to show her off. A convertible would be nice. Leo gals will get you noticed! When she disappears on your dates, she is merely primping in the ladies room. Be willing to fight for your Leo female, but don't take any crap from her. She can start fights over nothing. Be prepared. You had better love her cats too! She doesn't care if you are well read or educated, but do be suave, polished and act like you know what you are doing. She will marry you, but be prepared to take care of her sexually, financially, and emotionally. Leo females are a handful, and remember, she can always get another man, so treat her right.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Leo Male [July 23-August 22 - Leo]</strong><br>If you are dating a Leo male, he will take you to the best places for dinner, shows, etc. He will lavish money on you, even if he does not have it to spend. You can expect him to put the studley moves on you ASAP, not to worry. Usually it is a game, to see if you are really interested. He will impress you with his peacock strut, and the way he puffs out his chest. If he can convince you that he is a great guy, then he will be, otherwise, you will be pounced on by his cat like nature. His favorite past time is being waited on, breakfast in bed, candlelight, movies, concerts, roses and your basic everyday adoration. He is capable of a variety of occupations, but he likes to be the boss the most. This includes home. Leo men can have temper tantrums, if things don't go their way. It's ok, if you want to toss a few things back his way, when he starts to roar. Stand up to him. Be able to turn his roar into a purr. Always look good around him. Don't admit you color your hair. Do sleep with your makeup on, and dress sexy and feminine. He won't marry you otherwise. Leo males love the chase, so let him! (Leo males will already have told you about all of his other women.)</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Virgo Female [August 23-September 23 - Virgo]</strong><br>If you are dating a Virgo female, be on time when you arrive in your Mercedes to take her out for health food. Borrow the car if you have to. Do not pick her up in your unwashed car, with the baby car carrier. She isn't interested in ready-made families.

She likes elegance and beauty. Dress in your Sunday best. Bring her flowers, cards and special little feminine gifts. She'll be thoughtful too. Although Libra women are the ultimate in fashion and femininity, they are big flirts. However, underneath it all, they really want to be married to one darling man, who will romance them eternally. Flirt back with her, she loves little games. You can fall in love anytime you want to with her. Your car isn't as important, as how you treat her. Gently please, no conflict! Your Libra female probably won't have children, but she will have her fluffy lap dog, everywhere you go. She isn't the type to cheat on you, unless you forget about romance. Your occupation isn't that important. Be sure to earn enough money to support her frequent shopping trips to the mall. She loves to decorate, so step back at home. You can do the outside domestic duties. You get to wash the car and mow the lawn. When you propose to her, present her with your poetic love vows, and promise to hire a maid for her. Libra females love to be married!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Libra Male [September 24-October 23 - Libra]</strong><br>If you are dating a Libra male, your first date will be in a romantic restaurant, highlighted with a wonderful wine list. During dinner just smile and be sweet. Libra men don't like vulgarity in any form. Dress tastefully, and do use your flower scented perfume. He loves women who dress up, wear jewelry, use makeup, and are happy being feminine. He is fascinated with fantasy, including sexual fantasy. Don't discuss your recent love life, or ex-husbands. He could care less about your children, or desire to have them. Don't be argumentative. Libra males hate conflict. You can discuss your latest painting, the last book you read, or what your plans are for interior decorating. Libra males love cozy fires, and sensuous females near it. Fore play is a big high for Libra males. He is not a wimp, by any means, although, he loves to please! Yes, he would be your sex slave, provided you tease him a lot. At work, he is a fair boss, but at home he loves to be used! Libra males will stay in a bad marriage. Flirting gets them into trouble.Marriage is part of his ultimate plan, just make certain he is single, when you decide to date your Libra male.</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Scorpio Female [October 24-November 22 - Scorpio]</strong><br>If you are dating a Scorpio female, be careful! Show up wearing black clothes that fit you well. Arrive in your black car with the dark tinted windows. She likes the dark places, so take her to the bars, a casino would be fab! Don't tell her about the drugs you are on, she won't tell you about hers either. There needs to be caution exercised here, because Scorpios are one of two extremes. One the saint, the other the sinner. The first type of Scorpio is very religious, and does not smoke, drink, or do drugs. If you are on a blind date, you will know which version you are dating. Neither type is hung up on what you wear, but more how you wear it. Have sex appeal. Be interested in occult matters, be deep. She won't offer you much information about herself, you will have to guess. Scorpio females will pry your whole life story out of you. To keep her interested, be hard to get. You won't know if you are pleasing her, or where you stand. A fatal mistake is to anger a Scorpio female. Scorpio women will get you! She has a passionate nature and can have more than one love interest. They are not usually domestic, nor want to be involved with parenthood. She will put all of her intense energy into either partying or getting to the top. Female Scorpios are "all or nothing", even when it comes to marriage.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Scorpio Male [October 24-November 22 - Scorpio]</strong><br>If you are dating a Scorpio male, make sure you love secrets! He loves for you to be sexy and downright sleazy works for him too. He can make love to you, and not be in love with you. His passion can fool women, don't mistake it for love. Oftentimes, they are most in love when they can't possess or own you. Jealousy is a big issue with him. He stays jealous. He does not care what you do for an occupation, nor your financial status. Scorpio males want to control you to conform to their ideas of living. So, if you aren't strong in your own identity, then you will lose him. Scorpio males like the challenge of ownership. They love you most when they can't have complete control over you. Only the fearless need apply here. One type of Scorpio will marry you and stay put and dominates the household. Whereas, the other type will just disappear on you without warning or reason. Be true to yourself with Scorpio males, and let your personality stay on top!</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Sagittarius Female [November 23-December 21 - Sagittarius]</strong><br>If you are dating a Sagittarius Female, be ready willing and able to go anywhere. She loves sports and to travel. A perfect date would be an overnight excursion to Mount Olympus, and skiing down the slopes for breakfast. Pick her up in your jeep, or pickup truck, she won't mind your dog either. Dress casual, and be able to tell her about an Indian Shaman that you know, who invited you to a tribal ceremony. She'll want to go with you. Don't do the same things twice in a row. She won't care who you are dating, because she has plenty of men friends. Sagittarius women can be ready for a date on a momentÂ’s notice. She'll be great at men's activities, like softball, and eating the worm from a Tequila bottle. She will have been everywhere, but darn, Sagittarius females are fun to be around. You can win her heart with variety in your lovemaking. She isn't the type to spend time in the kitchen or babysitting. Show her you want to be a companion in all of her zany schemes. When she falls for you, she will ask you to do things with her. Marriage is not on her mind, but she would marry you, if she felt you were compatible enough. Sagittarius women love their freedom!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Sagittarius Male [November 23-December 21 - Sagittarius]</strong><br>If you are dating a Sagittarius male, expect anything and everything. He is not very reliable about schedules, dates, or you. Not in the beginning anyway. He likes talkative women and female jocks. He wants a buddy to join him in his pursuits. Most Sagittarius males are employed in sales/traveling jobs. They can have a gal in every port. Let him tell you he is serious about you first. Sagittarius males only get married when they have to, and then they can't seem to stay married. They love the thrill and adventure of chasing a woman, similar to their love of hunting, fishing, and sports. You rank in there somewhere. You can get used to being a hunting widow, sports widow, etc., with a Sagittarius male! You should love the same things he does. Sagittarius men can be very funny and interesting. He will go to restaurants, but throw out his suit and tie. Sagittarius males like their comfort and the wide open spaces and places, and freedom with their women. Make no mistake about it, he does love women, all of them. When your Sagittarian's heart goes out to you, he won't know what to do about it, because he didn't expect to fall in love. If you live with him, he won't find time to go down the aisle. Sagittarius men dread the thought of a tuxedo, and the stares from wedding guests. You will have to drag your Sagittarius male to the altar!</span></div>

Dress in your designer clothes, and be impeccable. Pinstripes and subtle scents arouse her. Be successful at whatever you are undertaking. Let her know about it. It's ok, to tell her you made two million last year. Don't be cheap. Tell her you have been saving yourself for the right woman, and that you have been working your buns off, to build your empire. Tell her you need someone to share this big business burden with, and that your thoughts are about expanding your business. Hint that a woman would be perfect as a manager in your new expansion. She will be so intrigued, that she will offer you sound business suggestions. She is SMART! Capricorn females won't compete with you, they'll help climb the ladder. Don't forget about her. She loves expensive presents with thought behind them. Her little "black book" is filled with business appointments, not telephone numbers. Capricorn women are almost always successful in whatever they undertake. They don't take enough time to eat, so take her to lunch, dinner and your next corporate meeting. Business thrills them. She may seem cold emotionally, but don't be fooled. She has those sexual infernos, looking for a release! She does not trust men entirely, so don't give her the bums rush, or you will be part of the homeless. She would be a great wife to a success-oriented man. She can entertain your clients, and friends. Capricorn females, can be boss in marriage too. Be prepared to be hen-pecked, if you are thinking marriage! You will love to have her..<br>LOVE MATCH:&gt;TAURUS</span><br><br><span style="color: dark blue;"><strong>Capricorn Male[December 22-January 20 - Capricorn]</strong><br>If you are dating a Capricorn male, plan on doing most of the talking. He will take you to places with class and ambience. He will pick you up in his black, luxury car. You will be treated like a lady. Therefore, you should let him open the doors, etc. Dress in style, but be sure you show some cleavage. Still waters run deep with Capricorn males. Your first dates will seem like business meetings, but eventually you will get to know him. He is insecure about his emotions and likes to keep them under control. Of course, he won't make this obvious. Compliment him on his achievements and he will open up to you. He would be strict as a parent, and holds very traditional beliefs about relationships. Don't be an airhead or aimless. He appreciates a hard working woman, whom he can consider an equal. He does not know how to play, so you will have to lighten him up with your humorous antics and fun loving side. Once your Capricorn man commits, he will not leave you. Divorce is a nasty word in his vocabulary. Capricorn males make good husbands and breadwinners. They are extravagant with gifts to those whom they love.

Be fascinating, tell her that you are going to Spain to run with the bulls. Explain your philosophy on combining chemicals to combat radiation. Tell her about your thesis which was published in the "International Who Dunnit Magazine". Don't tell her you are in love with her too soon. You will know when she has taken a strong liking to you. That is when your Aquarius female will invite you to her abode. Then you will see the real Aquarius female. There will be many unusual pictures, and books. There is a story connected to all of her belongings. When your Aquarius female commits to you, she will not necessarily be ready for marriage. That is just her way of saying she likes you. You must have like minds, or there will be no future Mrs. Anybody!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Aquarius Male [January 21-February 19 - Aquarius]</strong><br>If you are dating an Aquarius male, consider yourself lucky to even get the first date. Aquarius males don't date much. They would rather be an observer, hanging out on the scene. He would prefer to go to your house and have long talks into the night, and possibly just stay over. He may tell you that he just videotaped an erotica video featuring wild animals at the zoo with some vacationing starlets. He may stay at your house, never cook or clean, but just be there, when you come home from work. Then one day, without warning, he will be gone. If he is employed, he can be quite selfish with his money. He likes his freedom, in every way. Eventually he will call you..... expect the unexpected with Aquarius. When Aquarius males fall in love, it is usually with someone who is intellectual, self-sufficient, and childless. Have a deep purpose or goal in life and he will be attracted to your dreams. Aquarius males will marry, but they usually marry the wrong person the first time, and shy away from second marriages. They love their mental freedom. Nagging won't change them. He won't care what race you are, how much you weigh, etc. Mind altering drugs can ruin an Aquarian male for marriage completely. If he is more holistic, then he is searching for a soul mate. Love yourself and your Aquarius male will too!</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Pisces Female [February 20-March 20 - Pisces]</strong><br>If you are dating a Pisces female, take her to a psychic far, art gallery, or out for cocktails.

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=DarkRed]<strong>Are You In Love with an Aries?</strong><br>If you are in love with an Aries man or woman, give this person flattery and firmness.  Aries like to be noticed and will bask in the glow of your affection and attention.  Slightly self-centered, this individual thinks and talks in the "I" mode (not presuming to speak for another).  Able to take care of him(her)self, this being believes that you can take care of yourself, too.  Because this is one of the strongest signs, Aries can be incredibly pushy. If you want to live happily ever after with this soul, you are going to have to learn how to push back.<br><br>Aries doesn't actually want to run over you, but this person thrives on challenges and enjoys the fight.  There is generally an assumption made that you like the fight, too. Using your wit will impress this being a great deal more than resorting to a physical challenge. Aries also love the chase.  They enjoy being in the driver's seat and pursuing a potential lover with craft and skill. You will lose this being's interest in a hurry if you are too easily or quickly won.  If you know how to spar, you will have better luck with Aries.  Being somewhat elusive, especially in the beginning, is like issuing a challenge to this toreador.  Aries need physical activity and they love to compete.  If you are not a particularly physical person yourself, be sure to encourage your honey to work off this energy on his or her own.  You will find you have fewer arguments as a result.  One thing that you can count on with this lover, however, is a short grudge.  This person has too much to do to waste time on nursing wounds and will actually forget almost any trespass quite quickly.  Don't expect him(her) to read your mind if you are holding onto one, because it will be totally misread. Just as the rain washes away the dust from the road, a good night's sleep or the passage of a few days' time generally cleanses the cobwebs from this soul's mind.<br><br>[color=Green]<strong>Are You In Love with a Taurus?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Taurus man or woman, understand that this person is a one-woman man or a one-man woman (unless Gemini predominates elsewhere in the natal chart).  Primarily interested in security, this being is looking to settle down and doesn't need a lot of movement.  Preferring routine activities and traditional, established pleasures, this person is happy to continue on with whatever he or she has been doing for years.  You will need to be able to fit somewhat into this already settled routine.  You will attract his or her attention by giving gifts of quality; ticktacks is a turnoff for these practical souls. Known for their good taste, you will be more interesting to this being if you value yourself. Paying attention to your clothing and hair will help to show him or her that you understand the importance of appearance.<br><br>Taureans love to stay home and get cozy in their nests. Their idea of a good time is to rent a bunch of videos and veg out on the couch or in the easy chair.  They also enjoy gourmet foods and fine wines and will often have highly developed culinary abilities.  These souls can definitely be won over through their stomachs, so dig up your best recipes and give it a try.  They do, however, sometimes resemble their animal, the bull, in that they cannot be pushed; you will see some real digging in if you try.  Gentle persuasion is a much better tool with these people.  You also should be aware that, in general, they often need to ponder each word that you speak before being able to give you an answer. Allowing these souls a moment to think before expecting a response will result in a much happier relationship.<br><br>Taureans also have a real need for security; you won't make points by squandering assets or avoiding saving.  These beings need to have a home base which belongs to them and where they know they can retreat to in times of trouble. A nest egg for rainy days is also an essential.</div>
