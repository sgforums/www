            <div class='col-md body'>[color=brown]<strong>Are You In Love with a Gemini?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Gemini man or woman, give him or her elusively and a lot of space alone.  This individual needs a great deal of stimulation to stay interested and you will be much more appealing if you have some interests and friends of your own.  Detachment is also a help here and you must guard against sentimentality with this soul.  Remembering that this person is, for the most part, a thinker rather than a feeler will help to keep this relationship in perspective.  Changing your hair, your dress, or your schedule is another way to keep this one off guard.  Spontaneity is extremely valued by this sign so buying theatre tickets or home plate seats from time to time can make you more attractive.  If you can drop what you are doing at a moment's notice in order to travel up the coast for a romantic weekend, you will definitely score a hit here.  The ability to have fun is another must as it is practically a religion for this individual.  If you can handle a relationship that is light and loose, you will be happier with this soul than if you are too attached.<br><br>Remember, too, that Gemini is a sign of duality.  You may sometimes feel as though you are living with two different people here and you never can tell which one will present itself.  Patience comes in handy if you prefer one twin to the other.  It also helps to realize that this being is inherently restless. You will need to be able to keep pace with a odd deal of movement around the neighborhood as well as within your home.  Don't expect the furniture to stay in one place with this sign, either.  He(she) will soon find a better place to put the couch, the rug, the glass cabinet, or the pots and pans and you will be perceived as boring and dull if you complain. If you think of this type of living as exciting, you will be very happy here.<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>Are You In Love with a Cancer?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Cancer man or woman, give him or her your understanding.  This is a sensitive soul who needs to be brought out of the shell with attention and discussion.  Patience is important here as often (but not always) as this individual is quiet or shy. He or she will only share innermost thoughts after a great deal of trust has been established.  A Cancer lover is a deeply feeling person.  Once you have secured his or her love, you will be placed first, above all others, in everything that you do. You will be expected to return the favor.  Somewhat possessive, this man or woman is prepared to dedicate life to you and wants to know that you appreciate it.  Passion is also extremely important here.  Although you will be encouraged to keep the matter between the two of you, sexy underwear and satin sheets are a hit.  Your pleasure is extremely important to this being's happiness so don't be afraid to explain what you like (diplomatically).<br><br>And, return the favor by asking in kind.  This person is really a homebody and will work tirelessly to fluff up the nest.  Preferring the company of the clan to large crowds, a Cancer lover is often willing to invest in a swimming pool or hot tub.  Or, you do well when you share many sports or activities such as skiing, sailing, or bowling. A cabin on the lake or a mountainside condominium is also attractive to this man or woman; the only other necessity is to have you right by his or her side....  This is one honey who can also be counted upon to help out with household chores.  Dishes, dusting, sweeping, hedge trimming, and lawn mowing are almost akin to lovemaking (love of home) in his or her eyes.  All you need to do is be 100% loyal and you will be treated like the King or Queen of the Castle.  It's quite a small price to pay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Are You In Love with a Leo?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Leo man or woman, the most important thing you can give him or her is your attention.  This is one mate who will charm and caress you, make passionate love with you, dance with you into the wee hours of the morning, give you the Sun, the Moon and the Stars, and all you have to do is notice!  But, notice you must.  It is true that most Leos need pats on the back as much as the rest of us require air to breathe.  This is because, for all their vim and vigor and outward confidence, Leos are actually quite shy and vulnerable on the inside.  In fact, it can be said that the louder and more brash a Leo sounds, the more insecure he or she is feeling at the time.<br><br>A Leo lover is loyal, warm, generous, and fun. This is one individual who truly knows how to have a good time, and he or she wants you to be included in it.  You are a very special audience to this person and you are treated like royalty.  A Leo is not particularly interested in dating just anybody and you must stand out from the crowd to garner this one's attention.  He or she wants both of you to shine.  You will be appreciated even more if you don't mind letting this honey glow in the limelight.  A great storyteller, this one has a natural ability to draw a crowd of beaming faces.  Jealousy doesn't go over too well here.  You needn't worry overly much about losing his or her affections; once a Leo gives his (her) heart, loyalty comes right along with it.  While this mate likes to make dramatic statements, ticktacks does not do.  Gifts should be of quality and you are amazed at the ones showered upon you. Compliments keep them coming.<br><br>A fixed sign, this honey sometimes may become set in his/her ways.  Personal opinions are very important to this lover and it may be hard to change this premeditated mind.  Gentle persuasion works best here as well as pointing out the better aspects of his/her argument.  You can expect a lot from this lover.  He or she has a way of keeping life interesting and movement and action are constant companions.  If you are looking for a good time spelled F-U-N, you have certainly found it here.</span><br><br><strong>Are You In Love with a Virgo?</strong><br>If you love a Virgo, give him or her attention to detail. Some Â– but not all.  Virgos are neatness and cannot stand living in a mess. Others need for you to acknowledge their ideas or accomplishments.  But all will be fussy about something, and you will keep this one happy by discovering wherein lies the pet peeve and steering clear of it.  It is best if you realize that this individual has a real need for order in some aspect of his or her life.  This person can be counted upon to be consistent in a particular area for you, and feels cheated if the favor is not returned.<br><br>Because a Virgo is able to see the potential perfection in everything, don't be offended if little comments arise about getting the lint off your sweater or re-working your resumÃ©.  He(she) just wants you to look your best and is happy to help you do so.  Remember, too, that this person sees life largely through an intellectual window.  He or she can always be reasoned with but may have a hard time dealing with displays of emotion.  This doesn't mean that your feelings aren't important; it just indicates that you may need to explain them rather than expect this honey to intuitively understand.  A Virgo lover likes to know and follow certain around rules so you probably should spend some time discussing his or her expectations as well as your own at the beginning of this relationship.  As long as you keep the lines of communication open, this should ward off any potential misunderstandings in the future.  You won't, however, find a more loyal mate anywhere.  This is one honey who keeps all of his(her) loving for you alone and expects you to do the same.  Fresh sheets and clean skin turn this person on more than fancy perfumes or sexy underwear, too.  Respect for this one's person and belongings keeps him or her right by your side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=DarkRed]<strong>Are You In Love with a Libra?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Libran man or woman, give him or her your attention and your company.  This is one individual who truly wants to share as much as possible in life and will be a faithful and dedicated partner if given the chance. You may notice, too, that he(she) always strives to be inclusive of not only you, but friends and acquaintances as well.  This person truly needs interactions with others and desires a full social life above many other things. Because of his(her) desire for balance, you may also see some striking dualities here. Soft lights and classical music could be interspersed with wild dancing revelries to rock and roll; each Libra expresses this aspect in his or her own way.  Whatever the oppositions at work here, they will play and interplay in equal amounts.  If you are not as comfortable with one side, just wait a bit until the other reappears.<br><br>A touch of class and refinement works best here, too.  This is one individual who is singularly unimpressed with the grubby or ordinary.  Fine china and linen are generally preferred on the table as are brand names in the clothing.  Also, if you seek to impress this person by sending flowers, exotic lilies and tropical orchids work much better than a regular bunch of carnations.  Think elegant here. Libran is also very concerned with appearance and wants you to be proud of him(her).  With excellent taste and a superb sense of color, he(she) should be allowed to pick out the shades and hues for the home and office.  This individual will often throw together some dramatic tints that you may not appreciate until you actually see.<br><br>You can be sure, however, that this honey will never leave you lonely.  He(she) understands togetherness unlike most other signs and you would do well to return the favor.  Be careful, too, not to accept too many gratuities without exchange as he(she) will be aware of the imbalance and may harbor silent resentments in the future.  Enjoying the fun, sharing, and caring of this individual while giving back the same will ensure a long, happy, and prosperous relationship for both of you.<br><br>[color=Green]<strong>Are You In Love with a Scorpio?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Scorpio man or woman, give him or her your full attention and devotion. Sharp as a tack, this person definitely notices everything.  You will be able to keep no secrets here; this individual is an expert at ferreting them out.  Truthfulness is well appreciated by this mate.  Emotions are extremely important to a Scorpio and you must be willing to explore the range (the valleys as well as the peaks) in order to keep this partner happy.<br><br>Passionate and possessive, he(she) needs a lot of physical expression.  This mate often even defines his(her) relationship to you by the amount of actual physical connection.  If you are not interested in touchy feel, you might want to look elsewhere for true happiness.  Loyalty is also very valuable to this individual as he(she) will want to look at you as being his(hers) alone. Should you stumble in this area, you may be forgiven but don't think that your Scorpio lover will forget (with such a sharp mind, little is forgotten).  Of course, this works both ways and a more devoted mate would be hard to find.  You have in this partner an extremely strong personality.  This relationship works best if you can maintain some of your own strength and keep things equal.  Finding other arenas to excel in by yourself can also help here as very few signs can successfully compete with Scorpio.  Don't ever try to force something on this mate, either; coaxing works better than brute force here.  Be aware, too, that Scorpio's power is often of the hidden variety.  You mustn't take this mate at face value only.<br><br>If you delight in challenges, enjoy the world of emotions and are also a sturdy and strong personality, you may have just your cup of tea here.  This is one individual who is going places and, if you can keep up, would be happy to take you along.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=brown]<strong>Are You In Love with a Sagittarius?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Sagittarius man or woman, give him or her freedom and honesty.  This is one honey who will resist any and all efforts to be pinned down too definitively and you would do best to understand this from the start.  They are the players of love.  He(she) needs plenty of rope.  Don't expect quick commitment here either; this lover is fairly independent and enjoys his(her) own company.  You will never be bored with a Sagittarius partner though.  This individual is interested in almost everything and delights in sharing knowledge with you and everyone else.  "Flirt" could be a middle name here.  Jealousy is a no-no as the exchange of conversation is nearly as important as air and food to this person.<br><br>Friendly as a new puppy, he(she) meanders about collecting and dispensing data with all comers.  Physical fitness is also important here.  Often possessing natural athletic abilities, he(she) can be found hiking, biking, running, or skiing, and will want you to keep right up alongside.  You will have many joint memories of wilderness treks, roaring campfires, and starlit nights.  Adventuresomeness is quite near the top of the qualities you must have to be of any interest to this enterprising individual.  The meek need not apply.  Your main challenges here may be learning to live with the occasional disorganization of this busy soul and the directness which could be construed as lack of tact.  You must understand that this person abhors dishonesty and is quite incapable of participating in it.  Too many concurrent projects can scatter his(her) energy but your encouragement may be all that's needed to keep the number reasonable.<br><br>You have found a dynamic partner in this mate.  Enjoy the wit and repartee, explore new worlds and lost civilizations together and talk until the wee hours of the morning.  With this individual, you can have fun!<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>Are You In Love with a Capricorn?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Capricorn man or woman, give him or her encouragement and support.  This is one honey who will work diligently to provide you with the best that money can buy and all you have to do is notice.  Quiet and competent, he or she goes about business with a professional attitude and a desire to please.  You are always on his(her) mind even though you may not be hearing this often.  Pats on the back are appreciated here.  You do, however, need to realize that career is like lifeblood to this individual.  He(she) sees personal, professional work much like a husband looks upon his bride.  There will be late nights at the office, business trips, or working weekends, and you will be expected to understand.  Of course, all of this is done for your benefit so you will definitely be reaping some of the rewards.  Order is also important here.  Dishes left in the sink and loose socks cluttering up the bedroom floor will definitely be a turn-off.  Helpful hints from this individual are not meant as a criticism; he(she) just wants to assist in your perfection.  You will also be expected to honor all dates and appointments; this man or woman is completely punctual and reliable and wants you to be the same.<br><br>Knowledge of proper etiquette might come in handy, too. With this mate, you have found a partner who is going places and is willing to take you along.  It won't happen on the instant/credit plan, though, as he(she) truly wants to earn it and own it personally.  Because this individual is sometimes shy, you may need to get this individual talking in order to avoid the buildup of resentments.  You are asked to contribute a lot here, but much is also given.  Together, the two of you will reach for the stars.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><strong>Are You In Love with an Aquarius?</strong><br>If you are in love with an Aquarius, give him or her a very long leash and your respect.  This is one of the most freedom-oriented of all the signs and this individual will not tolerate nagging or any cramping of his(her) style.  You must understand that here you have found a person who truly looks at the world from a different perspective and needs to be supported in this endeavor.  Bright and original, this partner sees the world as it will be or should be and feels somewhat personally responsible to bring the future about.  Some Aquarians feel so strongly about this that they are almost revolutionary in thought and behavior.<br><br>Aquarius, as a rule, is also much more comfortable in the realm of thought than that of emotion.  This person actually has the ability to detach from his(her) body and view conversations and situations from above.  You needn't worry about judgment, though, as he(she) is extremely tolerant of everything except intolerance.  Friends are important to this individual and you can expect a steady stream either through your house or his(her) business.  You have found here, too, a partner that truly seeks an equal relationship.  He or she wants to stand on his(her) own and wants you to do the same.  This is the eleventh sign of the zodiac and if you look at the number 11, it represents masculine and feminine -- separate -- but also side by side and equal.  As we are currently proceeding into the great "Age of Aquarius," this is good news for us all.<br><br>Flexibility is also a must with this mate as he(she) enjoys last-minute and/or unexpected surprises.  "Boring" will not be a word you use to describe this relationship as he(she) keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.  If you are looking for a partner with whom to have a fair and interesting match, you have found it here.</span><br><br><strong>Are You In Love with a Pisces?</strong><br>If you are in love with a Pisces man or woman, give him or her attention and sympathy.  You have met here an individual who will quietly listen to the tales of your days -- good and bad ? and desires only the same consideration in return.  Gentle and caring, he(she) provides a safe haven in any kind of weather and can be counted upon to get you back on track.  Make sure that you do the same. Little gifts are greatly appreciated here and they need not be expensive.  The idea of the token of your affection keeps this individual smiling and returning the favor with surprises of his(her) own.  Snuggle-bunnies (hugs) or other displays of tenderness are also essential for true happiness with this mate.  You may need to make a conscientious effort to keep him or her talking about his(her) feelings.  Though deeply emotional inside, this particular sign -- more than others -- is prone to suffer in silence rather than speak out about personal irritations or let-downs.  Disaster lurks down that road as unexpressed emotions carry a punch far greater than expressed ones.  Make sure that the lines of communication stay open and you can avoid this pitfall.<br><br>Don't be alarmed when this honey desires to spend time alone; it is essential for his(her) mental health.  Pisces doesn't have as strong an aura as many of the other signs do and needs to re-charge the batteries without anyone else around from time to time.  Kindness also pays off in this match.  Often polite, he(she) generally is not fond of harsh words or rude phrases.  You have found here a person who prizes serenity above all else and one who will appreciate your efforts to keep the waters calm.  Once acquired, this bond will be long-lived and true blue.<br></div>

The<br>typical Leo is flamboyant and generous with tremendous charm and a magnanimous spirit. The fixed quality of this sign does help to restrain a large dose of over-exuberance.

Sulking results when they are not the absolute centre of attention. Leo will drum up some scene both good and bad to get attention, any attention! Leos can be very self opinionated, bombastic, and overbearing. One of Leos most noted traits is too much pride, leading to pomposity and snobbery. The other noted negative trait is being far to touchy, touchy about everything. When Leos pride and feelings are hurt the temperature drops, they become very touchy and retire to their throne.<br><br>Proud, jealous (sibling rivalry starts here), vain, bullying, pompous,<br>snobbish, intolerant, dogmatic, stubborn, patronising, egotistical,<br>conceited.<br><br>Ailments<br>Backache, palpitations, fainting, blood disorders, fevers, dizziness heart problems, pill-popping.<br><br>Beneficial foods<br>Oranges and peas.<br><br>You are most compatible with<br>Gemini - full of laughter.<br>Aries - memorable.<br>Cancer - loving.<br>Libra - great fun.<br>Capricorn - it will be short, but sweet.<br><br>Absolutely no chance!<br>Scorpio - a clash of the big egos.<br>Virgo - a difficult match.<br>Leo - a battle of the wills.<br>Aquarius - difficult but entertaining!<br><br>Your opposite sign<br>is Aquarius<br><br>Someone you know?<br>Mr. Toad, of wind in the willows<br>Napoleon,<br>Mussolini,<br>Bill Clinton,<br>Slobodan Milosovich!<br>David Essex,<br>Prince William,<br>Neil Armstrong,<br>Edward Alexander,<br>Bill "Count" Basie,<br>Lucille Ball,<br>Emily Bronte,<br>Fidel Castro,<br>Alexander Dumas,<br>Amelia Earhart,<br>Henry Ford Sr,<br>Alfred Hitchcock,<br>Aldous Huxley,<br>Carl Jung,<br>Gene Kelly,<br>Mata Hari,<br>Robert Mitchum,<br>Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,<br>Robert Redford,<br>Yves Saint Laurent,<br>George Bernard Shaw,<br>Superman,<br>Orville Wright,<br>Natalie Wood,<br>Mae West,<br>Andy Warhol,<br>Maddona,<br>Geri Halliwell.<br><br>Someplace you know?<br>Colorado<br>Hawaii<br>Texas<br>Missouri<br>New York State<br>Italy<br>Los Angeles<br>Rome<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>the Fiery Sagittarius Character<br><br>Sagittarius THE ARCHER is the sign of the gypsy<br>Sagittarians prefer to be footloose and fancy free, however should they become involved in a relationship they make it as enjoyable and as much fun as possible.

They interact spontaneously with life as they continue a lifelong quest for meaning. This sign needs a great deal of freedom, but is equally willing to offer freedom to others. Having an open minded and intellectual curiosity means that Sagittarius is willing to learn about other people in an effort to understand them, while being trusting and open. In fact Sagittarians say what they mean with complete and devastating frankness!<br><br>Jovial, optimistic, versatile, open-minded, philosophical, sincere, frank,visionary.<br><br>The dark side<br>Thinking with their mouths, tactlessness and boastfulness tend to upset others, unfortunately Sagittarius possesses all of these traits. While a tendency to moralise and preach on what you or I should do, while following a completely different set of rules themselves does not help either. One of Sagittarius great difficulties lies within relationships. They are completely able to be faithful to two people at once. Bored Sagittarians are a danger to themselves and others. Their attitude is that anything goes, so long as it is entertaining.

Many people seem prepared to brave this tedious behaviour for an evening of fine food and wine that will always appear at Taurean dinner parties.

Virgos find it hard to express love, they have a thoughtful approach and always look before they leap.<br><br>The bright side<br>The Virgo character is marked by a sharp intellect which is typically used to analyse the natural order. Virgos are methodical, oh so precise, and are attracted to only that knowledge that can be applied usefully. They will happily share this information with anyone, it confirms their own usefulness in the world, and brings them eagerly out of there shells.Virgo pursues very how standards born out of realism and a tight grip on their environment, rather than any chase of high ideals.<br>Caution is a Virgo trait which if used positively will give them a fine<br>sense of discrimination between practical ideas and those to be left in the sky. Virgos will usually develop this skill to improve themselves and their surroundings as they place great pride in tangible achievements.<br><br>Discriminating, fastidious, analytical, meticulous, modest, precise.<br><br>The dark side<br>In their urge to label, organise, and precisely understand all things in life, Virgo can become rather obsessed with the whole idea of "order".

Although they are cautious and introverted, they can be very faithful once in a relationship. They really need a partner who will support them emotionally, while giving them a much needed boost in confidence.<br><br>The bright side<br>One of Capricorns best assets is its sense of humour, this is often needed in their efforts to impose some kind of order on the world around them,(though not necessarily an order to everyone else's liking). Although the humour is dry, it does at least involve contact with others, something that the self contained Capricorn does not excel at. What capricorn is very good at are those tasks that other signs, (except the other earth signs), find rather tedious.

The prudent and cautious side of their nature can be taken to extremes resulting in the unsociable realm of the miser.<br>Capricorn needs to be in control to such an extent that they are often authoritarian.

Although they hate to be tied down, they make lively, entertaining and romantic partners, even if they can be rather fickle if bored or unhappy.<br>Natural communicators, Geminis do not suffer fools gladly; so once they are attracted to people, they have to ensure that they are not dull or mundane. They will no doubt spend ages chatting to them about every subject under the sun, just to keep feeding that ever active and inquisitive mind.<br><br>The bright side<br>Bright, witty, adaptable and quick to react. Very little troubles a Gemini or stops the relentless talking for long! Geminis can argue their way into or out of any situation. Having an active curiosity, Gemini is excellant at gathering all kinds of information and gossip. They excel at regurgitating this information in a constant stream, but not necessarily in a logical or understandable order! Geminis are capable of tackling almost anything, so long as they do not become bored. The difficulty lies in what subject to concentrate on today, Gemini is always engaged in two subjects or jobs at once.<br><br>Versatile, adaptable, intellectual, witty, charming, logical, energetic,<br>spontaneous, lively, chatty, amusing, youthful, up-to-date.<br><br>The dark side<br>Geminis biggest faults are inconsistency and superficiality.

A life without love is just not worth contemplating, Libra can not function without someone special, for they long for emotional security.

Libra is a sign that values peace at all costs, and is very fair minded. People like being around Librans, for in the event of a dispute they will seek a compromise. A word of caution on this compromise though, for things may not be what they seem, Librans can if they wish charm the birds from the trees!<br><br>Charming, easy going, romantic, diplomatic, idealistic, refined, in love with love.<br><br>The dark side<br>Oh the indecisiveness is famous! Librans either sit on the fence,<br>(attempting to appear pleasing to all parties), or they swing wildly from one side of the argument to the other, (and not necessarily dependant on who they are talking to!)<br>This is not the most reliable of signs, either in what they should do, or in maintaining any particular view point. They are often accused of being two faced. Beneath that charming exterior it is less well known, and stealthily concealed that they are very self centred, and insist on getting their own way, (whatever that is today).<br><br>Indecisive, resentful, frivolous, changeable, flirtatious, easily<br>influenced, highly susceptible to flattery.<br><br>Ailments<br>Eczema, skin diseases, kidney and bladder infections, diabetes, abcesses,lumbago, vein disorders.<br><br>Beneficial foods<br>Strawberries and plums.<br><br>You are most compatible with<br>Aquarius - a marvellous match.<br>Gemini - sublime.<br>Aries - opposites attract.<br>Scorpio - emotionally rewarding.<br>Taurus - very sensual.<br><br>Absolutely no chance!<br>Capricorn - don't bet on this one.<br>Cancer - very hard work.<br>Virgo - discordant.<br>Libra - indecisive, no decisive, whatever!<br>Sagittarius - too flighty.<br><br>Your opposite sign<br>is Aries<br><br>Someone you know?<br>Eve in the garden of Eden,<br>Brigitte Bardot,<br>John Lennon,<br>Michael Douglas,<br>Sting,<br>Julie Andrews,<br>Charlie Brown,<br>Johnny Carson,<br>Jimmy Carter,<br>Dwight Eisenhower,<br>F.

Their firm views and opinions can change to stubbornness if they are pushed into a corner. Nevertheless they are very faithful and supportive in the right relationship. Even though they may get thoroughly involved within a relationship aquarians need to preserve their privacy and independence.<br><br>The bright side<br>Aquarians are usually lively, inventive and oh so original! Sailing in the opposite direction to the crowd comes naturally to aquarius, in fact this does not worry them, as they are always out of step with the world because they think ahead of their time and revel in anything different. As aquarius thinks today. so the world will think tomorrow. Aquarius is the most happily eccentric sign in the zodiac. Although it can be very difficult to get close to an aquarian, this fixed sign is loyal and faithful.<br>Should you ask an aquarian for help, you will immediately get it, and all promises will be kept (at some point in the future).

This is a sign which can in extremes be totally dedicated to being unconventional, being wired the other way round.<br><br>This is a sign which can become detached to the point of coldness, stuck in a rigid and unrecognisable pattern.

Being loved is vital to their well-being. They are very caring, and make compassionate and reflective partners.<br><br>The bright side<br>Piscean sensitivity is so finely tuned that it reacts like blotting paper<br>to the atmosphere. When nursing the sick, for instance, Pisceans are apt to reflect a patient's own symptoms themselves. Indeed, Pisceans often have problems defining the boundaries between fact and fiction in general.<br><br>Pisces is empathetic and compassionate, and cannot bear to see another living being in pain. Indeed, Pisceans feel very deeply about other people as they do not have a strong sense of separation and individuality. Pisces is an intuitive sign which can receive great inspiration. Pisceans are thus the natural mediums and mystics of the zodiac who can communicate their inner vision through either the arts or the sciences, or caring professions. Pisces can also be a sign of selfless or self-sacrificing devotion, and is capable of truly unconditional love for others.<br><br>Artistic, kind, sympathetic, intuitive, visionary, sensitive, adaptable,<br>receptive.<br><br>The dark side<br>The Pisces personality has a number of sub personalities who are likely to take over at the drop of a hat. They include the victim, the martyr and the saviour or rescuer; and once Pisces gets locked into these patterns, it can be very difficult to shift. This can be hard on other people involved, too, for Pisceans can inflict or receive, considerable suffering when they enter into a guilt ridden phase.<br><br>The other negative Piscean trait involves the illusion and confusion which surrounds their ability to tell the truth, known as lying by the more pragmatic signs. Pisceans tend to be too imaginative for their own good, and serve their own good even if they believe themselves that they are serving others.<br><br>Impractical, vague, careless, spiteful, manipulative, confused,<br>weak-willed, indecisive, easily led astray, greedy, immoral.<br><br>Ailments<br>Bunions, chilblains, alcoholism, drug addiction, lymphatic and glandular disorders, forgetfulness, insanity.<br><br>Beneficial foods<br>Raisins, dates and cereals.<br><br>You are most compatible with<br>Pisces - totally bliss,<br>Libra - a fairy tale romance,<br>Taurus - an excellent match,<br>Leo - a romantic couple,<br>Scorpio - such fun and so tantalising.<br><br>Absolutely no chance!<br>Sagittarius - so many problems,<br>Aquarius - do take care,<br>Gemini - really needs insight,<br>Aries - you will need total dedication here.<br><br>Your opposite sign<br>is Virgo<br><br>Someone you know?<br>Don Quixote,<br>George Washington,<br>Albert Einstein,<br>Elizabeth Taylor,<br>Rudolf Nureyev,<br>Ffion Jenkins,<br>Alexander Graham Bell,<br>Harry Belafonte,<br>Johnny Cash,<br>Frederic Chopin,<br>John Foster Dulles,<br>Peter Fonda,<br>Rex Harrison,<br>Lord Snowden,<br>Ted Kennedy,<br>Jerry Lewis,<br>Michaelangelo,<br>Liza Minnelli,<br>Ralph Nader,<br>David Niven,<br>Sidney Poitier,<br>Lynn Redgrave,<br>Auguste Renoir,<br>Harold Wilson,<br>Drew Barrymore.<br><br>Someplace you know?<br>Florida<br>Maine<br>Nebraska<br>Ohio<br>Vermont<br>Portugal<br>South Africa<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> Hope you enjoyed...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>EGYPTIAN HOROSCOPES<br><br>Unknown till it was discovered by archaeologists, the mystic horoscope is divided into 12 signs, each one ruled by a different Egyptian god. 4000 years ago,mothers took their new born baby girls to the Temple of the Sun on the banks of the Nile, where priests consulted sacred writings to foretell the infants' romantic futures.<br><br>Here exclusively, are the 12 birth signs and the significance of each<br>to those born under them:<br><br>JANUARY 1st - FEBRUARY 2nd<br>AMMON (GOD OF PROPHETS)<br>Those born under this sign have a sure talent for recognising Mr/Ms Right the first time they see him/her - for them it's often a matter of love at first sight. When this happens, usually at a chance meeting in public places like shopping malls or restaurants, you can attract him/her by radiating happiness. You'll find it will captivate him/her.<br><br>FEBRUARY 3rd - MARCH 4th<br>SUCHOS (GOD OF THE SACRED NILE)<br>Better known as the Crocodile God, Suchos guarded the treasures of ancient Egypt. Those born under this sign are attracted by beauty, and ancient wise men warned them not to be blinded by it. "Look beyond an attractive appearance and find the real man beneath," they warned. "Listen to your heart, instead of what your eyes tell you."<br><br>MARCH 5th - APRIL 9th<br>OSIRIS (GOD OF FERTILITY)<br>If you were born under this sign, don't expect to fall in love at first<br>sight. Those ruled by Osiris need time for love to put down roots in<br>their hearts, but it will grow stronger until it blossoms into romance that will last a lifetime.<br><br>APRIL 10th - MAY 2nd<br>PTAH (GOD OF TRUTH)<br>Ptah's people are very sincere and have to be careful to avoid being hurt in romance. You'll find your Mr/Ms Right practically on your doorstep because you've known him/her for a long time. Because he's down-to-earth type who appreciates sincerity, he'll be attracted to you sooner or later, so don't be pushy<br>when you recognise him.<br><br>MAY 3rd - JUNE 16th<br>HORUS (GOD OF LIFE)<br>The hawk-headed god rules a fickle sign - those born under it have<br>roving eyes and a passionate nature. Life for them is finding a series of Mr/Ms Rights, and they have no trouble doing it. For true Romantic happiness, you need a very strong, steady type of man/woman who can tame your restless spirit and still give you the excitement you crave.<br><br>JUNE 17th - JULY 21st<br>NEPHTAPHIS (GODDESS OF TRUE LOVE)<br>Beautiful Nephtaphis watches over this most dreamily romantic of all signs. Her children are incredibly loyal to their lovers, and are actually capable of becoming one with them in body, mind and soul.<br>For this reason they have to be careful to choose men/women as caring and considerate as themselves, or they will cruelly be taken advantage of.<br><br>JULY 22nd - AUGUST 18<br>SETI (GOD OF THUNDER &amp; LIGHTNING)<br>Like their turbulent guardian, those born under this sign have<br>quicksilver temperaments and have to keep their thermostats lowered if they want their love lives to heat up. You need an even-tempered, understanding type who can put up with your occasional outbursts.<br><br>AUGUST 19th - SEPTEMBER 21st<br>ANUBIS (THE PROTECTOR GOD)<br>If you were lucky enough to be born under this sign, you can look<br>forward to life-long romance that will never stop growing. Mr/Ms Right for you is the mystery man type who has a multi-faceted personality and will forever be revealing new and fascinating aspects of himself/herself, thereby continually giving<br>you something new about himself for you to love.<br><br>SEPTEMBER 22nd - OCTOBER 15th<br>RA (THE SUN GOD)<br>You'll have no trouble finding Mr/Ms Right because you're what every man/woman is looking for - tender, understanding, passionate, and intensely loyal. Men/Women will flock to you, so you can afford to be choosy. Pick the man/woman who is most deserving of the prize you are, and don't look back. Your only fault is a tendency to wonder if you made the right choices in the past, so keep your eyes peeled on the future.<br><br>OCTOBER 16th - NOVEMBER 9th<br>ISIS (GODDESS OF MIRACLES) Those born under the sign of this ancient Egypt's chief goddess have a magic touch. With a smile, they can captivate any man/woman who attracts them. Finding<br>Mr/Ms Right is easy for Isis' sons/daughters they can spot him/her a mile off and snare him/her with their great charm.<br><br>NOVEMBER 10th - DECEMBER 3rd<br>THOTH (GOD OF LIGHT)<br>Thoth's children have a hard time displaying their feelings, especially the romantic ones. When you meet Mr/Ms Right, show him how you feel,don't keep him/her guessing or waiting.<br><br>DECEMBER 4th - DECEMBER 31st<br>HATHOR (GODDESS OF MUSIC &amp; THE ARTS)<br>Hathor's children are in love with love. They tend to fall head over<br>heels in love with the first man that shows any interest in them, and<br>they stick to them like glue. Keep a level head and be sure he's really Mr/Ms Right. Your type of man/woman likes harmony, and you have to show him/her that you're the one who can provide it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Australian Animal Zodiac on your Personality<br><br><strong>RED KANGAROO (Aries Mar 2 - Apr 19) </strong><br>The kangaroo or "great foot" has an abundance of speed.  His great feet with highly developed tendons allow an abundance of energy because of their self-supporting attitude.  The kangaroo sets down an intuitive path for its young to follow, ensuring its growth.  It has a nurturing tendency - supporting, fostering and encouraging its young.  The kangaroo has a strong sense of family togetherness.<br><br><strong>[color=DarkRed]F/Woman</strong><br>The red kangaroo woman is independent, optimistic and idealistic, with a strong faith in the future. She is capable of intense passion but is temperamental and likes freedom.  Although loyal, she dislikes playing a secondary role to a man.<br><br>[color=DarkBlue]<strong>F/Man</strong><br>The red kangaroo man is faithful and idealistic.  He dislikes flirtation and is both possessive and jealous. He is often intolerant, selfish and demanding, but can be sentimental.  He is generous but not good at budgets.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>HAIRY-NOSED WOMBAT (Taurus Apr 21 - May 21) </strong><br>Placid wombats go about their business largely unseen, stubbornly digging large underground homes where they can go to escape their predators.  Their tenacity means they don't give up on anything - wombats just keep digging until their goals are achieved.  Being nocturnal feeders gives them an advantage, as most predators are sleeping when wombats are feeding.<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The wombat woman usually has a friendly disposition and likes entertaining at home.  She likes her partner to be dependable and a good provider.  She has a mind of her own and is emotionally strong.  She has a strong sense of beauty and can excel at decorating her home.<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The wombat man is usually strong and masculine in his appearance, with a generous mouth and kindly eyes. He makes a good partner as he is loyal, considerate and romantic.  He loves his home and children and likes to provide those special extras for his woman.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>SUGAR GLIDER (Gemini May 22 - June 21) </strong><br>Known for their timid nature, gliders must take a giant leap of faith as they parachute themselves into the great unknown, usually landing safely in the arms of their carefully chosen tree.  In the darkness of the night and the silence of space, sugar gliders launch their way through life, trusting that the next tree will be there to catch them.<br><br>[color=darkred]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The sugar glider woman is often fickle and treats romance as a game.  She has a wonderful imagination and can be lively and happy when it suits her mood.  She has an appealing charm and is more practical than sentimental.  She can be attracted to a man for his intellectual qualities, but then suddenly become bored.  She is a thinker (and a very able one) and is often a career woman.<br><br>[color=darkblue]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The sugar glider man is a good talker and, with his ready wit, shines socially.  He is so unpredictable that his mood can change in a moment, and he has a tendency to become critical and irritable.  One moment, he can be sullen and morose, the next, up in the clouds.  His aims in life are changeable and his instabilities are often his undoing.  He is not known for being possessive or jealous. For him, variety is the spice of life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>KOALA (Cancer June 22 - July 23) </strong><br>Koalas, with their firm grip on life, always know where they are going by being aware of the opportunities they are presented with.  Koalas are very selective in the paths they take, and will foster only those directions that present the most enrichment.  They choose their trees very carefully as the choice not only provides their source of food, but also their bed.<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>A koala woman is good at saving and likes to build up reserves of food or essentials for rainy days.  She is motherly, protective and fond of her children and home.  She is very imaginative, highly sensitive and easily hurt.  Harsh words or criticism can wound her deeply and she will easily retreat into her tree.<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The koala man is wary of strangers and will never confide his secrets to others.  He loves his home and garden and has an affectionate and sentimental heart. He is usually very loyal, but even so, he can be fickle.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>FRILL-NECKED LIZARD (Leo July 24 - Aug 23) </strong><br>Lizards weave wonderful dreams of memories that have been long forgotten.  They remember the dreamtime, when they ruled the earth. Lizards, when under threat, will let drop their tails as a defense mechanism ensuring their survival, but people will not let go of past issues and this will be their undoing.<br><br>[color=darkred]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The frill-necked lizard woman is usually popular, good looking and has a vibrant personality.  She likes fine clothes and dressing up.  She dislikes slovenly men and likes to feel proud of her partner.  She loves going to dinner or to a show, and likes mixing with the best people, in the right places.  She is intelligent and has a good sense of humour and is inclined to be independent.  She has a soft heart, is usually sentimental, and has a weakness for flattery.<br><br>[color=darkblue]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The frill-necked lizard man likes to be dominant, but he can be jealous and has quite a strong temper if annoyed.  He can flirt and is often fickle, although he may not mean this at heart.  He dislikes loneliness, and will look for fun and pleasure and for the types of people who will blend with his ego. He is loyal and affectionate and generous with his money.  He is usually well built and is fond of sport.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>ECHIDNA (Virgo Aug 24 - Sept 23) </strong><br>The echidna is most likely to raise its spikes when someone gets too close; it needs it space.  The little creature is so safely encased in his own comfort zone, he is afraid to allow anyone in.  The moment it is threatened, it rolls itself into a ball so that nothing can harm - and it can't see the light.<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>An echidna woman likes a caring but not dominant partner.  She can be practical and loving at the same time.  She has an orderly and efficient mind and is usually well controlled, both mentally and emotionally.  She is loyal and respects the truth. She is fond of books, writing, concerts, artistic entertainment, and arts and crafts.<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The echidna man loves to work and is careful in his choice of partner.  He frowns upon dramatic declarations of love and of flirtatious and empty affairs.  He looks for an intelligent partner who will take an interest in family.  He is loyal, decent and possessive, but is not usually jealous.  He can be fairly strict with children but is always fair.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>COCKATOO (Libra Sept 24 - Oct 23) </strong><br>Cockatoos continually primp and preen their feathers to attract potential mates.  It is also a reflection of their high self-esteem.  Their open, friendly nature can be seen in their willingness to mix with others.  Cockatoos are sometimes seen alone but, mostly, they spend time in large groups enjoying each other's company.<br><br>[color=darkred]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The Cockatoo woman likes to own lovely things - beautiful clothes, perfume, pictures, fresh flowers, candlelight and good music.  She has a flair for socializing, and entertaining at home.  Her home will be well cared for, clean and colourful in a quiet way, and she will surround herself with furniture that blends with her nature.  She is usually highly intellectual, witty and charming.  She is sentimental and affectionate, and does not like to work or live alone.<br><br>[color=darkblue]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The Cockatoo man lacks driving ambition, but works for a comfortable, secure life.  He is often "in love with love" and becomes confused between a good friendship and romance.  He cannot live alone and must have someone to share his life and dreams with.  He is fond of the art and literature and is very sociable, courteous and obliging.  He will not willingly hurt anyone's feelings and he has a natural gentleness about him.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>REDBACK SPIDER (Scorpio Oct 24 - Nov 22) </strong><br>The redback spider ceaselessly weaves the web of life.  It knows that as long as it remains active in pursuing life's goals, it will always be nourished by the universe.  Its knowledge of the world and its energy is reflected by its ability to catch what it needs.<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The redback spider woman has a strange glamour and penetrating eyes.  On the surface she can be calm and poised, hiding her thoughts and emotions with great skill.  She is possessive and has a natural interest in the opposite sex.  She will be loyal and affectionate in a happy relationship, but hates weakness and looks for a strong partner in life. She can burn with jealousy, resentment and furious anger if her principles are put to the challenge.  Her home is usually full of good taste, comfortable and very clean.<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The redback spider man is extremely passionate.  In his work, religious belief, politics, friendships and business relationships, he is intense and thorough.  He is very energetic and perceptive and likes to probe to the very roots of mysteries.  He is intuitive and jealous in his personal and business life and will think nothing of pushing others out of his way if they should try to obstruct.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>KOOKABURRA (Sagittarius Nov 23 - Dec 21) </strong><br>The kookaburra's distinctive laughing call is contagious - it makes one feel like laughing along. It can stir up feelings of joy and of positive energy.  When you hear a kookaburra laugh, remember to allow yourself to laugh as well, for laughter and joy are part of the very essence of our being.<br><br>[color=darkred]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The kookaburra woman is cheerful, optimistic and friendly.  She is honest, confident and independent.  She is not fussy about the house and is not one to slave in the kitchen.  She likes drama and excitement, travel and the open countryside.  She hates to feel possessed and tied down to routine.  She likes good company, nice clothes, good food and wine.  She is casual towards romance but, when really in love, will be loyal and affectionate.<br><br>[color=darkblue]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The kookaburra man dislikes discipline and confined spaces.  He is very optimistic, idealistic and intelligent.  He likes a partner who will share his love of fun and adventure.  He is not possessive, jealous or demanding, and likes to be free to come and go as he pleases.  He is honest, open minded, easy to get on with, friendly and popular.  He must have a challenging interest in his life or else he will become bored and restless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GOANNA (Capricorn Dec 22 - Jan 20) </strong><br>Goannas are forever curious about their surroundings.  They calmly saunter along using their powerful body and legs to climb trees and rocks as they poke their noses into all manners of mischief.  But should goannas feel there is danger about, they'll make a speedy retreat.<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The goanna woman can be icy or charming; either way, she is sensible, determined, clever and superior.  She makes a particularly good career woman - she's ambitious, and looks for security, so she will work hard to climb the ladder of success.  She excels at managing the household chores and the budget and makes a caring mother, but can be a little too strict with her children.<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The goanna man is strong, dependable and very ambitious.  He is often a loner, but not by choice.  He rarely shows his feelings and many think he has a heart of stone.  But he is innately shy and adopts a serious approach towards love.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>EMU (Aquarius Jan 21 - Feb 19) </strong><br>These great flightless birds forage attentively in family groups and pair off during the breeding season to prepare for new arrivals.  Once the eggs are laid, the male assumes the motherly role of taking care of them and then the chicks, once they've hatched.<br><br>[color=darkred]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The emu woman is faithful when in love, but not ardent or emotional.  She likes to be able to carry on with her own interests and mix with her friends as often as she likes.  She will often work when married to get away from the confines of the home.  She is interested in the future but not from a material angle.  She is not a snob and will go out of her way to help friends in trouble, whether they are rich or poor.<br><br>[color=darkblue]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The emu man admires intelligence and hates to be possessed.  He is kind and loyal and enjoys an interesting social life where he can mix with the type of people who match him intellectually.  He has a modern outlook and fixed opinions.  He would make a good scientist, inventor, pilot, social worker, writer, mental-health worker or teacher.<br><br>[color=black]<strong>PLATYPUS (Pisces Feb 20 - Mar 20) </strong><br>The platypus feeds at dusk and dawn, so it is not easily seen.  If it senses an observer it will dive beneath the water.  Though timid, it has the means to defend itself if it chooses.<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>F/ Woman </strong><br>The platypus woman is full of charm, is sometimes quite witty, demure and feminine.  She adapts to circumstances and to other people's influences easily but she can be careless, secretive and deceptive.  She can lose herself in her dream world and be oblivious to reality, so she requires someone who can protect her.<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>F/ Man </strong><br>The platypus man is easily hurt, sensitive and needs plenty of encouragement.  He dislikes criticism and arguments and can easily become moody or depressed.  His interests lean towards the arts, but he would make a good doctor, chemist or welfare worker.  He is happy in an environment where his sympathetic qualities are employed.<br><br>[color=black]Taken from: Auz Astrology: The Australian Animal Zodiac by Ann Williams-Fitzgerald<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aries Male </strong><br>Are you in love with an Aries man?  You`ve got quite a macho man on your hands!  Ruled by Mars, the hot, red, active planet, the Aries man is known as the "warrior."  Fearless and brave, active and entrepreneurial, he is eager for new experiences.  Your man is never ever boring!<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>To get his attention away from his constant business wheelings and dealings, and to cater to his substantial physical needs.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him</span></strong><br>If this is your first date with an Aries, choose something daring to do.  Aries, the lover of risk and adventure, is apt to enjoy activities with you that could include hang gliding, bungee jumping or car racing.  The Aries man`s credo is he`ll try anything once.  Use this to turn his mind away from everyday business matters and focus on you.<br><br>Being such a testosterone-charged and masculine sign, Aries needs a regular, highly active sex life.  He is apt to be aggressive and spontaneous, and this is one man who likes to take the lead.  At the same time, the Aries man is highly protective of his lover, being quite willing to fight (literally or figuratively) for her, and this is a big part of his appeal.  Be gentle with this ego, though. If you`re not "in the mood" he might take the slightest rejection quite hard.<br><br>Aries likes a challenge, so you could tease him a bit when he starts getting bossy, keeping what he wants out of reach until the end of the pursuit.  If trying to win an argument, the smart partner of an Aries man will subtly convince him that her ideas are really his ideas.  Some Aries men have a roving eye, which is not an attractive quality, so to keep him playing in his own back yard, keep your body sleek, your lingerie sexy (a few skimpy pieces in his favorite color, red, would be a good idea) and the lights low (candlelight is perfect--Aries rules fire).  Most of all, keep him guessing because he loves the thrill of the chase.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Want to surprise him? Cook him a spicy dinner, perhaps something Tex Mex--or--just tease him by putting a jalapeno pepper in your mouth and dare him to bite it gently (a la 9 1/2 Weeks).  Then alternate sweet flavors with spicy (Aries rules spicy flavors).  That`s a way to get his attention!<br><br>In terms of gifts, the Aries man likes an experience rather than something tangible.  You might buy tickets to a boxing match or an exciting basketball game where he can get all worked up and scream his lungs out--all the better to get his lusty self in bed later that evening.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=Darkred]<strong>Aries Female </strong><br>Love an Aries woman? She`s modern all the way, full of spunk and drive.  You will likely find her running her own business, or heading up a division in her company, for Aries is the sign that rules entrepreneurial ventures.  She is a woman of strength, has well-formed and intelligent opinions, and part of her charm is that she is so thoroughly independent and self-reliant.  Aries is a fire sign and therefore quite imaginative, born to lead rather than to follow.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>To keep up with her, you`ve got to think of some original things to do together--the "same old, same old" will never rate with her.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>In bed, the Aries woman will often enjoy initiating the lovemaking, much to your delight. Allow her that pleasure and enjoy the fireworks.  Sexually, she will be creative and even humorous, and her sense of adventure will lead her to try many things.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Take her to an amusement park and try out the fastest, scariest rides together--she`ll be all the more passionate later. If you are giving her perfume, choose a fragrance that has depth and character--it could have a hint of spice or be a new, modern blend. (One thing is certain, your grandmother`s sweet rose or lily of the valley just isn`t her style).  Another idea would be to give her a gift certificate for a new hairstyle by a famous hairdresser she`s read about in her favorite fashion magazine.  A fine imported hairbrush would be a good gift idea too.  Aries rules the head, and a bad hair day is no joke for our girl. Having her hair just right gives her increased self confidence, and by giving her a chic new look, she`s apt to be delighted.  Be prepared for her open demonstrations of her love for you!  If you would rather choose something for her that is a bit more sexy, get her a short satin wrap robe with matching demi-bra and tiny thong panties, in her favorite color, bright red.<br><br>An Aries girl loves uniforms, so let her see you in your Navy dress whites the next time you call on her. If you don`t have an "Officer and an Gentleman" uniform around, any other uniform will do.  Do you have a friend who is a UPS or FedEx delivery man? You are in luck--borrow his uniform and pretend to be a delivery man.  This will really ring her bell! Take note all "suits": every Aries woman looks forward to those sexy, well-muscled UPS guys, even when they`re dumping more work for them to do on the counter!  Your working-class stud attire could be a fantasy-come-true.<br><br>If you want to be late for work and get the bathroom all steamy, try this: when you`re shaving one morning, stand at the sink completely nude, with the water running, and your face all lathered up with shaving cream.  As you shave, be completely oblivious to her staring at you and just talk naturally with her about everyday matters--the more mundane the better. For example, ask, "Shall I pick up the Dijon mustard after I get the stuff from the dry cleaner?" Shave your face slowly--and wait for her reaction. Aries rules sharp instruments, so watching you wield your razor in such a masterful fashion will send her temperature rising--and could be start the start of a wonderful day for you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=green]<strong>Taurus Male </strong><br>The Taurus man loves creature comforts. He is sensuous, tactile, giving, practical and stable.  When a Taurus man falls in love it is forever, because Taurus guys aren`t wanderers.  One of the sexiest characteristics of a Taurus man is his wonderfully sexy, deep voice.  Taurus rules the throat, and many Taurus are well known singers.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Taurus men often settle into ruts and aren`t known to be too flexible.  You`ll want to coax him into trying sharing new experiences and considering your point of view at decision-making time.  Some Tauruses can be very jealous of anyone else you may be dating, so you`ll have to keep an eye out for that too.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>When this man says, "Be mine!" he means it quite literally, for this is a possessive sign.  While this may seem charming on the outset, it can get a bit annoying.  Deal with this by being a little flirtatious around other guys, but not to the extent that he thinks you would really dump him for someone else.  Just tease him a little and reassure him that he is your number one man, and his passion will burn even brighter for you.  Feeling secure is important to Taurus, and most of their decisions are based upon how he can increase this feeling.  Taurus likes routine (hard to believe anyone does, but it is true.) While he is not a sign known for flexibility, his steadfastness and reliability will more than compensate, and you will find it comforting.  So, don`t expect your Taurus lover to understand when plans change at the last minute.  He has difficulty turning on a dime and this is something you will simply have to accept.  And if you want to have any influence his thinking, be sure to get your ideas across in early during his long decision-making process, before he becomes "set." Taurus can be quite stubborn!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>Taurus Female </strong><br>The Taurus woman is feminine, soft and highly diplomatic.  She has a lyrical speaking voice that soothes and comforts you, and she could even have a talented singing voice (Barbara Streisand is a Taurus).  Ruled by Venus, Taurus is a sign which adores the arts--from music to painting--and will enthusiastically go to any cultural event her lover suggests.  In lovemaking, the Taurus woman is passionate and deeply tender.  She may not be as sexually experimental as the other signs, but her fidelity and strong sense of ethics will impress you.  Her bed will be the pinnacle of comfort, with piles of pillows and a fluffy comforter.  There might be fresh flowers in her bedroom, or she might have a glass wall overlooking a lush garden.  She will make her environment so inviting you won`t want to leave, for Taurus adores comfort.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Your Taurus woman will need to see tangible evidence of your love for her--and that means gifts.  There is no getting around this and you may have to save up to afford her!  She is one of the most loving and affectionate of all signs, certainly one of the most sensuous, and quite a catch.  But first, this lady will want to know that you have a nest egg.  Delay popping the question until you can show her your substantial stash of Treasury bills, a solid investment in mutual funds, an impressive stock portfolio and, of course, cash in the bank.  Being a earth sign, having some real estate wouldn`t hurt either--it is something which would impress her deeply. (I never said your courtship was going to be easy, did I?)<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>Assure her of your reliability and your stability--traits she values in a person.  Being flaky is the surest way to turn her off.  She is slow but sure in matters of the heart, so don`t rush her.  Treat her well and she`ll be yours for a long, long time.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts Buy </span></strong><br>Always keep in mind that she is ruled by Venus, the planet of decorative arts.  Start by sending her flowers.  Be prepared to plunk down major money for a large bouquet of rare blooms.  Don`t try to get away with something cheap and small--you`ll loose points.  Original flowers to try would be white and purple lilacs, which are as fragrant as they are beautiful, and send them to her in an expensive crystal vase. (A Taurus knows quality when she sees it, and she adores objects of beauty.  Every time she uses the vase you gave her, she will think of you.)<br><br>Another clever tactic would be to find out the name of her favorite scent.  Most Taurus women have an entire arsenal of perfumes, one to suit every mood, and she uses her stash to seduce her chosen male with skill and subtlety.  Taurus rules the throat, so a choker of pearls or other stones would go over well too. Princess Di has popularized the choker.  This was not surprising since she had Venus in Taurus.  This sign likes almost any kind of gem, as long as it is precious and refined, so certainly there must be something that strikes your eye at the jeweler`s.  If you can`t afford to get her jewelry, then try for a fine silk or cashmere scarf.  She is prone to sore throats and you`ll want to be sure she stays cozy warm in the winter.<br><br>Finally, the influence of Venus gives the Taurus woman a rounded silhouette, perfect "material" for a WonderBra.  If you know her well, by all means buy her a selection of this type of bra in various pretty colors, then talk her into giving you a fashion s how.  Since the media keeps telling women who have curves (as most Taurus women do) that they are less-than-ideal, you`ll need to counteract that notion.  Keep reassuring her that you adore her real-woman curves and that the waif look was never one that turned you on.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Taurus men love the arts, so a Saturday spent poking through art galleries in Soho with a grand dinner at a fine restaurant later would be a perfect day.  (Taurus can quite a gourmet, so make the restaurant special.)  Taurus is a sensuous and cultured sign, so everything you do should be carefully and subtly orchestrated for the ultimate seduction.<br><br>When making love, remember to stimulate all his senses.  Start by surprising him with some special imported dark or white chocolate--Taurus men adore chocolate!--to nibble while consuming their other favorite treat, superb champagne.  Other things to have on hand include: dozens of votive candles, a short, silk charmeuse slip for you in a maddeningly flattering color, such as a pale peach (wear nothing underneath), a jar of warm, satiny cream to rub his shoulders and chest with (the areas Taurus men have the most tension), and his favorite CDs on the stereo. (Surprise him with one or two new titles, too.)  Wrap up a new designer men`s cologne and tuck it under his pillow--tell him how much this scent turned you on while you were in Saks Fifth Avenue and how it made you ache to be with him.  Now, your seduction is all set.  Happily, Taurus men don`t like to rush anything they do, so you`re assured that he is yours for that evening!  Lucky girl, Taurus is one sign that thoroughly enjoys languorous lovemaking.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=Olive]<strong>Gemini Male </strong><br>Your Gemini man is full of wit and charm, and often the center of attention, as he delights everyone with a new joke he just heard or a story about what happened to him at work.  Since Gemini rules Hermes, the messenger of the Gods, Gemini men are often writers or reporters.  They are brilliant communicators, and can talk their way into any opportunity or out of any tight spot.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>This guy likes to keep up-to-date on things, so you`ll have to get his head out of The New York Times and all his other daily doses of news.  Nobody reads as many current periodicals as a Gemini!  His coffee table probably looks like a newsstand.  When he gets done reading, he is likely to be switching on the TV news.  You will have to do something with this news junkie or he`ll stay wrapped up in current events.  The key is to convince him that you are the most interesting event in his life!<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>First of all, be one of his best news sources.  Before you meet up with him, call him with something you just heard on Reuters.  Leave a voice mail on his office phone with a late-breaking story, or fax over clippings from a newspaper on a topic that interests him greatly.  That will get his initial attention and you`ll be able to move on to more intimate matters.  Keep in mind that Gemini needs constant variety and change; the more surprising and spontaneous you are, the more he will love you.  Never reveal everything about yourself to a Gemini, for once they get the idea there is nothing new to discover, they will be tempted to look elsewhere.  Gemini men have a deep need to try and figure you out, so keep him guessing!<br><br>Be verbal in bed during lovemaking.  This will really turn him on.  Don`t be shy! Gemini is a highly-intelligent sign, stimulated by both exciting talk and the written word, and appealing to his mind and imagination will keep your sex life lively.  Try reading passages from a sexy novel. (Make sure the novel has some literary value--if it is too trashy, he will wonder about your educational level, another important aspect to smart Gemini).  Also, try leaving love notes in his suit pockets, his briefcase or anywhere he might casually come across them.  Few signs appreciate the now-dead art of writing love letters more than a Gemini.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Treat your Gemini man to a massage with a subtly-fragranced oil to reduce his nervous tension.  He is ruled by Mercury, the planet controlling the entire nervous system, and his nerves get jangled easily.  Pay particular attention to his hands, for they are susceptible to stress (probably because he is at the keyboard so much).  Geminis always appear to be far younger than their years and have great charisma.  To best bring out this boyish charm, flirt with him.  (Gemini is the best flirt of the zodiac and he will flirt right back.)  Step up your witty game of verbal Ping-Pong, if you`re ready for wildfire. No doubt he will be sitting at his computer while you talk with him, for Gemini always does two things at once.  As he sits there, intently pounding out his great American novel, seduce him while he is working. Slowly unbutton his shirt as you stand behind his chair and rub his chest.  Soon he will be putty in your hands.<br><br>Gemini is symbolized by the twins flying through the air, and your Gemini man is happiest when flying to some distant city.  Surprise him with tickets for two to a far-away island.  Then, use the fact that he`s an air sign to your advantage: seduce him on the flight (the rest room might be small but useful here).  He`ll be in his element and more in "in the mood" than anywhere else!<br><br>Do Geminis stray?  Only if they get bored.  What you need to do is to keep them excited and mentally engaged in you.  Therefore, here is the ultimate gift for communication-oriented Gemini:  Give him a year of internet access along with at least one sexy e-mail message from you per week!  What better way for him to stay focused on you?<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=blue]<strong>Gemini Female </strong><br>The Gemini woman is full of enthusiasm. A vivacious, shining beauty, she can talk about a wide variety of subjects, and she is curious about everything.  Don`t advise a Gemini woman that she would be better off doing one thing at a time, for she needs variety and pursues a multitude of interests.  She is actually at her best when swamped with things to do!  Gemini is an ace communicator too, particularly adept at sharing her emotions and thoughts.  (Take away her dial tone and it is like taking away oxygen.)  She doesn`t go for a man who crowds her or who limits her space.  Gemini is symbolized by the twins flying through the air, and to set limits on a Gemini is like trapping a lovely bird in a small cage.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>This is a busy woman with endless lists of things to accomplish.  She does have a tendency to be a bit forgetful too.  But who wouldn`t, with her lifestyle?  She does more in a week than most of us accomplish in a month!  You will need to remain Priority One with her, a hard task, when you`re competing with all her activities, friends and admirers.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>Read up on current issues, whether it is art, technology, movies, or books--anything interesting you that is topical.  Then suggest to her that you and she check out a show or meet in a late night coffee shop to discuss the issues.  Gemini adores a lively debate (she was probably captain of her debating team in college).  Browse with her in a good bookstore, one that plays music to encourage lingering.  (Gemini rules the printed words, thus, she is happy in book shops.)  Or, if she has a new laptop, offer to help her set up her system folder.  (She has the brains to do it, but prefers to do things like that Ã  deux for the company.)  Suggest you go window shopping for a new fax machine one night after work, so that she can choose the best one when she`s ready.  Convince her to let you assess the various local cellular phone carriers to choose the best deal for her, then meet to discuss your findings.  As you see all these things are communication-oriented, and believe it or not, as dorky as these things seem, they will really turn her on.  She will love you for your thoughtfulness. Trust me on this.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Buy her a cellular phone or a beeper with voice mail messaging, with pre-paid service for a year so you can call her up and leave sexy messages.<br><br>Or give her an all-expense-paid-trip for two (with you!) to an inland hideaway.  (Be sure there are cultural activities and night life available--remember, Gemini needs lots of stimulation).  No money? Then fax her a naughty love note if her machine is private or else FedEx her an overnight letter filled with pink and red rose petals--she will be thrilled by your creativity.<br><br>In bed, whisper words and little stories you`ve imagined or read.  She is the most verbal of all the signs, and her strong intellect and rich imagination is your surest way to passionate love.  Read portions of steamy novels too while in bed, and don`t be afraid to laugh or have fun with her when making love.  She is one of the most spontaneous of all the signs.  Since Gemini is the sign which rules versatility, she will appreciate your reading up on different lovemaking positions--and she`ll be willing to try almost anything at least once.  One more hint: she is very verbal, and therefore highly oral.  Enough said? You lucky dude, you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cancer Male </strong><br>A family man at heart, your Cancer loves children, roots, and sees home as a haven.  When traveling he is prone to get homesick, even in this day and age.  A water sign, Cancer is highly emotional and sympathetic.  He can be moody.  The changing moods of Cancers are one of their greatest charms, and as mutable as the natural landscape.  If is raining, you still know the sun will be out soon.  Although they are worriers, they have kind and giving temperaments.  Cancers also have excellent memories, so anything special that you do for him won`t be forgotten.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>If he is divorced with children, you may have to work hard to be as important to him as his kids.  To Cancer, blood is thicker than water, and you may not have first place in the pecking order.  If you are married to a Cancer, he can easily get caught up with family and chores and forget that he is a red-blooded male with sexual needs.  It is hard for him to remember romance when he is up on the roof, hammering shingles, so it`s up to you to proposition your handyman with an alternative, naughty use for his duct tape.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>If he is a single dad, see the sexy side of his role as father.  Knowing what he`s like when he interacts with his kids heightens, by contrast, the intimacy he shares with you.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Cancer is the only sign that will customarily make a trip to the grocery store to get ready for a big date (even if you are married, you can still have a "big date").  You`ll find him filling up his cart with exotic fruits (mangoes, strawberries) and at the dairy case (whipped cream), among other areas.  Making love in the kitchen always ignites his deepest fantasies, so by all means surrender amid the salad makings.  He may want to cook and eat together first.  As one Cancer man who is very dear to me has whispered more than once: "Cooking isn`t about cooking--it`s pure sex!"  And the person who said "The way to a man`s heart is through his stomach" was obviously referring to a Cancer.<br><br>Spilling wine over your breasts and letting him watch as you slowly lick it off will excite him, something which could occur around dessert.  Cancer rules the breasts (every astrological sign rules a different part of the body), so don`t wear your high-necked blouse on the night you want to start a private little nuclear reaction.  This is man who admires some cleavage and will make you glad you have dÃ©colletage to display!<br><br>If you want to present him a token of your love, frame a new black &amp; white portrait of you in a pure silver frame for his desk. (Cancer rules silver--plus memories and loved ones are also under this sign`s domain.)<br><br>One Last Idea<br>If you want some private time with your Cancer man outside of home, seduce him near water (Cancer is a water sign), perhaps on a deserted beach or on a private yacht.  Just about every Cancer I have known needs to be near water to feel completely relaxed and ready for love. Kidnap your beloved and whisk him off to the shore, and be sure to pack a basket of goodies and don your little red riding hood cape--with little or nothing on underneath!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=indigo]<strong>Cancer Female </strong><br>With her soft translucent skin and lovely shoulders, your Cancer lover makes a knockout entrance to any club wearing her sleek, dÃ©colletage slip dress, as only a Cancer lady could carry off.  But in case you think you can easily date this beauty, be forewarned that she is no pushover.  The Cancer woman is careful about who she gives her heart to, because once she commits, she gives her all.  Your lunar lady is truly feminine, and lucky for you, of all the signs, Cancer is the most nurturing and protective of those close to her.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Her ruler, the moon, rules the changing emotions--so she can be a moody person.  This may make it hard to figure out how she feels about you in the early days of your relationship, because at times your stock will appear to rise and fall.  If you marry her, this will not be a problem for she will be very loyal to you, and often put your interests ahead of hers.  Your lunar goddess takes responsibility seriously.  If she is a single mother, her children will come first, and you may have to wait in line.  Yet it is this side of her--her mothering instincts--that you probably find so appealing in her.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>Nothing comes before her spouse and her children in a Cancer woman`s life and thus, she often she forgets her own needs.  Here is where you can lavish attention on her.  She is a bit of a worrier, and will often second-guess herself about decisions she has made.  Reassure her that her judgment is sound, and help her focus more on the future, less on the past.  (Cancer rules tradition, and this why she is so marvelous about creating a warm and loving family life--she knows she is building memories!)  Holidays and birthdays are important to her, so don`t put her down for wanting to make them special. Instead, support her.<br><br>If she seems down and suddenly you find yourself on the outs with her, talk gently with her to get back into her good graces.  Harsh tactics would be the wrong approach to take with her.  Keep your temper under control and don`t be demanding.  Her gentle feelings over-respond to criticism and in the heat of argument you could say something which could crush her irreparably.  Cancers have excellent memories and she will remember everything you said, unfortunately whether you meant it or not.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>The Cancer woman`s home is her nest and is highly important to her.  Offer to paint her living room or to give her a hand moving furniture around if she wants a new look.  If she is divorced with kids, take everyone on an outing (she will be thunderstruck that you are attentive of her children, and love you for the gesture).  Later, help her locate a baby-sitter and take her to a small and cozy family-run restaurant where the food is delicious and the lights are low.  (Cancers are not comfortable in large, high-key, fancy places. She wants to focus on you, not the surroundings.)  If your table has a view overlooking water, so much the better, for water rejuvenates Cancer in a way that other signs simply can`t fathom.<br><br>The Cancer woman will enjoy reminiscing, so think about recreating the first time you made love together, perhaps by going back to the same place or by celebrating the anniversary.  Or, give her a beautiful album filled with snapshots of the two of you that you`ve been collecting.<br><br>When making love, the Cancer woman is fragile and feminine.  Because she often puts others first, a little pampering would be a smart idea.  To seduce her properly, whip up a surprise gourmet dinner and serve it to her on a small table decorated with flowers and white table linens set up in the bedroom, a place she isn`t used to eating.  Have chocolate-covered strawberries for dessert and feed her each by hand, one by one.  Hide a love note or special card under her plate--Cancers are sentimental.  Be especially careful about what you say to her during lovemaking, for anything she construes as negative could hurt her deeply---teasing is not for her.<br><br>Give her an exquisite strand of pearls (Cancer is a crab, a little sea creature like the pearl oyster)  or a skimpy, slinky, expensive nightgown in one of her moon colors--silver, creamy white or pale, smoky blue.  She would also adore flowers--but instead of sending her red or pink roses, make your bouquet a variety of flowers in Cancer`s color--snow white--tied with a gorgeous thick white satin ribbon.  You`ll eventually discover (if she likes you) that she has beautiful, firm, fully-rounded breasts (the part of the body the sign rules) which, in bed, she adores having her man fondle and admire.  Paint them with thousands of kisses and caress them gently.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=DarkBlue]<strong>Leo Male </strong><br>Ruled by the Sun, giver of life and strength, the Leo man is gregarious and warm-hearted.  He is impossible not to notice.  His powerful masculinity and commanding presence will be felt immediately, and his sense of showmanship and drama make him sexy and charismatic.  He may work in the arts (especially the theater), or do some sort of creative work.  He will probably head up a division of a company, if not the entire corporation. Leo men are leaders, not followers.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Leos are a bit self-absorbed and their egos are huge.  Yet they are so warmhearted and loving that these faults will look trivial in the grand overview.  He is jealous and possessive, especially in the courting stage, so you will need to find ways to derail his wrath if you plan to date others simultaneously.  One thing that Leo doesn`t entertain, is the possibility of being Number Two.  He`d rather walk.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>Gaining the admiration and respect of others is the single most important aspect of the Leo personality for you to keep in mind.  This is their driving force, winning out over money, fame and just about anything else.  Another aspect of their nature is their love of children and their intolerance of criticism about them from others.  Say something detracting about a Leo`s child and you will get a glimpse of the mighty lion`s temper.  If he runs low on cash, he won`t accept a loan from you, so don`t be bewildered or get hurt feelings, if this happens.  Leo prides himself in being self-sufficient.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Since Leo likes the best of everything, have some cold champagne (with a good label) on ice nearby, some lightly toasted bread and a tiny jar of imported caviar on a silver tray with your best china and crystal.  Your Leo lover likes luxury.  Your bedding should be new and fresh -- never threadbare.  Leo also appreciates flowers, but since he puts a premium on uniqueness, make them exotic or don`t bother.<br><br>Leos have a strong sense of drama and presentation, so if you go to a restaurant, choose one which is hotly reviewed, frequented by beautiful people and offers four-star quality. (This is going to be hard on your wallet, I know!)  Start the evening off by complementing him on something he did recently or how great he looks.  Be sure you look great too--Leo wants someone fabulous on his arm.  (You`ll rarely hear a Leo scold his lady for spending too much on herself.)  Don`t bring up other beaux or talk about those of your past.  Your lion is ruled by the Sun and wants to be the center of your universe.  He won`t tolerate competition--present, past or future!<br><br>This sign rules teaching, and no other sign can quite match Leo`s ability here.  Use this talent by begging him to show you new things to do together in bed.  He likes to be in charge anyway, and this will only enhance his natural inclination.  When you become intimately involved with him you will find the Leo male needs a great deal of attention and adoration.  An exciting and accomplished lover, he will expect you to spend a considerable time on him.  Yet his loyalty, devotion and extreme generosity to you will win you over, and soon you`ll find yourself looking for ways to satisfy his every need.<br><br>Give your Sun-ruled lover a gold pocket watch or sophisticated gold lighter, since Leo rules gold.  Or, since this sign rules theater, tickets to the best Broadway show in town, or to the opera.  He loves to dress in black tie (he is the ultimate sophisticate), so give him a good reason to dress up.<br><br>Since music is a high priority on his list, check out which new CD titles he would most like to own, but get him Ravel`s Bolero too, if he doesn`t have it.  This is perfect for Leo because of the dramatic, throbbing beat.  Later that night, show him what Bolero was made for: you, after your slow flamenco-styled strip-tease tango.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=DarkRed]<strong>Leo Female </strong><br>A Leo woman is easy to spot.  She`s the one lighting up the room in her spectacular designer outfit--Leo women love to make an entrance.  Her taste is superb and unfailing.  Like chic French women (France is ruled by Leo), a lioness would rather have one dazzling outfit than 20 cheap ones.  She has a deep and abiding need for respect from others and will work hard to being noticed and remembered.  She is naturally extravagant--don`t even try to tell her she spends too much on clothes (or on her kids either, who she loves to pamper).  Yet she is warm, spontaneous and creative too, and you are sure to have fun with this vivacious lioness.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>In a nutshell, your challenge will be to afford this jewel of a woman.  Her taste is superb and she won`t settle for second best (which she translates as second rate).  She will be demanding, so be prepared to lavish lots of attention on her instead of being preoccupied with your spreadsheets or waxing your car.  If you are serious about her, bite the bullet and get some personal help.  You will need to maximize your efficiency at home and the office to devote time to your lioness--at least until you win her heart.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>In all probability she will be handling you, not the other way around!  Leo women have a way of being in control, even if they let you think that is not the case.  She`s subtle, but strong.  She resists any kind of confinement, so don`t try to box her in.  Throughout courtship, the Leo woman loves to tease her man, often playing cat-and-mouse games until you "catch" her.  When wed, she will do anything in her power to keep things lively and fun, and will build up an entire wardrobe of imported lingerie to keep her man interested.  The Leo woman loves to have her lover run his fingers through her mane.  She will rarely go to bed without a touch of makeup, even if it`s just a hint of blush or scented body creme.  To increase her passion, whisper to her, "You are the most beautiful woman in the world!" . . . and mean it.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>This is one lady you are going to have to woo with gifts.  She expects them, wants them, and enjoys them, so you might as well cave in and buy them for her.  She looks stunning and regal in purple, so choose something in that color, whether it be a lace teddy, bra and panty set or drop-dead, killer nightie.  She will also sparkle in gold--try getting her a classy knit sweater shot through with golden threads that shimmer in the evening light, then take her to a four star restaurant for dinner so she can wear it.  Surprise her with an overnight stay at a rustic hotel with ornate wooden architecture and antique furniture.  Make sure to reserve a room with a roaring fireplace.<br><br>Or send her two dozen long-stemmed roses (don`t even THINK of trying to get away with one dozen), a generous box of imported bittersweet chocolates or a bottle of fine champagne for you both to drink later. Buy her tickets to the opera in New York or Rome (orchestra seats, of course.)  If buying her a ring or other jewelry, know that she adores sapphires, the gem ruling her sign. Start saving now!  It`s true, loving a Leo can be a second career in itself.  But she`ll adore you for your generosity and will insure you both will have a hell of a lot of fun.  So what if the American Express bill is gigantic?  Yours will be a life fully enjoyed and a love like no other you could imagine.<br><br>Your lioness likes to play games.  So, try a serious game of strip poker.  Or, if you know each other very well, do a variation on the movie Indecent Proposal.  Remember when Demi Moore had to decide whether to take the cool million and bed Robert Redford or stay loyal to Woody Harrelson and give up their dream house?  Near the end of the film there is a scene where she and Woody make love on a bed of hundred dollar (or higher) bills. In your own private remake, you are the millionaire, but you don`t have to share her with anyone.  For fun, strew her bed with lots of crisp, new crumpled dollar bills (if it`s ones, not fifties or hundreds, who cares?).  Leo women have fertile imaginations and a fabulous sense of drama.  She`ll adore your little make-believe and beg you to think of more!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=green]<strong> Virgo Male </strong><br>Your Virgo man is modest, meticulous and discriminating.  He is a joy to live with as long as you understand the Virgo man`s obsessive need to be productive on a daily basis.  He is practical, patient and is able to handle detail, and the amount of details he handles would drive others up the wall.  The Virgo`s talent is knowing how to make dreams (their own and those of others) a reality.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Virgos are worriers, so your first step will be to calm him down when you have time alone together.  Often workaholics, your Virgo will have a hard time detaching from his everyday schedule.  But you must, for they are incredibly passionate lovers once his total attention has been turned to you.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>He`s productivity oriented, so "goofing off" might be a foreign idea and too scary for him at the onset.  Since Virgo is wonderful at fixing things--his sharp mind hungers for things to take apart and figure out--so ask him to help you out. Tell him that you are hopeless with home repairs and he has got to come over and take a look at your air conditioner.  His small motor skills are the finest in the zodiac, so many Virgos like to putter around the house, looking for little projects.  Puttering takes their minds off more stressful issues.<br><br>Remind him how turned-on you were when you saw him wearing worn jeans and a plaid lumberjack shirt, jump-starting his car.  Tell him you fantasize about him walking around your apartment measuring walls for shelving, just wearing his tool belt.  (This kind of flattery will accomplish two things: you will have a hot, passionate lover ready to ravish you and no more leaky faucets.) Cruise around Home Depot, just to get him in the mood.  Then, one afternoon when he is putting in a new set of florescent lights over your kitchen counter, pounce on him and tell him you are getting hot watching him screw those huge bulbs in.  Make love to him right then and there.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Many Virgos are talented writers. Their reserved nature makes them express in writing what they would have difficulty saying in person.  Happily, you may be the lucky recipient of one of the wonderful love letters only a Virgo could write.  Drop hints that you would like to receive something written especially for you.  A perfect gift for him would be a beautiful fountain pen or engraved stationary.  He would also adore a P.D.A. or electronic organizer, a laptop computer, new software, or even a dust buster for his car.  You could also buy him a deluxe tool kit (don`t forget those metric socket wrenches too) and let matters take their own course!<br><br>To thank him for all his home improvement, you might want to take him to dinner.  When choosing the restaurant, remember that a Virgo`s digestive system is delicate.  Most Virgos dislike overly rich food and try to eat balanced healthful meals.  Many are vegetarians.  Another point to consider is that Virgo has a strong need to be highly organized.  So when seducing the Virgo man, be sure you have a neat bedroom and put unnecessary clutter out of sight.  (Seeing junk around will make him edgy.)  In bed, the Virgo man is like the Gemini (both are ruled by Mercury) in that his need to communicate is strong.  Talking during lovemaking will heighten his pleasure and add to his passion for you.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=brown]<strong>Virgo Female </strong><br><br>The quality people notice first about your Virgo beloved is her alertness and unmistakable intelligence.  It has been said that Virgo`s gift is making order out of chaos.  Send a Virgo into a hurricane-ravaged town, and in no time they`ve pitched the tents, organized the shipments of food and water, and started clearing the roadways.  If it is one thing Virgo does well, it`s organize people and things.  If your life is a bit of a hurricane, you`re in luck, for she will provide a willing ear and heaps of amazing practical advice-- ideas you will wish you had thought of long ago.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Virgo women have lists of things to do, and sometimes you could wind up being one more item on her list. Becoming "Priority #10-D" is something to avoid at all costs!  Once she writes you into her Filofax as "Sex with James, Thursday @ 9:00 PM" you know you`ve hit bottom, and it is time to do something drastic--and delightful!.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>Your goal is to allow her to take time to relax and gently pull her away from her everyday cares.  She hates being lazy, so accomplishing this isn`t going to be as easy.  Like the male Virgo, the female Virgo loathes making love in a hovel, so if this describes your place, you`d better spiff it up.  Nothing turns off a Virgo faster than dirt or mess.  She isn`t impressed with luxury, so don`t worry about having things "good enough" for her--crisp, just laundered cotton sheets and some soft pillows are fine.  But if you don`t get organized, before you know it, she`ll be out of bed and cleaning up the place--the last thing you want her to be doing in her Victoria`s Secret teddy!  As good as it sounds, to have some lovely geisha cleaning up your pigsty, think about it.  If she`s stacking dishes in the dishwasher, she isn`t making love to you, so get your priorities straight, buddy.  Besides, god knows where she`ll "neaten up" your collection of half-dirty basketball shorts TO.  So take away the clamor of disorder that distracts her and when she`s with you, you will be all that exists in her world.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>She adores high fashion and well-made clothing.  As the saying goes, "God in the details," and details are this perfectionist`s forte. Most Virgo women enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest couture trends (she is ruled by Mercury, so she is oriented toward staying current).  Yet their appearance will likely be elegant and understated rather than flashy, often choosing neutrals over bright colors.  She likes to dress up, so think of a nice restaurant where she can wear some of her new things.  Tattered jeans and polo shirts are not her style.<br><br>Buy her an article of clothing or piece jewelry that is high fashion but enduring, top quality, like a Tiffany or Cartier watch that she can treasure for years. (She`s madly punctual, so what better gift?).  Her sign rules jade, the stone of fidelity, so a ring or pendant made of that stone is especially meaningful.  You could alternatively give her a beauty service, like a year of manicures and pedicures (Virgo likes her nails fastidiously groomed) or six months of a personal trainer (fitness is a big thing with her) and still make a big hit with her.<br><br>In love, she is highly ethical and idealistic, so don`t be surprised if your Virgo comes to you with little sexual experience.  She`s just very discriminating about who she will give her heart and body to.  Don`t think that means she lacks passion.  Quite the contrary! Virgos are just better at controlling their intense, smoldering feelings, but once released, watch out! When she finds a man she is willing to devote her life to, she can be a tiger in bed. Her secret strength is that she communicates her needs well and will also listen closely to, and act on, what her lover needs.<br><br>Since Virgo prizes cleanliness so much, seduce her with a bubble bath for two. Set dozens of softly-scented votive candles around the bathroom and be sure to have some thick, luxurious towels nearby.  A bottle of champagne would be good to have on hand, as would a bowl of finger fruits--grapes, strawberries, raspberries--to feed her one by one.  After your bath, give her a full body massage. Later, when you make love, be sure to talk to her during sex because nothing as erotic to her as her vivid imagination.  Describe places and situations where you would like to make love to her down to the tiniest details. (When she begins asking questions to keep you taking about a certain scenario, you`re on the right track).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=blue]<strong>Libra Male </strong><br>Libra is the natural sign of partnership, so it follows that the Libra man prefers being married (or at least living together) over flying solo.  He will work toward making his union strong and happy.  True justice is a very important issue with Libra, and sometimes you might find him moping around murmuring "It`s not fair!" No one has yet succeeded to convince him that life in general isn`t fair.  Libras have a strong ideas about making life fair, and they make their decisions and arrange their actions around what they feel is the most just and equitable solution.  When drawn into a dispute, your Libra lover will quickly state his position and he`s done--there is no hanging on to old arguments, no poking into old wounds, and never any sarcasm.  Libras are too refined and gentlemanly to fight dirty.  He will expect the same from you.<br><br>Your Libra guy loves to socialize.  This is one man you will not have to coax into going to or hosting a party, and, oh, the parties that they give!  They are the best!  Libras are the ones who know everyone, and there is sure to be a famous face or two at one of their bashes.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Libra men have so many friends and are so charming themselves, that it is hard to know where you stand, at least at the beginning of a relationship.  They are very loyal once they commit, but until then, this air sign tends to flit around like a butterfly and is rather hard to pin down.  Initially, what you have to do is draw attention to yourself in a ladylike way and make him realize you are the companion he wants to spend his time with.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Him </span></strong><br>Lovemaking is something Libra will look forward to with relish--rarely will he want anything quick or rushed.  He enjoys the process of seduction, something he has elevated to an art form, and he will take his time with his woman, careful to attend to her emotional needs as well as her physical ones.  He is quite visual in orientation and likes his to see you dressed in elegant lingerie (Libra is a refined sign, so don`t get too trashy or flashy).  When you are getting ready to make love a Libra, wear your most elegant jewelry, like pretty earrings and a fine necklace, with little lacy underthings he can easily remove.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Libra is ruled by Venus, who controls the arts, so music is very important to him and he will have a great stereo system at home.  Buying him a good car stereo or auto CD player is a great way to make sure he always picks you up in a wonderful mood.<br><br>Here`s an idea for a Libran seduction: propose a day spent touring a pretty rural locale and tuck some of his favorite music into the glove compartment.  Don`t forget to pack a gourmet picnic basket (Libra likes fine food and delicacies).  While he is driving and his hands are full, start to touch him--before you know it, you will be pulled over on a small dirt road, the music reaching crescendo, while he makes love to you in the back seat, just like two high school teenagers.  There is something devilishly lovely about doing it in the back seat of his BMW or Lexus (many Libra men are lawyers, so they can afford good cars).  Later, suggest you go to a drive-in movie but don`t permit any monkey business there--make him concentrate on the film.  Libras appreciate subtle plotting like this.  Pet him all the way home as he drives, helpless in his securely fastened seat belt.  By time you are inside the door he`ll be ready for you all over again!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>[color=olive]<strong>Libra Female </strong><br>Libra women have busy social calendars and keep happy by surrounding themselves with adoring friends.  Still, this lady wants to be married, so don`t be fooled by her gadding about.  Once wed, she will attend to her marriage as fiercely as her career.<br><br>Always fashionably-dressed, she favors an eclectic look, mixing designer things with antique pieces.  The final effect is smart and sexy, never dowdy.  This Venus-ruled beauty is beautifully groomed, and smells as good as she looks, for she never leaves the house without a light spray of something intoxicating.  Her figure is usually curvy, svelte and feminine, so you don`t even stand a chance of resisting her.  The most memorable quality about your Libra lover is her quintessential grace; in every movement she makes, every word she utters, she is poetry in motion.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Your Challenge </span></strong><br>Your mission 007, is to capture her heart. Not an easy task, considering the line of men waiting in line.  She has no shortage of opportunities, so competition will be stiff.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">How To Handle Her </span></strong><br>She has powerful talents of persuasion and her lover may not know exactly how she gets her way, but she does every time--in the most charming fashion.  Be wary of getting wrapped around her little finger, for although she may protest, she secretly likes a man who stands up to her now and then. If you are only semi-conscious most of the time, you don`t stand a chance of winning her heart.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy </span></strong><br>Think of the cherubs in old master paintings, flying though the air, holding branches of roses or a lovely harp.  This describes your angelic lover.  She`d adore anything decorative, from sweetheart roses, soft silk lingerie in a delicate colors, to perfume in a modern or gentle floral tone (nothing jarring for Libra).  One of Libra`s favorite gifts is jewelry, but it has to be the real thing.  Costume jewelry will tarnish, just like your relationship will if you try to give her this. Robbing a bank may be your only choice to get her what she wants.  She might also enjoy a beautiful mirror, framed in gold leaf. Let`s pause a moment --perhaps you`ve just thought of something naughty?  Before you get carried away, let me advise you that not all Libras like making love in front of a mirror.  Venus endowed her with curves and she may be a bit self-conscious about them (silly girl.)  Put the mirror up in the bedroom and let her gradually get used to it.  Keep telling her how tell her how gorgeous she looks without a stitch on.<br><br>The Libra woman adores lighter foreplay activities and is a world-class kisser.  If you haven`t yet tapped into this aspect of her, you are missing one of life`s true experiences.  Corner her into a hot necking session somewhere like at the movies, where the other viewers won`t care if you and she are going at one another like two kids hell bent on trouble.  If you are lucky, the usher may come with her flashlight and scold you!<br><br>When you finally get her to bed she will want a slow hand, for Libra women never marry cold fish or slam-bam-thank-you-m`am types.  She is highly romantic and sensitive and wants you to be that way too.  Her bed usually has many fluffy pillows and the most beautiful linens she can afford.  She wants music in the bedroom, but no TV (too indelicate--who wants to hear about the Congressional budget or a mugging in Queens when one is in the throes of passion?)  One last hint: Libra rules the lower back and will purr like a kitten when her man massages it with a lightly scented cream. Meow!</div>
