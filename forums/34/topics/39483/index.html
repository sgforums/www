            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: violet;">Thought you might enjoy this one.. it is so cute..<br><br>A group of professional people posed this question to a group of 4 to 8 year- olds,<br>"What does love mean?"<br><br>The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined. See what you think:</span></strong><br><br>"You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget,"<br>(Jessica - age 8 )<br><br>"When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails  anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love."<br>(Rebecca - age 8 )<br><br>"When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You know that your name is safe in their mouth."<br>(Billy - age 4 )<br><br>"Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."<br>(Karl - age 5 )<br><br>"Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs."<br>(Christi - age 6 )<br><br>"Love is what makes you smile when you're tired."<br>(Terry - age 4 )<br><br>"Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK."<br>(Danny - age 7 )<br><br>"Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to  be together and you talk more. My mommy and Daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss"<br>(Emily - age 8 )<br><br>"Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen,"<br>(Bobby - age 5 )<br><br>"If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate,"<br>(Mike - age 6 )<br><br>"There are two kinds of love. Our love. God's love. But God makes both kinds of them."<br>(Jenny - age 4 )<br><br>"Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday."<br>(Noel - age 7 )<br><br>"Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well."<br>(Tommy - age 6 )<br><br>"During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore,"<br>(Cindy - age 8 )<br><br>"My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night."<br>(Claire - Age 5 )<br><br>"Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken."<br>(Elaine - age 5 )<br><br>"Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford."<br>(Chris - age 8 )<br><br>"Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day."<br>(Mary Ann - age 4 )<br><br>"I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones."<br>(Lauren - age 4)<br><br>"I let my big sister pick on me because my Mom says she only picks on me because she loves me. So I pick on my baby sister because I love her."<br>(Bethany - age 4 )<br><br>"When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you."<br>(Karen - age 7 )<br><br>"Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she doesn't think it's gross."<br>(Mark - age 6 )<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">so What does LOVE means to you?</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">What do Guys &amp; Gals want in each other? </span></strong><br><br>WHAT DO WOMEN WANT? (^.^)<br><br>When I was a young woman, all I wanted was a guy with big muscles. So I<br>dated a muscular guy. He was as strong as Terminator, but he beat up any<br>other guys who would stare at me. I was afraid he would hit me too. So I<br>dumped him when he was in jail.<br><br>I decided to date a romantic guy. He was so sweet he sent me flowers every<br>Friday to my office just to ask me out; one time he packed himself into a<br>box as my birthday gift. But he was also romantic to other girls until I<br>found out in a florist that he ordered 5 dozens roses each Friday. It was<br>too late, he already dumped me.<br><br>So I decided to date a stable guy. He was a "good" man and he had a Ph.D<br>from MIT. But all he talked with me was M/M/1 Queuing theory. I had to dump<br>him because when one day I said "I'm going to Australia," and he said "You<br>don't need to go there to buy apples. There's a groce! r across the street."<br><br>After that I decided to date an interesting guy. He was so funny and he was<br>like "George" in TV Steinfield. He made me laugh all time.But later,I<br>couldn't laugh any more. He didn't have a job,nor did he plan to find one.<br>All he did was playing Mahjong and "Cho Dai Di".The worst thing is that we<br>got married.<br><br>WHAT DO GUYS WANT (^_^)<br><br>When I was in JC, all I wanted was a girl with big boobs. So I dated a girl<br>with big boobs, but there was no passion.<br><br>So I decided I needed a passionate girl. In University, I dated a passionate<br>girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency, and she cried<br>all the time.<br><br>So I decided I needed a girl with some stability and I found a very stable<br>girl. But she was so boring, she never got excited about anything. So I<br>decided I needed a girl with some excitement.<br><br>There, I found an exciting gir! l, but I couldn't keep up with her.She rushed<br>from one thing to an other, never settling on anything. She was<br>directionless.<br><br>So I decided to find a girl with some ambition. After graduation,I found an<br>ambitious girl and married her. She was so ambitious, she divorced me and<br>took everything I owned.<br><br>SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?<br><br>Many times, people just go after what they want their ideal partner to<br>be.And they neglect other qualities the person has. Chasing after what you<br>want is never ending and may not come to a good end. So cherish what you<br>have and appreciate what they are. Accept them as they are. Only then, you<br>can learn and love each other better.<br><br></div>
