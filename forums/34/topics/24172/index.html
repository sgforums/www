            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Starved, battered, dead... Nine months of maid abuse went unnoticed </strong><br>By Karen Ho &amp; Elena Chong<br><br>Maid abuse: What's to be done?<br>Her clothes covered the bruises, cuts and lacerations on her But if anyone had taken a closer look at Miss Muawanatul Chasanah when she was alive, they would have seen the sores and open wounds on her lips. Lift her shoulder-length hair from her face and what stares back is a mass of black, brown and blue bruises.<br>Multiple injuries are seen on the back and neck of Miss Muawanatul. Her left ear had been battered into a 'cauliflower' - a feature found on boxers rather than a 19-year-old girl. Post-mortem reports recorded the rotan marks crisscrossing her buttocks and limbs, and sores, some yet to be healed, which dotted her back - the result of jabs with a hammer's handle. Her back and neck were discoloured - evidence of scalding. Her final indignity: She was found with vomit on her T-shirt with a distended stomach that could barely fit into the blue jeans which were being held up by a string.<br><br>But while this treatment was meted out to her, for nine months, at Ng Hua Chye's flat in Chai Chee and in his sister's home in Bedok Reservoir, neighbours interviewed said they were not aware of anything amiss - save one.<br><br>Ng's next-door neighbour, a 69-year-old retiree who wanted to be known only as Mr Ng, said he had bought bread for one of Ng's earlier maids. She would peer through the flat's window shutters, saying that she was hungry, he said.<br>'She was given only a few packets of Maggi mee to eat. She said she couldn't stomach it, so she would ask me if I could buy her some bread.'<br>He had bought bread for the maid about seven or eight times. He counted four maids during Ng's stay over the past year or so, all of whom stayed for only a couple of months. He described Ng as 'very fierce'.<br>'He was always scolding the maid, but I don't know what he was saying.'<br>He said he did not recall ever seeing maid No 5, Miss Muawanatul, and assumed that she must have spent most of her time in the Bedok Reservoir flat.<br><br>Over at Bedok Reservoir, of the five other units on the same floor as Ng's sister's flat, only one neighbour remembered the maid.  The 31-year-old contractor, who wanted to be known only as Mr Neo, said the family kept very much to themselves. He said the maid seldom left the flat.<br>'I saw her only a few times in the mornings or in the evenings watering plants outside the flat.'<br>Miss Muawanatul was very thin, and always looked tired and unhappy, he said.<br>'She was 19 but she looked like she was in her 40s.'<br><br>There was at least one person she had confided in. The court heard that she had told another Indonesian maid that her employers did not give her enough food to eat, which was why she resorted to stealing food. She told her that she was sometimes given only a packet of instant noodles each for lunch and dinner.<br><br>On her death, she weighed just 36 kg, down from the 50 kg she weighed when she arrived in Singapore two years ago. Miss Muawanatul also corresponded with her parents in Indonesia. They told her how to get her employers on her side. They sent her some powdery substances to put into the family's food. That proved to be her undoing, because Ng was enraged when he found out.<br><br><strong>Asked if he would have reported the abuse to the police if he had known of it, Mr Neo replied: 'Even if I knew, I wouldn't have called the police, it's not my business.</strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="large"><strong>'He can do what he wants, that's his problem. And anyway, God can see.'</strong></span></span><br><br><strong>200 Injuries</strong><br>Head 5 bruises 4 scars<br>Neck 5 scars<br>Face 7 bruises 15 scars<br>Mouth 3 tears and 3 healing cuts in mouth and lips<br>Abdomen 12 long and round brown scars<br>Chest 8 burn scars - healing and healed superficial ones4 brown and white scars plus multiple brown scars<br>Arms and Legs At least 85 scars and bruises<br>Hip 1 scar 1 bruise<br>Back 16 long scars on back 20 long scars across buttocks 6 ulcerated and scabbed sores<br></div>
