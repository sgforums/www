No matter how much fault you find with another, and regardless of how much you blame him/her, it will not change you. The only thing blame does is to keep the focus off you when you are looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration.

            <div class='col-md body'>When you think of your past love, you may view it as a failure. But when you find a new love, you view the past as a teacher. In the game of love,it doesn't really matter who won or who lost. What is important is you know when to hold on and when to let go! You know you really love someone when you want him or her to be happy, even if their happpines means that you're not part of it.<br><br>Everything happens for the best. If the person you love doesn't love you back, don't be afraid to love someone else again, for you'll never know unless you give it a try. You'll never love a person you love unless you risk for love.<br><br>Love strives in hurting. If you don't get hurt, you don't learn how to love. Love doesn't hurt all the time. Though the hurting is still there to test you, to help you grow. Don't find love, let love find you. That's why it's called falling in love because you don't force yourself to fall.<br><br>You just fall. You cannot finish a book without closing it's chapters. If you want to go on, then you have to leave the past as you turn the pages.<br><br>Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. It is a lifetime venture in which we are always learning, discovering and growing. The greatest irony of love is letting go when you need to hold on and holding on when you need to let go. We lose someone we love only when we are destined to find someone else who can love us even more than we can love ourselves.<br><br>On falling out of love, take some time to heal and then get back on the horse. But don't ever make the same mistake of riding the same one that threw you the first time.<br><br>To love is to risk rejections, to live is to risk dying, to hope is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is risk nothing! To reach for another is to risk involvement, to expose your feelings is to expose true self, to love is to risk not to be loved in return.<br><br>How to define love: fall but do not stumble, be constant but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understand and try not to demand, hurt but never keep the pain.<br><br>Love is like a knife. It can stab the heart or it can carve wonderful images into the soul that always last for a lifetime. Love is supposed to be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire you and give you joy and strength. But sometimes the things that give you joy can also hurt you in the end.<br><br>Loving people means giving them the freedom who they choose to be and where they choose to be. For all the heartaches and the tears, for gloomy days and fruitless years, you should give thanks, for you know, that these were the things which helped you grow.<br><br>Loving someone means giving him the freedom to find his way, whether it leads towards you or away from you. Love is a painful risk to take but the risk must be taken no matter how scary or painful, for only then you'll experience the fullness of humanity and that is love.<br><br>Only love can hurt your heart, fill you with desire and tear you apart. Only love can make you cry and only love knows why. If you're not ready to cry, if you're not ready to take the risk, if you're not ready to feel the pain, then you're not ready to fall in love.<br><br>There was a time in our lives when we became afraid to fall in love 'coz every time we do, we get hurt, then I figured that's why it's called falling in love. When you decide to love, allow it to grow. When you promise to love, refuse to let it die!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things to learn in life...<br>- The most powerful force in the universe is gossip.<br>- The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we ALL believe that we are above-average drivers.<br>- There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday. That time is age 12.<br>- There is a very fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."<br>-. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them.<br>- If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be "meetings."<br>- The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy people who are not in them.<br>- You should not confuse your career with your life.<br>- A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.<br>- No matter what happens, somebody will take it way too seriously.<br>- When trouble arises and things look bad, there is always one individual who perceives a solution and is willing to take command. Very often, that individual is crazy.<br>- Your friends love you, anyway.<br>- Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Albert Einstein Quotes...</strong><br><br><strong>On Knowledge</strong><br>- Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.<br>- Imagination is more important than knowledge.<br>- The only real valuable thing is intuition.<br>- Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.<br>- Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.<br>- The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.<br>- The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.<br>- The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.<br><br><strong>His Understanding of the World </strong><br>- I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.<br>- The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.<br>- I am convinced that He (God) does not play dice.<br>- The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.<br>- Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.<br>- Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.<br>- Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.<br>- The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.<br>- Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.<br>- Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.<br>- I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.<br>- In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep.<br>- Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts. (Sign hanging in Einstein's office at Princeton)<br><br><strong>On People and Life </strong><br>- Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.<br>- A person starts to live when he can live outside himself.<br>- I never think of the future. It comes soon enough.<br>- Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.<br>- Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.<br>- Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.<br>- Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.<br>- No, this trick won't work...How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?<br>- My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.<br>- The release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking...the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind. If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker.<br>- Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.<br>- The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed. - - --- Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.<br>- You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.<br>- A human being is a part of a whole, called by us Â“universeÂ”, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.<br><br><strong>On Math and Science and Education </strong><br>- Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.<br>- God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically.<br>- The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.<br>- Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.<br>- We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.<br>- Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school.<br>- Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.<br>- Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.<br>- If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut.<br>- As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.<br>- Yes, we have to divide up our time like that, between our politics and our equations. But to me our equations are far more important, for politics are only a matter of present concern. A mathematical equation stands forever.<br>- ...one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought.<br>- Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. THAT'S relativity.</div>

In the room of 200, he asked,<br><br>"Who would like this $20 bill?"<br><br>Hands started going up.<br><br>"I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this."<br><br>He proceeded to crumple the dollar bill up.

He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty.<br><br>"Now who still wants it?"<br><br>Still the hands went into the air.<br><br>"My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless. But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value: dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who love you. The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by WHO WE ARE. You are special - Don't ever forget it. Count your Blessings, not your problems."</div>
