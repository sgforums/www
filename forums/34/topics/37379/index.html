Simple because they crave for so much love and care from the bfs and refuse to give back any in return. It is always about them, and never the bfs. I feel that this is a selfish act of love. When the bf just feels that he's finally done enough and feel lacked of love and care from their gf, they'll simply break up.<br><br>This is usually the part where girls come to the forum and start complaining "boo hoo hoo . my bf broke up with me ... i still miss him but he said we can only remain friends ..."<br><br>For others to respect you, you must first respect others.<br><br>Love isn't selfish unless you want it to. at least not to both parties.</div>

This applies to both man and woman ok....<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>1. A gesture a day: </span><br>Send a note to him/her or give he/she a call to tell them "I Love you" or "I miss you" or just ask how he/she is.<br><br><span style="color: red;">2. Be yourself: </span><br>The best way for a person to be romantic is by being your own self. Don't let others tell you what to do. Come up with something no one would expect. Do something creative. Show who you are.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">3. Cherish the moment:</span><br>Take the time to pay attention to your mate. Not only try to please yourself, but make sure that they are also pleased. During and after, look into each other's eyes. No words are needed. Just looking in each other's eyes at such an intimate time is such an overwhelmingly wonderful feeling!<br><br><span style="color: red;">4. Discover their interests: </span><br>Take one night out and find out each other's needs and rules. These play a big part in relationships. For example -- some people are turned on more visually -- so presenting a flower says much more than saying, 'I love you.' Others like hearing the words more than having something done for them. Still others like to get a feeling - a touch, a hug -- most people like a combination of these. Sit and discover each other's needs. Take about 3 hours with each other. It could be the most wonderful thing you'll do.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">5. Express how you really feel: </span><br>Tell them how you really feel about them, that you love them from the inside not just the outside. Say sweet and loving things like: 'Your eyes can make the sun rise,' or 'Your the reason my heart beats,' or 'You look so good, I wish I could grow a whole field of you.'<br><br><span style="color: red;">6. Create an after-the-day ritual: </span><br>For example:<br>Perhaps when you and your gf get together the first thing you do is give each other a kiss. Tell each other about your day and share your thoughts about each other. Help each other with any problems you might have, and in the end you might be happy with just being together.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">7. Send letters/emails of love:</span><br>Even if you live close to your loved one, even if you are married to him/her, loving letters/emails show that you love him or her. They show that you are willing to expend time showing that person how much you care. They mean even more, of course, when there is a distance to overcome. Write down your deepest, truest, most intimate feelings -- because being vulnerable with your lover shows that you trust him or her and strengthens bonds between the two of you. A suit of armor is not romantic! Be vulnerable, but be sincere.<br><br><span style="color: red;">8. Have love rituals: </span><br>It is good to have rituals in your relationship that are unique to you and your love one.<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>9. Open your heart: </span><br>Often the greatest way to show your love is by giving someone your trust. Open up and tell your mate something about you that no one else knows. It's a sure fire way to let them know how special they are and how much they mean to you.<br><br><span style="color: red;">10. Pay attention: </span><br>The best way to show that you love that person is to pay attention to what they tell you. It's a very easy thing to do, but it is often overshadowed by personal thoughts or wants.<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>11. Praise your mate: </span><br>Tell your love one that he/she is the best. Kiss often and comfort each other by holding each other.<br><br><span style="color: red;">12. Remain playful: </span><br>A true token of love is an ability to share a playful moment together. Couples usually share work, home life, quiet times and intimate times, but play is the most romantic and connected feeling of all.<br></div>
