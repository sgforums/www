Unfortunately for James, the room he was in did not have a bar resting across the iron holders for it.<br><br>Catherine Douglass, a member of his wifeÂ’s entourage, came to JamesÂ’ aid.

Through a haze of cigarette smoke (well, some of it is probably tobacco), the saxophonist soulfully wails.<br>Funky!<br><br>Funky entered English in the 17th century and meant smelly. It probably came from Â“funkier,Â” French for puffing smoke on someone. Later it also came to mean a state of panic, possibly from a similar Flemish word, though it may be related to<br>the smell of fear. Eventually it also meant feeling down, as in a blue funk.<br><br>It only gained common usage in Black English 80 years ago, meaning sweaty and smelly. But just as Â“badÂ” came to mean Â“goodÂ” in the African-American community, funky, too, by the late 1930s, had its meaning mirrored as something earthy, basic and pleasing!<br></div>

It was basically a dark box with a small opening<br>that admitted light to form an image on the back of the box. The difference was that Niepce added a lens for focus and retained the image by having the light hit drops of light-sensitive bitumen, a substance resembling tar, on a silver pewter plate. It took eight hours to develop the image.<br><br>The technic used for developing is still a mystery!</div>
