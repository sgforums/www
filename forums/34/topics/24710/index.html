USA<br>It was not the crime of the century when a man allegedly stole 58 cents from a car in rural New Jersey, but his trial and incarceration could end up costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br><br>Over protests from a taxpayersÂ’ advocacy group and civil libertarians, prosecutors are pressing for a prison sentence of between five and 10 years for a drifter accused of stealing the money in Greenwich, New Jersey, in 1999.<br><br>In drifter Michael MonroeÂ’s defense, his attorney said he slid his hand through a slightly open window of the car to give more air to a Rottweiler dog that had been left inside by its owner. It had already cost taxpayers $16,000 to keep Monroe in prison before his trial started. If he receives the maximum prison sentence, local officials said the tab for his confinement would be about $270,000. (Reuters)<br><br>...

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people claim that fireworks should be legalized in all 50 U.S.  states. But if you ask Darren Anderson from Lewiston, MA, he will have a much different opinion. Mr. Anderson was relaxing on his hammock, located in his front yard, when 11 year-old Dennis Frampton launched an M-80 firecracker towards him. The young boy told police officials that he only wanted to frighten Anderson for not tipping him on his newspaper deliver service. The firecracker not only frightened Anderson, but it landed on his lower lip and then exploded on his face. The 31 year-old Anderson is currently in critical condition, and please only click on this link if you can handle graphic material As you can see, fireworks are illegal in most U.S. States for a reason.  Since the accused is under the age of 13 he can only be charged with vandalism; this is a $40 fine.<br><br><a href="http://www.wayweird.com/archives/2001/apr/seriousinjury.jpg" rel="nofollow">Do not click on this link if you are easily frighten by graphical gross picture.</a></div>
