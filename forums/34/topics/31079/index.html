            <div class='col-md body'>This is an episode on this TV series Boston Public shown on TCS 5 on Wednesday after midnight.<br><br>A female student, Melissa 16, fell down the stairs in school. She told her teacher, Ronnie, she was careless. Melissa was sent to the hospital to be checked for concussion and her injured arm. Another student, Ferris, came forward and told Ronnie he suspect that Melissa threw herself down the stairs trying to kill/hurt herself.<br><br>At the hospital, Ronnie discovered that that Melissa was pregnant (five months). She questioned Melissa's parents. They acknowledged that they knew about the pregnancy. It was Melissa's boyfriend who made her pregnant and she wants to keep the child. Ronnie told them that Melissa's attempt at aborting the child (by injuring herself). They told her they would talk to her about it.<br><br>The next day Ronnie happened to see Melissa in a heated discussion with a male student, Jim. Ronnie later questioned Jim about Melissa's condition. Jim told her he was not the father of the child because he never had sex with Melissa before. He suspected that the child was Melissa's father's. Ronnie confronted Melissa about this.<br><br>Melissa confessed that the child she was carrying was her father's. She was the surrogate mother for the fertilized embryo implanted in her womb. Ronnie reported this to the principal, Steven, whom then called the parents in for a meeting. They admitted to Melissa's confession.<br><br>The fetus inside of Melissa's was through the selection of the best DNA matching (in order to provide a donor kidney) of the mother's embryo and father's sperm. This is because Melissa and her father's kidneys is not a match to the mother. As the mother's condition does not allow her to be pregnant as it will further endanger her life, they had not choice but to ask Melissa to be the surrogate mother.<br><br>Ronnie was angry with the parents for forcing upon their own child this responsibility of saving her own mother through the above method. Not sure of the stand in this matter, the school has to report this to Social Services which promptly removed Melissa from her parents and placed her in a foster home.<br><br>Ronnie regretted her decision, blaming that she has condemned Melissa's life. Social Service just went through Melissa's case by the laws and did not give her special consideration.<br><br><strong>Questions</strong><br>1) Would you as a parent allow your teenage daughter to do this in order to save your spouse, her parent?<br>2) Would you get pregnant just to harvest the organs once the baby is born?<br>3) Is a fetus a sentient life? Does it have to have rights as a person?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If i am the parent of Melissa, I would not do such a thing to her cause if i am a parent, i would want my child to be happy and let no one hurt my child.<br><br>Melissa's parents are really selfish. Correct, they needed a liver to save a life but by sacrificing another life to save one, I do not think that is correct.  Besides, if they really love their kid, they would not even think of such an option!!<br><br>My grandma always tell me a saying in cantonese, being a parent for 100days, you would have to worry for 99days.  Cause no matter what, a parent would want their kids to be happy and well.<br><br>Besides, a foetus is a living being.  it has a hearbeat and can feel movement and pain too in the mother's womb.  Hence it should be given a chance to live and not some toy or stuff.</div>
