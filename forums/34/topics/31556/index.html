            <div class='col-md body'>What Are You Thinking?<br><br>The question this time, from the men's side of the table:<br><br>Â“What should you do when the women you are with ask you this questionÂ… What are you thinking?"<br><br>Every male in the world has had to deal with this question, which is more often than not uncorked at entirely inappropriate times, such as when you are watching ESPN, locked in a passionate embrace, or just reading a book or magazine.<br><br>Regardless of what you are doing, you must come up with a complete and satisfactory answer, or stand accused of Â“Hiding Your True FeelingsÂ”.<br><br>Which means, of course, you will spend the next week pretending to be sorry. So you have got to come up with something. And it had better be good.<br><br>Now, the obvious question here isÂ… WHY do women want to know what we're thinking? SimpleÂ… They assume we are thinking in the first place. Hard to believe, but there it is.<br><br>Why on earth would they think that? Well, go up to a woman and ask her what she is thinking. I have just done so with my wife, and this is what she is thinking about:<br><br>"Off the top of my head, I'm thinking about the party we're having Saturday, and how I'm going to fix that light in the spare room so that people can walk around without hitting their heads. Underneath that I'm thinking about my work schedule this week and whether or not I'm going to have time to do some of the things I need to do at home as well. And under that I'm wondering if it's too late to get cards for Christmas. AND I'm thinking about getting a snack."<br><br>Not only is she thinking about something, she is thinking about four separate things. If I check back in five minutes, she will still be thinking. Women are always thinking, and often about practical things.<br><br>Men, on the other hand, are actively thinking for about five minutes out of every hour (usually not in sequence). So, at best, you have a one in 12 chance of catching a man actually having a thought. What are we thinking about?<br><br>1. Women<br>2. Food<br>3. Soccer<br>4. Other sports<br>5. Funny joke told by friends last week or what numbers to buy...<br>6. How an awesome computer operating system like Linux can exist _AND_ be free at the same time (or Women)<br>7. Work<br>8. The black unknowable nothingness that frames our existence, and whether a benevolent and omnipotent higher power can possibly exist within it (or food)<br>9. Sleep<br>10. Women<br><br>In summary, randomly asking a man what he is thinking has precisely a 8.83% chance of turning up a real, verifiable, honest-to-God thought. You might as well bet on the Singapore winning the Tiger Cup. Sound harsh, guys? Fine. QuickÂ… what are you thinking? Had to think about it, did you not. You lose. Sit down.<br><br>Despite the overwhelming evidence that men, in fact, are almost never thinking, women will still demand to know their innermost thoughts. In a way, it is touching; women are expressing faith that, if prodded long enough and frequently enough, they may yet boost the number of times we think in an hour. And they will. Unfortunately, most of what we will be thinking is Â“stop asking me what I'm thinking." And that is just going to get us in trouble.<br><br>The best way to keep a woman from constantly asking you what you are thinking is to have a ready, pre-memorized answer for the times that she does. Here are some tried and true responses, with the pros and cons of each:<br><br>"I'm thinking that tonight it'd be nice to stay at home and cuddle on the sofa."<br>Pros: Romantic; Sounds as if you are spontaneous.<br>Cons: Requires comfortable sofa for long duration; Romantic moments often prompt even more "What are you thinking" queries.<br><br>"I'm thinking how much I love you."<br>Pros: Generally provokes a positive response that short circuits any need for further conversation; Is often also true.<br>Cons: If you use it too much, she'll know it's a line, and then you're really in trouble.<br><br>"I was wondering if there is actually life on other planets."<br>Pros: Cosmic; shows you are a deep thinker.<br>Cons: Woman may wonder if this is an intro to the same sort of "alien sigmoidoscopy" story that ruined her last relationship.<br><br>"I was imagining, if I were an animal, what sort of animal I'd be."<br>Pros: Imaginative; Allows woman to spend many happy minutes trying to establish your place in the animal kingdom.<br>Cons: She might think you resemble a marmoset or skunk; She may forego the animal world altogether and go straight to yeasts.<br><br>Keep in mind that these responses are not to supersede an actual thought. If you find yourself having one at the moment she asks, go ahead and share it, as long as it is not something along the lines of "This relationship blows" or "I really like shopping."<br><br>With a little practice, you should come out okay.<br><br>But, hey. That is just what I think.</div>
