You know how to have fun, but you may take it to extremes. You know what you are doing though, and are much in control of your own life. People don't always see things your way, but that doesn't mean that you should do away with your beliefs. Try to remember that your wild spirit can lead to hurting yourself and others.<br><br>(18-26 points)<br>You are Bugs Bunny the Rabbit<br>You are fun, friendly, and popular. You are a real crowd pleaser. You have probably been out on the town your share of times, yet you come home with the values that your mother taught you. Marriage and children are important to you, but only after you have fun. Don't let the people you please<br>influence you to stray.<br><br>(27-34 points)<br>You are Tweety the Bird<br>You are cute, and everyone loves you. You are a best friend that no one takes the chance of losing. You never hurt feelings and seldom have your own feelings hurt. Life is a breeze. You are witty and calm most of the time. Just keep clear of backstabbers and you are worry-free.<br><br>(35-42 points)<br>You are Peppe Le Pew (without the odor) the Skunk<br>You are a lover. Romance, flowers, and wine are all you need to enjoy yourself. You are serious about all commitments. A family person. You call your mom every Sunday, and never forget a birthday. Don't let your passion for romance get confused with the real thing.<br><br>(43-50 points)<br>You are Speedy Gonzales the Fastest Mouse in Mexico! You are smart, a real thinker. Every situation is approached with a plan. You are very healthy in mind and body. You teach strong family values.  Keep your feet planted in them but don't overlook a bad situation when it does happen.</span></strong></div>
