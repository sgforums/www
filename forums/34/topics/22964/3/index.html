            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting but rare and unusual to hear this from a CEO of a No.2 IT company in India... Extract of Mr. Narayana Murthy's Speech during Mentor session.<br><br>I know people who work 12 hours a day, six days a week, or more. Some people do so because of a work emergency where the long hours are only temporary. Other people I know have put in these hours for years. I do not know if they are working all these hours, but I do know they are in the office this long. Others put in long office hours because they are addicted to the workplace.<br><br>Whatever the reason for putting in overtime, working long hours over the long term is harmful to the person and to the organization. There are things managers can do to change this for everyone's benefit. Being in the office long hours, over long periods of time, makes way for potential errors.<br><br>My colleagues who are in the office long hours frequently make mistakes caused by fatigue. Correcting these mistakes requires their time as well as the time and energy of others. I have seen people work Tuesday through Friday to correct mistakes made after 5 PM on Monday.<br><br>Another problem is that people who are in the office long hours are not pleasant company. They often complain about other people (who are not working as hard); they are irritable, or cranky, or even angry. Other people avoid them. Such behaviour poses problems, especially in an area like IT, where work goes much better when people work together instead of avoiding one another. As managers, there are things we can do to help people leave the office.<br><br>First and foremost is to set the example and go home ourselves. I work with a manager who chides people for working long hours. His words quickly lose their meaning when he sends these chiding group e-mails with a time-stamp of 2 AM, Sunday.<br><br>Second is to encourage people to put some balance in their lives. For instance, here is a guideline I find helpful:<br><br>1) Wake up, eat a good breakfast, and go to work.<br>2) Work hard and smart for eight or nine hours (this is important).<br>3) Go home.<br>4) Read the comics, watch a funny movie, dig in the dirt, play with your kids, etc.<br>5) Eat well and sleep well.<br><br>This is called recreating. Doing steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 enable step 2.<br><br>Working regular hours and recreating daily are simple concepts.<br><br>They are hard for some of us because that requires personal change. They are possible since we all have the power to choose to do them. Perhaps some people put in such long hours because they do not want to miss anything when they leave the office.<br>The trouble with this is that events will never stop happening. That is lifeÂ… things happen 24 hours a day. Allowing for little rest is not ultimately practical. So, take a nap. Things will happen while you are asleep, but you will have the energy to catch up when you wake up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Workplace Farting: Options Explored</strong><br><br>Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same:<br><br><strong>Farts.</strong><br><br>Seventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions.<br><br><strong>Holders</strong><br>The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk.<br><br><strong>Desk Jockey</strong><br>When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider:<br>- Do you have your own office?<br>Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females.<br><br>- Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk?<br><br>If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area.<br><br>If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days.<br><br>There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heel on the floor.<br><br>I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event.<br><br><strong>Meetings</strong><br>Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in.<br><br>Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected.<br><br>Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like.<br><br><strong>Walker</strong><br>Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident.<br><br>The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice.<br><br><strong>Utility Closet</strong><br>One option is to find a utility closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet. I found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. People will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet. Of course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky.<br><br>And remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.</div>
