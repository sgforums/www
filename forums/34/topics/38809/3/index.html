His clothing is a tattered mix of leather rags. His entire face and body are covered with piercings and his earrings are big, bright red, yellow and green feathers. The old man stares at the young punk as the bus travels across the city. Finally, the punk looks across at the old man, and yells,<br>"What are you looking at, old man! Didn't you do anything wild when you were young?"<br>Without missing a beat, the old man replies,<br>"Yeah. Back when I was very young and in the Navy, I got really drunk in Africa and had sex with a parrot... I thought you might be my son."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A couple had been married 10 years. One afternoon, they were working in the garden together. As the wife was bending over pulling weeds, the husband said,<br><br>''Hey honey, you're getting fat. Your butt is huge. I'll bet it's as wide as the gas grill.''<br><br>Feeling the need to prove his point, he got out a yard stick and measured the grill, then his wife's butt.<br><br>''Yep,'' he said,'' just what I thought, just about the same size.''<br><br>The wife became incensed and left him gardening alone. She went inside the house and didn't speak to him for the rest of the day.<br>When they retired to bed that evening, the husband cuddled up to his wife and said,<br><br>''How about it, honey? How about a little lovemaking?''<br><br>The wife turned her back to him, giving him the cold shoulder.<br><br>''What's the matter?'' he asked.<br><br>''You don't think I'm going to fire up this big ass grill for one little wenier, do you?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From a strictly mathematical viewpoint, it goes like this:<br>What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? HereÂ’s a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:<br><br>What does it take to achieve 100% in life? LetÂ’s do the math...<br><br>If:<br>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z<br>is represented as:<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26<br><br>Then:<br>H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K<br>8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%<br><br>and<br>K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E<br>11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%<br><br>But,<br>A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E<br>1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%<br><br>And,<br>B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T<br>21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%<br><br>BUT, look how far ass kissing will take you.<br>A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G<br>1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%<br><br>So, one can then conclude, with mathematical certainty, that while Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, it takes the Attitude to get you there; but if your boss wants more... Bullshit and Ass Kissing will put you over the top!<br></div>
