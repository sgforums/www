As you are probably aware, the competition was exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also failed to make the final cut.  I will, however, keep your name on file should an opening come available.  So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition: (Check those that apply)<br><br>__ Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it, hyphenating it, or subjecting my children to it.<br><br>__ Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion.<br><br>__ The fact that our finest dining experience to date has been at McDonald's reveals a thriftiness that I find unappealing.<br><br>__ Your inadvertent admission that you "buy condoms by the truckload" indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my personality.<br><br>__ You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.e., I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself.<br><br>__ Your breasts are bigger than mine.<br><br>__ Your legs are skinnier than mine. If you can FIT into my pants, then you can't GET into my pants.<br><br>__ You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess. AMEN!<br><br>__ You're too tall. I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying to kiss you.<br><br>__ The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable.<br><br>__ Although I do enjoy the X-Files, I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms a little disconcerting.<br><br>__ Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker.<br><br>__ Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a long term partner.<br><br>__ Your height is out of proportion to your weight.  If you should, however, happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your application.<br><br>__ The fact that you categorize the Survivor or any reality show as 'Must See TV' demonstrated that you do not meet my intelligence requirements.<br><br>__ Somehow I doubt those condoms that I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip.<br><br>__ I am out of your league; set your sights lower next time.<br><br>Sincerely,</div>

On the day the surrogate father was to arrive, Mr. Lim kissed his wife and said,<br><br>''I'm off. The man should be here soon."<br><br>Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.<br><br>''Good morning, madam. You don't know me but I've come to....''<br><br>''Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you,'' Mrs. Lim cut in.<br><br>''Really ?'' the photographer asked. ''Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies.''<br><br>''That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat. Just where do we start?'' asked Mrs. Lim, blushing.<br><br>''Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you can really spread out.''<br><br>''Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me.''<br><br>''Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.''<br><br>''I hope we can get this over with quickly,'' gasped Mrs. Lim.<br><br>''Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.''<br><br>''Don't I know!'' Mrs. Lim exclaimed.<br><br>The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures.<br><br>''This was done on the top of a bus at Orchard.''<br><br>''Oh my god!' Mrs. Lim exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.<br><br>''And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.''<br><br>The photographer handed Mrs. Lim the picture.<br><br>''She was difficult?'' asked Mrs. Lim.<br><br>''Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Botanical Gardens to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get a good look.''<br><br>''Four and five deep?'' asked Mrs. Lim, eyes widened in amazement.<br><br>''Yes,'' the photographer said.<br><br>''And for more than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in.''<br><br>Mrs. Lim leaned forward.<br><br>''You mean they actually chewed on yourÂ… eh... equipment?''<br><br>''That's right. Well madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work.''<br><br>Â“Tripod?Â” Mrs. Lim looked extremely worried now.<br><br>''Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Madam? Madam... Good Lord, she's fainted!''</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Heaven and Hell - Rated R</strong><br><br>John and Bob were inseparable childhood friends. One night, they both died in a terrible car accident. When John woke up in heaven, he began to search for Bob but could not find him anywhere. Very distraught, he ran to St.Peter and said,<br><br>''St.Peter, I know Bob was killed in that accident with me, but I can't find him!''<br><br>''My son, I am sorry to tell you Bob didn't make it to Heaven.'' St. Peter said.<br><br>This upset John so much that St. Peter agreed to let him see Bob one more time. St. Peter parted the clouds and John saw Bob sitting in hell with a keg on one side and a beautiful buxom blonde on the other. John looked at St. Peter skeptically and said,<br><br>''Are you sure I'm in the right place?'<br><br>''My son," St. Peter said, "looks can be deceiving. You see that keg of beer? It has a hole in it. You see that woman? She doesn't!''</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A big shot business man had to spend a couple of days in the hospital. He was a royal pain to the nurses because he bossed them around just like he did his employees.<br>None of the hospital staff wanted to have anything to do with him. The head nurse was the only one who could stand up to him. She came into his room and announced, "I have to take your temperature."<br><br>After complaining for several minutes, he finally settled down, crossed his arms and opened his mouth.<br><br>"No, I'm sorry, the nurse stated, "but for this reading, I cannot use an oral thermometer."<br><br>This started another round of complaining, but eventually he rolled over and bared his rear end.<br><br>After feeling the nurse insert the thermometer, he heard her announce, "I have to get something. Now you stay JUST LIKE THAT until I get back!"<br><br>She leaves the door to his room open on her way out. He curses under his breath as he hears people walking past his door laughing. After almost an hour, the man's doctor comes into the room.<br><br>"What's going on here?" asked the doctor.<br><br>Angrily, the man answers, "What's the matter, Doc? Haven't you ever seen someone having their temperature taken?"<br><br>After a pause, the doctor confesses, "Well, no. I guess I haven't. Not with a carnation anyway."<br></div>
