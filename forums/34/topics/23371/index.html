            <div class='col-md body'>Study Suggests Ginkgo Ineffective Memory Enhancer<br>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Hoping to give your memory or mental abilities a boost with ginkgo biloba? You may be disappointed by the results of a study released Tuesday, which found no apparent memory-enhancing benefit for healthy people over 60.<br><br>"These data suggest that when taken following the manufacturer's instructions ginkgo provides no measurable benefit in memory or related cognitive function to adults with healthy cognitive function," according to the report in the August 21st issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.<br><br>Ginkgo biloba is widely advertised to be helpful for a variety of conditions including memory loss and dementia. As a result many healthy people and those with mental decline have turned to the unregulated dietary supplement with the hopes of improving or maintaining their mental abilities.<br><br>In the study, Dr. Paul R. Solomon of Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts and colleagues studied the effects of ginkgo on 98 men and 132 women over age 60. For 6 weeks, half the group took the manufacturer's recommended dose of the supplement and the other half took an inactive placebo.<br><br>All of the participants underwent a battery of tests designed to assess their mental abilities including memory before, during, and after the study period. Solomon's team also interviewed a close companion about the mental abilities of each of the men and women enrolled in the study.<br><br>Overall, 88% of the people completed the study, and the researchers found that "ginkgo did not facilitate performance on standard neuropsychological tests of learning, memory, attention, and concentration or naming and verbal fluency in elderly adults without cognitive impairment."<br><br>The study findings may not apply to different types of consumers taking other doses, the authors note.<br><br>"It is certainly possible that higher doses or longer periods of exposure than used in this study are necessary to detect changes; however, we administered the compound following the manufacturer's instructions," Solomon's team writes.<br><br>The dose used in the study was 120 milligrams per day, the same dose suggested by the German Commission E. More than 5 million prescriptions are written for ginkgo in Germany each year, mostly to treat dementia.<br><br>The researchers also did not measure the quality of the product, but note that the manufacturer says the product is "processed under strict guidelines...ensured through extensive quality control."<br><br>The authors note that ginkgo sales reached $240 million in the US in 1997, despite "the paucity of well-controlled" studies on its efficacy.<br><br>"In summary, this study does not support the manufacturer's claims of the benefits of ginkgo on learning and memory," they conclude.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;Very Important Information!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is<br>&gt;sexually active or not?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women<br>&gt;make love they produce amounts of the hormone estrogen, which makes<br>&gt;hair shine and skin smooth.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering<br>&gt;dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the<br>&gt;pores and makes your skin glow.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that<br>&gt;romantic dinner.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and<br>&gt;tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than<br>&gt;swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases endorphins<br>&gt;into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you<br>&gt;with a feeling of well-being.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually<br>&gt;active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called<br>&gt;pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE<br>&gt;EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages<br>&gt;saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid<br>&gt;that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release<br>&gt;the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a natural<br>&gt;antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This message has been sent to you for good luck in sex. The original<br>&gt;is in a room in Palaiseau. It has been sent around the world nine<br>&gt;times. Now sex has been sent to you. The "Hot Sex Fairy" will visit<br>&gt;you within four days of receiving this message, provided you, in turn,<br>&gt;send it on. If you don't, then you will never receive good sex again<br>&gt;for the rest of your life. You will eventually become celibate, and<br>&gt;your genitals will rot and fall off. This is no joke! Send copies to<br>&gt;people you think need sex (who doesn't?).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Don't send money, as the fate of your genitals has no price. Do not<br>&gt;keep this message. This message must leave your e-mail in 96 hours.<br>&gt;Please send ten copies and see what happens in four days. Since the<br>&gt;copy must tour the world, you must send it. This is true, even if you<br>&gt;are not superstitious.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;GOOD SEX, but please remember:<br>&gt;10 copies of this message must leave your e-mail in 96 hours or you<br>&gt;will not have good sex again for the rest of your<br>&gt;life!!</div>
