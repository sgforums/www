            <div class='col-md body'>Lisa, 22 year-old night manager of Burger King, conspired with the<br>34-year-old day manager to heist over $4000 from the restaurant.<br>They staged an elaborate fake robbery/arson, in which Lisa acted the part of the victim bound with duct tape and trapped in the walk-in<br>cooler, while her co-conspirator started a small fire and walked off<br>with a duffel bag of cash.<br><br>A key part of their plan was a quick "rescue" of Lisa by the local fire department.<br><br>Unfortunately the wastebasket fire went unnoticed until the morning<br>shift arrived to find a slow-burning smolder that had never erupted into the desired blaze. The air from the open door caused the smolder to burst into flames, and firefighters were summoned. They found Lisa in the freezer, chilled and semi-conscious, and rushed her to a hospital where she died from hypothermia.<br><br>When police nabbed her bungling 34-year-old accomplice with the cash stashed in a Burger King bag, she tearfully confessed the details of the crime, implicating Lisa in her own death. Her account was verified by the fact that Lisa's body showed no signs of forced restraint, the duct tape was loose, and she could have easily freed herself from her bindings and escaped from the unlocked refrigerator.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Joseph, a twenty-year-old inmate of the Stevens Point Jail, planned a circuitous route to freedom. He would pretend to be crazy in order to be transferred to the minimum-security mental health facility, from which it would be easier to engineer an escape. What would a crazy person do if he were trapped in jail? Joseph pondered the question, then decided to hang himself with a bed sheet until he was unconscious, while his bunkmate alerted officials, who would cut him<br>down and hopefully send him to the nuthouse. Joseph's escape plan worked more quickly than he had anticipated. He hanged himself and was taken to the freedom of a grave the very next<br>day.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Legendary Chicago guitarist Terry Kath died a week before his 32nd<br>birthday in front of his wife and friends in a one-man shootout. An avid collector of guns, he had brought several of his metal friends to a party along with his wife. After the party broke up, he began to play with his guns. First he spun his .38 revolver on his finger, brought it to his temple, and pulled the trigger. Click! He knew the gun was not loaded. Then he picked up a 9-mm automatic pistol. The host of the party asked him to stop, and as Terry pulled the clip from the weapon, he reassured him,<br>"Don't worry, it's not loaded."<br>Then Terry raised the pistol and put a bullet through his head.<br>This popular musician and long-time gun enthusiast forgot that an<br>automatic automatically chambers a bullet, so removing the clip does not disarm the weapon. He death was classified an inadvertent suicide.</div>

While around at 2 AM, the bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the window to see what would happen, but they apparently failed to notice that the window was closed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his body but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system. His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't have been fatal. But the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. He was a big man with a huge capacity for creating [this deadly gas]." Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.</div>
