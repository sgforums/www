            <div class='col-md body'>Once there were twins, Joe and John. Joe was the owner of a dilapidated old boat. It so happened that John's wife died the same day that Joe's boat sank.<br><br>A few days later, a kindly old woman saw Joe and mistook him for John. She said, 'I'm sorry to hear about your loss. You must just feel terrible.'<br><br>Joe, thinking that she was talking about his boat, said, 'Heck no, fact is I'm sort of glad to be rid of her. She was a rotten old thing right from the beginning. Her bottom was all shrivelled up and she smelled like old dead fish.<br><br>She was always losing her water, she had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too. Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy.<br><br>I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to these four guys looking for a good time. I warned them that she wasn't very good, but they wanted to use her anyhow. The fools tried to get in her all at once and she split right up the middle.'<br><br>The old lady fainted.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A mother took her daughter to the doctor and asked him to give her an examination to determine the cause of her daughter's swollen abdomen. It only took the doctor about two seconds to say,<br><br>"Gimme a break lady! Your daughter is pregnant."<br><br>The mother turned red with fury and she argued with the doctor that her daughter was a good girl and would never compromise her reputation by having sex with a boy. The doctor faced the window and silently watched the horizon. The mother became enraged and screamed,<br><br>"Quit looking out the window! Aren't you paying attention to me?"<br><br>"Yes, of course I am paying attention ma'am. It's just that the last time this happened, a star appeared in the east, and three wise men came. I was hoping they would show up again and help me figure out who got your daughter pregnant."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky, he could not tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared. Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked,<br><br>"Is the coming winter going to be cold?"<br><br>"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed," the meteorologist at the weather service responded.<br><br>So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again.<br><br>"Is it going to be a very cold winter?"<br><br>"Yes," the man at National Weather Service again replied, "it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."<br><br>The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.<br><br>Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again.<br><br>"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?"<br><br>"Absolutely," the man replied. "It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever."<br><br>"How can you be so sure?" the Chief asked.<br><br>"The Indians are collecting wood like crazy." the weatherman replied.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Early one morning, my husband, who works in a funeral home, woke me, complaining of severe abdominal pains. We rushed to the emergency room, where they gave him a series of tests to determine the source of the pain. My husband decided not to have me call in sick for him until we knew what was wrong. When the results came back, the nurse informed us that, true to our suspicions, he was suffering from a kidney stone. I turned to my husband and asked,<br><br>"Would you like me to call the funeral home now?"<br><br>With an alarmed look, the nurse quickly said, "Ma'am, he's not THAT sick!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long ago, there lived a sailor named Captain Bravo. He was a manly man's man, who showed no fear when facing his enemies.<br>One day, while sailing the Seven Seas, his lookout spotted a pirate ship. The crew became frantic! Captain Bravo bellowed,<br><br>"Bring me my red shirt!"<br><br>The first mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt, and while wearing the brightly colored frock, the Captain led his crew into battle and defeated the pirates. That evening, all the men sat around on the deck recounting the day's triumph. One of them asked the captain,<br><br>"Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before battle?"<br><br>"If I had been wounded in the attack, the shirt would not have shown my blood. Thus, you men would continue to fight, unafraid." The captain replied.<br><br>All of the men sat and marveled at both the courage and intelligence of such a manly man's man. As dawn came the next morning, the lookout spotted not one, not two, but TEN pirate ships approaching! The crew stared in worshipful silence at the captain and waited for his usual brilliant orders. Captain Bravo gazed with steely eyes upon the vast armada arrayed against his ship, and without fear, turned and calmly shouted,<br><br>"Get me my brown pants."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why Star Wars is better than Titanic</strong><br><br>* The Titanic is big, but it does not have hyper-drive.<br><br>* Yoda could have used the Force to lift Titanic out of the water.<br><br>* Leia is a princess, a senator, a freedom fighter, and Jedi material. Rose is just marriage bait.<br><br>* Ewoks throw better parties than either first class or steerage.<br><br>* It would be much scarier to get chased around the boat by a raving madman with a light-saber as opposed to a handgun.<br><br>* Titanic is egalitarian by portraying poor people as sympathetic characters. Star Wars is egalitarian by promoting bug-eyed amphibians to Admiral.<br><br>* We know Cal is the bad guy because he sneers at the poor and treats his fiancee like property. We know Darth Vader is the bad guy because he strangles people &amp; blows up planets for fun.<br><br>* Yeah, Leo can dance, but can he fly an X-wing? *Note: Is this a scary premonition: Anakin DeCaprio?<br><br>* Rose braves icy water to rescue her man. Leia braves Jabba the Hutt.<br><br>* There are always enough escape pods in Star Wars.<br><br>* If Luke were handcuffed to a pipe below decks in a sinking ship, he would use the Force to get the key.<br><br>* Nothing has the same sting as "I'd rather kiss a Wookie."<br><br>* Han is frozen in carbonite and turned into a wall ornament. Leo simply freezes.<br><br>* Han Solo would have steered clear of that stinking iceberg!<br><br>* We knew the boat was going to sink. But who could have anticipated Vader saying, "Luke... I am your father"?<br><br>* Storm-troopers blast big holes in stupid minor characters; everyone in Titanic was a minor character.<br><br>* When Star Wars was proclaimed coolest movie of all time by half of planet earth, George Lucas did not make a fool of himself at the Oscars.<br><br>* Titanic morals: 1) gamble, 2) cheat on your husband, 3) pose nude for pictures, 4) premarital sex is OK if you're infatuated, 5) let undesirables drown.<br>Star Wars morals: 1) fight evil, 2) do good, 3) respect all life even if it's ugly and slithers, 4) rescue princess, 5) save planet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two priests were going to Hawaii on vacation and decided that they would make this a real vacation by not wearing anything that would identify them as clergy.

(They were glad they had sunglasses, because their eyes were about to pop out of their heads.)

            <div class='col-md body'>Once there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans.<br>She loved them but unfortunately, they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her.<br><br>Then one day she met a man and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, "He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on."<br><br>She made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans.<br><br>Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the smell of the baked beans was more than she could stand.<br><br>Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans.<br><br>All the way home she putt-putted, and upon arriving home she felt<br>reasonably sure she could control it.<br><br>Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, "Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight."<br><br>He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the telephone.<br><br>The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go.<br><br>It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously.<br><br>Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes.<br><br>When the telephone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not.<br><br>At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!! There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a "Happy Birthday"!!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

Typical of most models, this Resusci-Annie was only a torso, to allow for storage in a carrying case.<br>The class went off in groups to practice. As instructed by the specialist, my buddy gently shook the doll and asked,<br><br>"Are you all right?"<br><br>He then put his ear over the mannequin's mouth to listen for breathing. Suddenly he turned to the instructor and exclaimed,<br><br>"She said she can't feel her legs!"<br><br>And my buddy have his weekends burnt for the rest of the course.<br>Some instructors just don't have a funny bone in them.</div>

The heart surgeon was waiting for the service manager to come take a look at his bike. The mechanic shouted across the garage,<br><br>"Hey Doc can I ask you a question?"<br><br>The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to the mechanic working on the motorcycle. The mechanic (suffering from a sudden illusion of grandeur) straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked,<br><br>"So Doc, look at this engine. I also can open hearts, take valves out, fix them, put in new parts and when I finish this will work just like a new one. So how come I get a pittance and you get the really big money, when you and I are doing basically the same work?"<br><br>The surgeon paused, smiled and leaned over, and whispered to the mechanic...<br><br>"Try doing it with the engine running!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little corporate humor<br>----------------------<br>I took some friends out to dinner last week, and I noticed a<br>spoon in the shirt pocket of our waiter as he handed us the<br>menus. It seemed a little  odd, but I dismissed it as a random<br>thing. Until our busboy came with  water &amp; tableware; he too,<br>sported a spoon in his breast pocket. I looked  around the room,<br>and all the waiters, waitresses, busboys, etc. had spoons in<br>their pockets.<br><br>When our waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask,<br>"Why the spoons?"<br><br>"Well," he explained, "our parent company recently hired some<br>Andersen Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and<br>after months  of statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons<br>drop spoons on the floor 73% more often than any other utensil; at a<br>frequency of 3 spoons per hour per workstation. By preparing all<br>our workers for this contingency in advance, we can cut our<br>trips to the kitchen down and save time...nearly 1.5 extra<br>man-hours per shift.<br>Just as he concluded, a "ch-ching" came from the table  behind<br>him,  and he quickly replaced a fallen spoon with the one from<br>his pocket.<br>"I'll grab another spoon the next time I'm in the kitchen<br>instead of making a special trip," he proudly  explained.<br>I was impressed.  "Thanks. I  had to ask."<br>"No problem," he answered, then he continued to take our<br>orders.<br><br>As the members of my dinner party took their turns, my eyes<br>darted back &amp; forth from each person ordering and my menu. That's when,<br>out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a thin, black thread<br>protruding from our waiter's fly. Again, I  dismissed it; yet I<br>had to scan the room and,  sure enough, there were other waiters<br>&amp; busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers.<br>My curiosity overrode discretion at this point, so before he<br>could leave I had to ask. "Excuse me, but...uh...why, or<br>what...about that string?"<br>"Oh, yeah" he began in a quieter tone. "Not many people are that<br>observant. That same efficiency group found we could save time<br>in the Men's room, too." "How's that, I asked?"<br>"You see, by tying a string to the end of our, eh. . ., selves,<br>we can pull it out at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby<br>eliminate the need to wash our hands, cutting time spent in the restroom<br>by over 93%!" "Oh, that makes sense," I said, but then thinking through<br>the process, I asked, "Hey, wait a minute.  If the string helps you<br>pull it out, how do you get it back in?"<br><br>"Well," he whispered, "I don't know about the other guys; but I<br>use the spoon in my pocket"!<br></div>
