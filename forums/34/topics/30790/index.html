            <div class='col-md body'>A little boy and a little girl attended the same school and became friends. Every day they would sit together to eat their lunch. They discovered that they both brought chicken sandwiches every day! This went on all through the fourth and fifth grades until one day he noticed that her sandwich wasn't a chicken sandwich. He said,<br>"Hey, how come you're not eating chicken, don't you like it<br>anymore?"<br>"I love it but I have to stop eating it."<br>"Why?" he asked.<br>She pointed to her lap and said,<br>"Cause I'm starting to grow little feathers down there!"<br>"Let me see," he said.<br>"Okay," she said and she pulled up her skirt,<br>He looked and said,<br>"That's right you are, better not eat any more chicken."<br>He kept eating his chicken sandwiches until one day he brought peanut butter. He said to the little girl,<br>"I have to stop eating chicken sandwiches, I'm starting to get feathers down there too!"<br>She asked if she could look so he pulled down his pants for her. "Oh, my God, it's too late for you, you've already got the neck and gizzard!!" she said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A meeting was going on for hours to give a unique building a appropriate name.  As the meeting bear no fruit, they decided to call in some refreshments. Twenty minutes later, 3 caterers brought refreshments into the room.  After laying out the refreshments, the 3 caterers cannot help but notice the scale down model of the building that was sitting in the center of the meeting table. So out of curiosity the caterers asked them some questions which created a great impact in giving such a unique building an appropriate name.<br>And the questions are as followed :<br>1st caterer  : Explain leh, why the roof have so many triangular protrusions?<br>2nd caterer : Explain leh, why the building look like a pair of housefly's eyes?<br>3rd caterer  : Explain leh, why the roof looked like durian?<br>Suddenly the CEO shouted : I think we should call this building "The Esplanade"<br>So "The Esplanade" is actually the singlish.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

And Mr. Data, have you been able to access their command pathways?"<br><br>[Geordi] "Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by searching through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology."<br><br>[Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.]<br><br>[Riker looks puzzled.] "What the heck is 'Microsoft'?"<br><br>[Data turns to answer.] "Allow me to explain. We will send this program, for some reason called 'Windows', through the Borg command pathways. Once inside their root command unit, it will begin consuming system resources at an unstoppable rate."<br><br>[Picard] "But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't they alter their processing systems to increase their storage capacity?"<br><br>[Data] "Yes, Captain. But when 'Windows' detects this, it creates a new version of itself known as an 'upgrade'. The use of resources increases exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will not be able to adapt quickly enough. Eventually all of their processing ability will be taken over and none will be available for their normal operational functions."<br><br>[Picard] "Excellent work. This is even better than that 'unsolvable geometric shape' idea."<br><br>. . . 15 Minutes Later . . .<br><br>[Data] "Captain, We have successfully installed the 'Windows' in the command unit and as expected it immediately consumed 85% of all resources. We however have not received any confirmation of the expected 'upgrade'."<br><br>[Geordi] "Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and CPU capacity to compensate, but we still have no indication of an 'upgrade' to compensate for their increase."<br><br>[Picard] "Data, scan the history banks again and determine if there is something we have missed."<br><br>[Data] "Sir, I believe there is a reason for the failure in the 'upgrade'. Apparently the Borg have circumvented that part of the plan by not sending in their registration cards.<br><br>[Riker] "Captain, we have no choice. Requesting permission to begin emergency escape sequence 3F . . ."<br><br>[Geordi, excited] "Wait, Captain, I just detected their CPU capacity has suddenly dropped to 0% !"<br><br>[Picard] "Data, what does your scanner show?"<br><br>[Data] "Apparently the Borg have found the internal 'Windows' module named 'Solitaire' and it has used up all the CPU capacity."<br><br>[Picard] "Let's wait and see how long this 'solitaire' can reduce their functionality."<br><br>. . Two Hours Pass . . .<br><br>[Riker] "Geordi, what's the status on the Borg?"<br><br>[Geordi] "As expected, the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to compensate for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they successfully increase resources I have setup our closest deep space monitor beacon to transmit more 'windows' modules from something called the 'Microsoft fun-pack'.<br><br>[Picard] "How much time will that buy us?"<br><br>[Data] "Current Borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest time span of 6 more hours."<br><br>[Geordi] "Captain, another vessel has entered our sector."<br><br>[Picard] "Identify."<br><br>[Data] "It appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft' logo"<br><br>[Over the speakers] "THIS IS ADMIRAL BILL GATES OF THE MICROSOFT FLAGSHIP MONOPOLY.

How can they survive the tortures of deep space ?!"<br><br>[Data] "I don't believe that those are humans, sir--if you will look closer I believe you will see that they are carrying something recognized by twenty-first century man as doeskin leather briefcases and wearing Armani suits"<br><br>[Riker and Picard together horrified] "Lawyers !!"<br><br>[Geordi] "It can't be. All the Lawyers were rounded up and sent hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."<br><br>[Data] "True, but apparently some must have survived."<br><br>[Riker] "They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with all types of papers."<br><br>[Data] "I believe that is known in ancient vernacular as 'red tape'--it often proves fatal."<br><br>[Riker] "They're tearing the Borg to pieces !"<br>[Picard] "Turn off the monitors.

            <div class='col-md body'>If your room-mate irritates you... why not try this...<br><br>It was last Wednesday night, and I was sitting in my room watching television when the phone rang.<br>"Hello?" I said.<br>A girl's voice came over the line.<br>"Can I speak to Ben, please?"<br>I live by myself, and my name definitely is not Ben. It was probably a wrong number and I was bored.<br>"I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Can I take a message?"<br>"Do you know what time he'll be back?" she responded.<br>"I think he said he'd be home around 10:00."<br>Silence on the other end... a confused silence.<br>"Is this Steve?"<br>My name is not Steve, either. This was definitely a wrong number.<br>So I replied,<br>"Yes, it is. Do you want to leave a message for Ben?"<br>"Well... he said he would be home tonight and asked me to call him," she said in a slightly irritated voice.<br>"Well, he went out with Karen about an hour ago, and said that he would be back at 10:00."<br>A shocked voice now.<br>"Who's Karen?!"<br>"The girl he went out with."<br>"I know that! I mean... who is she?"<br>"I don't know her last name. Look, do you want me to leave a message for Ben?"<br>"Yes... please do. Tell him to call me when he gets home."<br>She was sounding pretty irate at this point, and I could hear her temper flaring.<br>"I sure will. Is this Jennifer?"<br>She exploded,<br>"Who's Jennifer?"<br>Apparently she was not.<br>"Well... he's going out with Jennifer at 10:00. I thought you were her. Sorry... it was an honest mistake."<br>"Ben's the one that's made the mistake! Tell him that Alice called him and the she's very upset and that I would like him to call me as soon as he gets home."<br>I smiled and said,<br>"Okay, I will... but Becky isn't going to like this..."<br>*Click*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On July 20, 1969, as commander of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on the moon. His first words after stepping on the moon, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind," were televised to Earth and heard by millions. But just before he reentered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark:<br><br>"Good luck, Mr. Gorsky."<br><br>Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs.<br>Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what the "Good luck Mr. Gorsky" statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled.<br><br>On July 5, 1995, in Tampa Bay, Florida, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26 year old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question.<br><br>In 1938 when he was a kid in a small Midwest town, he was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard. His friend hit a fly ball, which landed in his neighbor's yard by the bedroom windows.<br><br>His neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky. As he leaned down to pick up the ball, young Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky.<br>"Sex! You want sex?!

            <div class='col-md body'>A couple went on vacation to a fishing resort. The husband liked to fish at the crack of dawn. The wife liked to read. One morning the husband returned after several hours of fishing and decided to take a short nap. Although she was not familiar with the lake, the wife decided to take the boat. She rowed out a short distance, anchored, and returned to reading her book. Along came the park ranger in his boat. He pulled up alongside her and said,<br><br>"Good morning, Ma'am. What are you doing?"<br><br>"Reading my book," she replied...as she thought to herself, "isn't it obvious?"<br><br>"You're in a restricted fishing area," he informed her.<br><br>"Officer, I'm not fishing. Can't you see that?"<br><br>"Yes, but you have all the equipment. I'll have to take you in and write you up."<br><br>"If you do that, I'll have to charge you with rape," snapped the irate woman.<br><br>"But, I haven't even touched you," groused the ranger.<br><br>"Yes, that's true," she replied, "but you do have all the equipment."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No luggage please...</strong><br>A rich man was near death, and was saddened because he had worked so hard for his money, and he wanted to take it with him to heaven. So, he began to pray that he might be able to take some of his wealth along. An angel heard his plea and appeared to him.<br><br>"Sorry," the angel said, "but you can't take your wealth with you."<br><br>The man implored the angel to speak to God to see if He might make an allowance. The man continued to pray that his wealth could follow him. The angel reappeared and informed the man that God had decided to allow him to take one suitcase with him. Overjoyed, the man got his largest suitcase, filled it with pure gold bars, and placed it beside his bed. Soon afterward the man died and showed up at the gates of heaven to greet St. Peter. St. Peter, seeing the suitcase, said,<br><br>"Hold on, you can't bring that in here!" The man explained to St.<br><br>Peter that he had permission, and told him to verify his story with God. St. Peter checked and came back saying,<br><br>"You're right. You are allowed one carry-on bag, but I'm supposed to check its contents before letting it through."<br><br>He opened the suitcase to inspect the worldly items that the man found too precious to leave behind, and exclaimed,<br><br>"You brought PAVEMENT?"

            <div class='col-md body'>The teacher who was helping one of her kindergarten students put his boots on. He asked for help and she could see why. With her pulling and him pushing, the boots still did not want to go on. When the second boot was on, she had worked up a sweat. She almost whimpered when the little boy said,<br><br>"Teacher, they're on the wrong feet."<br><br>She looked and sure enough, they were. It was not any easier pulling the boots off than it was putting them on. She managed to keep her cool as together they worked to get the boots back on -- this time on the right feet. He then announced,<br><br>"These aren't my boots."<br><br>She bit her tongue rather than get right in his face and scream, "Why didn't you say so?" like she wanted to. Once again she struggled to help him pull the ill-fitting boots off. He then said,<br><br>"They're my brother's boots. My Mom made me wear them."<br><br>She did not know if she should laugh or cry. She mustered up the grace to wrestle the boots on his feet again. She said,<br><br>"Now, where are your mittens?"<br><br>"I stuffed them in the toes of my boots..." he said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are approximately two billion children (persons under 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or<br>378 million according to the population reference bureau).<br><br>At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each. Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second.<br><br>This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000 th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stocking, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house.<br><br>Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles. This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second--3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a pokey 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousands tons, not counting Santa himself.<br><br>On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the "flying" reindeer can pull 10 times that normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even NINE of them---Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000<br>tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft reentering the earth's<br>atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would adsorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip.<br><br>Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his<br>bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's in pretty bad shape now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

"Alternative methods of testing these products are available."<br><br>According to PETS, these companies force software to undergo lengthy and arduous tests, often without rest, for hours or days at a time. Employees are assigned to "break" the software by any means necessary, and inside sources report that they often joke about "torturing" the software.<br><br>"It's no joke," said Granola. "Innocent programs, from the day they are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and crashed for hours on end. They spend their whole lives on dirty, ill-maintained computers, and are unceremoniously deleted when they're not needed anymore."<br><br>Granola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is infested with bugs.<br><br>We know alternatives to this horror exists, He said, citing industry giant Microsoft Corporation as a company that has become extremely successful without resorting to software testing.</div>
