            <div class='col-md body'>Rules that guys wished girls knew..........<br><br>1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.<br>2. Learn to work the toilet seat: if it's up, put it down.<br>3. Don't cut your hair. Ever.<br>4. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to<br>see<br>if he can find the perfect present!<br>5. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an<br>answer you don't want to hear.<br>6. Sometimes, he's not thinking about you. Live with it.<br>7. Don't ask him what he's thinking about unless you are<br>prepared<br>to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun formation,and<br>monster trucks.<br>8. Get rid of your cat. And no, it's not different, it's just<br>like ever other cat.<br>9. Dogs are better than ANY cats. Period.<br>10. Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of<br>the tides. Let it be.<br>11. Shopping is not a sport.<br>12. Anything you wear is fine. Really.<br>13. You have enough clothes.<br>14. You have too many shoes.<br>15. Crying is blackmail. Use it if you must, but don't expect us<br>to like it.<br>16. Your brother is an idiot, your ex-boyfriend is an idiot, and<br>your dad's way past idiot.<br>17. Ask for what you want. Subtle hints don't work.<br>18. No, he doesn't know what day it is. He never will. Mark<br>anniversaries on a calendar.<br>19. Pissing standing up is more difficult than peeing from point<br>blank range. We're bound to miss sometimes.<br>20. Most guys own two to three pairs of shoes - what makes you<br>think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would<br>look good with your dress?<br>21. Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers.<br>22. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a<br>doctor.<br>23. Your Mom doesn't have to be our best friend.<br>24. Foreign films are best left to foreigners.<br>25. Check your oil.<br>26. Don't give us 50 rules when 25 will do.<br>27. Don't fake it. We'd rather be ineffective than deceived.<br>28. It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the<br>quiz in Cosmo together.<br>29. Anything we said 6 or 8 months ago is inadmissible in an<br>argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days.<br>30. If you don't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't<br>expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br>31. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of<br>the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br>32. Let us ogle. If we don't look at other women, how can we<br>know how pretty you are?<br>33. Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come<br>out.<br>34. You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you<br>want it done - but not both.<br>35. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say<br>during commercials.<br>36. Christopher Columbus didn't need directions, and neither do<br>we.<br>37. Women wearing Wonderbras and low-cut blouses lose their<br>right to complain about having their boobs stared at.<br>38. Consider golf a mini-vacation from you. We need it, just<br>like you do.<br>39. Telling us that the models in the men's magazines are<br>airbrushed makes you look jealous and petty, and it's certainly<br>not going to deter us from reading the magazines.<br>40. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first<br>two months we were going out.<br>41. Anyone can buy condoms.<br></div>

"Let's have the first treatment<br>right now!"<br><br>"Very well," replies the specialist.<br>"Kindly go into the next room, drop your pants and lean over the<br>examining table. I'll be right in."<br><br>The mute does as instructed and the doctor sneaks in with a<br>broomstick, mallet, and jar of Vaseline. Greasing the broom<br>handle, he "sends it home" with a few deft swipes of the<br>mallet.<br><br>The mute jumps from the table, screaming,<br>"AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaa!!!"<br><br>"VERY good," smiles the doctor.<br>"Next Tuesday, we start with 'B'"</div>

Getting there, she stood<br>off to the side and watched. There was her husband dancing with<br>one girl after another and getting very physical with them.<br><br>She decided to see just how far he would go. She went up to him<br>and started dancing with him, got very close and whispered that<br>they should go outside. Going to one of the cars, they made<br>love. Prior to the midnight unmasking, she left and went home to<br>wait for her husband to return so she could confront him.<br><br>He arrived home about 1:00 a.m. and climbed into bed.<br>She sat up and asked 'Well, how was the party?'<br>He replied, 'It was no fun without you honey.'<br>She said, 'I don't believe you. I bet you had lots of fun!'<br>He replied, 'Really, Honey.  When I got to the party, some of<br>the guys and I got bored and we went downstairs and played poker<br>all night.<br><br>But you know, that guy I loaned my costume to had one hell of a<br>great time!'<br></div>

He forces himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins and a glass of water on the side table.<br><br>He sits down and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order. Everything spotless clean. And so's the rest of the house.<br><br>He takes the aspirins and notices a note on the table "Honey, breakfast is on the stove. Love you."

            <div class='col-md body'>Mistaken priorities?<br><br>I had just finished visiting a friend in the hospital and stopped by a burger drive-through for lunch to eat on the way back to work. I ordered the #1 combo (burger, fry, coke) for $4.29.<br><br>She said "that'll be $4.83, please drive forward."<br><br>"$4.83? For a $4.29 meal? That's 54 cents tax!? That can't be right," my mind raced.<br><br>Tax is 8 cents on the dollar in Huntsville, Alabama and for 4 dollars that would be 32 cents plus 1/3 (29) of 8 cents would be 35 cents max.<br><br>I'd heard of window workers overcharging drive through customers and skimming the money for themselves. Someone did just that to me at a Hardees couple of years ago.<br><br>I didn't have my calculator watch (I lost it a while back) so I got a pen and paper and did the long division since there were 2 cars ahead of me. Let's see ... 483/429 ... over 12 percent tax!?<br><br>When I got to the window I handed her a 5 and said "what's the sales tax in Huntsville?"<br><br>She didn't know.<br><br>I said "$4.83 for a $4.29 meal is 12 percent tax. That can't be right. Can I talk to the manager?"<br><br>She gave me my change and called the manager. So the manager comes over. I ask what the sales tax is in Huntsville, and she says 8 percent. I say that I just paid $4.83 for a $4.29 meal and that's over 12 percent sales tax.<br><br>She got a funny look on her face and said that maybe the computer had rung it up wrong or had charged me for the biggie size (biggie upgrade was 35 cents - which would be 4.64 plus tax which would put it over $5). She admitted it was supposed to be 4.63, and opened the drawer to give me my extra change.<br><br>"HA!" I thought to myself. "Six years engineering school has so heightened my mental mathematical adeptness that I can do percentages in my head and my superior intellect has foiled a feeble attempt by a drive-through worker to overcharge me!"<br><br>So what did this mathematical wizard do next? I took the twenty cents she handed me, proud of my staggering genius, and smugly drove off without my food.<br><br>This is what a smart alec is like.</div>
