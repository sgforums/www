            <div class='col-md body'>You're getting company in 30 minutes. Your house is a mess. WHAT WILL YOU DO?<br><br>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first session of Housekeeping Tips for Regular People. If you're a Martha Stewart type of housekeeper, this column is NOT for you.<br><br>However, for the rest of you, this is your chance to learn 15 Secret Shortcuts to Good Housekeeping that your mother never told you.<br><br>SECRET TIP 1: DOOR LOCKS<br>If a room clearly can't be whipped into shape in 30 days--much less 30 minutes--employ the Locked Door Method of cleaning. Tell anyone who tries to go in the room that the door is intentionally locked.<br>CAUTION: It is not advisable to use this tip for the bathroom.<br>Time: 2 seconds<br><br>SECRET TIP 2: SCOT-DUCT TAPE<br>No home should be without an ample supply. Not only is it handy for plumbing repairs, but it's a great way to hem drapes, tablecloths, clothes, just about anything. No muss, no fuss.<br>Time: 2-3 minutes<br><br>SECRET TIP 3: OVENS<br>If you think ovens are just for baking, think again. Ovens represent at least 9 cubic feet of hidden storage space, which means they're a great place to shove dirty dishes, dirty clothes, or just about anything you want to get out of sight when company's coming.<br>Time: 2 minutes<br><br>SECRET TIP 4: DISH WASHERS<br>Like Secret Tip 3, except bigger. CAUTION: Avoid hiding flammable objects here.<br>Time: 2.5 minutes<br><br>SECRET TIP 5: WASHING MACHINES &amp; FREEZERS<br>Like Secret Tip 4, except even bigger.<br>Time: 3 minutes<br><br>SECRET TIP 6: DUST RUFFLES<br>No bed should be without one. Devotees of Martha Stewart believe dust ruffles exist to keep dust out from under a bed or to help coordinate the colorful look of a bedroom. The rest of us know a dust ruffle's highest and best use is to hide whatever you've managed to shove under the bed. (Refer to Secret Tips 3, 4, 5.)<br>Time: 4 minutes<br><br>SECRET TIP 7: DUSTING<br>The 30-Minutes-To-A-Clean-House method says: Never dust under what you can dust around.<br>Time: 3 minutes<br><br>SECRET TIP 8: DISHES<br>Don't use them. Use plastic or paper and you won't have to.<br>Time: 1 minute<br><br>SECRET TIP 9: CLOTHES WASHING<br>This secret tip is brought to you by an inventive teenager. When this teen's mother went on a housekeeping strike for a month, the teen discovered you can extend the life of your underwear by two ...if you turn it wrong side out and, yes, rerun it.<br>CAUTION: This tip is recommended only for teens and those who don't care if they get in a accident.<br>Time: 3 seconds<br><br>SECRET TIP 10: IRONING<br>If an article of clothing doesn't require a full press and your hair does, a curling iron is the answer. In between curling your hair, use the hot wand to iron minor wrinkles out of your clothes. Yes, it really does work, or so I'm told, by other disciples of the 30-Minutes-To-A-Clean-House philosophy.<br>Time: 5 minutes (including curling your hair)<br><br>SECRET TIP 11: VACUUMING<br>Stick to the middle of the room, which is the only place people look. Don't bother vacuuming under furniture. It takes way too long and no one looks there anyway.<br>Time: 5 minutes, entire house; 2 minutes, living room only<br><br>SECRET TIP 12: LIGHTING<br>The key here is low, low, and lower. It's not only romantic, but bad lighting can hide a multitude of dirt.<br>Time: 10 seconds<br><br>SECRET TIP 13: BED MAKING<br>Get an old-fashioned waterbed. No one can tell if those things are made up or not, saving you, oh, hundreds of seconds over the course of a lifetime.<br>Time: 0<br><br>SECRET TIP 14: SHOWERS, TOILETS, AND SINKS<br>Forget one and two. Concentrate on three.<br>Time: 1 minute<br><br>SECRET TIP 15:<br>If you already knew at least 10 of these tips, don't even think about inviting a Martha Stewart type to your home.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You never know when a little conversational Latin might come in handy. Toward that end I've dug up a few Latin phrases for you to familiarize yourself with...<br><br>Non calor sed umor est qui nobis incommodat.<br>It's not the heat, it's the humidity.<br><br>Di! Ecce hora! Uxor mea me necabit!<br>God, look at the time!

            <div class='col-md body'>One of my friends works in the customer service call center of a Singtel Paging. He deals with the usual complaints regarding poor pager operation, as well as the occasional crank caller demanding to be paged less often, more often, or by more interesting people.<br>The best call came from a man who repeatedly complained that he was being paged by "Lucille." He was instructed that he would have to call her and tell her to stop paging him.<br>"She don't never leave no number, so I can't call her back," he said. After three such calls, someone thought to ask how he knew it was Lucille if she didn't leave a number.<br>"She leaves her name?" was the reply.<br>After establishing that the customer had a numeric-only pager, the light bulb came on.<br>"How does she spell her name?" the service rep asked.<br>He replied, "L-O-W C-E-L-L"</div>

Unless it's the one where you're at work in your underwear during a fire drill.<br><br>Always take time to stop and smell the roses... and sooner or later, you'll inhale a bee.<br><br>Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Just leave me alone!<br><br>If you don't like my driving, don't call anyone. Just take another road. That's why the highway department made so many of them.<br><br>If a motorist cuts you off, just turn the other cheek. Nothing gets the message across like a good mooning.<br><br>When I'm feeling down, I like to whistle. It makes the neighbor's dog run to the end of his chain and gag himself.<br><br>It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal the neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.<br><br>A handy telephone tip: Keep a small chalkboard near the phone. That way, when a salesman calls, you can hold the receiver up to it and run your fingernails across it until he hangs up.<br><br>Each day I try to enjoy something from each of the four food groups: the bonbon group, the salty-snack group, the caffeine group, and the whatever-the-thing-in-the-tinfoil-in-the-back-of-the-fridge" is group.<br><br>Into every life some rain must fall. Usually when your car windows are down.<br><br>Just remember... You gotta break some eggs to make a real mess on the neighbor's car!<br><br>This morning I woke up to the unmistakable scent of pigs in a blanket. That's the price you pay for letting the relatives stay over.<br><br>It's a small world. So you gotta use your elbows a lot.<br><br>Keep your nose to the grindstone and your shoulder to the wheel...it's cheaper than plastic surgery.<br><br>This land is your land. This land is my land. So stay on your land.<br><br>Love is like a roller coaster: when it's good you don't want to get off, and when it isn't... you can't wait to throw up.</div>

Doc said, "When your wife is at the sink doing dishes, stand fifteen feet behind her and ask her a question. If she doesn't respond, keep moving closer, asking the question until she hears you."<br>He went home and saw his wife preparing dinner. Standing fifteen feet behind her he said,<br>"What's for dinner, honey?"<br>Hearing no reply, he moved up to ten feet behind her and repeated the question. Still no reply, so he moved to five feet. Finally he stood directly behind her and said,<br>"Honey, what's for dinner tonight?"<br>She turned around and yelled in his face,<br>"For the fourth time, I SAID CHICKEN, you deaf old goat!"</div>

Ever. We can play back the error messages from here.<br><br>When an IT person says he/she is coming right over, go for coffee. It is nothing for us to remember 3,000 screen saver passwords.<br><br>When you call us to have your computer moved, be sure to leave it buried under half a ton of postcards, baby pictures, stuffed animals, dried flowers, bowling trophies and magazines. We do not have a life, and we find it deeply moving to catch a fleeting glimpse of yours.<br><br>When you call the help desk, state what you want, not what is keeping you from getting it. We do not need to know that you cannot get into your mail because your computer would not power on at all.<br><br>Do not put your phone extension in your e-mails to the help desk. We need to keep an eye on the address book performance.<br><br>When IT support sends you an e-mail with high importance, delete it at once. We are just testing the public groups.<br><br>When an IT person is eating lunch in his cube, walk right in and spill your guts right out. We exist only to serve.<br><br>When an IT person is having a smoke outside, ask him a computer question. The only reason why we smoke at all is to ferret out those staff who do not have e-mail or a telephone line.<br><br>Send urgent email all in uppercase. The mail server picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery.<br><br>When you call an IT person's direct line, press 5 to skip the bilingual greeting that says he/she is on leave for a week, record your message and wait exactly 24 hours before you send an email straight to the IT director because no one ever returned your call. You are entitled to common courtesy.<br><br>When the photocopier does not work, call computer support. There is electronics in it.<br><br>When you are getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home, call computer support. We can fix your line from here.<br><br>When something is wrong with your home PC, dump it on an IT person's chair with no name, no phone number and no description of the problem. We love a puzzle.<br><br>If you hate your mouse, get some other pointing device and discard the manual. We know all the keyboard accelerators.</div>

We love a good argument.<br><br>When you get a message about insufficient disk space, delete everything in the Windows directory. It is nothing but trouble anyway.<br><br>When you get a message about a hard disk controller failure, and then you reboot and it looks okay, do not call IT support. We would much rather troubleshoot it when it is dead as a doornail.<br><br>When you have an IT person on the phone walking you through changing a setting, read the paper. We do not actually mean for you to do anything; we just love to hear ourselves talk.<br><br>When an IT person tells you that he will be there shortly, reply in scathing tone of voice: "And just how many weeks do you mean by shortly?" That will get us going.<br><br>If you have a 14-inch monitor that says VGA on it, set the display to true colour, 1024 x 768. You will never again have to worry about people reading confidential files over your shoulder.<br><br>When we offer training on the upcoming OS upgrade, do not bother. We will be there to hold your hand after it is done.<br><br>When the printer would not print, re-send the job at least 20 times. Print jobs frequently get sucked into black holes.<br><br>When the printer still would not print after 20 tries, send the job to all 68 printers in the company. One of them is bound to work.<br><br>Do not learn the proper name for anything technical. We know exactly what you mean by "my thingy's outta whack."<br><br>Do not use on-line help. On-line help is for wimps.<br><br>If you are taking night classes in computer science, feel free to go around and update the network drivers for your all your co-workers.

We function better when slightly dizzy.<br><br>Do not ever thank us. We are getting paid for this.<br><br>When an IT person asks you whether you have installed any new software on this computer, lie. It is nobody's business what you have got on your computer.<br><br>When an IT person finds the porn shortcuts in your Recycle Bin, tell them you have never seen those before. We could not tell a lie if it kicked us in the face.<br><br>If you have NT, feel free to change the local administrator's password and promptly forget it. We like installing NT.<br><br>If the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed picture of your dog, lift the computer and stuff the cable under it. Mouse cables were designed to have 15 kilograms of computer sitting on top of them.<br><br>If the space bar on your keyboard does not work, blame it on the mail upgrade. Keyboards are actually very happy with half a pound of bread crumbs, staples and nail clippings in them.<br><br>When you receive the new Yanni CD for your birthday, shove it into any slot on the front of your computer. We like getting physical with 5.25 floppy drives.<br><br>When you get a message saying "Are you sure?" click on that Yes button as fast as you can. Heck, if you were not sure, you would not be doing it, would you?<br><br>When you find an IT person on the phone with his bank, sit uninvited on the corner of his desk and stare at him until he hangs up. We do not have any money to speak of anyway.<br><br>Feel perfectly free to say things like "I don't know nothing about that computer nonsense." We do not mind at all hearing our area of professional expertise referred to as nonsense.<br><br>When you need to change the toner cartridge, call IT support. Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely complex task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it be performed only by a professional engineer with a master's degree in nuclear physics.<br><br>When you have a lock to pick on an old file cabinet, call IT support. We love to hack.<br><br>When something is the matter with your computer, ask your secretary to call the help desk. We enjoy the challenge of having to deal with a third party who does not know anything about the problem.<br><br>When you receive a 30 MB movie file, send it to everyone as a mail attachment. We got lots of disk space on that mail server.<br><br>Do not even think of breaking large print jobs down into smaller chunks. Somebody else might get a chance to squeeze a memo into the queue.<br><br>When the Finance folks are printing a 100-page spreadsheet on the LaserJet, send your black and white print job to the colour printer. We get the black toner for free.<br><br>When you lose your car keys, send an email to the entire department. People out in Wagga Wagga land like to keep abreast of what is going on.<br><br>When you bump into an IT person at the grocery store on a Saturday, ask a computer question. We do weekends.<br><br>Do not bother to tell us when you move computers around on your own. Computer names are just a cosmetic feature in NT 4.0; they would not be doing anything useful until the next major release.<br><br>If you need to buy a computer for your daughter in college, feel free to pick our brains while we're eating. We're good at talking shop with mouths full.<br><br>If your son is a student in computer science, have him come in on the weekends and do his projects on your office computer. We will be there for you when his illegal copy of Visual Basic 6.0 makes your Access 95 database flip out.<br><br>When you bring your own personal home PC for repair at the office, leave the documentation at home. We will find the jumper settings on the Internet.<br><br>We are aware of that problem with computers just sitting there and not doing anything. We are confident that with the next service pack they will be able to dance the jig.<br><br>The correct location to store important files is the Recycle Bin. It is just like a real office, where you keep your tax receipts in the blue can under your desk.<br><br>If you miss Windows 3.1, find the line that goes shell=explorer.exe in your SYSTEM.INI file and replace it with shell=progman.exe. It makes troubleshooting infinitely easier when we ask you whether you have a Start button at the bottom of your screen and you truthfully answer us that you do not.<br><br>If you hate PC's, get on the Internet and download one of those desktop enhancements that make your computer look just like a Mac, down to the sad faces replacing verbose error messages. We find it refreshing to troubleshoot the nuances in that sad little face instead of some cold forbidding hexadecimal integer.<br><br>We do not really believe that you are a bunch of ungrateful twits. It hurts our feelings that you could even think such a thing. We wish to express our deepest gratitude to the hundreds of clueless losers portrayed herein, without whom none of this could have been remotely possible.<br><br>Lastly...<br><br>Keep it crashing!<br>PS... all of the above does not apply until your IT support is a CHK.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jews Leaving Rome<br><br>About a century or so ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave Rome. Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community. So the Pope made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave.<br><br>The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked a middle aged man named Moishe to represent them. Moishe asked for one addition to the debate. To make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed.<br><br>The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, "I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay."<br><br>An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what had happened. The Pope said, "First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He<br>had an answer for everything. What could I do?"<br><br>Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. "What happened?" they asked. "Well," said Moishe, "First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here."<br><br>"Yes, yes,.. and then???" asked the crowd.<br><br>"I don't know," said Moishe, "He took out his lunch, and I took out mine."<br><br>============================================================<br><br>Probably the saddest thing you'll ever see is a mosquito sucking on a mummy.<br>- Jack Handey<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Little Alien Sex<br><br>A Martian couple and an Earthling couple have met and are talking about all sorts of things. Finally, the subject of sex comes up.<br><br>"Just how do you guys do it?" asked the Earthling.<br><br>"Pretty much the way you do," responded the Martian.<br><br>Discussion ensues and finally the couples decide to swap partners for the night and experience one another. The female Earthling and the male Martian go off to a bedroom where the Martian strips. He's got only a teeny, weeny member; very short and very narrow.<br><br>"What can you do with THAT!?" exclaims the woman.<br><br>"Why?" he asked, "What's the matter?"<br><br>"Well," she replied, "it's nowhere near long enough. It'll never reach!"<br><br>"No problem," he said and proceeded to slap his forehead with his palm. With each slap of his forehead, his member grew until it was quite impressively long. "Well," she said. "That's quite impressive, but it's still pretty narrow."<br><br>"No problem," he said again and started pulling his ears. With each pull his member grew wider and wider until the entire measurement was extremely exciting to the woman.<br><br>"Wow!" she exclaimed as they fell into bed and made mad, passionate love. The next day the couples rejoined their normal partners and went off together.<br><br>As they walked along the Earthling male said, "Well, was it any good?"<br><br>"I hate to say it," she said, "but it was really wonderful. How about you?"<br><br>"Well," he said, "It was the weirdest thing. She kept slapping me on the forehead and pulling my ears all night."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his<br>teacher picked him to answer a question, "Johnny, if there were<br>five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun,<br>how many would be left?"<br><br>"None," replied Johnny, "cause the rest would fly away."<br><br>"Well, the answer is four," said the teacher, "but I like the<br>way you're thinking."<br><br>Little Johnny says, "I have a question for you. If there were<br>three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one was licking<br>her cone, the second was biting her cone and the third was<br>sucking her cone, which one is married?"<br><br>"Well," said the teacher nervously, "I guess the one sucking the<br>cone."<br><br>"No," said Little Johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her<br>finger, but I like the way you're thinking."<br></div>
