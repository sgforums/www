Your weak point is your hot temper.<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Your Love</span> </strong><br>You are willing to start off in one-sided love affairs because you strongly believe that you will eventually win his/her heart.

Many can win your heart at once, but not for long. This is why you hardly win a decent relationship.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Is your birthday day 16 of the month? </span><br><span style="color: blue;">Your Life </span></strong><br>You always follow the good and the right instead of listening to your heart.

People may find you childish and not very attractive in that sense.<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Your Love  </span></strong><br>Your fun-loving character attracts opposite sex. Many of those are great.You often find yourself trapped among a few great guys while you have to choose only one.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Is your birthday day 18 of the month?</span><br><span style="color: blue;">Your Life </span></strong><br>At first glance, people think you are quiet type of person. Actually you are cheerful, but conditionally. You will show your joyful character only in good mood. One the other hand, when you are moody, no one would dare to be around. Because of your emotion fluctuation and frank character, some find you hard to be around.<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Your Love</span>  </strong><br>You hardly show your feeling towards opposite sex no matter how much you like him/her. Your partner also has similar character so your love affairs often take quite a while to flourish. Time tells  it all.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; To find your love attitude number, add your birthmonth and your<br>&gt; birthdate together.<br>&gt; Keep reducing it until it's a single digit.<br>&gt; Example:<br>&gt; January 28<br>&gt; 1+28 = 29<br>&gt; 2+9 = 11<br>&gt; 1+1 = 2;<br>&gt; your love attitude number is 2.<br>&gt; Read on below to find out what your love style is supposed to be. If<br>&gt; your number is:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One -<br>&gt; You are charming imaginative and independent. Usually your style is ahead<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; others; you know what's in and what's way out. Sometimes you're a little<br>&gt; too<br>&gt; aggressive when it comes to pursuing a love interest. You have a way of<br>&gt; drawing attention wherever you go, and this dramatic flair usually<br>&gt; attracts<br>&gt; the strongest guys. Your competitive nature either draws or repels<br>&gt; guys/gals...but those who can't handle your power aren't your type<br>anyway.<br>&gt; At times you can be possessive, manipulating and demanding with your<br>&gt; friends<br>&gt; and in love relationships. You like guys/gals with lots of<br>intelligence...<br>&gt; and knock-'em-dead good looks don't hurt either.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Two -<br>&gt; Your love nature is sentimental, romantic and kind. Your easygoing, mild<br>&gt; manner allows almost everyone to feel very comfortable with you -<br>&gt; especially<br>&gt; shy guys/gals. Your modesty and tact enable you to get along easily with<br>&gt; both sexes. You are a natural peacemaker and can be very persuasive with<br>&gt; words, which helps you to gain the respect of your classmates. You can<br>&gt; also<br>&gt; be too sensitive at times, and your greatest drawback is a lack of<br>&gt; confidence to stand up for yourself in conflict. Your favorite type of<br>guy<br>&gt; is a gentle, affectionate one who is also strong and playful. A great<br>&gt; sense<br>&gt; of humor is also a must. A guy/gal who loves to listen to music and dance<br>&gt; should rank high on your list of favorites,too.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Three -<br>&gt; You are imaginative, fun-loving, thrill-seeking and expressive. You're so<br>&gt; charming that you attract many friends and you are almost never lacking<br>&gt; guys/gals. In your earlier years, you may be totally shy and<br>&gt; self-conscious,<br>&gt; but you'll lose those qualities in the high-school years. You can be sort<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; vain or even a bit of a show-off when you get caught up in exciting<br>events<br>&gt; in your life, but you usually redeem yourself in some playful way before<br>&gt; you<br>&gt; lose a friend. Jealousy shows its ugly head sometimes, but generally you<br>&gt; aren't affected by it unless your guy/gal tries to provoke it. In the<br>&gt; guy/gal department, you prefer the athletic or artistic types. You're in<br>&gt; absolute heaven when you find both of those qualities in the same<br>guy/gal.<br>&gt; When you're looking for love, a guy/gal who can make you laugh scores<br>&gt; points, big time!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Four -<br>&gt; You tend to be loyal, dedicated and good hearted. You're one of the most<br>&gt; diligent students when you really try, and you tend to make your<br>&gt; schoolwork<br>&gt; a priority. You also express those same qualities in your love<br>&gt; relationship.<br>&gt; No one is more faithful and trusting than you. In fact, those tendencies<br>&gt; can<br>&gt; be a little negative in your romantic life. You may sometimes hang on too<br>&gt; long to a guy/gal who doesn't give you the respect and love you deserve.<br>&gt; You<br>&gt; can be stubborn and a bit of a troublemaker if the mood strikes you but<br>&gt; you<br>&gt; can usually dig yourself out of that hole just in time to stay out of<br>&gt; major<br>&gt; trouble. You usually fall for extremes when choosing a love mate - he/she<br>&gt; may be a show-off or a teacher's pet. Whatever the type, it helps if<br>&gt; he/she<br>&gt; is good-looking, too, but that's not a major consideration for you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Five -<br>&gt; Your love attitude is adventurous, charismatic and spontaneous. you're<br>&gt; creative and adaptable, and you can come up with the most exciting and<br>&gt; sometimes daring things to do. Your quick intelligence and way with words<br>&gt; help get you out of the problems that come with being flirtatious and<br>&gt; playing hard to get. You need to pay close attention to your personal<br>&gt; values<br>&gt; because you love to try new and different things and easily go along with<br>&gt; the crowd and the consequences can put extra strain on your relationship<br>&gt; with a boy/girl. You like guys/gals who have great bodies and good looks,<br>&gt; along with exceptional brain and high grades. It helps if they are highly<br>&gt; athletic or involved in as many activities as you, otherwise you might<br>get<br>&gt; bored! Variety is the key to your love attitude number.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Six -<br>&gt; You are warm, loving, devoted and affectionate. Your outgoing, thoughtful<br>&gt; nature attracts many girlfriends/boyfriends to you, and usually some of<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; nicest guys/gals too. Because of your need to care, you can end up in a<br>&gt; relationship that requires too much care-taking to make it balanced.<br>Since<br>&gt; home and family play important roles in your life, you are unlikely to be<br>&gt; attracted to guys/gals who your parents wouldn't like. Sometimes you have<br>&gt; a<br>&gt; slight jealous streak... but it doesn't last long. Some people with this<br>&gt; love attitude number are prone to making harsh judgements of others,<br>&gt; especially when others don't share your set of values. You are especially<br>&gt; attracted to the good looking, boy/girl-next-door type who is smart as<br>&gt; well<br>&gt; as a gentle man/woman.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Seven -<br>&gt; Your love nature is thoughtful, poetic, mystical and mysterious. A few<br>&gt; people with love attitude number seven are class clowns, and they usually<br>&gt; attract guys/gals who like to be given a hard time. But most of you are<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; quiet, reserved types who dislike calling attention to yourself. Your<br>type<br>&gt; generally attracts guys who feel the same way you do. Your refined,<br>&gt; independent and secretive nature is very alluring to certain guys/gals.<br>At<br>&gt; times you can also be somewhat fault-finding and a little demanding in<br>&gt; your<br>&gt; love relationship and with friends. You are mostly attracted to guys/gals<br>&gt; who aren't like all the rest; a loner easily attracts you. And, if he/she<br>&gt; reads a lot and enjoys learning, he/she is especially perfect for you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Eight -<br>&gt; Your love attitude is confident, powerful and exciting. This number<br>&gt; usually<br>&gt; makes for a very conscientious student, someone who puts schoolwork ahead<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; a social life. However, you also enjoy being a leader among<br>yourclassmates<br>&gt; and will seek offices or other positions that enable you to use your<br>&gt; leadership skills. Because of this, you can be somewhat intimidating to<br>&gt; certain guys/gals. You can also be a little too intense, bossy and<br>jealous<br>&gt; for your own good. Your love match is definitely someone who is smart,<br>&gt; handsome and popular. You like quality over quantity and will usually<br>wait<br>&gt; until the guy/gal with the best attributes comes along.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Nine -<br>&gt; You have a sophisticated attitude that is also generous and considerate.<br>&gt; Your responsible, charitable nature may find you attracting guys/gals who<br>&gt; want someone to confide in or who makes them feel secure. At a very young<br>&gt; age, you developed the type of personality that makes others feel safe<br>and<br>&gt; protected. You will carry these qualities into your adult years and, down<br>&gt; the road, you'll be a good mom/dad because of them. On the negative side,<br>&gt; you can be argumentative and overly emotional, and you usually possess a<br>&gt; temper that can make everyone run for cover. You like the kind of guy/gal<br>&gt; who is responsible and impeccably dressed and has gorgeous eyes and a<br>&gt; great<br>&gt; body. Charm, wit and (of course) brilliance could make him the perfect<br>&gt; guy/gal for you.<br></div>
