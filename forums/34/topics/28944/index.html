            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore has potential to be exporter of solar energy technology</strong><br><br>Singapore may not have oil - but it has sunshine, and lots of it.<br>And solar energy experts at an energy efficiency seminar say there's potential for Singapore to develop and sell this technology.<br><br>"Singapore has twice the potential for solar energy, compared to Germany, a leader in the field." Dr Volkhard Reichmann, Head of Department of Energy, Coal and Mining at the Economic Affairs Ministry in Germany, said, "Also you have the big buildings, you can use photovoltaic energy on the roof but also on in the facade."<br><br>For example, there's an ongoing pilot project to use solar energy to light common areas in HDB blocks.<br><br>But solar energy is still costly.<br><br>And Dr Reichmann acknowledged that <strong>governments still have to sponsor the technology through subsidies or loans</strong>.<br><br>In Germany, for instance, utilities companies pay households which help to contribute solar energy to the power grid 50 Euro cents or 80 Singapore cents per kilowatt hour.<br><br>Mr Christophe Inglin, Managing Director of Shell Solar Pte Ltd, said,<br>"At today's prices, one could argue that it doesn't compete against the power stations so it does need financial support. But we see from examples in countries like Japan, US or Western Europe, that support doesn't cost the government very much and it is contributing to a vast expansion of the solar power market which in turn is driving down prices, as you get the economies of scale."<br><br>In Singapore, the Energy Authority Market has estimated that the cost of solar photovoltic cells to be between $ 0.25 to $0.38 per kilowatt hour. And this is considerably higher than Power Supply's current $ 0.1651 per kilowatt hour. EMA adds that solar energy is viable, if consumers are prepared to pay the higher price. Still, Singapore is already looking at implementing it.<br><br>Dr Balaji Sadasivan, Minister of State for Health and the Environment, said,<br>"We are working with several private and public sector partners to explore and develop test-bedding opportunities. Solar thermal energy for hot water requirements is already implemented in several hotels and even private homes. The major challenge is to harness solar energy for other applications, such as electricity generation - which is affordable, with a high energy yield. When that happens, Singapore can reap the benefits.<br><br>"Singapore itself, "Mr Inglin added, "with its capacity doesn't need additional generating capacity. Asia Pacific generally certainly does.<br>There's a lot of region that's remote from the grid and where the grid is very expensive to install because you don't have a dense urban population like Singapore, so the advantage for Singapore in developing the know-how and technology is to export this as a business in the region."<br><br><strong>Does the current economy situation makes it viable to invest in other means of energy or water source? Or should national interest as in self-reliance comes first and foremost?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE -- Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook for Singapore port operator PSA Corp from stable to negative late on Tuesday, reflecting concerns about increased competition and the poor global trading environment.<br><br>But Moody's affirmed PSA's 'Aa1' long-term senior unsecured foreign currency debt rating.<br><br>'Moody's is particularly concerned with the pressure facing shipping companies with their focus on costs as well as competition from neighbouring ports which will impose increasing pressure on PSA's operating margin,' the statement said.<br><br>'In addition, the port operations are also vulnerable to the overall global trading environment.'<br><br>PSA is facing tougher competition from the Port of Tanjung Pelepas in neighbouring Malaysia which has snared two big clients over the past two years -- Danish line Maersk and Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp.<br><br>Lower cargo volumes due to the global economic slowdown could also effect earnings.<br><br>But despite the growing pressures and the recent shutdown of US west coast ports, PSA said last month it was on track to achieve its goal of handling 17 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) at its Singapore operations by the end of this year.<br><br>Moody's said it decided to affirm PSA's Aa1 rating to reflect its belief that the Singapore firm 'remains a global leader in container transshipment services in view of its strategic location and its size and efficiencies'.<br><br>Moody's also said it considered the rising revenue contributions of PSA's overseas investments when producing its ratings.<br><br>PSA said last month its total throughput, or output, rose 28 per cent on the year to 2.18 million TEUs.<br><br>Its overseas terminals handled 760,000 TEUs in October, up 122 per cent. -- AFP<br><br><strong>Our neighbouring ports effeciency will soon be up to par with ours, it is a matter of time.

This could have been a great opportunity for the Republic to showcase its many wonderful attributes.<br><br>With the world watching, Singapore could show that we have indeed come a long way.<br><br>Instead, we chose to show the world PCK! What image is it that we want to project?<br><br>Sure, PCK is a popular TV character here, but do we want the rest of the world to think we are all just like PCK?<br><br>Do we really want to present an illiterate, odd-looking man in yellow boots as our representative?<br><br>Every other country has taken the opportunity to show a slice of their culture, giving viewers an interesting, though brief, insight that makes them want to visit that country.<br><br>So what is the message we are sending out through our new 'international ambassador' Gurmit Singh, aka PCK?<br><br>The Government has worked hard to have Singaporeans speak good English, to present Singaporeans as sophisticated, well-spoken indivi-duals.<br><br>Won't all this be undone? Won't the only memorable image of Singaporeans retained by viewers be that of the Singlish-speaking PCK?<br><br>Indeed, it promises to be a tacky effort that will embarrass English-speaking Singaporeans.<br>OH WEE TONG<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>WHEN the people behind The Amazing Race 3 asked for a 'local icon' for the detour, they were given PCK!<br><br>Come on, Singapore Tourism Board and MediaCorp TV, there are better local icons to represent our tiny island than a man in yellow boots.<br><br>Why wasn't our own Ah Meng from Singapore Zoo chosen?
