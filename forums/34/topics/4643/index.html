To say of Hitler, to say of the criminal, that he did not choose to be bad but was a victim if his upbringing is to make all morality, all discussion of right and wrong, impossible. It leaves unanswered the question of why people in similar circumstances did not all become Hitlers.

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=Indigo]Once upon a time there was an island where all the feelings lived; Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all the others, including Love.<br><br>One day it was announced to all of the feelings that the island was going to sink to the bottom of the ocean.

            <div class='col-md body'>Twenty years ago, I drove a cab for a living.<br><br>When I arrived at 2:30 a.m., the building was dark except for a single light in a ground floor window. Under these circumstances, many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a minute, then drive away. But, I had seen too many impoverished people who depended on taxis as their only means of transportation.<br><br>Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door.<br><br>This passenger might be someone who needs my assistance, I reasoned to myself.<br>So I walked to the door and knocked. "Just a minute", answered a frail, elderly voice.<br><br>I could hear something being dragged across the floor.<br>After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 80's stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940s movie.<br><br>By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years.<br><br>All the furniture was covered with sheets.<br>There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on<br>the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with<br>photos and glassware.<br><br>"Would you carry my bag out to the car?" she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman.<br>She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness.<br><br>"It's nothing", I told her. "I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated".<br><br>"Oh, you're such a good boy",  she said.<br><br>When we got in the cab, she gave me an address, then asked,"Could you drive through downtown?"<br><br>"It's not the shortest way," I answered quickly.<br>"Oh, I don't mind," she said!<br>"I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice".<br><br>I looked in the rearview mirror. Her eyes were glistening.<br><br>"I don't have any family  left," she continued. "The doctor says I<br>don't have very long."<br>I quietly reached over and shut off the meter. "What route would<br>you like me to take?" I asked.<br><br>For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me<br>the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator.<br><br>We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds.<br><br>She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had<br>once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.<br>Sometimes she'd ask me to slow  in front of a particular building<br>or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.<br><br>As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly<br>said, "I'm tired. Let's go now."<br><br>We drove in silence to the address she had given me.<br><br>It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.<br><br>Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They<br>were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her.<br><br>I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.<br>"How much do I owe you?" she asked, reaching into her purse.<br><br>"Nothing," I said.<br><br>"You have to make a living,"  she answered.<br>"There are other passengers,"  I responded.<br>Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly.<br><br>"You gave an old woman a little moment of joy," she said. "Thank you."<br><br>I squeezed her hand, then walked into the dim morning light.<br>Behind me, a door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.<br><br>I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly,<br>lost in thought. For the rest of that day, I could hardly talk.<br><br>What if that woman had gotten an angry driver, or one who was<br>impatient to end his shift?<br>What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then<br>driven away?<br>On a quick review, I don't think that I have done anything more<br>important in my life.<br>We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around greatmoments.<br><br>But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in<br>what others may consider a small one.<br><br>PEOPLE MAY NOT REMEMBER<br>EXACTLY WHAT 'YOU DID, OR WHAT YOU SAID,<br><br>BUT THEY WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER<br>HOW YOU MADE THEM FEEL.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>-a very good reminder.<br><br>Something for us to ponder as we live each day ...<br><br>" <strong><span style="color: blue;">BALANCE OF LIFE</span> </strong>", by Catherine Pulsifer<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Mary and Susan were friends for years. They grew up together and attended the same schools. They were now both in their 40's, and both had great careers. They both had a similar upbringing - same education, same family values, similar support and financial position. But there was one main difference.  Mary never seemed to have enough time. She watched her life long friend Susan.  She had similar responsibilities and interests. Susan had a career, she had three children, she had her hobbies, one of which included golf. Over lunch, Susan was telling Mary about the golf game that she played last  weekend.<br><br>"Susan, where do you find the time to play golf?" asked Mary. "I never seem to have the time, now with the children older and doing there own thing I thought I would have time to play golf like we did when we were in college."<br><br>Susan looked at Mary and laughed, "Mary, we both have the same hours in a day. You do have the time to play golf!"<br><br>With a sigh Mary replied, "That's easy for you to say. I never seem to have time. My work takes so much of my time. I am in the office at 7:30, I leave at 6:30 in the evening. By the time I get home and have dinner, it is 8:00!  And, then I usually have a briefcase full of work. The weekends are full of more work. Just to keep up, I have to put in the hours. You know what it is like!"<br><br>"Of course, I know what it is like," Mary said.  "But what would happen tomorrow if you got sick? Who would do the work?"<br><br>"Sick. Who has time to get sick! exclaimed Mary. "But if I did get sick, someone else would do the work, I suppose."<br><br>"You know something, Mary, I used to be like you. I worked night and day and of course on weekends. When I got home I was exhausted but I would push myself and read my children a bedtime story. By the time I went to bed, I would be more than exhausted. The boss I had was very demanding. She was there early in the morning, late at night, and she always worked weekends. I felt I had to do the same - I needed the job to help support my family - just as you did. But then I had a change of bosses. The man I worked for was older and much wiser, I might add! Of course, I continued to work the hours I had been working. One day he came to my desk and passed me a card that had a quote on it which said, 'What I do today is important, because I will never have today again' - then he left.<br><br>I sat there stunned. I suddenly thought of what was important to me. While my work was important, I realized my children were more important. I also realized that time for me was important. It was 4:30, the official closing time of the office. I straightened my desk, felt a twinge of guilt about leaving, but I forced myself to leave. I was home by 5:00. My children and husband were surprised. I had a wonderful evening. It was not a chore to read that bedtime story that evening."<br><br>Mary was looking at her friend thoughtfully and then questioned Susan about the work she had left on her desk. Susan replied, "I never thought this possible, but I actually accomplished more the next day then I had in weeks. As I was  leaving the next day I stopped at my new boss's office and thanked him for the quote. He told me a story about advice his dad had given him many years ago when he was working night and day. He referred to it as 'Balance of Life'. His dad told him to keep balance in his work, in his family life and in time for himself. He explained to me, while all aspects of our  life are important, without a balance, you become addicted and like all addictions you lose -<br><br>- no balance with your family - you lose them<br>- no balance with your work - you lose your  perspective and you actually lose focus on the important aspects of your  job.<br>- no balance with yourself - you forget who you are and when you retire you have nothing! Or worse than that, if you lose your job through a company sale or downsizing you lose your identity.<br><br>He went on to tell me that who we are is NOT what we do to make a living. Who we are is a balance of our family, our work, ourselves! It truly was the best advice I ever received."<br><br>Mary took a drink of her tea and tearfully looked at her friend, "But I would never get my work done if I left at 4:30!"<br><br>Susan looked thoughtfully at her, "When you go to work on Monday, look at what you have on your desk. Make a list of everything you have to get done and beside that list write the impact of<br>not doing it. Then focus only on the top three items that have the most impact. Do that everyday for a week. At first, you will find it difficult to leave. But, after awhile, you will find that you will have more energy, and you will be more focused in your work because you have BALANCE! There are times when we have to lose balance - a special project at work, or a family matter at home - but consciously focusing on balance keeps everything in check."<br><br>Mary smiled at her friend, "Thanks for talking with me. We have been friends for so long. Thank heavens I have balance with your  friendship! You have convinced me. I will leave the work in my briefcase this weekend. On Monday, I will make the list first thing. Perhaps next weekend, I will have the time to go golfing with you!"<br><br>"Balance of Life" - important for us ALL!</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: orange;">A STORY THAT WARMS YR HEART!!!</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Her Name Was Mrs. Thompson<br><br>As she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of school, she told the children a lie. Like most teachers, she looked at her students and said that she loved them all the same. But that was impossible, because there in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.<br><br>Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn't play well with the other children, that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath. And Teddy could be unpleasant. It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X's and then putting a big "F" at the top of his papers.<br><br>At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review each child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last. However, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise.<br><br>Teddy's first grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners...he is a joy to be around."<br><br>His second grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is an excellent student, well liked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle."<br><br>His third grade teacher wrote, "His mother's death had been hard on him.<br><br>He tries to do his best, but his father doesn't show much interest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't taken."<br><br>Teddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't show much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and he sometimes sleeps in class".<br><br>By now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents, wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddy's. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper<br>that he got from a grocery bag. Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle that was one quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist.<br><br>Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say,"Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to." After the children left she cried for at least an hour. On that very day, she quit teaching reading, and writing, and arithmetic. Instead, she began to teach<br>children.<br><br>Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and, despite her lie that she would love all the children the same, Teddy became one of her "teacher's pets."<br><br>A year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.<br><br>Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.<br><br>Four years after that, she got another letter, saying that while things had been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with it, and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. He assured Mrs. Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole life.<br><br>Then four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he explained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a little further. The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer -- the letter was<br>signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD.<br><br>The story doesn't end there. You see, there was yet another letter that spring. Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be married. He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom.  Of course, Mrs. Thompson did.<br><br>And guess what? She wore that bracelet, the one with several rhinestones missing. And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together.<br><br>They hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs.Thompson's ear, "Thank you Mrs. Thompson for believing in me. Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference."<br><br>Mrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back. She said, "Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you."</span><br>Please remember that wherever you go, and whatever you do, you will have the opportunity to touch and/or change a person's outlook. Please try to do it in a positive way.<br><br>"Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings stop remembering how to fly."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Growing Up... Or Growing Old ?<br>The first day of school our professor introduced himself and<br>challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know.<br>I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady<br>beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being.<br>She said, "Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old.<br>Can I give you a hug?"<br>I laughed and enthusiastically responded, "Of course you may!" and she gave me a giant squeeze.<br>Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?" I asked. She jokingly replied, "I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel."<br>No seriously," I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to<br>be taking on this challenge at her age.<br>I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting<br>one!" she told me.<br>After class we walked to the student union building and shared a<br>chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends.<br>Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop.<br>I was always mesmerized listening to this "time machine" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me.<br>Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up.<br>At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football<br>banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us.<br>She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to<br>deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor.<br>Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said "I'm sorry I'm so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know."<br><br>As we laughed she cleared her throat and began:<br>"We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing.<br>There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and<br>achieving success.<br>You have to laugh and find humor everyday.<br>You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die.<br>We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it!<br>There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability.<br>The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change.<br>Have no regrets. The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we<br>did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets."<br>She concluded her speech by courageously singing "The Rose." She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives.<br>At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep.<br>Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.<br><br>If you read this, please send this peaceful word of advice to your<br>friends and family, they'll really enjoy it! We send these words in<br>loving memory of ROSE.<br><br>Remember, GROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY, GROWING UP IS OPTIONAL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An old story tells of an unhappy and discontented stonecutter. One day<br>he came upon a merchant and was awe-struck by all of the marvelous<br>goods the man had for sale. "I wish I were a merchant," said the<br>stonecutter and, quite amazingly, his wish was granted.<br><br>Not long afterward he saw a parade pass his little shop. Spying a<br>prince dressed in splendor such as he had never before seen, he said,<br>"I wish I were a prince." And he became one.<br><br>But it wasn't too many days later that he stepped outside and felt the<br>discomfort of the hot summer sun beating down upon his head. "Even a<br>prince cannot stay cool in the sun," he said. "I wish I were the sun."<br>This wish, too, was granted.<br><br>He was happy being the sun until, one day, a cloud came between him<br>and the earth. "That cloud overshadows me," he said. "I wish I were a<br>cloud."<br><br>Again, his wish was granted and he was happy until he came to a<br>mountain that he could not rise above. "This mountain is greater than<br>I," he said. "I wish I were a mountain."<br><br>As a tall and mighty mountain he looked down upon the affairs of<br>humans and felt that he was finally happy. But one day a stonecutter<br>climbed up his side and chipped away at rock and there was nothing he<br>could do about it. "That little man is more powerful than I," the<br>mountain said. "I wish I were a stonecutter."<br><br>So the circle was completed and now the stonecutter knew that he would<br>always be happy just being himself. He would never dress like a<br>prince, shine like the sun nor rise as tall as a mountain, but he was<br>happy to be who he was.<br><br>A sure way to unhappiness is to compare yourself to others. Like<br>someone aptly said, "The grass may be greener on the other side of the<br>fence, but it still has to be mowed." You are who you are and that is<br>to be celebrated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Emperor's Seeds</strong><br>An emperor in the Far East was growing old and knew it was time to choose his successor. Instead of choosing one of his assistants or his children, he decided something different. He called young people in the kingdom together one day. He said,<br>"It is time for me to step down and choose the next emperor. I have decided to choose one of you."<br>The kids were shocked! But the emperor continued.<br>"I am going to give each one of you a seed today. One very special seed. I want you to plant the seed, water it and come back here one year from today with what you have grown from this one seed. I will then judge the plants that you bring, and the one I choose will be the next emperor!"<br><br>One boy named Ling was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed. He went home and excitedly told his mother the story. She helped him get a pot and planting soil, and he planted the seed and watered it carefully. Every day he would water it and watch to see if it had grown.<br><br>After about three weeks, some of the other youths began to talk about their seeds and the plants that were beginning to grow. Ling kept checking his seed, but nothing ever grew. Three weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks went by. Still nothing. By now, others were talking about their plants but Ling didn't have a plant, and he felt like a failure. Six months went by-still nothing in Ling's pot. He just knew he had killed his seed. Everyone else had trees and tall plants, but he had nothing. Ling didn't say anything to his friends,<br>however. He just kept waiting for his seed to grow.<br><br>A year finally went by and all the youths of the kingdom brought their plants to the emperor for inspection. Ling told his mother that he wasn't going to take an empty pot. But honest about what happened, Ling felt sick to his stomach, but he knew his mother was right. He took his empty pot to the palace.<br><br>When Ling arrived, he was amazed at the variety of plants grown by the other youths. They were beautiful-in all shapes and sizes. Ling put his empty pot on the floor and many of the other kinds laughed at him. A few felt sorry for him and just said,<br>"Hey nice try."<br>When the emperor arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted the young people. Ling just tried to hide in the back.<br>"My, what great plants, trees and flowers you have grown," said the emperor. "Today, one of you will be appointed the next emperor!"<br>All of a sudden, the emperor spotted Ling at the back of the room with his empty pot. He ordered his guards to bring him to the front. Ling was terrified.<br>"The emperor knows I'm a failure! Maybe he will have me killed!"<br>When Ling got to the front, the Emperor asked his name.<br>"My name is Ling," he replied.<br>All the kids were laughing and making fun of him. The emperor asked everyone to quiet down. He looked at Ling, and then announced to the crowd,<br>"Behold your new emperor! His name is Ling!"<br>Ling couldn't believe it. Ling couldn't even grow his seed. How could he be the new emperor? Then the emperor said,<br>"One year ago today, I gave everyone here a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds which would not grow. All of you, except Ling, have brought me trees and plants and flowers. When you found that the seed would not grow, you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. Ling was the only one with the courage and honesty to bring me a pot with my seed in it. Therefore, he is the one who will be the new emperor!"<br><br>If you plant honesty, You will reap trust<br>If you plant goodness, You will reap friends<br>If you plant humility, You will reap greatness<br>If you plant perseverance, You will reap victory<br>If you plant consideration, You will reap harmony<br>If you plant hard work, You will reap success<br>If you plant forgiveness, You will reap reconciliation<br>If you plant openness, You will reap intimacy<br>If you plant patience, You will reap improvements<br>If you plant faith, You will reap miracles<br><br>But<br><br>If you plant dishonesty, You will reap distrust.<br>If you plant selfishness, You will reap loneliness<br>If you plant pride, You will reap destruction<br>If you plant envy, You will reap trouble<br>If you plant laziness, You will reap stagnation.<br>If you plant bitterness, You will reap isolation<br>If you plant greed, You will reap loss<br>If you plant gossip, You will reap enemies<br>If you plant worries, You will reap wrinkles<br>If you plant sin, You will reap guilt<br><br>So be careful what you plant now,<br>It will determine what you will reap tomorrow the seeds you now scatter,<br>Will make life worse or better your life or the ones who will come after.<br>Yes, someday, you will enjoy the fruits,<br>Or you will pay for the choices you plant today.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your Inspiration: The Trouble Tree<br><br>I hired a plumber to help me restore an old farmhouse, and after he had just finished a rough first day on the job, a flat tire made him lose an hour of work &amp; his electric drill quit, his ancient one ton truck refused to start. As I drove him home, he sat in stony silence. On arriving he invited me in to meet his family. As we walked toward the front door, he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the branches with both hands. Upon opening the door he had undergone an amazing transformation. His tanned face was wreathed in smiles and he hugged his two small children and gave his wife a kiss. Afterward he walked me to the car. We passed the tree and my curiosity got the better of me. I asked him about what I had seen him do at the little tree.<br>"Oh, that's my trouble tree," he replied. "I know I can't help having troubles on the job, but one thing's for sure, those troubles don't belong in the house with my wife and the children. So I just hang them up on the tree every night when I come home and ask God to take care of them. Then in the morning I pick them up again. Funny thing is," he smiled, "when I come out in the morning to pick them up, there aren't nearly as many as I remember hanging up the night before."<br></div>
