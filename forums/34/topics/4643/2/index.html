            <div class='col-md body'>Another to ponder upon....<br><br>A girl, lost her favourite watch and she was very unhappy, she even fall sick because of that. A priest came to visit her while she was sick and asked her,<br>"If one day you accidentally dropped one hundred thousand dollars, would you accidentally dropped another two hundred thousand dollars again?"<br>"Of course not." The girl replied.<br>"If that is the case," the priest said again, "why did you let yourself<br>lose two weeks of happiness after you have lost your watch? And also went on to let yourself lose two weeks of health?"<br>The girl was suddenly enlightened and jumped out of bed. She said,<br>"You are right. I refuse to lose more than what I did. From today onwards, I will earn back the money I need to buy myself another watch."<br><br>Life is full of winning and losing and also full of challenges. It<br>doesn't matter if you lose, if you live for  yourself, then that is truly<br>LIFE.<br><br>Some people refuse to accept the truth and to start again, thus they end up losing more and more in life and end up nothing can be done to bring back what they lost.<br><br>If you are losing in your life now, don't continue letting yourself lose<br>more than what you did. Put a stop to that situation and do not be afraid to start from scratch.<br><br>"Contentment is not the fulfillment of what you want, it is the realisation of how much you already have."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this guy who loved two gals at the same time but he didn't know which one he loved more. Someone taught him.<br><br>Ask yourself this question and answer it honestly :When you are happy, which gal would you want to share your happiness with?" The one you think of is someone you love.<br><br>Ask yourself another question and answer it honestly : "When you are sad, which gal you want to share your burden with?" The one you think of is also someone you love.<br><br>If you think of the same gal when you are happy &amp; sad, that's the most perfect. But if you don't think of the same gal, I would advise you to chose the one you are willing to share your sadness with.<br><br>In life, there are more sorrows than happiness. There are too many people that u meet that u can share your happiness with, not necessary your lover. If you live your life happily, you can also  enjoy it alone. In sadness, however, there are not many people willing to share your burden with you. If you are willing to tell<br>someone your happiness, I am sure that person has got<br>to be someone close &amp; an understanding person to you. But it shouldn't stop there. If that person only thinks of you when she is happy, but looks for someone else when she is sad, this lover is too unstable, she doesn't treat you as someone she can spend the rest of her life with. Of course, I will be very happy if I am the first person to share her happiness. But, if she is sad, I will be too willing to stay by her side &amp; ease her pain. Only then, will I believe that I hold a very important position in her heart. If you are sad, who comes to your mind first? ********************<br><br>Friendship is a strange thing.<br>We find ourselves telling each other the deepest details of our lives...things we don't even share with the families who raised us. But what is a friend? A confidant? A shoulder to cry on? An ear to listen? A heart to feel? A friend is all these... and more.<br><br>No matter where we met, no matter how long we've been together... I call you friend. A word so small, yet so large in feeling, a word filled with emotion, a word overflowing with love. Truly great things come in small packages. Once the package of friendship has<br>been opened, it can never be closed. It is a constant book always waiting... waiting to be read... and enjoyed. We may have our disagreements... we may have our disappointments... we may argue... we may have concern for one another... friendship is a unique bond that lasts through all tribulations. A part of each of<br>us goes into our friendships... our humor... our experiences... our tears. Friendships are foundations... necessary for life... and love.<br>Friends... you and me... you brought another friend and then we were three... we started our group... our circle of friends... there is no beginning... there is no end.<br><br>Sometimes God wants us to meet many wrong people So that when the right one comes along, we will appreciate that person more.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not realli a story..but just a short passage i read in a newsletter before...Can't realli remember the full thing...but the main idea is there..I jsut changed it into my own way of putting ti across...<br><br>"Everyday, I would have to wait at the bus stop for my bus to get to work. And everyday, day in day out rain or shine without fail, I can't help but notice these small movement on the wall behind the bus-stop...when you take a closer look it's those red ants that are moving twigs, food, leaves around into their nest. Of course many times we would ask, what so interesting about these small little insects? Therefore many of us pay no need or attention to them... I too did thot of them the same way...<br><br>But until one of these days when I was not rushing for bus, I left the house earlier, I just stood there for 15 mins looking at the ants... Probably you would have thot that I was very boliao at that time...but actually a lesson was learnt here.... I looked at this paritcular ant that was carrying a piece of dead leave abt 2 times it's size dragging and dragging it across the route to get to it's nest... And after a long tedious route...it finally made it to the nest... But here came the big problem... The entrance to the nest was too small for the leave to go in...It tried several times, several angles...but it still won't budge in....And it jsut did a simple thing... It just left the leave at the side of the nest and went away...looking for another...."<br><br>Probably this story may be boring to some of you..but the lesson I learnt from there is...there are things which you took great pain to bring it to what it is todae...but eventually, if it not meant to be like tat or in the way you want...just let it go.....life still goes on...<br><br>I have been stuck in one such suitation for very long...I can understand things are not easy to let go..but I am trying too...so do hope that we can learn from the ant... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mrs Jones is 92 years old, petite, well-poised, and proud. She is fully<br>dressed each morning by eight o'clock, with her hair fashionably coifed,<br>and her makeup perfectly applied, in spite of the fact she is legally blind.<br><br>Today she has moved to a nursing home. Her husband of 70 years recently<br>passed away, making this move necessary.<br><br>After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home,<br>where I am employed, she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready. As<br>she maneuvered her walker to the elevator, I provided a visual description<br>of her tiny room, including the eyelet curtains that had been hung on her window.<br><br>"I love it," she stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old having just been presented with a new puppy.<br><br>"Mrs. Jones, you haven't seen the room...just wait," I said. Then she spoke<br>these words that I will never forget:"That does not have anything to do<br>with it," she gently replied.<br><br>"Happiness is something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room<br>or not does not depend on how the furniture is arranged. It is how I<br>arrange my mind. I have already decided to love it. It is a decision I make<br>every morning when I wake up. I have a choice. I can spend the day in bed<br>recounting the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer<br>work, or I can get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do work.<br>Each day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open, I will focus on the new<br>day and all of the happy memories I have stored away...just for this time<br>in my life. Old age is like a bank account. You withdraw from what you<br>have already put in."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My mother used to ask me what is the most important  part of the<br>body.<br><br>Through the years I would take a guess at what I  thought was<br>the correct answer. When I was younger, I thought sound  was<br>very important to us as humans, so I said, 'My ears,  Mommy.'<br>She said, 'No. Many people are deaf. But you keep  thinking<br>about it and I will ask you again soon.'<br><br>Several years passed before she asked me again. Since  making<br>my first attempt, I had contemplated the correct answer.  So<br>this time I told her, 'Mommy, sight is very important  to<br>everybody, so it must be our eyes'. She looked at me and told  me,<br>'You are learning fast, but the answer is not correct  because<br>there are many people who are blind.'<br><br>Stumped again, I  continued my quest for knowledge and over<br>the years, Mother asked me a  couple more times and always her<br>answer was, 'No. But you are  getting smarter every year, my<br>child.'<br><br>Then  last year, my grandpa died. Everybody was hurt.<br>Everybody was crying. Even  my father cried. I remember that<br>especially because it was only the  second time I saw him cry. My<br>Mom looked at me when it was our  turn to say our final good-bye to<br>Grandpa.<br><br>She  asked me, 'Do you know the most important body part yet,<br>my dear?'  I was shocked when she asked me this now. I always<br>thought this was a game  between her and me. She saw the<br>confusion on my face and told me,  'This question is very<br>important. It shows that you have really lived in  your life.<br>For every body part you gave me in the past, I have told  you<br>was wrong and I have given you an example why. But today  is<br>the day you need to learn this important lesson.'<br><br>She  looked down at me as only a mother can. I saw her eyes<br>well up  with tears. She said, 'My dear, the most important<br>body part is your  shoulder.' I asked, 'Is it because it holds up<br>your head?' She replied, 'No, it is because it can hold  the head<br>of a friend or a loved one when they cry. Everybody needs<br>shoulder to cry on sometime in life, my dear.<br><br>I only  hope that you have enough love and friends that you<br>will always have a  shoulder to cry on when you need it.' Then and<br>there I knew the most  important body part is not a selfish one. It<br>is sympathetic to the pain of  others. People will forget what you<br>said.......People will forget what  you did........ But people will<br>NEVER forget how you made them  feel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A delightful story is told about a young man who applied for a job as<br>a telegraph operator. He answered an ad in the newspaper and went to<br>the telegraph office to await an interview. Though he knew Morse Code<br>and was qualified in every other way, seven other applicants were also<br>waiting in the large, noisy office.<br><br>He saw customers coming and going and heard a telegraph clacking away<br>in the background. He also noticed a sign on the receptionist's<br>counter instructing applicants to fill out a form and wait to be<br>summoned to an inner office for an interview. He filled out the form<br>and sat down to wait.<br><br>After a few minutes, the young man stood up, crossed the room to the<br>door of the inner office, and walked right in. Naturally the other<br>applicants perked up, wondering why he had been so bold. They talked<br>among themselves and finally determined that, since nobody had been<br>summoned to interview yet, the man would likely be reprimanded for not<br>following instructions and possibly disqualified for the job.<br><br>Within a few minutes, however, the young man emerged from the inner<br>office escorted by the interviewer, who announced to the other<br>applicants, "Thank you all very much for coming, but the job has just<br>been filled."<br><br>They were all confused and one man spoke up: "Wait a minute -- I don't<br>understand. We've been waiting longer than he and we never even got a<br>chance to be interviewed."<br><br>The employer responded, "All the time you've been sitting here, the<br>telegraph has been ticking out the following message: 'If you<br>understand this, then come right in. The job is yours.' So you see,<br>all of you were summoned, but HE heard and understood!"<br><br>This man knew a valuable life-lesson that most people miss: Wherever<br>You Are, Be There. You're there physically, be there emotionally. Be<br>there mentally. Be there attentively. Be there as fully as you can.<br><br>Wherever you are, be there. When you're completely present, you'll<br>make the most of every minute. And minutes lived fully add up to a<br>life lived magnificently.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;A frail old man went to live with his son,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;daughter-in-law, and four-year old grandson. The old<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;man's hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred,and his<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;step faltered.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The family ate together at the table. But the elderly<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;grandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;tablecloth.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;mess. "We must do something about Grandfather," said<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the son. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;eating, and food on the floor."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;So the husband and wife set a small table in the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;bowl.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;When the family glanced in Grandfather's direction,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Still, the only words the couple had for him were<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;food.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The four-year-old watched it all in silence. One<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;evening before supper, the father noticed his son<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;child sweetly, "What are you making?" Just as sweetly,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the boy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The four-year old smiled and went back to work.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The words struck the parents so, that they were<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;speechless. Then tears started to stream down their<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;be done.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;gently led him back to the family table. For the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;remainder of his days he ate every meal with the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;On a positive note, I've learned that, no matter what<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;happens how bad it seems today, life does go on, and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;it will be better tomorrow.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the way he/she handles three things: a rainy day, lost<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that, regardless of your relationship<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;with your parents, you'll miss them when they're gone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;from your life.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that making a "living" is not the same<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;thing as making a "life."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;chance.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;catcher's mitt on both hands. You need to be able to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;throw something back.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that if you pursue happiness, it will<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;elude you. But, if you focus on your family, your<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;friends, the needs of others, your work and doing the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;very best you can, happiness will find you.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that whenever I decide something with an<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;open heart, I usually make the right decision.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to be one.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that every day, you should reach out<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;and touch someone.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that I still have a lot to learn.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've learned that you should pass this on to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;everyone you care about. I just did.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;People love that human touch -- holding hands, a warm<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;hug, or just a friendly pat on the back.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Sometimes they just need a little something to make<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;them smile. People will forget what you said ...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;people will forget what you did, but people will never<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;forget how YOU made them feel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Five Great Lessons</span></strong><br>1 - Most Important Lesson Â– Everyone is significant<br>During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I read the last one:<br>Â“What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?Â”<br>Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name? I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.<br>Â“Absolutely,Â” said the professor. Â“In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say hello.Â”<br>I have never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.<br><br>2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain<br>One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the manÂ’s door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home.<br>A special note was attached. It read:<br>Â“Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husbandÂ’s bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others.Â”<br>Sincerely,<br>Mrs. Nat King Cole.<br><br>3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.<br>In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.<br>Â“How much is an ice cream sundae?Â” he asked.<br>Â“Fifty cents,Â” replied the waitress.<br>The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.<br>Â“Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?Â” he inquired.<br>By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.<br>Â“Thirty-five cents,Â” she brusquely replied.Â”<br>The little boy again counted his coins.<br>Â“IÂ’ll have the plain ice cream,Â” he said.<br>The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies. You see, he could not have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.<br><br>4 - Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path<br>In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the kingÂ’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.<br><br>5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts<br>Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying,<br>Â“Yes, IÂ’ll do it if it will save her.Â”<br>As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice,<br>Â“Will I start to die right away?Â”<br>Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.<br><br>Life will be easier if youÂ…<br>Work like you donÂ’t need the money.<br>Love like youÂ’ve never been hurt.<br>And dance like you do when nobodyÂ’s watching.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato<br>garden, but it was very hard work. His only son, who would have helped him, was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and<br>mentioned his predicament.<br><br>Dear Son,<br>I am feeling pretty bad, because it looks like I won't be able to plant<br>my potato garden this year. I hate to miss doing the garden, because your mother always loved planting time. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me, if you weren't in prison.<br>Love, Dad<br><br>Shortly, the old man received this telegram:<br><br>For Heaven's sake, Dad, don't dig up the garden! That's where I buried the GUNS!"<br><br>At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen FBI agents and local police<br>officers showed up and dug up the entire garden without finding any guns. Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what happened, and asking him what to do next. His son's reply was,<br>"Go ahead and plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best I could do for you at this time."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the winter of 1990, I was asked to appear on a television talk show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. At the end of our first day of taping I was on my way back to my plush, high-rise, cable-TV, twenty-four-hour room service hotel, when I saw something I had never seen before. Lying on the sidewalk against a building in four inches of snow was a man sleeping with only a cardboard blanket to keep him from being completely exposed to the freezing cold. What really broke my heart was when I realized that he wore no shoes or socks.  I thought to stop and help him but was not quite sure what to do. As the traffic light turned green, it seemed life was demanding that I move along. So I did. Back in the "anything I wanted was mine" environment of my hotel, I promptly forgot about the man on the street.<br><br>Several days later, prior to the morning taping, I was having coffee and Danish in the green room at the station. All of the "important" people had left the room and it was just me and the janitor remaining. I had seen him quietly go about his business every day while I was there, and he never said a word except "Good morning" or "Can I get anything for you, sir?" He always had a smile to give to everyone. When I asked him how he was feeling today, he told me that he had been having to ride his bike to work in the snow and that he had been feeling rather sorry for himself... that is, until he saw a man sleeping down on the corner of Yonge Street and Bloor with just a piece of cardboard for covering from the cold and no shoes.<br><br>I almost choked on my Danish as I heard him go on to relate how he was so moved with compassion for the man that he went around the corner to a store and bought the man a pair of socks and shoes. As I heard his story, I saw in my mind a poster that used to be in an old friend's bedroom when I was a teenager. It was a picture of a child handing someone a flower and the caption read:<br><br>"The smallest deed always exceeds the grandest of intentions."<br><br>I stood there wishing it was me who had bought the shoes and socks for the man, when they called my name to come to the set. As I got to the studio, they were just concluding an interview with a social worker who specialized in benevolence for eastern Ontario. The social worker relayed a story about Mother Teresa, who when asked once how she had accomplished such great things in her life responded,<br><br>"None of us can do anything great on our own, but we can all do a small thing with great love."<br><br>When I went home that day, I looked for the man on the street. He was gone, but I knew it would not be long before someone took his place.<br>By Michael Peterson from Chicken Soup for the Country Soul<br>Copyright 1998 by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and Ron Camacho</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something about love, which I personally believe it so...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>1. I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with you<br><br>2. No man is worth your tears, and the one who is won't make you cry.<br><br>3. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.<br><br>4. They say love hides behind every corner, then I must be walking in circles.<br><br>5. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart.<br><br>6. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them, knowing you can't have them.<br><br>7. Never frown, even when you're sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.<br><br>8. To the world you may be one person, but to one person, you may be the world.<br><br>9. Don't waste your time on someone who isn't willing to waste their time on you.<br><br>10. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to feel greatful.<br><br>11. Don't cry because its over, smile because it happened.<br><br>12. There's always going to be people that hurt you, so what you have to do is to keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust the next time around.<br><br>13. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.<br><br>14. Don't try so hard; the best things come when you least expect them to.<br><br>~ Author Unknown~<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><strong>The Healing Poison</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">A long time ago, a girl named Li-Li got married and went to live with her husband and mother-in-law. In a very short time, Li-Li found that she couldn't get along with her  mother-in-law at all.<br><br>Their personalities were very different, and Li-Li was angered by many of her mother-in-law's habits.   In addition, she criticized Li-Li constantly. Days passed days, and weeks passed weeks. Li-Li and her mother-in-law never stopped arguing and fighting.<br><br>But what made the situation even worse was that, according to ancient Chinese tradition, Li-Li had to bow to her mother-in-law and obey her every wish. All the anger and unhappiness in the house was causing the poor husband great distress.<br><br>Finally, Li-Li could not stand her mother-in-law's bad temper and dictatorship any longer, and she decided to do something about it.  Li-Li went to see her father's good friend,  Mr Huang who sold herbs.<br><br>She told him the situation and asked if he would give her some  poison so that she could<br>solve the problem once and for all. Mr Huang thought for a while, and finally said, "Li-Li, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and  obey what I tell you". Li-Li said, "Yes, Mr Huang, I will do whatever you tell me to do".<br><br>Mr Huang went into the back room, and returned in a few minutes with a package of herbs.  He told Li-Li, "You can't use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body. Every other day prepare some meat or chicken and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, in order to make sure that nobody suspects you when she dies, you must be very careful to act very friendly towards her. Don't argue with her, obey her every wish, and treat her like a queen".<br><br>Li-Li was so happy. She thanked  Mr Huang and hurried home to start her plot of murdering her mother-in-law.<br><br>Weeks went by, and months went by, and every other day, Li-Li served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. She remembered what Mr Huang had said about avoiding suspicion, so she controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother.<br><br>After 6 months had passed, the whole household had changed. Li-Li had practiced controlling her temper so much that she found she had almost never got mad or upset. She hadn't had an argument in six months with her mother-in-law, who now seemed much kinder and easier to get along with.<br><br>The mother-in-law's attitude toward Li-Li changed, and she began to love Li-Li like her own daughter. She kept telling friends and relatives that Li-Li was her best daughter-in-law one could ever find. Li-Li and her mother-in-law now treating each other like a real mother and daughter. Li-Li's husband was very happy to see what was happening.<br><br>One day, Li-Li came to see Mr. Huang and asked for his help again.<br><br>She said, "Dear Mr Huang, please help me to keep the poison from killing my mother-in-law! She's changed into such a nice woman, and I love her like my own mother. I do not want her to die because of the poison I gave her".<br><br>Mr Huang smiled and nodded his head. "Li-Li, there's nothing to be worried about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to improve her health. The only poison was in your mind and your attitude toward her, but that has been washed away by the love which you gave to her".</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">MORAL: Friends, have you ever realized that how you treat others is exactly how they will treat you? In China it is said: The person who loves others will also be loved.</span></div>
