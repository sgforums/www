            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">To find your love attitude number, add your birth month and your birth date together. Keep reducing it until it's a single digit.<br><br>Example: August 20<br>= 8 + 20 = 28<br>= 2 + 8 = 10<br>= 1 + 0 = 1<br>Thus, the love attitude number is = 1</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">1<br>You're charming imaginative and independent. Usually your style is ahead of others, you know what's in and what's way out. Sometimes you're a little too aggressive when it comes to pursuing a love interest.<br>You've a way of drawing attention wherever you go and this dramatic flare usually attracts the strongest guys. Your competitive nature either draws or repels guys/gals but those who can't handle your power aren't your type anyway. At times you can b! e possessive, manipulating and demanding with your friends and in love relationships. You like guys/gals with lots of intelligence and knock them dead good looks don't hurt either.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">2<br>Your love nature is sentimental, romantic and kind. Your easygoing, mild manner allows almost everyone to feel very comfortable with you - especially shy guys/gals. Your modesty and tact enable you to get along easily with both sexes. You're a natural peacemaker and can be very persuasive with words, which helps you to gain the respect of your classmates. You can also be too sensitive at times, and your greatest drawback is a lack of confidence to stand up for yourself in conflict. Your favorite type of guy/gal is a gentle, affectionate one who is also strong and playful. A great sense of humor is also a must. A guy/gal who loves to listen to music and dance should rank high on your list of favorites, too.</span><br><span style="color: green;">3<br>You're imaginative, fun-loving, trill-seeking and expressive. You're so charming that you attract many friends and you're almost never lacking guys/gals. In your earlier years, you maybe totally shy and self-conscious, but you'll lose those qualities in the high-school years. You can be sort of vain or even a bit of a show-off when you get caught up in exciting events in your life, but you usually redeem yourself in some playful way before you lose a friend. Jealousy shows its! ugly head sometimes, but generally you aren't affected by it unless your guy tries to provoke it. In the guy department, you refer the athletic or artistic types. You're in absolute heaven when you find both of those qualities in the same guy. When you're looking for love, a guy who can make you laugh scores points, big time!</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">4<br>You tend to be loyal, dedicated and good-hearted. You're one of the most diligent students when you really try, and you tend to make your schoolwork a priority. You also express those same qualities in your love relationship. No one is more faithful and trusting than you. In fact, those tendencies can be a little negative in your romantic life. It give you the respect and love you deserve. You can be stubborn and a bit of a troublemaker if the mood strikes you but you can usually dig yourself out of that hole just in time to stay out of major trouble. You usually fall for extremes when choosing a love mate - he/she is good-looking, too, but that's not a major consideration for you.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">5<br>Your love attitude is adventurous, charismatic and spontaneous. You're creative and adaptable, and you can come up with the most exciting and sometimes daring things to do. Your quick intelligence and way with words help get you out of the problems that come with being flirtatious and laying hard to get. You need to pay close attention to your personal values because you love to try new and different things and easily go along with the crowd and the consequences can put extra strain on your relationship with a boy/girl. You like guys who have great bodies and good looks, along with exceptional brain and high grades. It helps if they're highly athletic or involved in as many activities as you,otherwise you might get bored! Variety is the key to your love attitude number.</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">6<br>You're warm, loving, devoted and affectionate. Your outgoing, thoughtful nature attracts many boyfriends/girlfriends to you, and usually some of the nicest guys too. Because of your need to care, you can end up in a relationship that requires too much care-taking to make it balanced. Since home and family play important roles in your life, you're unlikely to be attracted to guys/gal! s who your parents wouldn't like. Sometimes you've a slight jealous streak but it doesn't last long. Some people with this love attitude number are prone to making ha! rsh judgments of others, especially when others don't share your set of values. You're especially attracted to<br>the good looking, boy-next-door type who is smart as well as a gentleman.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">7<br>Your love nature is thoughtful, poetic, mystical and mysterious. A few people with love attitude number seven are class clowns, and they usually attract guys/gals who like to be given a hard time. But most of you are the quiet, reserved types who dislike calling attention to yourself. Your type generally attracts guys who feel the same way you do. Your defined, independent and! secretive nature is very alluring to certain guys/gays. At times, you can also be somewhat fault-finding and a little demanding in your love relationship and with friends. You're mostly attracted to guys/gals who aren't like all the rest; a loner easily attracts you. And, if he/she reads alot and enjoy learning, he/she is especially perfect for you.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">8<br>Your love attitude is confident, powerful and exciting. This number usually makes for a very conscientious student, someone who puts schoolwork ahead of a social life. However, you also enjoy being a leader among your classmates and will seek offices or other positions that enable you to use your leadership skills. Because of this, you can be somewhat intimidating to certain guys/gals. You can ! also be a little too intense, bossy and jealous for your own good. Your love match is definitely someone who is smart, handsome/pretty and popular. You like quality over quantity and will usually wait until the guy/gal with the best attributes comes along.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">9<br>You've a sophisticated attitude that's also generous and considerate. Your responsible, charitable nature may find you attracting guys/gals who want someone to confide in or who makes them feel secure. At a very young age, you developed the type of personality that makes others feel safe and protected. You'll carry these qualities into your adult years and, down the road, you'll be a! good mom/dad because of them. On the negative side, you can be argumentative and overly emotional, and you usually possess a temper that can make everyone run for cover. You like the kind of guy/gal who is responsible and impeccably dressed and has gorgeous eyes and a great body.<br>Charm, with and brilliance could make him the perfect guy/gal for you.</span></div>
