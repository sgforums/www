The sexy charm that you possess does attract other's attention and gain you much popularity. However, most of them just pay notice and show favor toward your outward beauty. You are advised not to believe other's sweet and honeyed words and phrases too much. It is suggested that you show more your talents and intelligence, so that people will have a good impression on you not only because of your outward appearance but because you have high opinion of intrinsic aptitude.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brushing teeth is an activity you would do daily.<br><br>Some people brushes several times a day while others brush just once, but it all doesn't matter.<br><br>What matters is that have you ever noticed that you tend to look in a particular direction always when you brush your teeth, ie: where you place your eyes.  If you do, then look below for more instructions, If not go and brush now!<br><br>hehehe....................<br><br>Where you place your eyes?<br><br>i) looking up<br>ii) moving your eyes left and right<br>iii) looking down<br>iv) looking at your image in the mirror<br><br>Have you chosen the direction???? Then look down...<br><br>Don't try to cheat as you will just be cheating yourself!<br>Here's the answer,<br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;"><br>i) Those who look up are the reserved type of people. They do not have much confidence in themselves and don't know how to express themselves.  For their love life, they are very dependent on their partner and always look to him/her in times of trouble.<br>[color=Brown]<br>ii) Those who look around are the careful type. They are very careful and always plan of everything before they act. For their love life, they will tend to miss golden opportunities that were posed to them, as they don't dare to pursue.<br>[color=green]<br>iii) Those who look down are the nice and accommodating type.  They are good friends as they are compassionate. As for their love life, they listen to their partners. They are inconclusive and tend to reasure the relationship therefore, afraid that their obedience would cause uncertainties to disrupt this relationship of theirs.<br>[color=indigo]<br>iv) Lastly, those who look at themselves are the clear cut and practical type. They dare to do and dare to admit. They love their life and have the potential to do great things and achieve in life. Their love life is not that good as they are not devoted to their partners enough<br>[color=black]<br>So, which kind r U?<br>[color=darkred]</span></div>
