            <div class='col-md body'>How u like the centre of your chocolate to reveal your personality?<br>1) Almond<br>2) Coffee<br>3) Strawberry<br>4) Marshmellow<br>5) Peppermint<br><br>Scroll down to find out?<br><br><span style="color: olive;"><strong>Almond</strong><br>Climbing the almond tree of prosperity, you desire success and you like to celebrate your achievements. You have a quickness of mind that can stagger your friends. You can change your conversation or your beliefs very rapidly. You love making changes to yourself, because there are so many thoughts in your head. You like to offer a hand in friendship and are keen to help others.<br><br><strong>Excess:</strong> You can appear flippant to people who do not know you. You have the best of intentions, but some people just don't want to be changed, so stop trying. You may rely on helping hands from others when you could do something yourself.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Coffee</strong><br>As a coffee person, you're not one to be kept waiting or standing in line. You like everything at once, and why not? You are a deep thinker and like the buzz of discussion and debate. After all, this is why coffee and chocolate houses came into being. Your mind is like a parachute - it works best when open.<br><br><strong>Excess:</strong> Living on a caffeine fix, nervous energy, prone to addictions. You can be impatient and throw tantrums when things don't go your way. You always look busy, but what are you achieving?</span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Strawberry</strong><br>You're a loving and caring person. In touch with your intuition, you listen to other people's problems with compassion and tenderness. You have or will find time for people and you believe that things will turn out all right in the end. A romantic and an idealist at heart, you have lots of unconditional love for yourself and for others. Music can play a large part in your life.<br><br><strong>Excess: </strong>Disappointments in love not being returned. Sensitivity to others can leave you drained of energy. The need to love at any cost means you can be living through others, seeing the world through rose-coloured glasses.</span><br><br><span style="color: violet;"><strong>Marshmallow</strong><br>As a person who likes marshmallow, you're very social. You like to party, to have people around you. Light and fluffy, you can move from one idea or subject to the next, without a great deal of though. If you choose pink marshmallow, you're in love with romantic and very optimistic. White marshmallow denotes clarity for that moment in time.<br><br><strong>Excess: </strong>You can get bored very quickly. Tend to agree with whomever you are talking to at the time, no matter what you believe in. Not a lot of follow-through on ideas that you come up with. The need for romance, for clarity.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Peppermint</strong><br>All things are possible to peppermint lovers; you have all the scope of life to choose from. You tend to see life as moving on - tomorrow is another day. You're very clear on what you're doing, whether it be in mattes of the heart of in your profession. You're full of ideas and won't be bound by rules unless you've made them. You're always striving for things to be better, looking ahead with an open mind.<br><strong><br>Excess:</strong> The need for all the above. Being able to let go and trust your inner center. Suffering from the past is clouding your judgment of the here and now.</span><strong></strong><br></div>
