            <div class='col-md body'>A man asked his wife what she'd like for her 40th birthday.<br><br>"I'd love to be six again," she replied.<br><br>On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off<br>they went to a local theme park. What a day! He put her on every ride in<br>the park: the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear,<br>everything there was! Wow!<br><br>Five hours later she staggered out of the theme park, her head reeling<br>and her stomach upside down.<br>Right to a McDonald's they went, where her husband ordered her a Happy<br>Meal along with extra fries and a refreshing chocolate shake.<br><br>Then, it was off to a movie - the latest Disney and what a fabulous<br>adventure!<br><br>Finally, she wobbled home with her husband and collapsed into bed. He<br>leaned over and lovingly asked, "Well, dear, what was it like being six<br>again?"<br><br>One eye opened. "You idiot, I meant my dress size."<br><br>The moral of this story is: When a woman speaks and a man i! s actually<br>listening, he will still get it wrong. So he shouldn't bother<br>listenening in the first place.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=blue]correct when a couple being together for a long time, they sometimes know what each other wants...but like for me, I and my guy thinks what each other wants and hence it becomes taking it for granted.  For instance, I love to drink ice-lemon tea.  My guy will take it for granted that everytime i order a drink, it will be ice-lemon tea.  Hence you got to let the person know what you want or else we just take things for granted. Humans i guess  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read each one carefully and think about it a second or two<br><br>01. I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with you.<br><br>02. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, would not make you cry.<br><br>03. Just because someone does not love you the way you want them to, does not mean they do not love you with all they have.<br><br>04. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart.<br><br>05. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you cannot have them.<br><br>06. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.<br><br>07. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.<br><br>08. Do not waste your time on a man/woman, who is not willing to waste their time on you.<br><br>09. Maybe fate wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.<br><br>10. Do not cry because it is over, smile because it happened.<br><br>11. There is always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.<br><br>12. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.<br><br>13. Do not try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.<br><br>Remember this, whatever happens, happens for a reason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relationships are hard. It's like a full time job, and we should treat it like one. If your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to leave you, they should give you two weeks' notice. There should be severance pay, and before they leave you, they should have to find you a temp. - Bob Ettinger</div>
