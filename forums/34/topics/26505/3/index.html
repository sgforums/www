            <div class='col-md body'>As he was quietly watching television at home, a chap hears a sound on the roof of his house and rushes out to investigate. Seeing it was a fair sized gorilla tearing the shingles off his home he promptly calls up the local zoo authorities to inform them one of their animals had escaped. He is reassured that a gorilla recovery unit is on the way and is told to remain calm. A few minutes later, an old beat up truck, displaying the Gorilla recovery unit logo on its panels, pulls up to the house. The elderly driver proceed to recover from the back of the truck, a Chihuahua dog, a pair of handcuffs, a ladder, a baseball bat and a 12 gauge shotgun. Puzzled on how this lone elderly was to solve the problem of this gorilla who had by now torn half the roof apart, the chap ask him how he will go about doing this. As he hands him over the .12 gauge shotgun, the zoo employee explains the plan:<br>- First I'll climb up there with the ladder;<br>- Then I approach the gorilla and knock him off the roof using the baseball bat;<br>- As soon as the gorilla hits the ground, the specially trained Chihuahua dog will attack its private parts;<br>- When I get back on the ground, the gorilla will have lowered it's hands to it's groin area to protect itself thus making it easy for me to slip on the handcuffs;<br>- Then, I lead him to the truck, lock him up and take him back to the zoo...<br>Amazed at the procedure, the somewhat startled house owner, 'asks why he was handed the 12 gauge shotgun?<br>"Well... " explains the experienced gorilla retriever, It's just a precaution should thing not go exactly as planned. In the unlikely event that once on the roof the gorilla knocks me off with the baseball bat -<br>Shoot the dog...</div>

The pilot's sign read "WHERE AM I?" in large letters.<br><br>People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign, and held it<br>in a building window. Their sign read "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER". The pilot smiled,<br>waved, looked at his map, determined the course to steer to the Seattle-Tacoma airport,<br>and landed safely.<br><br>After they were on the ground, the copilot asked the pilot how the "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER"<br>sign helped determine their position.<br><br>The pilot responded "I knew that had to be the Microsoft building because, similar to their help-lines,<br>they gave me a technically correct but completely useless answer."<br></div>

One day the teacher called on her while she was napping,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Tell me, Mary, who created the universe?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When Mary didn't stir, little Johnny, an altruistic boy seated behind her,<br>&gt;took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. "God Almighty!!" shouted Mary and<br>&gt;the teacher said, "Very good", and Mary fell back asleep.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A while later the teacher asked Mary, "Who is our Lord and Savior?"<br>&gt;But, Mary didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the<br>&gt;rescue and stuck her again. "Jesus Christ!!" shouted Mary and the teacher<br>&gt;said, "Very good", and Mary fell back asleep.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Then the teacher asked Mary a third question.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?" And again<br>&gt;Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time Mary jumped up and shouted, "If you stick that damn thing in me one more time, I'll break it in half!!"<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt;The teacher fainted.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Superman was feeling bored after a long day of crime-fighting and wanted to go out and party, so he called Batman to ask if he wanted to go to a club and pick up some girls. Batman said Robin was ill and he had to look after him. A little disappointed, Superman called Spiderman to see if he fancied a few beers. Spiderman told him he had a date with Cat-woman. As a last resort, Superman flew over to Wonder- woman's apartment to see if she was free. As he landed on her balcony, he saw Wonder- woman naked on the bed with her legs open. Superman thought to himself,<br>"I'm faster than a speeding bullet. I could be in there, have sex, and be out again before she knew what was happening."<br>So Superman did his Super Thing in a split second and flew off happily. Meanwhile on the bed, Wonder-woman said,<br>"Did you hear something?"<br>"No." said the Invisible Man, "but my ass hurts like hell!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dearest Samantha,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am very happy to inform you that I have fallen<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in love with you since Tuesday, the 17th of August 1999.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. With reference to the meeting held between us on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; the 17th of August 1999 at 1500 hours, I would like to present myself<br>as<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; prospective lover. Our love affair would be on probation for a period<br>of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; three months and depending on compatibility, would be made permanent.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Of course, upon completion of probation, there<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; will be continuous relationship training and relationship appraisal<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; schemes<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; leading up to promotion from lover to spouse. The expenses incurred<br>for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; coffee and entertainment would initially be shared equally between us.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Later, based on your performance, I might take up a larger share of<br>the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; expenses.However I am broad-minded enough, to be taken care of, on<br>your<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; expense account.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. I request you to kindly respond within 30 days of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; receiving this letter, failing which, this offer would be canceled<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; without further notice and I shall be considering someone else. I<br>would<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; happy, if you could forward this letter to your sister, if you do not<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; wish<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; to take up this offer.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Thanking you in anticipation.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yours sincerely,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Max<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; MODERN REPLY TO MODERN LOVE LETTER<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Max,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Please refer to your letter dated today. I am<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; pleased to inform you that I hope to accept your proposal for romance.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. However, you should be informed that there are<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; certain conditions of acceptance. Promotional prospects are to my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; satisfaction. However, please enlighten me as to your retirement<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gratuity should be generous.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. I also need to be assured that there is sufficient<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; security with regards to this commitment. If there is any chance at<br>all<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; retrenchment or consequent disinterest on your part,then I should<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; receive<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; monetary compensation according to union standards.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Due to the nature of my position, I am sure you<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; will agree that an expense account should be arranged for my access in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; light<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the 'VIP'. I shall be entertaining. In addition, housing and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; transport<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; allowances should be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in order and nothing less than a Jag is in order.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Please also note that there should be no<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; moonlighting restrictions placed on myself. If you are still<br>interested<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; the relationship, please reply on an urgent<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; basis as other prospective lovers have sent indications<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; of interest.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Please also note that my sister is happily employed.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yours perhaps,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Samantha</div>
