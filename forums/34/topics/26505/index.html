            <div class='col-md body'>A woman decided to have a facelift for her birthday. She spent $5,000.00 and, after looking in the mirror, she felt pretty good about the results. On her way home she stopped at a newsstand to buy a paper. She asked the paper man,<br>"I hope you don't mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?"<br>"About 32," the clerk replied<br>"I'm actually 47," the woman said happily.<br>A little while later she went into McDonalds, waited in line and upon getting her order, she asked the counter girl the same  question. The girl replied,<br>"I'd guess you're about 29."<br>The woman said proudly to her, "Nope, I am 47."<br>Now she was feeling really good about herself. Then, while waiting for the bus home, she asked an old man the same  question.<br>"I'm 78 and my eyesight is poor. Although, I remember when I was young, there was a sure way to tell how old a woman was, but it required me to put my hands up her blouse and feel her boobs for a short time. Only then I could tell exactly how old a woman was."<br>They waited in silence on the empty street until curiosity got the best of the woman and she finally said,<br>"What the hell, okay, go ahead."<br>So the old man slipped both hands up her blouse, under her bra, and began to feel around slowly. After a few minutes she said, "That's enough. Now tell me, how old am I?"<br>He removed his hands and said, "You are 47."<br>"That is amazing. How could you tell that?" the woman asked, stunned.<br>"I was behind you in line at McDonalds..."</div>

Just as they were about to put the toe tag on the Indian, he stirred and opened his eyes. Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.<br>"Well," said the Indian, "I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Chinese and the Malay and I were standing at the gates of heaven. An Angel approached us and said that we were too young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50 and the next thing I know I was back here."<br>Â“That's amazing!" said one of the doctor. "But what happened to the other two?"<br>"Last I saw them," replied the Indian, "the Chinese was bargaining over the price and the Malay was waiting for the government to pay for his."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Russian Pretzel</strong><br>Three Americans were up against a very large Russian in a wrestling meet. They were nervous because he had a famous move called Â“The Russian Pretzel,Â” which often landed his opponents in the hospital.  When the first American caught a glimpse of him, he said,<br>Â“Coach, heÂ’s HUGE. IÂ’m scared.Â”<br>Â“You da MAN!Â” The coach replied, Â“Just go in there and tear him up!Â”<br>The guy started the match quite confidently, but after about a minute, the Russian picked him up, slammed him into the famous pretzel, and sent him to the emergency room. The same thing happened to the second wrestler, so the third guy was petrified. He told his coach he was backing out. The coach said,<br>Â“CÂ’mon, son. YouÂ’re our last chance!Â”<br>The kid started out pretty well, but when the Russian started to twist him into the pretzel, the coach covered his eyes. When he opened them, he saw the referee holding the AmericanÂ’s hand up in victory. The coach, baffled, asked the kid how he did it.<br>Â“Well Coach, when that damn Russian picked me up and started twisting my body, it HURT! So when I saw two red things dangling there, I bit them... HARD! YouÂ’d be surprised what you can do when you bite your own balls!Â”<br><br><strong>Golfing With The Mob</strong><br>One morning, a man approached the first tee, only to find another guy approaching from the other side. They began talking and decided to play nine holes together. After teeing off, they sat off down the fairway,<br>continuing their chat.<br>Â“What do you do?Â” the first man asked.<br>Â“IÂ’m a salesman. What about you?Â”<br>Â“IÂ’m a hitman for the mob,Â” replied the second man.<br>The hitman noticed that the first guy started getting a little nervous and continued,<br>Â“Yeah, IÂ’m the highest paid guy in the business. IÂ’m the best.Â”<br>He stopped, sat down his bag of clubs, and pulled out a fancy, high powered rifle that was loaded with all types of scopes and sights. He then asked the man where he lived. Still nervous the man replied,<br>Â“In a subdivision just west of here.Â”<br>The hitman placed the gun against his shoulder, faced west, peered into a scope and asked,<br>Â“What color roof yaÂ’ got?Â”<br>Â“Gray.Â”<br>Â“What color siding?Â”<br>Â“Yellow.Â”<br>Â“You got a silver Toyota?Â”<br>Â“Yeah,Â” replied the first man who was now completely amazed by the accuracy of the hitmanÂ’s equipment. Â“ThatÂ’s my wifeÂ’s car.Â”<br>Â“That your red pickup next to it?Â”<br>Looking baffled the man asked if he could look through the scope. Looking through the sights, he said<br>Â“Hell. ThatÂ’s my buddy JeffÂ’s truck. What the hell is he doing there if IÂ’m..?Â”<br>The hitman looked through the scope once more.<br>Â“Your wife a blond and your buddy got black hair?Â”<br>The man nodded.<br>Â“Well, I donÂ’t know how to tell you, but I think youÂ’ve got a problem. TheyÂ’re going at it like a couple of teenagers in there.Â” said the hitman.<br>Â“Problem?! THEYÂ’VE got the problem! I want you to shoot both of them! Right now!Â”<br>The hitman paused and said,<br>Â“Sure. But itÂ’ll cost you. Like I said, IÂ’m the best. I get paid $5,000 per shot.Â”<br>Â“I donÂ’t care! Just do it! I want you to shoot her right in the head, and shoot him in the balls.Â”<br>The hitman agreed, turned, and took firing position. He carefully stared into the sights, taking careful aim. He then said,<br>Â“You know what buddy, this is your lucky day. I think I can save you $5,000!Â”<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

Rated PG</strong><br>A beautiful blonde went into a bar and sat down next to a guy that was so homely looking, he has not had a date in over a year, also, he was so dumb that one night he slept with a ruler next to his head to see how long he slept. So he figured that he had absolutely no chance in the world to score a date with this ravishing buxom blonde. Then suddenly she struck up a conversation with him and soon they became rather chummy. It started to get late and the bartender called out last drink for alcohol. The blonde leaned over to the guy and said,<br>"Let's have this last drink at my apartment."<br>Taken back by her request, and trembling, the guy finally uttered the word,<br>"Okay."<br>They got up from the bar stool arm and arm, headed for the door. The blonde stopped him and said,<br>"Before we go back to my apartment there's one thing I have to tell you, I'm on my menstrual cycle."<br>"That's okay,Â” he replied, Â“I'll follow you in my Honda."<br></div>

One of them suggested,<br>Â“You know, I used to have the same trouble with my bull, but got it fixed really quick.Â”<br>Â“How did you get it fixed?Â”<br>Â“Well I just dipped my finger in the cowÂ’s vagina and rubbed it all over the bullÂ’s nose and he got right after her.Â”<br>He went home to the farm and decided to try it. He grabbed a cow, dipped his fingers in the cowÂ’s vagina and rubbed it all around the bullÂ’s nose. The bull got a rip-roaring boner and jumped on the cow immediately. That night, he got into bed with his wife and could not get the effect on the bull out of his mind. As she lay sleeping, he dipped his fingers into his wifeÂ’s vagina and feeling that it was nice and wet,  he rubbed it all around his nose and got a rip-roaring hard on. He quickly shook his wife awake and cried out loud,<br>Â“Darling. Look at THIS!Â”<br>She rolled over, turned on the light and screamed at him,<br>Â“You mean you woke me up in the middle of the night just to show me that you have a nosebleed?Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many Romance Languages (Italian, Spanish, French) give even inanimate objects a gender. In French, for example, this determines whether you use Â“laÂ” or Â“le in front of the noun. If English designated things as either male or female, here are a few of our recommendations...<br>COPIER: Female, because once turned off, it takes a while to warm up. Because it is an effective reproductive device when the right buttons are pushed. Because it can wreak havoc when the wrong buttons are pushed.<br><br>HAMMER: Male, because it hasn't evolved much over the last 5,000 years, but it's handy to have around.<br><br>HOT AIR BALLOON: Male, because to get it to go anywhere you have to light a fire under it... and, of course, there's the hot air part.<br><br>HOURGLASS: Female, because over time, the weight shifts to the bottom.<br><br>KIDNEYS: Female, because they always go to the bathroom in pairs.<br><br>REMOTE CONTROL: Female... Ha! You thought I'd say male. But consider Â… it gives a man pleasure. He'd be lost without it. Lastly while he doesn't always know the right buttons to push, he keeps trying.<br><br>SHOES: Male, because it is usually unpolished, with its tongue hanging out.<br><br>SPONGES: Female, because they are soft and squeezable and retain water.<br><br>SUBWAY: Male, because it uses the same old lines to pick people up.<br><br>SWISS ARMY KNIFE: Male, because even though it appears useful for a wide variety of work, it spends most of its time just opening bottles.<br><br>TIRES: Male, because it goes bald and often is over inflated.<br><br>WEB PAGE: Female, because it is always getting hit on.<br><br>ZIPLOC BAGS: Male, because they hold everything in, but you can always see right through them.<br></div>

As they went along, they passed some people who remarked it was a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding. The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, so they changed positions. Later, they passed some people that remarked, "What a shame, he makes that little boy walk." They decided they both would walk! Soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a decent donkey to ride. So the both rode the donkey! Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy and man said they were probably right so they decided to carry the donkey.
