            <div class='col-md body'>Samy Vellu was visiting India when he fell and broke his jaw. He was<br>unable to speak. Being the great leader that he is, he continued his grand<br>tour.  On the last week of his visit, the RTM crew was present for his<br>press conference. Although unable to speak, Samy insisted on sending a<br>message home to his Cabinet colleagues. Samy caught a chicken and showed it<br>to the camera. Next he took a goat, and showed it to the camera. Finally<br>he took a bag and displayed it in front of the camera. Dr Ling was the<br>first to see the video clip. He said, "Samy is telling us that India has<br>insufficient food because he showed us a chicken and a goat, and he wants<br>Malaysia to donate bags of rice. "Mahathir watched silently then said, "No<br>lah....what Samy is trying to say is HE IS COMING BACK. The whole Cabinet<br>was puzzled and look to the old man for an explanation. Mahathir reasoned,<br>"AYAM KAMBING BAG." ("I am coming back" in Indian accent).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was getting a little crowded in Heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was, that in order to get into Heaven, you had to have a really awful day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day. The next day at 12.01pm, the first person came to the gates of Heaven. The Angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, said to the man,<br>"Before I can let you in, you have to tell me what was happening in your life the day on which you died."<br>"No problem," the man said. "I came home to my 25th floor apartment during my lunch hour and found my wife half-naked. I thought she was having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. Immediately, I began searching for him. My wife was shouting at me as I searched the apartment. Just as I was going to give up the search, I looked out onto the balcony and saw there was a man hanging over the edge by his fingertips! Well, I ran out onto the balcony and jumped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But he landed in some tress and bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die! I was so mad that I went back inside to fetch something that I could throw at him. Strangely, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. So I unplugged it, pushed it to the balcony and tipped over the side. It fell the 25 storeys and crushed the man. Unfortunately all this excitement was too much and I had a heart attack and died instantly!"<br>The Angel sat and thought for a moment. Technically, the man did have a bad day. It was crime of passion. So he announced,<br>"Okay, sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,"<br>And he let him in.<br><br>A few seconds later the next person came up. The Angel said,<br><br>"Before I can let you enter, I need to know what was happening to you on the day you died."<br>"No problem," said the second man. "But you are not going to believe this! I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure, so I was really pushing hard to<br>relieve my stress. I think I got a little carried away, slipped and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But suddenly, this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, swears at me, and jumps on my fingers! Well, I fell and just before I hit the ground, I landed in some trees or bushes which I broke my fall. But I didn't die immediately. As I am lying there, looking up, unable to move, and in great pain, I notice the crazy man push his REFRIGERATOR off the balcony. It falls 25 floors and lands on top of me - killing me instantly!"<br>The Angel was quietly laughing to himself as the man finished his story.<br>"I think I like this new policy," he said to himself. Â“Okay, welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven."<br>And he let the man in.<br><br>A few seconds later, a third man came up to the gates. The Angel asked,<br><br>"Please tell me how you died."<br><br>"You will never believe this.Â” the third man said, Â“I am naked, hiding inside a refrigerator..."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: A letter from a Loving mother to his Son, somewhere 20 miles from Madras or is it Chennai (whatever) - can't they make up their fickle mind?!?<br><br>This is really hilarious ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My dear Vahe Guru.<br>I am in a well here and hoping you in the same well there. I'm writing this letter slowly, because I know you cannot read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen 20 miles from home, so we moved 20 miles. I wont be able to send the address as the last Sardar who stayed here took the house numbers with them for their new house so they would not have to change their address. Hopefully by next week we will be able to take our earlier address Plate<br>here, so that our address will remain same too.<br><br>This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine, situated right above the commode. I m not sure it works too well. Last week I put in three shirts, pulled the chain and haven't seen them since. The weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice last week. The first time it rained for three days and second time for four days. The coat you wanted me to send you, your Aunt said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with all the metal buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pocket.<br><br>Your father has another job. He has 500 men under him. He is cutting the grass at the cemetery. By the way I took Bahu to our club's poolside. The manager is badmash. He told her that two piece swimming suit is not allowed in his club. We were confused as to which piece should we remove? Your sister had a baby this morning. I haven't found out whether it is a girl or a boy, so I don't know whether you are an Aunt or Uncle.<br><br>Your uncle, Jetinder fell in the nearby well. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off bravely and drowned. We cremated him and he burned for three days. Your best friend, Balwinder, is no more. He died trying to fulfill his father's last wishes. His father had wished to be buried in the sea after he died. And your friend died while in the process of digging a grave for his father. There isn't much more news this time. Nothing much has happened.<br><br>Love<br>Mom.<br>P.S : Beta, I was going to send you some money but by the time I realized, I had already sealed off this letter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One afternoon, a wealthy lawyer was riding in the back of his limousine when he saw two men eating grass by the road side. He ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate.<br>"Why are you eating grass?" he asked one man.<br>"We don't have any money for food," the poor man replied.<br>"Oh, well, you can come with me to my house," instructed the lawyer.<br>"But, sir, I have a wife and two children with me!"<br>"Bring them along!" replied the lawyer and he turned to the other man and said, "You come with us, too.Â”<br>"But, sir, I have a wife and six children!" the second man answered.<br>"Bring them as well!" answered the lawyer as he headed for his limo.<br>They all climbed into the car, which was no easy task, even for as large as the limousine. Once on the way, one of the poor fellows said,<br>"Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."<br>"Glad to do it.Â” the lawyer replied, Â“You'll love my place; the grass is almost a foot tall...Â”</div>

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me either. Just leave me the hell alone.<br><br>2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a leaky tire.<br><br>3. It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal your neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.<br><br>4. Sex is like air. It's not important unless you aren't getting any.<br><br>5. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.<br><br>6. No one is listening until you fart.<br><br>7. Always remember you're unique. Just like everyone else.<br><br>8. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.<br><br>9. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.<br><br>10. Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.<br><br>11. If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.<br><br>12. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.<br><br>13. If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.<br><br>14. If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.<br><br>15. Some days you are the bug; some days you are the windshield.<br><br>16. Don't worry; it only seems kinky the first time.<br><br>17. Good judgment comes from bad experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.<br><br>18. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it back in your pocket.<br><br>19. A closed mouth gathers no food.<br><br>20. Duct tape is like the Force. It has a light side and a dark side, and it holds the universe together.<br><br>21. There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.<br><br>22. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your lips are moving.<br><br>23. Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.<br><br>24. Never miss a good chance to shut up.<br><br>25. We are born naked, wet, and hungry, and get slapped on our ass ... then things get worse .<br><br>The most wasted day of all is one in which we have not laughed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
