IÂ’ll shoot the bear and then have a proper lunch.Â”<br><br>You probably think this is enough activity for one bank of a lake, but I can tell you there was more.<br><br>A wee mouse by the hunterÂ’s foot was thinking,<br>Â“Gosh... if that fly goes down three inches... and that fish jumps for that fly... and that bear grabs for that fish... the dumb hunter will shoot the bear and drop his cheese sandwich.Â”<br><br>A cat lurking in the bushes took in this scene and thought, as was fashionable to do on the banks of this particular lake around lunch time.<br>Â“Gosh... if that fly goes down three inches...and that fish jumps for that fly... and that bear grabs for that fish...and that hunter shoots that bear... and that mouse makes off with the cheese sandwich... then I can have mouse for lunch.Â”<br><br>The poor fly is finally so hot and so dry that he heads down for the cooling mist of the water...<br>The fish swallows the fly...<br>The bear grabs the fish...<br>The hunter shoots the bear...<br>The mouse grabs the cheese sandwich...<br>The cat jumps for the mouse...<br>The mouse ducks...<br>The cat falls into the water and drowns.<br><br>The moral of the story is....<br>Whenever a fly goes down three inches...<br>Some pussy is probably in danger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold mild. Since he was an  Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the  old secrets, and when he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the hell the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared. Being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked,<br><br>"Is the coming winter going to be cold?"<br>"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"<br>the Meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.<br><br>One week later, he called the National Weather Service again,<br><br>"Is it going to be a very cold winter?" he asked.<br>"Yes," the man at the National Weather Service again replied, "it's going to be a very cold winter." The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.<br><br>Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again.<br><br>"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?"<br>"Absolutely," the man replied. "It looks like it's going to be one of the coldest winters ever."<br>"How can you be so sure?" the Chief asked.<br>The weatherman replied, "The Indians on the remote reservation are collecting firewood like crazy."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An old hillbilly and his wife had never been more than 7 miles from their home<br>in the East Tennesse Smokies. One day the man said to his wife,<br>"Honey, you know we're not getting any younger and I sure would like to take<br>a vacation and stay in one of those fancy hotels in the city before I die."<br><br>That sounded good to her so they started scrimping and saving. Four years later<br>they had enough for them and their never-married adult son to go and spend 5 nights<br>in a very posh hotel in the big city. They all piled into the man's old pickup and headed out.<br><br>When they got to the hotel the man said to his wife, "Mama, you just wait in the truck.<br>Junior and I will go in and be sure this is the right place."<br><br>When they stepped into the lobby they both thought they had died and gone to heaven.<br>There were indoor streams and water fountains, polished marble and gleaming brass everywhere.<br>But the most amazing thing of all was the elevators. They stood there and watched the lights<br>flash, the doors open and close and people getting on and off.<br><br>A stooped over little lady who was 90 if she was a day approached the elevators and pushed<br>the "Up" arrow. The door opened and she got on. The door closed. The lights above the door flashed.<br>They flashed some more and the door opened. The most stunning 24-year-old, green-eyed blonde<br>you've ever seen stepped off and went into the lounge. The son looked at his dad.<br><br>The dad looked at his son for just a second and then said, "Son, go git yer Ma!"<br></div>
