            <div class='col-md body'>A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon<br>their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would<br>transfer a portion of the mother's labour pain to the father. He asked if<br>they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favour of it.<br><br>The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even<br>10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. As<br>the labour progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go<br>ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20%<br>pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.<br><br>The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and as amazed at how well<br>he was doing. At this point, they decided to try for 50%. The husband<br>continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously<br>helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to<br>transfer ALL the pain to him.<br><br>The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her<br>husband were ecstatic. When they got home, the mailman was dead on the<br><br>porch.<br></div>

As recorded on the bank's audiotape system,<br>one robber said, "At least we'll have a bit to eat."<br><br>The robbers opened up a second safe, and it also contained nothing<br>but vanilla pudding. The process continued until all the safes were opened.<br>They found not one pound sterling, a diamond, or an ounce of gold.<br>Instead, all the safes contained covered bowls of pudding.<br>Disappointed, the robbers made a quiet exit, each leaving with<br>nothing more than a queasy, uncomfortably full stomach.<br><br>The newspaper headline read:<br><br>"IRELAND'S LARGEST SPERM BANK ROBBED EARLY THIS MORNING"</div>

Another man that was in there, asked,<br>"I don't mean to be rude sir, but how to you go to the bathroom with no arms?"<br><br>The guys with no arms replied, "Well I need a little help, could you unzip my pants?"<br>The other guys reluctantly says, "sure".<br><br>The guy with no arms says, "I need a little more help than that, I need some aim.<br>Would you mind?"<br><br>The guy, very reluctant to do it this time said, "Sure, I guess".<br>When the guy pulled out the mans penis, there was red pustules and blisters and hair all over it.<br>Reluctantly, he continues to help the man out.<br><br>When the man with no arms was finished. The other man asked him,<br>"I don't mean to be rude, but what was all over your penis?"<br><br>The man then replied, as he pulled his arms out his shirt, -<br>"Hell if I know pal... but I know one thing - I sure as hell ain't touching it!"</div>

A gorgeous petite blonde walks by him and the man<br>immediately gets an erection.<br><br>The woman notices his erection, comes over to him grinning sweetly and says:<br>"Sir, did you call for me?"<br>Bob replies: "No, what do you mean?"<br>She says: "You must be new here; let me explain. It's a rule here that if I give you an erection,<br>it implies you called for me." Smiling, she then leads him to the side of a pool, lays down on a<br>towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.<br><br>Bob continues exploring the facilities. He enters a sauna, sits down, and farts.<br>Within a few seconds a huge, horribly corpulent, hairy man with a firm erection lumbers out<br>of the steam towards him. The Huge Man says: "Sir, did you call for me?"<br>Bob replies: "No, what do you mean?"<br>The Huge Man: "You must be new here; it is a rule that when you fart, it implies you called for me."<br>The huge man then easily spins Bob around, bends him over the bench and has his way with him.<br><br>Bob rushes back to the colony office. He is greeted by the smiling naked receptionist:<br>"May I help you?"<br>Bob says: "Here is your card and key back. You can keep the $500 joining fee."<br>Receptionist: "But Sir, you've only been here a couple of hours;<br>you only saw a small fraction of our facilities.....<br><br>"Bob replies: "Listen lady, I am 58 years old...<br>I get a hard-on twice a month, but I fart 15 times a day!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A school teacher injured his back and had to wear a plaster cast around the upper part of his body. It fit under his shirt and was not noticeable at all. On the first day of the term, still with the cast under his shirt, he found himself assigned to the toughest students in school. Walking confidently into the rowdy classroom, he opened the window as wide as possible and then busied himself with desk work. The classroom became a bit unruly and he admonished them. This happened several times. When he could do work at his desk, the strong breeze from the window made his tie flap annoyingly. He kept rearranging and rearranging the tie as the class raised it's level of unruliness. Finally, becoming disgusted with the wayward tie, he stood up and took a big stapler off his desk and stapled the tie to his chest in several places.<br><br>Discipline was not a problem from that day forth.</div>

The first Juswan. Singh was interviewed by the officer in charge.<br>"Well, Mr. Singh, all we need to know is whether you have the mental resources to survive your trip to London," he said, demonstrating his cultural understanding of the applicant. "Let's see, nowÂ… if I poke you with this pencil in your left eye, what will happen?<br>"I'll be blinded in my left eye, sir."<br>"Very good, Mr. Singh. Now, if I poke you with the pencil in your right eye, what will happen?"<br>"I'll be blinded in my right eye, sir, and I won't be able to see anything at all."<br>"Well, Mr. Singh, you've passed with flying colors. Enjoy your trip."<br>Juswan then rejoined Harwan in the waiting room, and described his experience.<br>"It was being very easy, Harwan. That very nice officer Sahib ask you two questions, and you are answering only I'll be blinded in my left, eye, sir, and then I'll be blinded in my right eye, sir, and I won't be able to see anything at all and then you are getting the visa straight away."<br>So the second, and slightly more comprehension-impaired Harwan Singh, went into the interview room. The officer took the same approach.<br>"What would happen if I took these scissors and cut off your left ear?"<br>"I'll be blinded in my left, eye, sir".<br>"Hmmm. What would happen if I cut off your your right ear?"<br>"I'll be blinded in my right eye, sir, and I won't be able to see anything at all."<br>The officer was a little perplexed by these answers.<br>"Now Mr. Singh, I find your answers very difficult to understand. How could it be that cutting off your ears would have anything to do with your eyesight?"<br>"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dearÂ… I should be explaining myself. If you cut off my left ear, my turban will fall down on the left side and cover my left eye and I'll be blinded in one eye. And then if you cut off my right ear, my turban will also be falling down on the right side and I'll be blinded in my right eye and I won't be able to be seeing anything at all!"<br>Harwan Singh got his visa.</div>
