Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.<br>2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.<br>3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.<br>4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.<br>5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not get his ass.<br>6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ and his apostles as J.C. and the boys.<br>7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy,  Junior,<br>and the Spook.<br>8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the crap out of him.<br>9. When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say...he<br>was stoned off his ass.<br>10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T".<br>11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "Take this and<br>eat it, for it is my body." He did not say, "Eat me."<br>12. The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry."<br>13.

As her head is battered against the ground, she is<br>mere moments away from unconsciousness when to her great fortune . . . the<br>Supermarket manager sees her and shuts the horse off.</div>
