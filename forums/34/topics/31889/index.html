            <div class='col-md body'>As any experienced conversationalist can tell you, ambiguity is the key to winning any argument. Following are a few popular proverbs and counter-proverbs that will allow you to turn a conversation in any direction you want. Who can argue with the wit and wisdom of our fore fathers, or even our five fathers?<br><br>Actions speak louder than words.<br>The pen is mightier than the sword.<br><br>Look before you leap.<br>He who hesitates is lost.<br><br>Many hands make light work.<br>Too many cooks spoil the broth.<br><br>Clothes make the man.<br>Don't judge a book by its cover.<br><br>Nothing ventured, nothing gained.<br>Better safe than sorry.<br><br>The bigger, the better.<br>The best things come in small packages.<br><br>Absence makes the heart grow fonder.<br>Out of sight, out of mind.<br><br>What will be, will be.<br>Life is what you make it.<br><br>Cross your bridges when you come to them.<br>Forewarned is forearmed.<br><br>What's good for the goose is good for the gander.<br>One man's meat is another man's poison.<br><br>With age comes wisdom.<br>Out of the mouths of babes come all wise sayings.<br><br>The more, the merrier.<br>Two's company; three's a crowd.</div>

The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.<br><br>3. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.<br><br>4. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.<br><br>5. I have plenty of talent and vision; I just don't care.<br><br>6. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and inexperienced.<br><br>7. What am I - flypaper for freaks!?<br><br>8. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.<br><br>9. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.<br><br>10. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.<br><br>11. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.<br><br>12. Yes, he is an agent of Satan, but his duties are largely ceremonial.<br><br>13. No, my powers can only be used for good.<br><br>14. How about never? Is never good for you?<br><br>15. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to worship me.<br><br>16. Your idea seems reasonable... Time to up my medication.<br><br>17. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.<br><br>18. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message...<br><br>19. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.<br><br>20. Who me? I just wander from room to room.<br><br>21. My toys! My toys! I can't do this job without my toys!<br><br>22. It might look like I'm doing nothing, but at the cellular level I'm really quite busy.<br><br>23. At least I have a positive attitude about my destructive habits.<br><br>24. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.<br><br>25. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.<br><br>26. Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously, and change the subject.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following is an actual question given on University of Washington chemistry mid-term. The answer by one student was so "profound" that the professor shared it with colleagues via the Internet, which is of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.<br><br>Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?<br><br>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.<br><br>One student, however, wrote the following:<br>First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.<br><br>I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.<br><br>Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.<br><br>With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.<br><br>This gives two possibilities:<br><br>1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.<br><br>2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.<br><br>So which is it?<br><br>If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Teresa Banyan during my Freshman year that "...it will be a cold day in Hell before I give you my number" and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in aquiring her number, then 2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and will not freeze.<br><br>The student received the only "A".<br><br>Note: Only in university that respect innovation and talent then you can try this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My company recently employed a new HR executive.

            <div class='col-md body'>From the Washington Post Style Invitation, in which it was postulated that English should have male and female nouns and readers were asked to assign a gender to a noun of their choice and explain their reason.<br><br>The best submissions:<br><br>ZIPLOC BAGS - male, because they hold everything in, but you can always see right through them.<br><br>SWISS ARMY KNIFE - male, because even though it appears useful for a wide variety of work, it spends most of its time just opening bottles.<br><br>KIDNEYS - female, because they always go to the bathroom in pairs.<br><br>SHOE - male, because it is usually unpolished, with its tongue hanging out.<br><br>COPIER - female, because once turned off, it takes a while to warm up. Because it is an effective reproductive device when the right buttons are pushed. Because it can wreak havoc when the wrong buttons are pushed.<br><br>TYRE - male, because it goes bald and often is over inflated.<br><br>HOT AIR BALLOON - male, because to get it to go anywhere you have to light a fire under it... and, of course, there is the hot air part.<br><br>SPONGES - female, because they are soft and squeezable and retain water.<br><br>WEB PAGE - female, because it is always getting hit on.<br><br>SUBWAY - male, because it uses the same old lines to pick people up.<br><br>HOURGLASS - female, because over time the weight shifts to the bottom.<br><br>HAMMER - male, because it has not evolved much over the last 5,000 years, but it's handy to have around.<br><br>REMOTE CONTROL - female... Ha! You thought it is male. But consider, it gives man pleasure, he would be lost without it, and while he does not always know the right buttons to push, he keeps trying.</div>
