Black Grapes<br>10.Peach<br>11.Custard Apple<br>12.Pear....<br><br>What is your pick???<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;"><br>Orange</span></strong><br>If orange is your favourite fruit, it speaks of a person who has enduring patience and willpower. You like to do things slowly, but very thoroughly and are completely undaunted by hard work. You tend to be shy, but are a reliable and trustworthy friend. You have an aesthetic bent of mind. You select your partner with care and you love with all your heart, and not in for just a fling. You avoid conflict at all costs.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Apple</span></strong><br>If apple is your favourite fruit, you are an extravagant, impulsive and outspoken person, often with a bit of a temper. While you may not be the best organiser yourself, you make a good team leader and are good at taking things forward. You can take quick action in most situations.  You enjoy travel immensely. You ooze with charm when you are with your partner. You have an enthusiasm for life, unmatched by most.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Banana</span></strong><br>You are a softie!

People often take advantage of your sweet temperedness, and sheer vulnerability to a situation. You adore your partner in every which way, both for their mental and physical beauty! Because of the way you are, your relationship is always very much in harmony!<br><br><strong><span style="color: brown;">Coconut</span></strong><br>The coconut lover is a serious, very thoughtful and contemplative<br>person.

You tend to be self reliant, sincere and honest in your dealings with others. Though you are not given to making friends very quickly,but once you do, it is for life. You rarely, if ever, make romantic overtures. Your partner is often impressed with your sterling qualities but disappointed in your ability to show affection.<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">Papaya</span></strong><br>You are truly fearless and take much that happens in life, in your stride. You give considerable thought to things you do. You have a sense of humour that along with your generous nature keeps you in most people's good books. You are a go-getter in your professional life, and have a knack for being in the right place at the right time. You enjoy meeting new people and seeing new sights whenever you can.

You are quite shy and not very comfortable demonstrating  affection.<br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Pear</span></strong><br>If you put your mind to something you can do it successfully, but by<br>and large you tend to be fickle and have trouble completing a task<br>with the enthusiasm you started it with. You need to know the results of your efforts almost immediately. You enjoy mental stimulation and love to get into a good discussion. You tend to be a restless and high-strung person, and are easily excitable. While you are quick to strike up a friendship with someone, maintaining it does not seem to be easy for you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is some advice on fruits and how they help you.!<br><br><strong>SUPER FRUITS </strong><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Kiwi : </span>Tiny but mighty. This is a good source of potassium, magnesium,  Vitamin E &amp; fibre. It's Vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Apple : </span>An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Although an apple has a low  Vitamin C content, it has antioxidants &amp; flavonoids which enhances the activity of Vitamin C thereby helping to lower the risks of colon cancer,  heart attach &amp; stroke.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Strawberry : </span>Protective Fruit. Strawberries have the highest total  antioxidant power among major fruits and protect the body from cancer causing, blood vessels clogging free radicals.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">Orange : </span>Sweetest medicine. Taking 2 -4 oranges a day may help keep  colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent &amp; dissolve kidney stones as well as lessen the risk of colon cancer.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Watermelon : </span>Coolest Thirst Quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also  packed with a giant dose of glutathione which helps boost our immune system. They are also a key source of lycopene the cancer fighting  oxidant. Other nutrients found in watermelon are Vitamin C &amp; Potassium.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Guava &amp; Papaya :</span> Top awards for Vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high Vitamin C content. Guava is also rich in fibre  which helps prevent constipation. Papaya is rich in carotene, this is good  for your eyes.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">The Correct Way Of Eating Fruits </span></strong><br><br>We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths. It's not so easy as you think.<br>It's  important to know how and when to eat.<br><br>What is the correct way of eating fruits?<br><br>IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS!<br>FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN on AN EMPTY STOMACH.<br><br>If you eat fruit like that, it will play a major role to detoxify your  system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.<br><br>FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD<br>Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit.<br><br>The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach<br>into the  intestines, but it is prevented from doing so.<br><br>In the meantime the whole  meal rots and ferments and turns to acid.<br><br>The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the<br>stomach and  digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.<br><br>So please eat  your fruits on an empty stomach or before your meals!<br><br>You have heard people complaining - every time I eat water-melon<br>I burp,  when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat banana I feel like running to the toilet etc - actually all this will not arise<br>if you  eat the fruit  on an empty stomach. The fruit mixes with the<br>putrefying  other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat!<br><br>Graying hair, balding, nervous outburst, dark circles under the<br>eyes all  these will NOT happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.<br><br>There is no  such thing as some fruits like orange and lemon are acidic because all  fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did a research on this matter. If you have mastered the correct way of  eating fruits, you have the secret of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.<br><br>When you need to drink fruit juice - drink only fresh fruit juice, NOT  from the cans. Don't even drink juice that has been heated up.<br><br>Don't eat  cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get to  taste. So stop making 'goreng pisang' or 'durian porridge' if you want  nutrients.  Cooking destroys all the vitamins. But eating a whole fruit is better than  drinking the juice. If you should drink the juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before  swallowing it.<br><br>You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse your body. Just eat<br>fruits and  drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be<br>surprised your  friends tell you how radiant you look!<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><span class="small">Disclaimer : At your own risk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></div>
