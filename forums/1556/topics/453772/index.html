              <p>Canterbury is now home to the biggest and the best dark-sky reserve in the world.</p>
              <p>Six years of hard work and intense lobbying have finally paid off 
              with tonight's announcement that the Aoraki-Mackenzie Dark-Sky Reserve 
              has been officially approved by a global astronomical body.</p>
              <p>The reserve, which includes Canterbury University's Mt John 
              Observatory above Lake Tekapo, Twizel and Aoraki-Mt Cook village, is 
              only the fourth in the world and the second in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
              <p>At 4300 square kilometres the Aoraki-Mackenzie reserve is the 
              biggest, ahead of reserves at Exmoor in England and Quebec in Canada, 
              and the recently announced NamibRand Nature Reserve in Namibia.</p>
              <p>It is also the first "gold-rated" reserve, meaning the darkness of its night skies is almost unbeatable.</p>
              <p>International Dark-Sky Association executive director Bob Parks, who
               announced the new reserve, said it was about the best astronomical site
               one could get without being on the summit of very tall, remote 
              mountains.</p>
              <p>"The new reserve is coming in at a 'gold-level' status. That means the skies are almost totally free from light pollution.</p>
              <p>"To put it simply, it is one of the best stargazing sites on Earth."</p>
              <p>The success of the efforts to have the Mackenzie Basin recognised 
              was announced at the start of third International Starlight Conference 
              being held in Tekapo township this week.</p>
              <p>Opening the conference was Ngati Tuwharetoa paramount chief Sir Tumu
               te Heuheu, a former chairman of the World Heritage Committee of Unesco,
               the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.</p>
              <p>An earlier bid to the Unesco committee to have the Mackenzie skies 
              gazetted as a world heritage site failed because there were no rules in 
              place to protect the heritage of the skies.</p>
              <p>Starlight reserve chairwoman Margaret Austin, who also led the 
              Unesco bid, said she and all those involved with the application were 
              thrilled it had been accepted.</p>
              <p>"We're just over the moon.</p>
              <p>"Really, achieving this status is a tribute to the people of the 
              district who never wavered in their commitment to achieving it."</p>
              <p>Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism chief executive Tim Hunter said it was fantastic news for Canterbury.</p>
              <p>"It's wonderful finally to have recognition in both national and global terms for this premium asset.</p>
              <p>"It puts the Mackenzie Basin on the map as a destination of 
              international significance and sends a clear message to people that if 
              they want the ultimate dark-sky experience then this is the place to 
              come."</p>
              <p>He expected to see visitor numbers to the Mackenzie soar as a result.</p>
              <p>Mackenzie Tourism general manager Phil Brownie said there would be 
              "enormous ramifications and beneficial flow-on effects" for the district
               and for New Zealand.</p>
              <p>"Mt John is considered one of the most accessible observatories in the world.</p>
              <p>"The observatory is home to six telescopes, including the country's 
              biggest, which measures 1.8m across and can observe 50 million stars 
              each clear night."</p>
