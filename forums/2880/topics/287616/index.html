            <div class='col-md body'>Air Caraibes mulls order for four A350 XWBs<br><br>Caribbean operator Air Caraibes is calling for Airbus to offer a 10 abreast configuration on its A350 XWB, as it seeks to place a four-aircraft order by mid-2008.<br><br>Air Caraibes is seeking four aircraft to replace its A330 fleet around 2016-17, with candidates comprising the A350-1000 and the Boeing 777-300ER.<br><br>The Guadeloupe-based carrier operates its A330-300s in a nine-abreast, 372-seat configuration. Air Caraibes president Francois Hersen recently participated in an A350 XWB forum in Bordeaux and called on the manufacturer to offer the type with 10 abreast seating.<br><br>Speaking to ATI, flightglobal.com's sister publication, during the World Air Transport Forum in Cannes, Air Caraibes president Francois Hersen said: Â“If we want to increase capacity and cut costs, we want to have at least 450 passengers. The best solution is to increase the size.<br><br>Â“The target is for 2016-17 and we have to decide in the next few months which aircraft we will choose. The A350 XWB will be a good answer, but only if it is 10 abreast.Â”<br><br>Air Caraibes is also evaluating the Boeing 777-300ER, which Hersen believes is likely to be improved and possibly equipped with a new engine. But he adds that the A350 XWB has pilot training advantages due to fleet commonality.<br><br>He says: Â“We will have to decide before the middle of 2008 if we want to have an aircraft in 2016. It is difficult because I think Boeing could improve the 777. The 777 is too-big an aircraft for us today, but in the future it will be a good aircraft.Â”<br><br>Air CaraibesÂ’ long-haul fleet comprises two A330-200s and a -300 on lease from International Lease Finance (ILFC). It is replacing the -200s and is due to take three more -300s in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Hersen says the type is a very good aircraft for Air CaraibeÂ’s long-haul network.<br><br>On its regional operations, Air Caraibes operates three ATR 72s, an Embraer ERJ-145 and an E-175. Hersen says the E-175, which is leased from Embraer, and the ERJ-145 will be replaced with an E-190 in November.<br><br>Air Caraibes has a second E190 on option, but Air France is planning to deploy a second A320 to its Caribbean network.<br>Hersen says: Â“In a few months the capacity on the market will double [due to Air France]. We want to have two jets for this network, but we donÂ’t know what will happen. It is difficult to say whether we will firm it.Â”<br><br>Air Caraibes is using its first E-190 to launch twice-weekly flights to Panama and Costa Rica from Pointe-a-Pitre and Fort-de-France on 11 December.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Emirates seeks A380 and 747-8 weight control<br>By Victoria Moores<br><br>Emirates president Tim Clark is optimistic that AirbusÂ’ A380 weight-reduction programme will be successful, but outstanding weight concerns are hampering the airline from committing to the Boeing 747-8.<br><br>Dubai-based Emirates is due to take delivery of its first Airbus A380 next August. This will be followed by a further four in 2008 and within two years Emirates will operate 22 of the type.<br><br>Speaking at the World Air Transport Forum in Cannes, Clark said: Â“It is six tonnes overweight, thatÂ’s a fact about the A380, but the good thing about it is that Airbus has been working very hard to take weight out of the aircraft.<br><br>Â“We are very pleased to see that there is a definitive weight-reduction programme over the next few years to reduce the manufacturer empty weight by a few tonnes. Of course, that is of great interest to us and I am optimistic that they will get 50% of that weight out, maybe more.Â”<br><br>Clark is eager to take delivery of EmiratesÂ’ first A380. He says he is immensely relieved that the first aircraft has been delivered and describes Singapore AirlinesÂ’ A380 cabin configuration as Â“an absolute show-stopperÂ”.<br><br>He remains tight-lipped on EmiratesÂ’ initial A380 routes, while awaiting definitive dates from Airbus. But he says: Â“The aircraft that we are taking is the long-range version, so that will be operating on our very long-haul network to New York and Australasia. It may be flying, when we first get it, on some of our European operations.Â”<br><br>Emirates will operate its A380s in three configurations. Its crew rest-equipped long-range versions will house 489 passengers in a three-class configuration, while the non-crew rest version will accommodate 531 passengers. Emirates is also planning to operate some of its A380s in a two-class layout, with 617 passengers.<br><br>Clark says Emirates is still interested in the larger A380-900, which he claims would be a simple, but low-demand, stretch. Emirates would configure the aircraft with 531 seats in three classes or around 700 in a two-class layout.<br><br>He says: Â“We are still interested in [the A380-900]. We could do with a few of those now. It is an easy one to do because the wing is there, the propulsion is there. All they need to do is stretch the fuselage and Â‘bingoÂ’. I am sure it will come.<br><br>Â“There wonÂ’t be many of us who want it, but at that point it doesnÂ’t matter because the manufacturing economics become incremental. TheyÂ’ll have gone through the 200 or 300 they need to break even and beyond that, to stretch the aircraft, would be a $2-5 billion investment. WeÂ’d take it straight away.Â”<br><br>Clark says Emirates would consider the 747-8 if it met the airlineÂ’s requirements, but he is again concerned about weight. He says: Â“It is not there yet either. We are not ready to sign a contract. WeÂ’ve got to be sure that they would deliver the aircraft on the table at the moment, which will require some copper-bottomed guarantees.Â”<br><br>Emirates is also working with both Boeing and Airbus to find ways of cutting controllable weight across its in-service fleet, evaluating options such as shifting some of its paper literature into its in-flight entertainment system.<br><br>Clark says: Â“We are looking at multiple ways to take weight out of the aircraft Â– thatÂ’s weight that we control, like catering, galleys, carts, carpets, seat weight, water, magazines. We are working with both Boeing and Airbus to find ways and means of stripping weight out from the aircraft in a very pro-active manner.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China Southern Buys 10 A330s to Add Long-Haul Routes (Update2)<br><br>By Jiang Jianguo and Irene Shen<br><br>Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- China Southern Airlines Co., the country's biggest carrier by fleet size, agreed to buy 10 Airbus SAS A330-200 aircraft as it adds more overseas routes.<br><br>The planes, to be delivered starting in 2010, are valued at as much as $1.77 billion at list prices, the Guangzhou-based carrier said in a Hong Kong stock exchange statement late yesterday. The airline paid a ``significantly lower'' price.<br><br>Chinese carriers, led by China Southern and Air China Ltd., plan to expand international networks as economic growth fuels demand for overseas trips. China Southern, which flies about a third of the country's airline passengers, is adding at least 10 overseas routes before the 2008 Beijing Olympics.<br><br>``China Southern is trying to secure its market share,'' said Li Lei, an analyst at China Securities Co. in Beijing. ``It's particularly adding mid- and long-haul routes to increase its international business.''<br><br>As well as the 10 A330s, the airline has also ordered 20 A320s and 80 Boeing Co. 737s in the past year. These 110 planes will raise the carrier's capacity 43 percent, it said.<br><br>China Southern rose 4.5 percent to HK$11.62 in Hong Kong trading today. In Shanghai, it gained 7.1 percent to 20.87 yuan.<br><br>The airline will use cash and bank loans to pay for the 10 A330s. The A330-200 can carry 253 passengers in a three-class configuration and has a range of 12,500 kilometers (6,750 nautical miles), according to the Airbus Web site.<br><br>China Southern flew 42.7 million travelers in the first nine months of the year, about 15 percent more than a year earlier. Cargo volume rose 6.2 percent to 640,000 tons. It filled 74.2 percent of available seats in the period, 1.9 percentage points more than a year earlier. Air China's passenger load factor in the period was 78.3 percent.<br><br>China Southern plans to expand its fleet 22 percent this year from the 309 planes it had at the end of 2006. Chinese carriers may fly 185 million passengers this year, 16 percent more than a year earlier, according to the General Administration of Civil Aviation.<br><br>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a2IzcISiDrac&amp;refer=home</div>
