To the place where the rivers are going, there they are returning to go again.<br>8 All words are wearisome; a man is not able to utter it.

They only worship buddha and learn from his teaching. As for me,<br>Do i believe in God/Creator ? yes.<br>why ? Becoz i do not believe all this things are just created by probability. No one could prove the born of the universe, whereby it defy the law of physics and chemistry. Human body itself is too complicated to be created by probability.<br><br>Then what about devil? God created him? Devil is not the opposite of God. Devil is the non existence of God. God is love. Non- existence of God in the Devil's heart lead to hatred and any act which does not shows love.<br><br>Darkness power over light? Again darkness is not the opposite of light. Darkness is the non existence of light. If there is light, no matter how dim the light is, it will overcome darkness.<br><br>Believing in Trinity ( for christians)? Alot of ppl think it is nonscensical. Father, Son , Holy Spirit are a part of Holy Trinity ( 3 in 1). Can't believe it? Well, ice, vapour and liquid are 3 different form but they are water. But there are time that Father talk to the Son, which means they exist at the same time and talk to each other...but they are 1?? Well, do u know even water have triple point. Triple point is a state where ice, solid and vapour form exist at the same time at the correct temperature and pressure. Only water? nope, iron have thier eutectic point and all elements have tripple point. So in this case, God is like water, and exist in 3 form liquid, solid,vapour. And yes they can exist at the same time. Even God's creation can exist in a triple point state, y cant He Himself?<br><br>well again, this is my point of view and the evidence of my searching in life b4 i just accept wat i believe in today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Maybe u r born w/o knowing who ur mother is, therefore u do not search for her. But no matter what u believe , is a fact that one woman on earth gave u life, and this is a fact u cannot change. So whether u admit there is a Creator/ God in this world is also up to u, but if u think that all this wonderful life just came out form no where...that is also up to u. ( u not = raven ok...general view  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) . If came out from no where does that mean nothing created something??</div>

But that doesnt mean that one should take an excuse to accept what u dun understand. we have to find our own truth in what we believe in. even in studies, we always wan to know the truth so, why not life? however if one has found his/ her own truth, respect them! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
