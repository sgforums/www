Whether something works or fails, will still depend on your own business and common sense. And of course, how well you do your research.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks folks.<br><br>So I gathered that what we have in mind now is that university or schools can only provide the students with the basic business and technical skills and knowledge they need to know to do business or embark on technopreneurship. It's like students who have to learn engineering subjects to become competent in their engineering field to embark on a specialised engineering or engineering related career after their studies. Or even medical students, who learned and become competent doctors after schools. These professions have clear definition of problems in real life to solve.  However, for students who wish to be technopreneurs, it would be a much more challenging thing as their real life business problems are more complex and undefined. Schools can only provide them the basic technical knowledge and soft skills in what they need to know, and probably they can do projects and gain experiences from business case studies. Whether they can really be technopreneur in real life, it's a question, and a question that they can only answer, and they will only know when they are in real business life.<br><br>I'd give an analogy of technopreneur training to army training. Without going into war, we won't know whether the soldiers can really fight ?! But when they are at war, with the skill and knowledge that they have learned from army schools, then they will know how to fight it right if they want to survive. Agree?<br><br>So my next question is, probably current school environment is not ideal to train technopreneurs?<br>i) We may need more than just current school teachings, e.g business simulations like army training, real field business battle practise, etc ?<br>ii) Or perhaps we are too restrictive to our thinking and understanding of current education model in Singapore in the provision of entrepreneurship training ? If not wrong, I was told that universities do have incubators, and students learn in school and do real business there. Are these effective?<br>So what do think about these ?<br><br>Yes, I agree that not all consumers know how to make business deals digitally, so the technopreneur must know their consumer behaviour and know their market well before they want to do certain type of technology business. I guess many people have to play a part to drive technopreneurship in Singapore.  If technopreneurs are trying to do their parts in creating technology business, socially the tradition way of living has to be improved if we think there are hurdles to cross. It is not easy but it is not impossible. For example, if we talk about e-business, to share, personally, it's an eye-opening experience for me when I went to UK. Almost everything there, people will do online - esp.  purchases and hotel/transport reservations, etc, etc.<br><br>I guess it need not be necc for all areas to be digitised, of course if it could be, it would be ideal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I agree that payment online still has security issue to look into, but then parts of the business processes can still be manually driven, isn't it ? Offline payment still exists in real life (e.g. we still have cheque payment system, and bank tellers to assist <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) , so technopreneurs to be should not be stopped by technical issue if they really want to do technology related business. my 2 cents.<br><br>I guess whilst trying to educate the younger generation in schools, we need to put in efforts to educate the people of the nation as well, so then technopreneurship problems socially could be minimised. So i guess this brings us to another question to think about - cultural issue - Singapore has a rather interesting yet dfferent cultural setup, and this could therefore be the detering factor in the advancement of technopreneurship in Singapore. Do you think so ?<br><br></div>
