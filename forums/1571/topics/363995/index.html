              <p><em><span style="color: #333399;">Wednesday, June 10, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #333399;"><br><br>Steelhead trout that are originally 
              bred in hatcheries are so genetically impaired that, even if they survive and 
              reproduce in the wild, their offspring will also be significantly less 
              successful at reproducing, according to a new study published today by 
              researchers from Oregon State University. <br><br>The poor reproductive fitness 
              – the ability to survive and reproduce – of the wild-born offspring of hatchery 
              fish means that adding hatchery fish to wild populations may ultimately be 
              hurting efforts to sustain those wild runs, scientists said. <br><br>The study 
              found that a fish born in the wild as the offspring of two hatchery-reared 
              steelhead averaged only 37 percent the reproductive fitness of a fish with two 
              wild parents, and 87 percent the fitness if one parent was wild and one was from 
              a hatchery. Most importantly, these differences were still detectable after a 
              full generation of natural selection in the wild. <br><br>The effect of 
              hatcheries on reproductive fitness in succeeding generations had been predicted 
              in theory, experts say, but until now had never been demonstrated in actual 
              field experiments. <br><br>"If anyone ever had any doubts about the genetic 
              differences between hatchery and wild fish, the data are now pretty clear," said 
              Michael Blouin, an OSU professor of zoology. "The effect is so strong that it 
              carries over into the first wild-born generation. Even if fish are born in the 
              wild and survive to reproduce, those adults that had hatchery parents still 
              produce substantially fewer surviving offspring than those with wild parents. 
              That's pretty remarkable." <br><br>An earlier report, published in 2007 in the 
              journal Science, had already shown that hatchery fish that migrate to the ocean 
              and return to spawn leave far fewer offspring than their wild relatives. The 
              newest findings suggest the problem does not end there, but carries over into 
              their wild-born descendants. <br><br>The implication, Blouin said, is that 
              hatchery salmonids – many of which do survive to reproduce in the wild– could be 
              gradually reducing the fitness of the wild populations with which they 
              interbreed. Those hatchery fish provide one more hurdle to overcome in the goal 
              of sustaining wild runs, along with problems caused by dams, loss or degradation 
              of habitat, pollution, overfishing and other causes. <br><br>Aside from 
              weakening the wild gene pool, the release of captive-bred fish also raises the 
              risk of introducing diseases and increasing competition for limited resources, 
              the report noted. <br><br>This research, which was just published in Biology 
              Letters, was supported by grants from the Bonneville Power Administration and 
              the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. It was based on years of genetic 
              analysis of thousands of steelhead trout in Oregon's Hood River, in field work 
              dating back to 1991. Scientists have been able to genetically "fingerprint" 
              three generations of returning fish to determine who their parents were, and 
              whether or not they were wild or hatchery fish. <br><br>The underlying problem, 
              experts say, is Darwinian natural selection. <br><br>Fish that do well in the 
              safe, quiet world of the hatcheries are selected to be different than those that 
              do well in a much more hostile and predatory real-world environment. Using wild 
              fish as brood stock each year should lessen the problem, but it was just that 
              type of hatchery fish that were used in the Hood River study. This demonstrates 
              that even a single generation of hatchery culture can still have strong effects. 
              <br><br>Although this study was done with steelhead trout, it would be 
              reasonable to extrapolate its results to other salmonids, researchers said. It's 
              less clear what the findings mean to the many other species that are now being 
              bred in captivity in efforts to help wild populations recover, Blouin said, but 
              it's possible that similar effects could be found. <br><br>Captive breeding is 
              now a cornerstone of recovery efforts by conservation programs for many 
              threatened or endangered species, the researchers noted in their report. 
              Thousands of species may require captive breeding to prevent their extinction in 
              the next 200 years – which makes it particularly important to find out if such 
              programs will ultimately work. This study raises doubts. <br><br>"The message 
              should be clear," the researchers wrote in their report's conclusion. "Captive 
              breeding for reintroduction or supplementation can have a serious, long-term 
              downside in some taxa, and so should not be considered as a panacea for the 
              recovery of all endangered populations." <br><br>### <br><br>Oregon State
