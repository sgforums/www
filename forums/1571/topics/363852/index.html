              <p id="article_credit"><span style="color: #000080;">LONDON — </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">After years of criticism from environmentalists, two top Japanese restaurants 
              in London are now advising diners to avoid selecting the endangered bluefin 
              tuna—but have still kept the fish on their menus.<br><br>Environmentalists have 
              slammed the compromise, saying the two restaurants in central London owned by 
              famous Japanese chef, Nobu Matsuhisa, should take the dish off their menus 
              entirely.<br><br>The contradiction was discovered by environmental journalist 
              Charles Clover who has been researching the demise of fish stocks and the 
              response from the restaurant industry.<br><br>Many eateries in Britain have 
              taken bluefin tuna off their menus, following pressure from environmental 
              groups.<br><br>But several high-end Japanese restaurants in Britain still have 
              it on their menus and the two Nobu establishments had, until recently, resisted 
              the pressure to follow the prevailing trend. The restaurants are popular in 
              London with A-list celebrities.<br><br>Clover, who has been preparing a film on 
              the decline of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, said that he first did some undercover 
              testing on the tuna served at Nobu to ascertain whether it was bluefin. The 
              restaurants don’t actually state what kind of tuna is served, only the cuts, 
              such as toro (the belly).<br><br>DNA tests proved it was Atlantic bluefin and 
              then he was able to secure an interview with one of Nobu’s partners, Richie 
              Notar.<br><br>As a result of this meeting, Nobu agreed to put an asterisk next 
              to dishes containing bluefin and a warning about its endangered 
              status.<br><br>Under the asterisk it is stated, ‘‘Bluefin tuna is an 
              environmentally threatened species please ask your server for an 
              alternative.’’<br><br>The asterisk appears on several sushi and sashimi (raw 
              fish) dishes at Nobu’s restaurant in Berkeley Street, Mayfair.<br><br>However, 
              although the warning appears on the menu at its other London restaurant, no 
              asterisk appears against any of the fish dishes. The warning has only been put 
              on the menus of the London restaurants, but crucially the bluefin can still be 
              served if the customer wants.<br><br>Giles Bartlett, from environmental charity 
              World Wide Fund for Nature, told Kyodo News he was ‘‘surprised’’ by Nobu’s 
              rather contradictory move.<br><br>‘‘We want Nobu to take bluefin off the menu 
              and replace it with a sustainable alternative, such as albacore or big eye. We 
              feel that such high-class establishments should be setting the best 
              environmental precedent,’’ he said.<br><br>Environmentalists have for many years 
              urged the world to reduce its consumption of bluefin tuna due to dwindling 
              stocks which are not being replenished due to over-fishing, particularly in the 
              Mediterranean.<br><br>The bluefin tuna from Europe is much prized by Japanese 
              who like its fatty quality and have traditionally eaten the fish raw.<br><br>Due 
              to the popularity of Japanese cuisine in Europe, more people have become aware 
              of the status of bluefin and have put pressure on restaurants to take it off 
              their menus. A few years ago, British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay bowed to 
              environmental pressure, and now many consumers now opt for yellowfin tuna or 
              more sustainable alternatives.<br><br>No one from Nobu in London was available 
              for comment despite several requests for comment.<br><br>Matsuhisa, who was born 
              in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, has over 24 restaurants in 20 countries and opened 
              his first outlet in the United States with the help of actor Robert de Niro. He 
              opened his first London restaurant in 1994 and his cooking, which is a fusion of 
              Japanese and South American styles, has picked up several awards, including 
              coveted Michelin stars.</span></p>
