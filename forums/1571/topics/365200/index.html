              <p><em><span style="color: #996600;">Wednesday, June 17, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #996600;"><br><br>Although worlds apart, the way fish 
              learn could be closer to humans' way of thinking than previously believed, 
              suggests a new research study. <br><br>A common species of fish which is found 
              across Europe including the UK, called the nine-spined stickleback, could be the 
              first animal shown to exhibit an important human social learning strategy. The 
              sticklebacks can compare the behaviour of other sticklebacks with their own 
              experience and make choices that lead to better food supplies, according to the 
              study by St Andrews and Durham universities. <br><br>The researchers suggest 
              these fish might have an unusually sophisticated social learning capability not 
              yet found in other animals, called a 'hill-climbing' strategy. <br><br>This 
              ability of picking the best quality food patch by comparing how successful 
              others are at getting food from it against their personal experience has not 
              been shown before in animals, say the scientists. <br><br>The team of 
              researchers, which was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences 
              Research Council, suggests that in the case of the nine-spined stickleback it is 
              likely to be a case of 'needs must' as the anatomy of this particular species of 
              fish does not offer significant protection from predators to forage alone 
              safely. They may have been 'forced' to learn from others about where to feed 
              while hiding from predators as they themselves cannot risk looking for food 
              sites in the open. <br><br>The scientists say the findings, published in the 
              academic journal Behavioral Ecology, show that the cognitive mechanisms 
              underlying cumulative cultural evolution may be more prevalent in nonhuman 
              animals than currently believed. The findings show that big brains, like those 
              in humans, are not necessarily needed as a pre-requisite for cumulative culture. 
              <br><br>The researchers say the findings contribute to the understanding of 
              brain evolution and the types of brain required for certain cognitive functions, 
              both in humans and animals. <br><br>Lead author Dr Jeremy Kendal from Durham 
              University's Anthropology Department, and a Research Council UK Fellow, said: 
              "Small fish may have small brains but they still have some surprising cognitive 
              abilities. <br><br>"'Hill-climbing' strategies are widely seen in human society 
              whereby advances in technology are down to people choosing the best technique 
              through social learning and improving on it, resulting in cumulative culture. 
              <br><br>"But our results suggest brain size isn't everything when it comes to 
              the capacity for social learning." <br><br>Around 270 fish were caught using dip 
              nets from Melton Brook in Leicester, and housed in aquariums in a laboratory. 
              The fish were split into three experimental groups and one control group. The 
              fish in the experimental groups were given two different learning experiences 
              and two preference tests in a tank with a feeder at each end. <br><br>First, 
              they were free to explore the feeder at each end during a number of training 
              trials, where one feeder supplied more worms than the other, called the rich 
              feeder. They were then tested to see which feeder they preferred. In the second 
              training trial, those fish that had learned a preference for the rich feeder 
              observed other fish feeding but this time the rich and poor feeders were swapped 
              round with the rich feeder either giving even more worms than the one the fish 
              previously got their food from or giving roughly the same or less. In the second 
              test, the fish were again free to swim around and choose their feeder. 
              <br><br>Around 75 per cent of fish were 'clever' enough to know from watching 
              the other fish that the rich feeder, previously experienced first hand 
              themselves as the poor feeder, gave them the better pay off. In comparison, 
              significantly fewer fish preferred the feeder that appeared to be rich from 
              watching others if they themselves had experience that the alternative feeder 
              would give roughly the same or more food. <br><br>The team's further studies 
              have found that the likelihood of copying the behaviour of others increased with 
              the rate at which the others fed. <br><br>Dr Kendal said: "Lots of animals 
              observe more experienced peers and that way gain foraging skills, develop food 
              preferences, and learn how to evade predators. But it is not always a recipe for 
              success to simply copy someone. Animals are often better off being selective 
              about when and who they copy. <br><br>"These fish are obviously not at all 
              closely related to humans, yet they have this human ability to only copy when 
              the pay off is better than their own. You might expect this ability in animals 
              who are closely related to humans. In the case of the nine-spined stickleback, 
              they have most likely adapted to their local ecology." <br><br>Co-author 
              Professor Kevin Laland from the School of Biology at St Andrews University 
              added: "Nine-spined sticklebacks may be the geniuses of the fish world. It's 
              remarkable that a form of learning found to be optimal in humans is exactly what 
              these fish do." <br><br>### <br><br>Durham University</span></p>
