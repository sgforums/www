It is thought to result from an allergic reaction to chemicals absorbed by the contact lens or microscopic deposits that have accumulated on the lens. One chemical that has been found to be associated with GPC is a preservative in many contact lens solutions called thimerosal. Irrigation of the underside of the eyelids has been found to aggravate the condition.<br>doc: ooohhhhh, so what do you suggest?<br>xzz: I suggest I go to National Eye Centre instead<br>doc: that will be just $10 for brief consultation<br></div></blockquote>haha.... wish i can see xzz pull that off. at least we have an online med officer now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>received this email regarding placing tissues to reserve seats...<br><br>~~~~~<br>Dear Frens,<br><br>Be careful when you try to "chop" for places using tissue paper the next<br>time.<br>=) enjoy..... and REFLECT a little ya?? (those who have the habit!!)<br><br>"Ok... this is an Singaporean. I must confess I do not reserve seats at<br>Hawker Centres AT ALL.<br>Take for example Golden Shoe Hawker Centre.. you see people placing<br>tissue<br>paper and walk away. OK, the law says that you can sit anywhere and<br>hawkers<br>cannot reserve the seats for their stall.. how about the customers ?<br>Once I was looking for a seat, I had a fish soup and somehow, was in a<br>foul<br>mood cos the soup scaled me a little due to my clumsiness. So, I just push<br>away a tissue paper and took the seat. Abt 5 mins later, unfortunately a<br>beautiful lady tap my shoulder looking frustrated told me that she reserved<br>the seat. I look at her blur and said "err ". She said she placed her<br>tissue<br>paper there.<br>SO I bitched with her and said, "what is your name".. as far as I<br>know,there<br>is no name written on your seat and if you have reserved, I have<br>to question the building management why they did not block up this area or<br>have a reserve tag like restaurants do have..."<br>She raised her voice saying "I place the tissue paper there !!". So I<br>reponded even louder "So the tissue paper represent you, SO CHEAP<br>har..here<br>is 50cents, go get yourself another tissue paper and call the police, tell<br>them I violated your property.."<br>The guys around me actually burst into laughter and she was in tears,<br>quickly hurried away.<br>This is the ugly singaporean side, simply no class.<br>I have worked in US, UK, Australia and even in Indonesia.. never encounter<br>this tissue paper effect before.<br>Any Comments ?<br>Yeah! should have put the tissue on his lap and ask her to sit...<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>
