            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, would like to dedicate this song "My Love" by Westlife to my long forgotten ex~. Though it's been quite a long time of seperation already, I would never forget those days we shared and especially for Valentine's Day. Thinking back, how I wish Valentine's Day would be just as sweet as before.<br><br>Anyway, I'll have to thank you. Thank you for hurting me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have known that I'm actually a man. Because, I felt so sorry that I acted like a complete wussy back then. I thought being "nice" is all it takes, but I'm wrong. So wrong... please forgive me.<br><br>This song is for you. Remember? This was our theme song.<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mebbe it is time for me to make my dedication oso le...<br><br>This is for him who made me believe in love, who makes me feel once like there was someone who really cares for me, someone who always walk me home, someone who always listen to me whenever I need someone to...<br><br>Do you still remember the time when you stood outside the Ladies because you were scared I would do something silly inside after I got that terrible letter?<br><br>Do you still remember the time when we walked all the way to the concert hall just because we wanted to be wif each other for a longer time?<br><br>Do you still how we held hands when we ice-skated together while the Christmas lights blinked all around us? (How do I ever go back there now?)<br><br>Do you still remember how we can spend hours talking or just enjoy each other's company in silence?<br><br>Maybe you don't. You have already moved on, I can tell. Why am I still here? I am the one who made the decision that we shouldn't even talk to each other anymore, but when you did exactly that, why do I feel like my heart is being ripped apart?<br><br>I might look calm yesterday but my heart has never felt so tormented before yesterday. I want to look in your eyes and I want to let you see all the pain inside, but at the same time my pride prevented me from doing so. So I pretended to be happy, I pretended to smile happy smiles, laughed as if I was enjoying myself. But I could not ignore the silence, it felt like a wall has been erected between us now. When we used to be able to talk about everything last time, now we both behave like strangers.<br><br>The silence...it is almost deafening. i feel as if my heart has been lost forever.<br><br>I know you do not know of the existence of this forum. But I would like to dedicate this song to you, Xin Dong...Just want to thank you for everything you have done for me before, and to let you know that I have never hated you even though you have hurt me a lot. A lot of people said I was cruel to make this decision, but only I know how hard it is. But I guess it is the best way to move on...<br><br>And like I have told you last time before we stopped talking...I will always remember. You will always have a place in my heart. i wish you all the happiness in the world. Maybe one day, you will find a better girl who will make you happier than what I have made you feel.<br><br>You told me you don't know what is it like to love a person. I hope one day you will find out...I am sorry I couldn't be the one to give the meaning of that word to you.<br><br>i.c.y<br><br></div>
