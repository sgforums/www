Everyone is allowed to make song requests in this forum. Everyone is also allowed to upload their files and share them here.<br><br>5. Any song requests made by anyone <strong>MUST</strong> have the tag <strong>[req]</strong> beside the song title. This is for clearer identification of requests and faster responds from fellow forumites.<br><br>6. No CROSS-POSTING is allowed. Failure to abide this rule will be issued a warning by the moderator(s) and his/her topic closed or deleted immediately after the first warning.<br><br><strong>Behavior in this Forum</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behave yourselves</span>. As you know, we all want to be comfortable in this forum where we can interact with other forumites in many greater ways. Additionally, we'd want to enjoy surfing this forum and for some, it's a place to chill. So, there MUST be cooperation.<br><br>1. No one is allowed to start a thread that is subject to flames and other sensitive or crude remarks. The thread will be closed or nuked if someone does this.<br><br>2. In time, when I get complaints from anyone here being uncomfortable with certain forumite(s), I will need your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">VALID reasons</span>. Without strong reasons or existing evidences, I will not go to the extend of banning anyone.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Alright guyz, here are a few added rules by <span style="font-style: italic;">icyprincess</span> and a few by me. Please abide them too.<br><br><strong>Chinese/English Song Requests</strong><br>1. Each person may request from <span style="font-style: italic;">icyprincess</span> up to 4 songs/videos, given the amount of space constraints in individual hosts and also other life commitments. Hope you all can understand. If there're any more files that you may want to get, you may come back in a few hour's time or perhaps the next day.<br><br>2. If you are requesting songs especially from <span style="font-style: italic;">icyprincess</span>, I'd recommend you to get a gmail or streamload account so as to make the transfer easier.<br><br><strong>Korean Song Requests</strong><br>1. Each person may request up to 5 songs/videos from the list I've shared. If there're any more files that you may want to get, you may come back in a few hour's time or perhaps the next day.<br><br>2. I would recommend each forumites here to get <a href="http://www.streamload.com" rel="nofollow">Streamload</a> or <a href="http://www.yousendit.com" rel="nofollow">You Send It</a> to make the transfer easier.<br><br><strong>PM-ing the Mods</strong><br>Only email addresses are allowed to be PMed to the Mods. <strong>NO REQUESTS ARE TO BE DONE VIA PMs!</strong> They'll be ignored.<br><br><strong>File Transfer</strong><br>Music files are huge when one requests them at one time. They come in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megabytes</span> (MB)! So if you have gmail accounts or any other forms of accounts, <strong>PLEASE</strong> clear enough space for the song files you've requested to be sent to you. I'll only say this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once</span>! So if you don't heed this advice, don't come to me threatening to bite my head off. ALL PMs will be ignored.<br><br><strong>File Sharing</strong><br>1. Please try and share a little as well as requesting. This forum depends largely on the forumites' willingness to share their files, not just simply requesting.<br><br>2. As for album requests, or requests for more than five songs, I would try to send it. As you must understand, compiling an album or several songs takes time.<br><br>3. Do not report your post to me to have it fulfilled.<br>- Honestly, what do you expect me to do? :X<br><br>4. Don't try a, "where the f**k is my song? give it to me now!" - try being polite.<br><br>5. If you haven't receive your requests in more than two weeks, you can PM me or icyprincess to bump ur requests. Please try to understand, that we mods have our own lifes to lead and we aren't that free to send out every songs in every second. So, if you guys would be nice, we will appreciate it.<br><br><strong>Additional Rule by <span style="font-style: italic;">icyprincess</span></strong><br><br>Sorry but this is to make things easier on us as well as the other forumites.<br><br>Please dun request a song that you have already requested like, a day before. Keep tabs on what you have requested and what you have not. I will be sending out the songs with the titles as the topics, so it is pretty easy to keep tabs I think. Thanks.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">More rules will be added depending on the situations to come.</span><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This forum needs your support and cooperation.

You post your request here in this forum. Remember to post the tag [req] beside a song you r requesting.<br><br>2. As another user in this forum, I saw your request, so I upload the song file that I have with me, which you also want, and then post its link after your request.<br><br>3. When you right click the link, and click save as, you'll be able to get your file you want.</div>

If you can ban people, think about it first, they might draw RIAS's attention to here and turn the tables on you for a petty ban. I'm not really against the idea of 'file sharing' but I'm against bans.

I think using bans as a deterrent is a stupid idea since you're already infringing copyright laws yourself. Who stands to lose more? Not me, I'm not sharing, nor do I care about this nick, nor my personnal nicks. And I'm still wondering if the korean keuriseudo knows that moderators of their own forums does not equate to having the powers to ban people.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>-----<br><br>I'm Looking 4 Trouble, where are you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Anyway you do know that we will not abuse our power in that way. I know we have no power to personally ban someone from this forum, but if what you do is really drastic, then we have no choice but to report it to F| and she will be the one to take further action. So really, it is the same thing..cos I am sure when you join Sgforums in the first place, there is sth about you getting banned if you do not follow the rules. We just act as a remainder.<br><br>Thanks to you/or your other 'family' members for the help. Really appreciate it, and enjoy your stay here.</div>
