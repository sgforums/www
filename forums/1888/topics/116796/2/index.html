            <div class='col-md body'>I have something to say about the sharing attitude. Some of you might hate me for saying this over and over again, but we are trying very hard to make this work. It is not going to work if all you do is to just come in, take what you like and give nothing in return.<br><br>I do not like to force people into sharing, I believe it should come out from your own will. Nor am I being calculating or stingy. But I believe in order to make this forum works for a longer time, we all need to cooperate. This forum will only work based on the give-and-take attitude. There is a limitation to the number of songs I can offer, so I do still need help from all of you out there.<br><br>So first, please do make sure that you at least make a sincere effort to share your files. I have seen some of you(I am going to refrain from naming names here) who took the files from this forum and bringing them to another forum as to get more songs from other people. And I have noticed that in a way you are sharing your songs over at <span style="font-style: italic;">another</span> forum, but you can't make an effort to share them over here where we have given you a lot. And mind you, this is not just a few files, this is a request for a huge bulk of files.<br><br>As a mod, I feel compelled to urge you to at least try to share sincerely. Dun do it just because I said this, or because you are looking for more songs to get in return. Do it out of your own willingness okie, dun you think it is fun to share something that you think is good? I have said what I need to say, if there are still people who refuse to at least try to do this, it is very sad but I will have to disappoint you on some of your requests. Thanks for reading.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So here's how the new 'system' is going to work. Please note this is how it is going to work when you request songs that are posted by me, for now, it will not affect Keuriseudo's songs yet. Basically I decide to adopt this system because of some unfortunate events which have taken place since a few days ago. As I have said before, I do not mind sharing my files, but pls do show the correct attitude when you receive them. So based on my observations these past few days, unless you want your requests to be ignored and your presence not welcomed in this forum, below are some of the things you should be aware of and try your best not to do:<br><br>1. <strong>No Leeching</strong>. I despise parasites who only know how to take but do not have any <span style="font-style: italic;">intention</span> to give in return. I encourage everyone to share their favorite music here, it can be just <strong>a song or an entire album or just a thread to discuss current entertainment news</strong>, as long as there is some sincere contribution from your part, I will happily send you my files. I am not that evil okie, I just want to instil the <span style="font-style: italic;">spirit of sharing </span>over here. If you do not think you have that in you, then I am sorry that you might get criticized after sometime.<br><br>2. <strong>No posting of a huge bulk of the songs I sent to you anywhere else in Sgforums, where I can detect them.</strong> Don't think I won't know, I can say I monitor this place pretty closely except when I have exams, then I will get someone else to help me watch. I don't mind you posting one or two of them, but if it is a huge list, then I have to warn you that you might get into some sort of trouble with me.<br><br>3. <strong>Read all the rules</strong>. From now on, I will attach a link to the rule page in every thread I made, so you have no excuse to tell me you don't know anything about them. Ideally I do not want to bother everyone with so many rules, but chaos can happen without them. So pls, pls, pls. It won't take long. And the songs you receive will be worth it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>4. <strong>Don't complain about the quality of the songs</strong>. All of the songs I send out have already gone through screening in my computer, and if it can play on my Windows Media Player, I assume it can play on yours well. Don't complain whether it is a .wma file or .mp3 file, I can't possible grant everyone's wishes, I am not God.<br><br>Alright, so now on to how the new system is going to work. Basically you can just post your requests in the appropriate thread. I will go through them a couple of times in a day. If you haven't broken any rules, I will PM you with a password. The password is for the place where I will upload most of my music files from now on, which is a Gmail account I set up just for this purpose. So when I have uploaded the songs there, i will post a reply in the thread. You just need to go to <a href="http://www.gmail.com" rel="nofollow">www.gmail.com </a>and use this info:<br><br><strong>username:songrequests<br>password:I will PM you with this once your song is ready to be d/l-ed</strong><br><br>So log in there and look for your songs there. Each email will have the title of the songs, so just choose the ones you want and open the attachement, and save it to your PC. It is that easy. And after you are done, <strong>pls report back to the thread</strong>. Once everyone has said they have downloaded what they want, I will go and delete that song to make way for new ones.<br><br>So let me remind you, the password I will give you is for<strong> you and you only.</strong> Pls refrain from sharing it with others. I will also change the password periodically to ensure that only certain allowed members can go in there.<br><br>If you want to upload songs to share with others, you can do the same. Just send or forward the songs to this email address: <a href="http://songrequests@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">songrequests@gmail.com </a>and do what I do in your own thread.<br><br>Thanks for reading so far. I hope this will work for the best!<br><br>i.c.y</div>
