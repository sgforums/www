            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lena Park's 5th Album is out!</strong><br><br>Check out the reviews below..<br><br><img src="http://www.oi.co.kr/new_admin/cd_pictures_new/09002720010.jpg"><br><br>Released: February 3, 2005<br>Note: Title track in bold<br><br>01 Ode<br>02 Beautiful You<br>03 Long Goodbye<br>04 Moon<br>05 Miracle<br>06 I'll Look Into It<br>07 Future<br>08 Don't<br>09 If It Was Today<br>10 Mia<br>11 Single Ring<br>12 Very Thought<br>13 Ghost<br>14 Miss Havisham's Walts<br><br>It is said that when Confucius discovered music he forgot the taste of meat. Confucius is not the only inspired soul, because though he had the courtly music of the Odes, we have the beautiful, sensual and captivating tunes of Park Jung Hyun (Lena Park). Her latest album has dropped and there really is only one word to encompass it: Heavenly. Not only does she take her God-given voice and incorporate it perfectly with the music, but she accompanies it with such diverse and sensual lyrics that the listener is pulled out of their reality and thrown into the world of Lena Park.<br><br>Her greatest accomplishment with this album is that it is the first album in which she has made significant contributions to the production and cultivation of the album. And if this is any indication of her talents beyond her wonderful voice, then she will have an even longer and more prosperous career than initially thought. We were given a brief insight into the album with the release of her Japanese single, which the Korean version falls on this album, "Moon." The song was brilliant when first released, and it complemented by every other song on this album to elevate it even higher.<br><br>Every one of her albums is known for telling a story. The placement of the songs on the album is crucial to really understand what Lena is trying to convey through her music. This album is no different. This latest album, 'On and On,' is a story of redemption, of new beginnings, and of changes. She begins the album with a simple 'new age' meets choir concert song that signifies the curtain being raised and the show beginning. Then with the start of her second song, "Beautiful You," it is as if she appears to us and the audience is drawn into the world. It begins the rising action to the album, to the performance of a lifetime, and as each song passes the passion and intensity only increases. Each song possesses a distinctiveness that distinguishes it as original and as a 'Lena Park Classic.' This song, though a bit more 'popish' than traditional Lena, it is exciting, colorful, and a cultivation of relief and brilliance all tied together. This song closely mirrors a later song, which signifies the falling action in her album and performance, "If It Is Today," that also has a very exiting flavor to it and that marks a changing point in the album.<br><br>It is easy to comment on every song individually, but the truth is that it is almost impossible to talk about the album without any one of these songs. Each song adds to the album a new feeling and a new point of view that was once kept hidden in Lena's mind, in her soul. Through her magnificent voice, ever present and ever captivating, the music comes to life and surrounds us; we can see the vibrant colors surround our bodies as we interact with them. We can have many artists that sing ballads, rock, pop, and any number of musical genres. But what makes an artist truly talented and truly brilliant is their intuition. From any given album we can remember maybe a few songs and remember vaguely the feeling of the album. Yet with Lena Park, and a selected number of Korean artists, we always remember the message; always remember the feeling, because we are part of it, part of what she creates. She possesses a craft that many know of, few can explain, and even fewer have. Confucius was wise to say that music is innate in all of us, that it lives and affects us all. Lena Park really does epitomize this wise sage's words in ways that many will experience, but few can master.<br><br>Grade: A<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>* solidnet news *</div>

This song states: "I want a tattoo too!"<br><br>Some of se7en's friends had their tattoos done and shared their stories with him, also reassuring se7en that it doesn't hurt that much to get a tattoo done [a/n: what are they talking about? 0____o tattooing is literally burning your skin!]<br><br>As said by one of the YG staff, se7en plans get his tattoo done after the "moon shin" activities. Sources state that he will be getting the tattoo when he leaves for LA on October 16th, 2004.<br><br>However, se7en's family and his hyungs from YG are having doubts about se7en's decision. Some of the YG singers who had their tattoos done are telling se7en that it will be quite difficult to get the tattoo removed after it's done. Also, they strongly stated that a tattoo will not match with se7en's pure and innocent appearence. Even with all their persuation, se7en still has plan of getting his tattoo.<br><br>[a/n: please don't get a tattoo oppa. &gt;&lt;''' tattoos may look good on your danny hyung.. but it's just gonna look weird on you!!!! listen to your parents and fellow yg singers!!!]<br><br>credits || Shinhwa sarang<br>original article: yg japan, se7encat.com<br>translation: me [jadie]<br><br>* soompi news reports *</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>February 16, 2005<br><br>Lena Park: Mooning On<br><img src="http://solid07.net/newspics/lenapark5.jpg"><br><br>R&amp;B Queen Lena Park released her 5th album called "On&amp;On" on February 3. This is her first album in two and a half years after her highly successful 4th album sold 400,000 copies. This is also the first album Lena Park took on the role as producer which unlike her previously heavy R&amp;B filled albums displays serious forays into other genres. She also wrote and composed a record of 5 songs including the introductory track "Ode" and "Future" for a total of 14 tracks. The title song "Moon" is a one of her typical strong ballads this time featuring Chinese instrumentals. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the summer of 2004 but was delayed after Lena displayed disatisfaction with it. "I wanted real progress in the music," said Lena who decided to keep the grandeur scale of the 4th album while emphasizing a strong and bright beat. The album jacket are filled with photos of Lena backpacking in the Arizona deserts. Lena Park who put out her first Japanese single last November is planning to do activities both in Korea and abroad throughout 2005. For a review on the 5th album, look at the first post.<br><br>New releases: Boa will release a Japanese best album on February 22. It will include all her Japanese hits including "Valenti," "Shine We Are" and "Double." It will also include Boa's version of "LAÂ¡Â¤LAÂ¡Â¤LA LOVE SONG" as a bonus track. Also rap artist Eun Ji Won is slated to release his 4th album on February 23 with title track called "All Famy."<br><br>Japan Crazy: Bi will release his first Japanese album "It's Raining" on February 16. He will start promoting it on February 21 with a live Tokyo performance. Meanwhile Seven will release his first Japanese single album on February 23 with title song "Hikari." The album will also include "Crazy" which was released in December in Korea as a digital single.<br><br>* Solidnet Reports *</div>

I hope ShinHwa ChangJo who stayed with ShinHwa for these long years will celebrate with ShinHwa, and we thank ShinHwa and ShinHwa ChangJo."<br>ShinHwa debuted on March 24th, 1998 with their 1st album and title song .<br>7 years is not a short time. Especially for a dance group to stay together for 7 years is an astonishing amount of time. That's why their 7th anniversary means so much more. They never had a member leave the group and get a new member, they stayed together for 7 years and that's why ShinHwa shines.<br>Even though ShinHwa did not have any special events planned out for their 7th anniversary, but the fans will be happy because of how each member are working hard.<br>Eric's new drama  made its debut on the 23rd, getting a lot of love, and Lee MinWoo's single that was released on the 10th dominating the charts, is making the fans all very happy.<br>The group ShinHwa is succeeding by doing group activities together and doing solo activities. ShinHwa is opening the doors for younger stars to become megastars and we'll be looking forward to what they have more to show.<br>--Review Star--<br><br>source : Daum<br>credits : SM Club USA<br>translation : hee*kyung</div>
