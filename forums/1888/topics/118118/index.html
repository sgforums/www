You had such bad experience... I'm so sorry to hear that.<br><br>However, I'm more motivated to share files here and to make this forum a success. I don't expect it to become one of the best forums here, but I hope to see sincere supporters that are willing to be part of our team. By sharing files that we may not have is a fun thing altogether, rather than having to resort to Kazaas and all those spyware-loaded craps.<br><br>At the same time, this forum is also a place to talk about music and entertainment and share news and views, even likes and dislikes. I'm keen and focus only in making this forum a comfortable place to stay and to belong. Not creating a battlefield out of it. If people aren't willing to co-operate, my door is always open to them. I don't mind losing unkeen supporters. What matters to me most is people who are sincere and generous (not afraid to share).<br><br>It is better to have a small community of generous, and peace-loving people than to have a bulk of selfish demanding brats hanging around.<br><br>I would like to encourage you to be generous, not just only in file sharing, but in other areas of your life.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for your reply.<br><br>God Bless,<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>
