That time i met this really cute surfie looking guy. I was so drunk, but i remembered what they looked like. HEHE.. all i remember was them gawking at me like as if they haven't seen the female species before. My boyfriend tells me now that he thought i was such a looker and he had hoped to bump into me sometime in the future.. but he didn't have any hope cos i was standing next to the surfie guy..<br><br>AHHAH.. then that night when i went out with my girlfriend, we were talking and stuff. My boyfriend was talking about going to England for good and not coming back for 3 years. So.. my hope died cos i remember thinking.. oh dear.. the good ones are leaving. But that night we were dancing together and stuff.. ... until i got a call from surfied dude. And i walked out.. so i said hi etc.. my boyfriend saw us outside and was devastated.. hahah.. at the end of the night, i saw the saddest face i've ever seen. That night, I couldn't stop thinking of him. It was a Saturday, Sunday I went to the Great ocean rd with my friend. When i came back on Monday night, i smsed his friend for his mobile number. All day Tuesday i was calling him, i thought he didn't want to talk to me anymore. We went out for a movie that night.. he didn't come. The next day on Wednesday night, he rang and said his mobile was in his glove compartment and didn't know the whole world was ringing him.<br><br>He said he wanted to have coffee with me. So i said.. Yes how bout tonight? And we met that night.. he drove me to the city for coffee.. hahah.. i found out that the next day was his birthday.. it was 9.30pm then, he drove me back. I got my car and took my fav CD gave it to him as a present. Hhehe.. he didn't know where i was taking him, but i took him to my favourite place -&gt; Brighton Beach... waited till midnight. ahahah.. cute huh?</div>
