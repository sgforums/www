Do not let them take sgforums for granted where they can post freely anything offensive to others yet stop others who are offensive to him.<br><br>Do heed my calls and pleas.<br><br>I only hope for the best in sgforums and do not wish to see someone having special status when we are all equal.<br><br>Thank you for reading.</div>
