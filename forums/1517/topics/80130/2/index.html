These laws execute themselves. They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance. Thus; in the soul of man there is a justice whose retributions are instant and entire. He who does a good deed, is instantly ennobled. He who does a mean deed, is by the action itself contracted.... Pure "Evil" perhaps..."Karma" in return...with a tag of "Justice"...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Moral cowardice that keeps us from speaking our minds is as dangerous to this country as irresponsible talk. The right way is not always the popular and easy way. Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character....

Truth is generally the best vindication against slander.... Falsehood is easy, truth so difficult.... Some minds remain open long enough for the truth not only to enter but to pass on through by way of a ready exit without pausing anywhere along the route....<br><br>Truth is mighty and will prevail.
