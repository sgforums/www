U have to keep thinking we r helping him, he lose or not, i dun care. the thing is your're not making yourself look too good right now, and not helping anything by publicly screaming for blood. u have to tell me, whats the point of sitting there and starting so many threads if he dun even bother about u? u'll look dumb, u'll look bad, and u'll simply irritate the hell out of many people, who might have actually felt that u were right. when we have reason on our side, we dun hav to keep saying things. once is enough. yelling again n again dulls the effectiveness and impact of anything u were trying to say, any point u were trying to make. u need to stop thinking anyone not on your side automatically means they're siding him, because thats not helping your cause, and its making u look... a tad too keen on drawing lines.<br><br>when u have a bar brawl, the one who starts the brawl looks no more ugly than the ones who jump in. when the police come everyone's going to get arrested.<br>yes i guess i am looking ugly too now, but i have to tell u, there is such a thing as say too many times... and then it becomes useless. im saying all this very nicely, im hoping to bring some sense into all, even if u dun accept this piece of advice, i hope just stop saying things like:<br>"actually not , but see you guys so lame helping him . shake head.<br><br>as if he loss face you guys will die."<br><br>because, it dun make u look like the good guy either, nor does it look like an intelligent statement. just because someone not "on your side" doesn't automatically make him the enemy.<br><br>now, go enjoy your new car in peace ok?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
