Therefore, passing any judgement before understanding what has been said, done or assumed is not justified. It's not wrong to sympathize the victims involved, but pointing fingers is definitely wrong if you're not clear on the issue.<br><br>More importantly, it will be unfair to hold trial to a case where only one party makes their statement. To be partial, one must see from both viewpoints and their reasonings, before passing the final judgement.<br><br>Secondly, both parties involved are my friends. It hurts either way to say or judge anything without understanding. You must understand this, I've been through all these squabbles for seven years online. I've seen enough that I think that it might be better to let it pass.<br><br>If you feel I'm heartless by not taking sides, what would you feel if your children are fighting against one another or your parents are fighting against one another? I don't know if anyone gain from this, but surely it hurts me more to think I'm going to expect something occuring. I don't want to talk about what I expect to happen.
