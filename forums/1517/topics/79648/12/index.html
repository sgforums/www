As far as my point of view and understanding....<br>As long as bear dun come out and more clear the air.....<br>there wont be any peace in the forum......<br>If bear come in to clear the air.... the thread wont even last for so long.... do u guys agree??? whether ganna slam anot it another matter.....<br>"quote example:- during secondary school time i always skip class that y i always ganna public canning.. if teacher and principal never takes any action against me.. then i will think i m great and by skipping school is not wrong... and will contiuned my act...<br><br>The moral of this story is "i dare to skip school then i dare to go up to the stage and face the whole school and accept my punishment...<br><br>"yan jing yu chi"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by OCEANOS:<br><strong>[b]</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet to all,<br><br>Just came to know of such a thread, again i feel a need to speak up when it has reached the Limits of One's Tolerance. Let all be the Judge pertaining to all these issues, kindly express your views about it, you need not make a stand or show any support in any ways, just your views In all conscience are needed regardless adverse or positive!<br><br>From the above excerpts of the conversation, it clearly shown how "Meowsusan" being vituperate by villiany of 2 latters whom she took as friends! What is their motive? Is it a ploy to hurt Meowsusan? Who is the Instigator/puppeteer behind all these? Who is the puppet? Are Man "Puppet of Society" or Simply  "A pawn of One's own staged drama"? As Human of sentient mind &amp; capable of cognitive process, i am sure after reading these, everyone will already have the "Answers" in their mind! Substantial Evidences has already surfaced which is undeniable! Sad to know again my name "Oceanos" has been mention by people who seek to maleficiate &amp; asperse me! Anyway my conscience is clear &amp; No "Evil" shalt harm me, Let the Omnipresent Holy Spirit be my Judge! The Start &amp; End parts highlighted in "DarkRed" has shown such contradictory in its representation, One said literally "No need any teachings from anyone coz its their life, has all Individuality &amp; Rights" however the other just attempt to teach &amp; cohere another Individual who possess the same Rights towards his own beliefs &amp; values, what do you make of such incoherent actions &amp; words? Is there Integrity or Justice? The others highlighted in "Red" in my own perceptive, i deemed that as an "personal attack" on our helpless friend Meowsusan here who are being aggressed due to her poor command of language &amp; kind personality!<br><br>I just saw Meowsusan this evening during a coffee session organised by another forumite which she also been invited. She seems rather mentally disturbed, depressed &amp; stressed up which i felt very sorry for her unfortunate predicaments, at a point of time she even breakdown in tears while she relate this matter to us. So i hope all here will be the witness that if any mishaps occurs to Meowsusan, all will know who are the "Ones" who cause such harm to her! I am sure all who know Meowsusan personally or been in touch with her recently can see the Toils &amp; Effects on her mind &amp; body because of the issues that occurred over the past month has greatly traumatised &amp; affected her health! That further prompted me to speak up for her since the existence of this thread!<br><br>To the people who has been casting aspersion maliciously of me, i reserve all the rights to take civil actions against you for defamation according to UK Defamation Act 1996 which our country legislation is adhering! What is "Defamation" in layman terms "Libel is the written word." &amp; "Slander is spoken." Libel is when the defamation is written down (including email, bulletin boards and websites), and slander is when the incident relates to words spoken. I give you the benefit of doubt that your actions are not of such intents &amp; I do not want to see anymore new inputs of such contents in any ways &amp; avenues! i beseech you to stop &amp; rectify such acts &amp; deeds or be prepared to get my lawyer letter, we shall have it rectify in Singapore Subordinate court! </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Singapore's law of libel protects all persons against unjustified attacks on their reputation. A person is libeled if the words expose him (or her) to the risk of being: hated, ridiculed, or viewed with contempt, or shunned or avoided, or lowered in the standing of right thinking members of society, or discredited in his trade, business, office, or profession. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Last but not least, i would like to thank F.O.S for starting this thread for the benefit of Masses' awareness &amp; to redress grievances for our unfortunate friend, Meowsusan! Brightest Blessing for all good &amp; kind fellow forumites who stand up against all wrongs, accusations &amp; injustices brought upon our poor Victim of Other's aggression which has already happened...Yes in here...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span> </strong>[/b]</blockquote>Hong, from wat Oceanos posted, it seems tat u were already in jakatar.... n things between u n MS is nt yet settled...<br>so if u claimed tat things have already been settled but oceanos claimed not.. so isnt it kinda 2 headed???</div>

It may/will mean alot to parties involved but seriously: Who on earth never been through such chapters in life before? <strong>And the most crucial part</strong>: This matter 'seemed' huge not because of the parties involved - but because of people whom are fueling the fire.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Suzuki Hayabusa has long been the pinnacle of large-displacement hyperbikes. The new 2004 edition of the GSX1300R continues this tradition of speed and performance. The '04 Hayabusa comes in two striking new color selections and is equipped with a new passing switch for the headlight and revamped hazard lights.<br><br>The Hayabusa blends a cohesive mix of high-performance aerodynamics with powerful engine design. Optimum aerodynamic efficiency requires a precise fairing shape and the GSX1300R achieves this. Indeed, the elements of the Hayabusa's fairing, headlight and turn signals result in the lowest coefficient of drag of any Suzuki ever produced.<br><br>Motivation for the Hayabusa comes in the form of a potent inline-four-cylinder engine. The high-powered motor is equipped with a 16-valve, DOHC cylinder head with narrow 14-degree valve angles. Electronic fuel injection, ram-air intake, a gear-driven counterbalancer, six-speed transmission and large-capacity hydraulic clutch all enhance overall engine performance.<br><br>Anchoring the hugely powerful 1300cc engine is an aluminum-alloy twin-spar frame suspended by 43mm titanium-nitride-coated forks offering 120mm of travel. A link-type rear suspension system mates a bridged aluminum swingarm with a fully adjustable shock for 140mm of travel. Wide, cast-aluminum wheels shod with radial tires provide ample traction at both ends. Braking comes from six-piston calipers gripping dual 320mm rotors in the front and a twin-piston caliper and 240mm rear rotor in the rear. This combination of performance and sporting features creates the awesome 2004 Suzuki GSX1300R Hayabusa.</div>
