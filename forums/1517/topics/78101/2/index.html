            <div class='col-md body'>I have a friend who's guy beau is after her money nia, and she knows(duhz) but they are going to ROM end this year.  She's tried repeated attempts to break up with him, but he just manages to persuade her not to.  They've been together for 6 years.<br><br>Ok, anyway like that has anything to do with the problem here.  I've went thru the 2 pages of this thread to come to this possible solution.<br><br>Like you said, you are merely a close friend, so interfering into her private affairs would be a no go.  Telling her the problem straight in the face might cause even bigger misunderstandings.<br><br>The best approach I mentioned in short earlier is to hint to her.  What I mean is to sit down and have a nice chat with her, face to face and serious, no jokes.  Ask her if her decision to ROM is truly confirmed.  Give her 'what if's' questions to answer.  you should know what I mean.  eg. "what if you find out your beau is foolin' around behind your back?" and blah blah blah so and so.<br><br>Do it till she gets a slight hint and ask you back.  This is when you might want make your move.  Go nice and slow.  Subtle is the word.  You don't want to make yourself look like a kaypoh into her private affairs.  Nobody likes kaypohs, especially one that makes up nasty things about their loved ones. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
