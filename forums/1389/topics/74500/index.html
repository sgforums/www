I like it that way... less intrusive and allows us to focus more on building personal relationships with God...<br><br>and tithing is completely up to us.,... they wun come hounding after us with chopper or phone calls asking why we dun tithe... keke  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

So this bunch of religious 'holy' people arrested that woman and wanted to stone her.<br><br>Jesus saw that happen and went there and say 'whoever is without sin, be the first person to pick up the stones and stone her' So..one by one the crowd dispersed because they know well that they too are sinners and r not perfect. The scene left with Jesus and the woman because Jesus is sinless. So one might expect Jesus to stone her right? But He didnt, He simply said 'neither will I, go and sin no more' and allowed her to go.<br><br>thats my summary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
