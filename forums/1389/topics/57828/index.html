            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but<br>shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but<br>have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller<br>families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less<br>sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems,<br>more medicine, but less wellness.<br><br>We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little,<br>drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too<br>little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our<br>possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and<br>hate too often.<br><br>We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to<br>life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but<br>have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer<br>space but not inner space.<br><br>We've done larger things, but not better things.<br><br>We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom,<br>but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but<br>accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more<br>computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we<br>communicate less and less.<br><br>These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small<br>character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of<br>two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are<br>days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night<br>stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to<br>quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and<br>nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to<br>you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just<br>hit delete.<br><br>Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going<br>to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to<br>you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your<br>side. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is<br>the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.<br><br>Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most<br>of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep<br>inside of you.<br><br>Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will<br>not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to<br>share the precious thoughts in your mind.<br><br>Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments<br>that take our breath away.<br><br>HOW TO STAY YOUNG<br><br>1. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.<br><br>2. Enjoy the simple things.<br><br>3. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.<br><br>4. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is<br>with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be ALIVE while you are alive.<br><br>5. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it's family, pets,<br>keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever.Your home is your refuge.<br><br>6. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable,<br>improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.<br><br>7. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, to the next county, to a<br>foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.<br><br>8. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.<br><br>AND ALWAYS REMEMBER:<br><br>Life is not measured by the number of breaths we Take, but by the moments<br>that take our breath away.</span><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;">So sweet......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></span></div>
