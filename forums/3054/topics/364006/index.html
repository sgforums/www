              <p><em><span style="color: #333300;">June 9, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #333300;"><br><br>Driven by a decline in satisfaction with work life 
              and family life, overall well-being initially plummeted in countries directly 
              affected by the fall of the Iron Curtain, reveals an important new study. 
              <br><br>The research, forthcoming in the August 2009 issue of the Journal of 
              Economic Behavior and Organization, expands our understanding of the correlation 
              between happiness and democracy — and whether economic concerns outweigh 
              political reforms in their impact on subjective well-being. <br><br>"Although 
              one might suppose these questions are of interest — some might even say 
              fundamental interest, considering that they involve comparing capitalism and 
              socialism — they have received little attention in the voluminous literature on 
              transition economies," says Richard Easterlin, USC University Professor and 
              professor of economics at USC. <br><br>Easterlin examines life satisfaction in 
              thirteen countries in the so-called communist-bloc using self-reported data from 
              a range of sources, particularly the World Values Survey. Communist-bloc 
              countries first appeared in the large-scale Survey in 1989, when a 
              representative population in each country was asked to rate "life these days, as 
              a whole" on a scale of 1 (dissatisfied) to 10 (satisfied). <br><br>Other surveys 
              before and after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 asked similar questions 
              about specific aspects of life — such as work, health, and standard of living — 
              and about "the way democracy works in (your country)." <br><br>"The dissolution 
              of the police states and increase in political and civil rights in many of the 
              transition countries might have been expected to increase life satisfaction," 
              Easterlin says. "The sharp decline that initially occurred suggests that adverse 
              economic and social conditions trumped the political in their impact on 
              subjective well-being." <br><br>The study finds that the trend in overall 
              satisfaction with democracy is actually slightly negatively correlated to the 
              trend in reported happiness after the fall of the Iron Curtain. This correlation 
              is not statistically significant, according to Easterlin, but undermines the 
              assertion by some scholars that democratization in these countries significantly 
              increased happiness. <br><br>"There is evidence that, when asked about their 
              sources of well-being, people rarely mention political circumstances," Easterlin 
              explains. "Rather, they put foremost those concerns that principally occupy 
              their time, most notably making a living, family life and health." 
              <br><br>Satisfaction with work, childcare and health all decreased significantly 
              during the transition from socialism to capitalism, reflecting a marked rise in 
              symptoms of social stress such as divorce rates, suicide rates, domestic 
              violence and increased alcoholism and drug use, Easterlin finds. 
              <br><br>However, people were much more satisfied with one particular aspect of 
              their lives after the fall of the Soviet Union: their material circumstances, 
              including standard of living, goods availability and the environment. 
              <br><br>"The positive contribution of life satisfaction to improved material 
              living was outweighed by losses in employment security, health and child care, 
              and provision for old age," Easterlin says. <br><br>Disparities in life 
              satisfaction also increased after the fall of the Soviet Union, particularly 
              along the lines of age and education. Those older than 30, who had already 
              established careers under the socialist system, were far more likely to be 
              dissatisfied with life under capitalism than younger adults. Older people also 
              faced the deterioration of old-age pension support and rising unemployment 
              rates. <br><br>Men and women had about equal declines in life satisfaction, 
              Easterlin finds. <br><br>"The human cost of the transition was enormous, with 
              the lives of millions turned upside down," Easterlin says. "The impact of these 
              changes on people's personal lives and their well-being is almost totally missed 
              by GDP per capita." <br><br>While life satisfaction had rebounded somewhat by 
              1999, there is evidence to suggest that even by 2005 it had not yet reach 
              pre-transition levels, according to the study. By this time, GDP in the 
              countries studied had increased 25 percent on average since the collapse of the 
              Soviet Union. <br><br>"The life satisfaction measure, which reflects not only 
              material well-being, but the everyday concerns and worries of women and men 
              about work, health and family, is more indicative of the far-reaching changes 
              that were taking place," Easterlin says. <br><br>He continues: "Life 
              satisfaction is not an exhaustive measure of well-being. But if, in formulating 
              transition policy, some consideration had been given to this measure, perhaps 
              there would have been fewer 'lost in transition.'" <br><br>###
