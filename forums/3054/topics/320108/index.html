              reminds me of this
              
              NO one ever succeeded by learning from LKY 
              
              1. Durai had expressed at different time in different place to different people his "admiration" of LKY. And he had analysed and learnt the way LKY dealed with matters. 
              
              Now, look, this leads Durai to what prize? 
              
              2. Ex-HK Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa had repeatedly and openly showed and expressed his admiration of LKY's administration techniques and upheld of "Asian Confucius Values". And Tung really meant what he said and practised what he had learnt from his mentor with the hope to achieve what LKY has achieved. 
              
              Now, looking back, what good TCH had brought about for HK people? 
              
              3. Suharto was a close friend of LKY, and one can assume reasonably, Suharto had learnt and taken more than few pieces of advice from LKY. 
              
              Now, watch, what glorious ending did Suharto have ? 
              
              4. The deposed Thai leader, Thaksin, "was seen as a student of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's political philosophy. The senior Lee saw in Thaksin a leader with great potential and awarded the Thai with a fellowship under his name in 1996, the first foreign politician to receive such an honour. Thaksin was hooked. 
              
              He even declared at one time that he would make the Thai provinces into several Singapores. One of Thaksin's long-held plans was to implant the Singapore press model on the Thai press." 
              
              Now, guess, apart from the multi-billions he earned from business deal with Temasek, what other happy ending did Thaksin win? 
              
              5. Not long ago, Chinese Primier Wen Jiabao and HK CE Donald Tsang came separately to Singapore to "see how Singapore's system works". They return home, only to learn that what can work well in Singapore just cannot be applied elsewhere. 
              
              Donald Tsang recently is being under intense critic fire, accusing him bringing "NEPOTISM" to Hong Kong political system, and THIN THE BOTTOM, FAT THE TOP (in pay). 
              
              6. The Secretary for Food and Health in HK (some people said he had some background in Singapore health system before, anyone has more info about this?) Dr York *, is being in a boiling basin of critic, to force through a "Medisave &amp; Medishield sytem" which is a replica of Singapore's. 
              
              Let's see how things will develop and whether Donald Tsang and Dr York * can successfully implement what they learnt from their mentor. 
              
              7. Taiwan Ma Ying Jeouhad visited Singapore and praise highly of Singapore's govenment, "he added that 15 years ago when he was Justice Minister, he had already admired Singapore's determination to have a clean and corruption-free government. " 
              
              So, let's see whether he will really implement what he had learnt from Singapore, the crux of the issue would be to give a substantial Ministerial Pay Hike to his cabinet, a hike that surmounts the benefits that they could possibly obtain from practising corruptiion. 
              
              ======================================= 
              
              All in all, from Singapore to HK to Indonesia to Thailand, NO one had ever achieved anything laudable from lessons taught by their mentor LKY. 
              
              NAME ONE TO ME IF YOU COULD.

              <p>Ma Ying Jeou is different from our ruling party.   He respects democracy and will go forth do whatever that benefit his people in the country.  </p>
              <p>Taiwanese are commited to carry out to fulful what they desire.   Looking at it positively, I am encouraged by their positive involvement in politics.</p>

              <p>The reason for those who tried the LKY way but failed miserably - is due to the fact that it needs a 'Total Controlled' environment to have LKY's ways to succeed.</p>
              <p>An environment that do not tolerate any challenge to his ideas, his policies, and his dictum - not even from within his own party.</p>
              <p>Suharto failed when the more educated in Indonesian society began to see through the thin wall that was erected to conceal the corrupt acts and to protect the interest of Suharto, his family and his cronies from being attacked by Indonesian society.</p>
              <p>The past and present Hongkong leadership can only fail in their attempts to imitate the thinking and policies of LKY - without adapting to their own social standards - as Hongkong has a far more open society that allow its Citizens to participate in the political process and be responsible for their own lives.</p>
              <p>In contrast, LKY has placed the burden of responsibility for our own future on Singaporeans, while at the same time adding the weight of his decided policies without any consultation with Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The ingenious die-hard supporters will believe the ability of LKY and his Party in getting the mandate from Singaporeans at each Election has shown that Singaporean is largely supporting his policies.</p>
              <p>This is farther from the truth, as almost half of Singaporeans do not get to vote in an Election System that is rigged in favor of the incumbent Political Party.</p>
              <p>The GRC system was initially tendered to Singaporeans as a means of ensuring the political participation of the minority ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>It has unfortunately, been fined tuned to be used as another means for entrenching the Incumbent Ruling Party by having the GRC being enlarged, while at the same time re-drawing the Electoral Boundaries to wipe out constituencies that have previsouly proven to be stronghold for the Alternative Parties.</p>
              <p>Other strategies were instituted by LKY and his Parliamentary subordinates in passing legislations that chip away all possibilities of public support to any Alternative Parties - to the extent that records of the entire family tree of any supporter or activist in the Alternative Camp is monitored in the Super Cray Computer purchased by the Government, and placed under constant watch.</p>
              <p>If one happen to be a computer programmer, and is unfortunate enough to have Low Thia Kiang as a brother, cousin or an uncle, your name will sound the alarm if your company sent your name to MINDEF for vetting as part of the Team to perform any contracted computer services at MINDEF or any sensitive Government installation besides the Military.</p>
              <p>These are some of the direct and indirect methods used in the LKY First World to starve the Alternative Political Parties from getting any support.</p>
              <p>This is the kind of First World Country created by LKY that has made the ''Majullah Singapura'' National Anthem and the ''Singapore Pledge'' to become nonsense.</p>
              <p>Yet, it is remarkable that the trolls cannot see beyond the veil of the cleverly arranged propaganda, the shimmering glass towers, and clock-work systematic State supervision over the lives of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>With all the close attention to watch over the Citizens, can we be surprised that they fail to watch their own backyard, which resulted in the clever escape of Mas Selamat Kastari from a supposedly High Security Detention Centre operated by the Internal Security Department ?</p>
              <p>Yet the trolls will not admit to the deficiencies of a One Man, One Party, One System, One Vision Rule for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Even Russians have debunked Communism and Autocracy, and China is attempting to allow her Citizens to participate in the political process and control their own future at the village and county levels, and also at the National Level.</p>
              <p>Despite the progress around the World, Singapore's politics is regressing towards that of Zimbabwe, where President Mugabe is as adapt as LKY in holding on to political power in an autocratic environment, with a twisted and managed Democratic Process used as a showpiece to justify their own legitimacy.</p>
