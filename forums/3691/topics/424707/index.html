The new biometric identity and credential management system, using unique biometric characteristics - such as fingerprints, face and retinal images combined with risk analysis of biographic data (Passenger Name Record - PNR; Advanced Passenger Information System APIS; APP) into a single security framework - to accurately identify and verify each personnel concerning their right to be on a plane or any other mode of transport.<br><br>According to Sean Farrell SITA's Portfolio Director for Biometrics, "Asia is leading the world in the implementation of biometrics to improve border security, so it is appropriate that we are here in Singapore to discuss global security issues. The trend is to combine the use of biometrics with sophisticated risk analysis which based on data provided by airlines and other carriers to<br>governments, will enhance security."<br><br>He also added that sophisticated air border management systems that use biometrics and extensive passenger data analysis are currently being deployed with great success by governments and agencies in the region. The benefits of such solutions are two-fold; security at the border is improved and cross border traffic is processed faster. "It is important to invest now in this technology and to provide travelers with safer and smoother international travel," he added.<br><br>"GSA 2011 is uniquely positioned to be the premier forum and showcase for Homeland Security professionals from around the world, especially the Asia Pacific region. Homeland Security is no longer about individual countries or agencies but a sophisticated network of partnerships, latest technologies and pro-active monitoring and management. Technology enables agencies and professionals to stay ahead.
