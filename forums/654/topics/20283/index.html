            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br>Just giving some forms of opinion regarding an article read a few days, or maybe a week ago. There is this article saying about women marrying up. So why this trend is coming about. Also, which time is the most suitable time to get a companion? During school days or working days or?? Because most girls mind nowadays mature much more slower than those in the past. They believe love is everything and all that. But question, can love fill your stomach?? Can love make you live more comfortably?? And also, when girls become women, they are more materialistic, can I say that? Why are the females like chameleons, changing always just to suit the environment? If they are marrying up, then one day, I think without a degree or even a Master degree, local men can forget about getting local women, time to migrate elsewhere to marry the right one. Cause one day, in a female's mind, it is all about S 11, money!*sigh*<br><br>p/s :pardon me if you can't understand what I say as I have taken some medicine that cause drowsiness.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Don</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Virus, thanks for replying.<br>Well, I can tell you one thing, I don't hang around partying all night long although I have the chance to do that. Also I don't go round doing all bad habit things or rather immoral things like smoking, drinking, having causal sex although I have CHANCES to do them. One thing is because I have parents that doted on me and trusted me much enough that I won't do those things. I have friends who smoke and drink, also so going to pubs or disco to have sex with anyone girl who say yes. But when they offer me these kind of so called "entertainment", I say a stern no. Reasons, I do not want to disappoint my parents, I will have kids in the future(hopefully I can), I want to set a good example to them and also not wanting others to harm them, likewise I don't do it to others. As for your views of guys are also maturing slower, I won't really agree with that. And also, what do you mean by mature for a guy? I can tell you frankly that I am not offended by girls before, the thing is I feel that our Singapore society, many of the young one around my age are rotting away, they don't seemed to care. Especially the girls too. To them, chastity+morals=zero. I am just sad to see that. I can tell you one thing which might shocked you. I have a friend who is no longer a virgin. He told me that he had another friend like him who sometimes do those things, or get straight, have sex as though it is a hobby. Once when he was parking near one of those red light districts, a pimp came up and offered him girls with pictures, guess what? Those pictures are photos on student admin cards of a particular poly, which I will not disclosed. It includes students even from the BA cos! In another words, even girls from Poly are actually selling themselves, I am sad to see that.<br>Regarding that money things, I do not say I don't like money, but enough money for a decent life is enough for me. What I mean in those girls or women cases are the extreme type, for money, they actually can say yes even to a guy they might not like and then marry them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don: thats putting it really generally... but I guess its true to a certain extent... but to generalise as you have done is not right... there are the "mature" and "decent" girls out there too... so you are not being fair to them and their upbringing if you just loosely declare them as immature and immoral... leave it alone... no one is asking you to go after those very girls you are so loave of... just sit and wait till "the one" comes along... I am sure there are girls that still fit your criteria of a good wife...<br><br>think about it... but be fair....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As to you virus,<br>well gf, maybe nearly going to have, but I chickened out last minute, that was in Sec 3 I think. Thinking back, how stupid I am to even think of having a relationship, that year, was my worse year in sec school days, worse results.<br>So to be more direct, never had one gf before, still fresh in every part of me. Never get to "enjoy" kisses and hugs. hehehe<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Don</div>
