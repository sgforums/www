            <div class='col-md body'>Dreams can be messages of things about to happen.<br><br>By learning the symbols of the dreams, we can get a feel of what's coming. I have found that my dreams will manifest its meaning within one month of the dreaming. Usually, the dreams with strong messages are long and elaborate.<br><br>Over time, it has appears to me that the personality/ego is not the one thinking... the 'thinking/intention/planning' is occuring at a higher level of the soul ( subconscious mind). That could be why, the dreams events occurs in physicality after a while. Dreams are messages from soul level.<br><br>Also it appears to me that the subsconscious mind is a karmic storehouse. Our unknown karmic patterns are stored there, carried for lifetimes. It is those thoughtforms/impulses inside there that gives us the expereinces(good/bad) in our life.This is the basis of karma.  So... there is truly no victim in life. Every single expereince in life is self-arised.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by sinweiy:<br>Just learn from Ven Shen Kai's audio how dreams works:<br>(so can clear some doubts)<br><br>Buddhism wants you to doubt. Big doubt = big realisation. Small doubt = small realisation. No doubt = no realisation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Kinds of dreams:<br>1) se yin chan meng (form-based dreams) - what we see in color can become dream. Example you see a base-ball tournament, then when you come back you dream about it.<br>2) shou yin chan meng (feeling-based dreams) - you go to a place and there's feelings, example when people insult you or praise you. They can cause one to dream about it.<br>3) xiang yin chan meng (perception-based dreams) - think of it now and daily, like thinking of fishing, then one day, you really will go fishing.<br>4) xing yin chan meng (mental fabrication-based dreams) - example when you come back from fishing, and you feel happy about it, then when you dream, you'll still dream of fishing.<br>5) si yin chan meng (consciousness-based dreams) - 'si' or consciousness is dualism. Thinking of how in the past people used to fish and how people use to fish now, then when you see documentary on fishing and you knew the know how. Our dualistic views can cause dreams too.<br>6) sickness/4 elements imbalance based dreams - Another form of dreaming is condition by the weather or in other word the 4 elements. Due to sickness, our 4 elements are in balance.<br>7) karma seed based dreams - Dreams that are due to the accumulation of karma seeds be it good or bad, in our Alaya (Stored Consciouness) through out our cycle of rebirths.<br><strong>8 ) karma fruition based dreams - Dreams that are due to the coming fruition of karma (future karmic events about to unfold)</strong><br>9) emotional based dreams - Dreams that are due to family love, friendship love, spouse love, etcs. The emotion of 2 party coming together<br>10) divine intervention based dreams - Dreams that are cause by intervention of Buddha, bodhisattvas or saints, for the sake of delivering sentient beings.<br><br>note:<br>All the 5 aggregates can cause dreams. Another form of dreaming is condition by the weather or in other word the 4 elements. Due to sickness, our 4 elements are in balance. Example when dream of flying, the wind element is in balanced. For people who always get angry easily, they are bound to dream a lot. If one imagine of flying, one can also dream of flying. Like for children who watch Superman, at night they too can dream of flying. All are projection from the 8th consciousness.<br><br>Amituofo!<br>/\<br>[/b]</blockquote>I believe not all dreams tell the future, but some do, as karma unfolds and the 'subconscious mind' knows it.</div>
