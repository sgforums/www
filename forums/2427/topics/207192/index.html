            <div class='col-md body'><strong>TV Presenters in Hot Water Over Sexy Photo Spread</strong><br><br>Presenters from Korea's three terrestrial networks -- MBC's Lee Jung-min, KBS's Kim Kyoung-ran, and SBS's Kim Ji-yeon -- have all posed for a sexy photo shoot that will appear in the September issue of men's magazine Arena.<br><br>In a press release, the magazine says the sexy transformation of the three was due to the makeup, revealing clothes and hairstyle they sport in the shots. Along with the release, the magazine sent a sneak preview of the three in relatively suggestive outfits. Lee Jung-min (MBC) appears in an off-the-s! houlder dress, Kim Ji-yeon's outfit shows off her chest, and Kim Kyoung-ran's getup emphasizes her waist.<br><img src="http://english.chosun.com/media/photo/news/200608/200608220022_01.jpg"><br>But trouble is brewing since a couple of the presenters failed to report their external activity to their employers, as required by company policy. Guardians of morality also say it is unacceptable for figures on public television, where a certain level of dignity needs to be preserved, to appear in suggestive photographs.<br><img src="http://english.chosun.com/media/photo/news/200608/200608220022_02.jpg"><br>MBC says Lee Jung-min made no report before shooting the photo spread, in a "clear violation" of company policy, "After receiving the details, we will decide what measures to take,"  it said. "According to Lee's explanation, she received an assurance from the magazine that it would not run any advance PR and said that the content of the spread are far from suggestive, Lee herself appears to have been fooled, so we will most likely be able to allow for extenuating circumstances." Lee has declined to comment.<br><img src="http://english.chosun.com/media/photo/news/200608/200608220022_03.jpg"><br>SBS says it was! a mistake of Kim Ji-yeon not let the company know, but the magazine m ay not have been on the straight and narrow, so there is no need for disciplinary measures. KBS is also looking into the details, but Kim Kyoung-ran had told the company about the shoot in advance, and since her pictures cannot be said to have been any more provocative than those of the other presenters, there does not seem to be a problem.<br><br>Lee Jung-min hosts MBC's "Wonder World", "Sports News" and"Sports Magazine." Kim Kyoung-ran hosts KBS's "Sponge," "Open Concert"and "Movie Conquest", while Kim Ji-yeon presents the SBS show "Morning Wide."<br></div>
