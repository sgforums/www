            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Train Cafe takes hands-on approach in fight against molesting</strong><br><br>Groping remains a painful fact of life for Japan's female train<br>commuters, even with most cities now having Women Only carriages to<br>combat the heinous issue, but molesting addiction has recently started<br>attracting headlines, according to Weekly Playboy.<br><br>Celebrity economist Kazuhide Uekusa's arrest last month for groping --<br>his third sex charge in eight years -- has thrown the spotlight on the<br>scores of train molesters who simply cannot help themselves.<br><br>Train Cafe, an adult's club in the basement of a seedy building in<br>Tokyo's Ikebukuro district, claims to be combating the crime of<br>molestation by getting chikan, or gropers, off the streets.<br><br>Train Cafe is a members' only club and is staffed by young women<br>dressed in school uniforms or aprons. Membership costs 5,000 yen and<br>there is a 2,000 yen payment for a cup of tea levied with each visit.<br>A subsequent payment of 3,600 yen for 20 minutes permits members to<br>partake of Train Cafe's services.<br><br>Those services are carried out in a room refurbished so that it looks<br>exactly like the inside of a carriage on the Yamanote Line, the train<br>that loops the central Tokyo area. Young women stand at strategic<br>points in the carriage and patrons are permitted to fondle them in<br>whatever way they please. An extra payment of 5,000 yen gives patrons<br>the option of selecting the woman they want to ride with for a<br>15-minute period.<br><br>Male customers, of who the club says there are 4,000, are not allowed<br>to ejaculate in the establishment.<br><br>Train Cafe members are offered a virtual reality trip on the Yamanote<br>Line.<br><br>"During the 20 minute session, the trip takes you from Ikebukuro to<br>Meguro (about one-third of the Yamanote Line's 60-minute complete<br>loop). With each stop, the doors of the carriage open and the girls<br>get on and off the train. We use actual recordings of the conductors'<br>announcements and LCD screens outside the window display actual<br>footage of the trip along the Yamanote Line," Train Cafe's operator<br>tells Weekly Playboy. "We cannot be beaten when it comes to reality."<br><br>Train Cafe's operator tells the weekly that the club's membership is<br>largely based on men in the early to mid-40s. He adds that many<br>customers enter the establishment saying that they had just ridden<br>trains and been driven almost mad by temptation, but made it to the<br>club before tackling an innocent woman commuter.<br><br>"We have a crime reducing effect," the operator says.<br><br>Far from feeling demeaned, women working at the club say they enjoy it.<br><br>"I loath real chikan. But if I'm attacked by one, I'm too scared to do<br>anything and just shut up. I really, really hate it," 20-year-old Rin<br>tells the weekly. "But here, all the customers are members. You know<br>you're going to be felt up and it's a good place to make friends, so I<br>enjoy it."<br></div>
