            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Actress Lee Hye-young sues ex-husband for fraud</strong><br><br>Actress Lee Hye-young is suing her ex-husband for fraud, according to<br>National Police Agency.<br><br>The 34-year-old actress Lee filed a lawsuit against her ex-husband,<br>singer Lee Sang-min, for fraud, claming that he cheated her, taking<br>about 2.2 billion won (~$2.2 million) prior to their marriage until<br>they were divorced last year.<br><br>Her 33-year-old ex-husband, who was also a member of the now disbanded<br>K-pop group Roo'ra, denied all the claims and said the case will be<br>settled amicably since it was brought through misunderstanding.<br><br>In the suit, Lee claimed that her ex-husband forced her to pose as a<br>nude model for business purposes, taking 50 million won (~$50,000) for<br>the contract and 30 million won (~$30,000) worth of benefits from the<br>project.<br><br>She also claimed he bought cars on installment programs under her<br>name, but did not pay for them, causing her enormous financial damage.<br>She added that Lee had not returned money he had borrowed it in her<br>name, and also asked her to borrow money from her friends to support<br>his business.<br><br>Regarding the nude picture project, Lee Sang-min previously said that<br>he never forced her wife to do it. He also said that he already paid<br>back all the money he borrowed for cars.<br><br>Lee will settle the complaint once the police investigation starts,<br>according to his acquaintance.<br><br>Meanwhile, Ko Young-wook, who is Lee Sang-min's friend and an<br>ex-member of Roo'ra expressed concerns about Lee's suit.<br><br>"As far as I know, Lee Sang-min is troubled with debts and this suit<br>might be related to that problem. I hope they reach a peaceful<br>agreement," he said.<br><br>A police official said Lee Sang-min was not only sued for fraud by his<br>ex-wife, but also by two other people, who are claiming 4 billion won<br>from Lee.<br><br>Police will summon Lee Sang-min next month and investigate the<br>accusations. The Lees married in June 2004 after 10 years of romance<br>but ended up in divorce in August 2005.<br></div>
