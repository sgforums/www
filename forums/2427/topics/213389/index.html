            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Business as usual in Bangkok's red light district </strong><br><br>BANGKOK - When troops seized power in the middle of the night,<br>Bangkok's infamous Patpong red light district did not blink. And<br>hours later it was business as usual at Spanky's Bar and the Electric<br>Showgirls.<br><br>"I was up to 3:00 am looking for lots of fornication with women and I<br>didn't see any soldiers," said English tourist Barney Humble,<br>recalling that images of the coup had flashed up television screens<br>in the bars.<br><br>"It was exaggerated on the telly," he added, sipping a beer under the<br>watchful eye of two scantily-clad bar girls the following evening.<br><br>Patpong is a notorious strip of go-go bars at the heart of one of the<br>most famous red light districts in the world catering mainly to<br>foreigners attracted by Thailand's huge sex industry.<br><br>The day after the military seized power market vendors could be seen<br>unpacking stalls loaded with fake Polo shirts, blackmarket DVDs and<br>illegal pornography.<br><br>Bar staff slowly trickled back to work readying for the usual influx<br>of sex tourists, curious holidaymakers and expatriate regulars.<br><br>Joe Morrow, a 39-year-old tourist from England, was out enjoying<br>Bangkok's nightlife when news of the coup broke Tuesday night, but he<br>said it had not affected his holiday at all.<br><br>Plans for the following night included "night market, beer, drinks,<br>women for the ugly ones," he said, gesturing to his friends, and<br>then "back to the hotel."<br><br>"Seriously, we're not doing anything different, just normal," he told<br>AFP.<br><br>Business owners and bar workers appeared to share the tourists'<br>nonchalance about the coup, which unfolded Tuesday night when tanks<br>and armed soldiers surrounded key government buildings in central<br>Bangkok.<br><br>"Everything is open, we don't have concerns about this. It is the<br>same as before," said Noon, a waiter at Patty's Fiesta Mexican<br>restaurant.<br><br>Naiyana Nongnuch, 32, a cashier at a Patpong bar, said that her<br>customers carried on drinking Tuesday night as if nothing had<br>happened.<br><br>"They stayed until the bar closed," she said. "I don't think there<br>will be less customers as many are Bangkok-based foreigners and they<br>know the situation well."<br><br>But Noi, a hostess in a beer bar, said she thought the coup would<br>leave people reluctant to venture outside. "I think there will be<br>less customers," she said. "They may want to stay home and watch the<br>news."<br><br>Sak, a 32-year-old waiter at Dick's Cafe, said the coup may have some<br>effect on tourism in Thailand, but was confident that his bar would<br>be spared.<br><br>"We have regular customers and our location is far from the centre<br>where there was a lot of troops," he said.<br><br>Thailand was until last year the world's leading destination for sex<br>tourists, according to Interpol. It was bumped off the top spot by<br>Brazil, but Patpong still maintains a reputation for sleazy nightlife<br>and lurid live sex shows.<br><br>Although prostitution is officially illegal in Thailand, estimates<br>for the number of sex workers range from 80,000 to two million women<br>and men.<br></div>
