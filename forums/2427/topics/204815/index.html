            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Slow Life, Slow Sex: Learning about your body means self-exploration</strong><br>Author: Dr. Kunio Kitamura<br><br>Find what feels good and make your mark.<br><br>I'm a little worried about the negative attitude of Japanese women.<br><br>According to a 2000 survey the Japanese Association for Sex Education<br>carried out on youths' sexual behavior, 94.2 percent of male<br>university students had experienced masturbation, while the figure for<br>women was only 40.1 percent. Playing with yourself is not exclusively<br>the domain of men and I find the low rate amongst women to be very<br>disappointing indeed.<br><br>How about using bath time or one time when you're sleeping alone to<br>explore a bit to find out where you feel good? If you're feeling<br>REALLY adventurous, why not use a felt-tip marker and draw a heart on<br>the spot that tickles your fancy. It doesn't have to be a heart, a<br>diamond, or spade, or whatever, will do. Then, when you get a chance<br>with a partner who stumbles around grabbing whatever he can, slow him<br>down and use the mark to point him in the right direction. The more<br>frequently and longer this goes on, the closer you'll get to real<br>communication. When he can't rise to the occasion, you can rib him<br>about it gently, while also letting him know that's how he leaves you<br>feeling when he shows no concern for your orgasm. Doing this will<br>enable you to get your message across and not hurt his pride.<br><br>Many people ask me for advice on the best method to play with<br>themselves, but, basically, there are no rules. Do what makes you feel<br>best. Mind you, if you have long nails, you may end up scratching your<br>genitals or vagina, opening the door to possible infection, so it's<br>best to be careful. And you shouldn't use instruments that are<br>harmful. If, by chance, you do decide to use a vibrator, make sure you<br>read the instructions for use very carefully and always use lubricants.<br><br>Playing with yourself helps with early detection of illness and<br>prevention of unwanted pregnanciesBecause of my interest in the<br>subject of self pleasure, about two years ago I developed a lubricant<br>called Doctor G.* ("G" derives from "jii," the Japanese word for<br>masturbation that literally translates as "self comfort." ) It's a<br>lubricant that doesn't harm the skin and makes playing with yourself<br>more enjoyable. (Somewhat surprisingly, sales of the women's version<br>of Doctor G are better than the type for men.)<br><br>Many have criticized me for advocating masturbation, saying that it<br>does little to help combat the problems caused by the country's low<br>birthrate. But it's not that at all. What masturbation does is provide<br>a shortcut for better sex for both men and women, gives women with a<br>chance to detect any abnormalities in their b r e a s t s or genitals and<br>can be an effective way to prevent unwanted pregnancies or the spread<br>of sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS. Finally, I'd like to<br>remind you of one of my favorite movie lines, from Woody Allen's<br>Academy Award-winning "Annie Hall.""Masturbation is sex with the<br>person you love the most."<br></div>
