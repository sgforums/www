            <div class='col-md body'>She truly is a mystery since I did a search on her hoping to locate a photo but I didn't find anything!<br><br>Mystery broadcasting employee goes from TV to AV<br><br>Squeaky-clean TV Asahi, one of Japan's major networks, is awash with rumors that one of its staff members has turned into an adult movie actress, according to Shukan Shincho. Making the claim to be an ex-TV Asahi employee while posing nude for a glossy magazine is Emiri Arisugawa; which is, of course, a pseudonym.<br><br>Arisugawa says that she worked on several documentaries and educational programs during her time at TV Asahi and even helped out on "News Station," the network's flagstaff program.But there are few traces of the enigmatic Arisugawa at the network.<br><br>"Nearly every guy working at the station has seen the photo spread she did, and that's all they're talking about. But nobody can confirm if she really did use to work at the network," a TV Asahi insider tells Shukan Shincho. "Judging by the photos, the woman is about 40. I've checked with all sorts of guys who were working at the network at about the time she says she was there, but nobody has any recollection of her."<br><br>Arisugawa's handlers insist their charge is above board.<br><br>"Make no mistake -- she used to work for TV Asahi. She joined the network about 15 years ago and there are people who joined at the same time as her still working there now. She got an introduction to the network, passed its employee test and joined the company," a spokesman for the actress's talent agency tells Shukan Shincho. "She left the network when she married, but she later divorced. A few money issues arose and, now, she's working in the adult movie business."<br><br>A source within the pin-up photo industry also speaks out on Arisugawa's behalf.<br><br>"She spent time as a child overseas, skipped a few grades and graduated from university, which gave her a different background to the typical TV Asahi employee," the source says. "Those inside the network who should know exactly who she really is."It's a different story at TV Asahi, though.<br><br>"There's not a single person at the network who knows her," a TV Asahi spokesman tells Shukan Shincho. "She may well call herself a 'TV Asahi employee,' but the number of contract workers or part-time staff we take on is absolutely enormous. Even if we tried to confirm she once worked here, the sheer number of people who've worked here would make it an impossible task."</div>
