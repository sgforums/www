            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Shiofuki and the art of female ejaculation</strong><br><br>"Doctor, is it true that any woman can ejaculate?"<br><br>Kyoko, a 21-year-old Tokyo University student, asked me this as she shut the door and entered the consultation room at my clinic. Both myself and the clinic's gynecologist rolled our eyes.<br><br>"But my boyfriend tells me everyone can do it."<br><br>So, on to our theme this week of female ejaculation, or shiofuki, as it's called in Japanese, taking the term also used to describe a whale spouting water.<br><br>Shiofuki has become a household word in Japan largely through the efforts of one man -- Taka Kato, the 44-year-old adult movie actor who has made a name for himself by making so many of his on-screen female companions ejaculate. Female ejaculation became a common theme when Kato, variety performer Kuniko Yamada and I appeared together as co-hosts of LaLa TV's "Perfect H."<br><br>Kyoko, the young woman worried about female ejaculation, had left her boyfriend sitting in the clinic waiting room with the other mostly female patients waiting to see me. We called him into the consultation room to talk about shiofuki. Among the first words he uttered were "Taka Kato."<br><br>"Taka-san says he can make any woman he performs with ejaculate," the boyfriend said.<br><br>Bearing in mind that adult movies are supposed to be a form of entertainment and thus a performance, I asked the young lad to show me his fingernails. He thrust his hand out at me and I took a look.<br><br>"With these fingernails, working on the G-spot would probably end up rupturing the vaginal walls. Before you try to copy Taka with anything else, first copy the way Taka keeps his fingernails cut short."<br><br>I spoke about the G-spot. Well, this is the organ where shiofuki occurs. Strictly speaking, the G-spot is actually the Grafenberg Spot, named after Berlin gynecologist Ernst Grafenberg who discovered that stimulating the inside front wall of the vagina could spark sexual arousal. China and India with their rich sexual histories have known about the organ for centuries, but the G-spot was only given its name in Western medicine in the 20th century -- a path often followed in the medical world.<br><br>Lying on your back, it's close on impossible to find the G-spot. Gravity forces the body's organs downward and it becomes inaccessible from the opening of the vagina. It's best for a woman to try finding it while sitting on the toilet. She should raise the front part of her vaginal wall with some force using one hand and use the other hand to push down on her pubic bone just above the groin. The quarter-sized organ that feels incredibly good when you touch it is the G-spot.<br><br>If the woman has a partner, it's easy to find if she lies down on her belly, spreads her legs and raises her hips a little so they can be rotated. Her partner should move their flattened hand underneath her, then insert the middle two fingers and push firmly into the front of the vaginal wall. By moving the pelvic area and touching around, the partner can find the G-spot when the woman feels good.<br><br>While working on "Perfect H," Taka Kato and I once had a torrid exchange about shiofuki, or female ejaculation. The self-professed shiofuki expert said that the female ejaculate was urine. But, we had a discussion about the ejaculate, with Kato saying that because it didn't have the ammonia smell that builds up after a long time spent in the bladder it could only possibly be fresh urine. What weakened Kato's argument, however, was that the vast majority of actresses upon whom he had performed shiofuki had been to the toilet shortly beforehand.<br><br>Having heard Kato's arguments, I took it as my responsibility as a doctor to look into the mechanism. I picked up a medical terminology book and found there was no entry for the G-spot, but instead it was referred to as Skene's glands and that female ejaculate contains acid phosphatase, a liquid also found in the prostate. Put simply, the G-spot performs some similar roles in women as the prostate does in men and that's why shiofuki is also called female ejaculation.<br><br>Why did this quarter-sized organ gain the capability to ejaculate? The answer to that question lies in the b r e a s t s, or the mammary glands, to be more precise. Mammary glands are not like a milk tank that can disperse b r e a s t milk simply by twisting or turning some trigger. B r e a s t milk comes out when the b r e a s t s are sucked. Glands need to be set off to work. The G-spot (Skene's glands) is the same, emitting more liquid the more it is stimulated. Female ejaculation is kind of like blocking a running hose and then relieving the pressure and watching the water spurt forth.<br><br>Nonetheless, the probability of finding the G-spot is very limited, at about 60 percent. And long fingernails can be dangerous, causing blood to spurt forth from ruptures rather than any shiofuki. And people should also remember that female ejaculation doesn't necessarily come simultaneously with an orgasm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Everything you ever wanted to know about the G-Spot</strong></span></span><br><br><strong>What is the G-Spot?</strong><br><br>Unlike men, women can orgasm several different ways, via clitoral, vaginal, or G-Spot stimulation. Your partner may already climax fairly easily with clitoral stimulation or during intercourse. However, there is an area for stimulation inside her vagina called the G-Spot that you may not have found. Most people don't know about it. The G-Spot is a bean shaped mass of nerve tissue located about halfway between the back of the pubic bone and the top of the cervix. The G-Spot is the focal point of the female sexual arousal. The size and location of the G-Spot will vary from woman to woman, but it's usually about the size of a quarter, and lies two to three inches inside the vagina directly behind the pubic bone. You may be able to help her have added pleasure, experience new sensations, and perhaps have a new type of climax.<br><br><strong>Where can I find the G-Spot?</strong><br><br>The G-Spot is not easily located. Sometimes women have a hard time finding it and do not even believe they have one. Here is an easy method to finding it.<br><br><img src="http://www.minou.com/aboutsex/images/femlintrnl.jpg"><br><br>To explore this area, have your partner lie down, knees bent and feet flat on the bed, with a small pillow under her buttocks. Insert the length of your lubricated fingers into her vagina towards her navel. This will be about two inches inside the vagina. Press with one or two fingers against the front wall of her vagina. Because it's surrounded with tissue and is deep in the vaginal wall, you may want to apply a little more pressure than usual.<br><br>When you stimulate the right spot, it will swell the way your penis does. Slide your fingers from side to side. Have your partner tell you when you hit the right place. She will be able to tell. When you find the sensitive spot, continue stimulating it and you may find that it becomes firm and swells much like the erectile tissue in your penis.<br><br><strong>How do I stimulate the G-Spot?</strong><br><br>Now that you've found the G-Spot, kneeling between your partner's legs you can use the thumb of your other hand to gently stimulate her clitoris at the same time. This combination should give her very intense sensations. She may climax in this position, or you have the alternative of continuing in a different position.<br><br>If your partner turns over onto her back, you can stimulate her G-Spot most easily if you lie between her legs. Then try inserting two fingers and rub against the bottom of the vaginal opening, press upward with the tips of your fingers until you are pressing her G-Spot. Move your fingers from back and side to side. You can give her great pleasure by licking your partners clitoris and stimulating her G-Spot at the same time.<br><br>Another method is to have your partner lie on her belly with her legs spread apart and her hips slightly elevated. Insert your fingers with your palm down, into her vagina and explore the front wall. Have your partner move her pelvis to make contact with your fingers. As you feel your partner become more aroused, slip the other hand under her abdomen above her pubic hairs and slowly press.<br><br><strong>What else is important about the g-spot?</strong><br><br>Many women enjoy the "doggy" position during intercourse because it stimulates the G-Spot. This is because a man's penis has better access to the front wall of the vagina. Most women need firmer pressure to the front of the vagina, quick rhythm,and a lot of friction to have a G-Spot orgasm.<br><br>Some women get a feeling of the need to urinate at first when the G-Spot is stimulated. Your partner may need to empty her bladder before you begin love making.<br><br>It's possible that by stimulating the G-Spot your partner may ejaculate a small amount of white or clear fluid when she climaxes.<br><br></div>
