              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Dam bursts near Indonesian capital, killing 58</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://sg-portal-origin.web.aol.com/image-files/ap/2009/03/b0ced1ff-8269-4254-9b9e-8c6398e562d8@news.ap.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <div class="body">
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Torrential rain caused a colonial-era dam to burst outside the Indonesian capital early Friday, sending a wall of muddy water crashing into a densely packed neighborhood and killing at least 58 people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The flood left scores missing and submerged hundreds of homes. Rescuers used rubber rafts to pluck bodies from streets that were transformed into rivers littered with motorcycles, chairs and other debris.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Officials predicted that the death toll would rise and delivered more than 100 body bags to the scene.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I'm devastated," said Cholik, 21, crying as he sat next to the body of his 54-year-old mother. His brother-in-law also was killed and his 1-year-old niece was missing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I wasn't home last night. ... I should have been there to save them," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The earthen dam, built in 1933 when Indonesia was still under Dutch rule, surrounded a man-made lake in Cirendeu on the southwestern edge of Jakarta. It collapsed just after 2 a.m. when most people were sleeping, sending 70 million cubic feet (2 million cubic meters) of water cascading into homes and leaving the lake almost completely drained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Several survivors said it felt like they'd been hit by a "mini-tsunami."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Water levels were so high in some places that people waited on rooftops for rescuers. Telephone lines were toppled and cars swept away, some ending up hundreds of feet (meters) from where they'd been parked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">By mid-afternoon, hundreds of victims gathered at nearby Muhammadiyah University, which was transformed into a makeshift morgue. Many were wailing as soldiers and police brought in bodies, covering them in white sheets of plastic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Cecep Rahman, 63, lost his wife, son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter in the disaster.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"I heard a crashing sound and looked out my window," he choked. "The tide was so strong, like a tsunami. They were swept away. ... There was nothing I could do."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Health Ministry Crisis Center chief Rustam Pakaya and rescue teams at the scene said at least 58 people were killed and more than 400 houses submerged, some in water 10-feet- (about three-meters-) deep.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">A 9-year-old girl was found unconscious on one rooftop after the water receded, but she died on the way to a hospital, said rescuer Toni Suhartono, adding the child's parents and sister were among dozens still missing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The powerful current carried some bodies several miles (kilometers), uprooted trees and completely demolished homes, leaving only the foundations standing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">For many, the walls of water spawned by the dam collapse triggered memories of the much more devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed 230,000 people, more than half of them on Indonesia's westernmost island of Sumatra.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The Ministry of Public Works said it will investigate what caused the disaster.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">But Wahyu Hartono, a former official at the ministry, said the 40-foot- (about 15-meter-) high dam had been poorly maintained in recent years because of budget shortfalls. After four hours of heavy rain the spillway overflowed and the base gave way.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"We need to find a way to take better care of these Dutch-era dams and dikes," he said. "Otherwise, there will be more problems like this in the future."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Seasonal downpours cause dozens of landslides and flash floods each year in Indonesia, a nation of 235 million, where many live in mountainous areas or near fertile plains.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">More than 40 people were killed in the capital after rivers burst their banks two years ago. Critics said rampant overdevelopment, poor city planning and clogged drainage canals were partly to blame.</span></p>
