            <div class='col-md body'><strong>There's much more to life than the missionary position</strong><br><br>No way! We've only ever used the missionary position. That's why my<br>husband says I'm frigid. But, I have to admit, it's the easiest<br>position. And the one that hurts the least," one of my female patients<br>told me.<br><br>The missionary position got its name because holy types believed sex<br>should only be for procreation purposes and they preached that it was<br>the best way to ensure that the man's seed was preserved in the<br>woman's body. But sex in nothing more than the missionary position is<br>like being served fried eggs for every single meal you ate. The idea<br>of a sex life consisting solely of the missionary position would be<br>sure to raise a smile on the face of Shiva, one of the three great<br>Hindu gods and the symbol of love. "How daft," I can imagine Shiva<br>saying, particularly as it was said that he experienced the joy of sex<br>in 186 million different positions while meditating.<br><br>There are 60 trillion cells in my body. There are also 60 trillion<br>cells in your body, too, and you should think of each of these cells<br>are buttons. What if you were to try and touch each and every one of<br>these buttons? In one day, there are 24 hours, or 1,440 minutes, or<br>86,400 seconds. Each year consists of 365 days, or 31.53 million<br>seconds. There wouldn't be enough time in several lifetimes to come<br>into individual contact with every single one of the 60 trillion cells<br>in a human body. And sex needs a partner, too. So, combining your 60<br>trillion cells with your partner's 60 trillion cells and,<br>theoretically, there are 60 trillion times 60 trillion different<br>positions that could possibly exist. There's no way anybody should<br>ever become bored with sex. Don't forget curiosity and remember that<br>you're missing out on so much by not continuously exploring though<br>touch without taking a break.<br><br>There was once a computer programmer who developed a touching order<br>program based on rolling three dice. He would roll the dice, look at<br>the three numbers that came up and that would tell him the order of<br>body parts he and his wife would touch. Imagining the couple pulling<br>out a torch and using it to see what numbers the dice had come up with<br>so they could work out what to do is a bit farcical, but even if you<br>don't go that far, couples should come up with ideas to spice up their<br>sex lives.<br><br>Don't the Pillow Books from the Edo Period (1603-186<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> still give you<br>a thrill? Take the Shigurechausu, or time of thin rain and tea. This<br>is a position where the woman gets on top. If the woman shifts to her<br>side while riding atop the man, the position turns into the<br>goshoguruma, or ox-drawn cart like those used by ancient royalty. If<br>you're both looking in the same direction while being sideways, that<br>is, insertion from the rear while both are lying side-on, it's called<br>the mado no tsuki, or moon window. Turning the woman in the opposite<br>direction gives you the Tsubame Kaeshi, or inverted swallow (as in the<br>bird), which was also a name given to a famous style of sword stroke.<br>Then, there's the Bajogake, or horse riding bridge, a sex technique<br>based on the way a horse is ridden. If the horse kicks, everything<br>finishes, but it can still be exciting if approach with a refined<br>sense of fun.<br><br>These pillow books and shunga erotic prints were supposed to have been<br>produced by elegant people of leisure during feudal times. Even in<br>today's busy world where everybody's in a rush. How about giving each<br>different position its own name and jotting down a picture in a<br>sketchbook to leave as a reference for future generations? Do that and<br>throw in a bit of information about the date, time and notes about how<br>you felt at the time for good measure. (By Dr. Kunio Kitamura)<br></div>
