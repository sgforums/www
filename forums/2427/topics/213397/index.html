            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Japan's online communities turning from SNS to S.E.X.</strong><br><br>The country's biggest Social Networking Service, mixi, recently went<br>public, prompting it to purge itself of anything pubic.<br><br>The result has been a boon for operators of adult-oriented SNS such as<br>sexii and Private People that cater for people with little more than<br>lust on their minds, according to trendy men's weekly Spa!.<br><br>As those who put racier profiles or pictures up on mixi are escorted<br>out of the community, they're finding their way toward the mushrooming<br>adult-oriented SNS sites, creating an entirely new world of online<br>erotic communication, to put it in the magazine's own words.<br><br>With membership already topping 8,000, sexii is so far Japan's largest<br>adult-oriented SNS.<br><br>"We're actually an online advertisement company, but when we heard<br>that mixi was cracking down on people who were a bit too raunchy, we<br>decided to step in and fill the breach, and started up sexii in May,"<br>the site's operator, who is not named, tells Spa! "We never dreamed<br>we'd get so many people registering so quickly and have had to hurry<br>up and put in some more servers. We're currently using three massive<br>servers to cope with the traffic. Mind you, I think we're the only<br>place where a company is actually running an adult-oriented SNS. All<br>the others are still being run by individuals."<br><br>It's true that other adult SNS sites are packed with plenty of<br>revealing photos of a type that can't be found on sexii, which is a<br>deliberate policy of the company.<br><br>"We're deleting any risky photos. Even if we are an adult site, that<br>doesn't mean 'anything goes.' We abide by the law," sexii's operator<br>says before jokingly adding: "We like to set up fights between our<br>administrators and users to find out just how far people can go before<br>we draw the line and take their pictures down."<br><br>While mixi has hundreds of millions of yen in advertising on offer as<br>an incentive to clean itself up, it's hardly likely that companies are<br>going to be rushing to the adult SNS sites to pay for their products<br>to be promoted. So, where's the incentive to run them?<br><br>"Adult-oriented sites have lost a bit of their steam, thanks to all<br>the scamming that had been going on. Places that had a lot of<br>once-popular erogs (erotica-oriented blogs) like mixi and Livedoor<br>have cleaned up their acts, too. But all we're interested in, really,<br>is making a fine, adult-oriented SNS where people can have a good<br>time," sexii's operator tells Spa! "We're an ad company now, but we're<br>thinking about one day offering pay-per-view contents like videos or<br>erotic chats. Frankly, we're quite happy to see mixi become even<br>stricter because that only means all the more people coming to us."<br></div>
