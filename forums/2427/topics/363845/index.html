              boy’s mother.</p>

              ambulance crew. Police said they found a deep wound at the top of his head and 
              two teeth near his body, adding they recovered his empty wallet from the water 
              as well as a blazer and found a pool of blood on a nearby river terrace.</p>

              <div id="mainbody"><span class="lingo_region">
              <p id="paragrah">OSAKA (Kyodo) A 17-year-old high school student was arrested 
              Saturday on suspicion of killing and abandoning the body of a 15-year-old from a 
              different school who was found dead early Friday in a river in Tondabayashi, 
              Osaka Prefecture.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The suspect, whose identity is being withheld because he is a 
              minor, has admitted to the allegations, police said. The youth said he killed 
              the other boy after growing close to the victim's girlfriend, who was coming to 
              him for advice on their apparently sour relationship, because he thought that 
              was only way he could help her.</p>
              <p>The senior, who lives in Tondabayashi, told the police that he 
              couldn't forgive the boy for troubling the girl, they said.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The 15-year-old victim was identified as Koki Okubo, a student at 
              Chiyoda High School, a private school in Kawachinagano, Osaka Prefecture. The 
              suspect allegedly killed Okubo by battering him around the head and face with a 
              wooden hammer and a bat near the river, leaving his body there between Thursday 
              evening and early Friday.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">An autopsy showed Okubo died of a brain contusion, the police 
              said.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">According to the police, the suspect asked Okubo to meet him to 
              talk about his girlfriend, and they met at around 7:30 p.m. Thursday at a train 
              station. The suspect then took him out to the river area on his bicycle, the 
              police said.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Near the river, the suspect told Okubo to close his eyes and sit 
              down, saying he would give him a psychological test. Instead, he allegedly beat 
              him to death and kicked his body into the river, they said.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Later in the day, many of Okubo's friends visited the site by the 
              river and left flowers in his memory.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"I can't believe what happened. As the killer was arrested, I 
              prayed for him to rest in peace," said Shuhei Mihara, 16.</p>
