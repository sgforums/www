            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wise Japanese investors add love hotels, starlets to their portfolios</strong><br><br>Nestled away in a traditional love hotel quarter in Tokyo's Uguisudani<br>district, Hotel P Door looks just like any other establishment in its<br>particular line of business.<br><br>A plague beneath the neon sign contains two prices, 4,600 yen for a<br>rest and 7,500 yen a stay, a giveaway that the hotel is dedicated to<br>amorous couples.<br><br>What makes Hotel P-Door stand out, according to Shukan Gendai,<br>is that some of its operating capital comes through Hope Alpha 2, a<br>fund that finances the love hotel's operations in return for payouts<br>of up to 8.4 percent annual interest.<br><br>Love hotels are among the many unusual businesses coming to the aid of<br>struggling investors in Japan who can look forward to interest of less<br>than 1 percent for any money they put into the bank. Hope Alpha 2 agrees.<br><br>"Normal hotel rooms only have a single customer a day, but with a love<br>hotel, you can get as many as three or four customers in the same room<br>every 24 hours. Love hotels are also built to be replaced every few<br>years, so construction costs are comparatively cheap. That allows for<br>profits unthinkable in lots of other types of businesses," Shuzo<br>Shinano tells Shukan Gendai. "We've paid out dividends on time and<br>will continue to do so from now on, too."<br><br>Others agree that love hotels can be a potentially lucrative investment.<br><br>"(Funds are) a somewhat shady business. You want to invest in an<br>industry that has a history and tradition of being a profitable<br>business. Love hotels are precisely that. You're not investing in the<br>hotel itself, but in the profits it makes, which means you can expect<br>a high return on your outlay," securities journalist Genichiro Tenkai<br>tells Shukan Gendai.<br><br>P-Door is currently accepting investors willing to foot at least<br>500,000 yen apiece and will continue doing so until Nov. 22. It<br>pledges an 8.4 percent payout for the first year over a five-year<br>investment and plans 12 percent plus from the second year on. Payouts<br>are made twice annually, in January and July, but Hope Alpha 2 warns<br>that dividends are entirely dependant on the hotel's business<br>performance and that principle investments are not guaranteed.<br><br>Love hotels aren't the only peculiar funds punters can choose to<br>invest their cash in. In 2003, the Shinjin Gurabia Aidoru Dai-Ichi Go<br>fund sought 50,000 yen investments in the careers of five young women<br>it hoped to manage into pinup queen stardom. Money collected was<br>supposed to fund the production of photo collections and DVDs<br>featuring the starlets, with profits split up amongst the investors,<br>which proved profitable for some.<br><br>Not every funny fund is a roaring success, though. Take the Ramen<br>Fund, which ended up getting those who invested 500,000 yen apiece<br>into a ramen theme park in Tokyo's Shibuya-ku doing their noodle. The<br>theme park promised annual returns of 10 percent, but went bust within<br>a year and speculators were lucky to at least receive their principle<br>outlays back.<br><br>Securities analyst Haruo Ueki warns that freaky funds like investing<br>in love hotels should only be pursued with caution.<br><br>"Investment funds don't guarantee the principle investment, so it's<br>important to look at past performance before committing. Love hotel<br>funds have maintained high dividend payouts, so they appear to be<br>pretty good, but don't forget things like fire or management problems<br>can arise in the place you've chosen to invest in. Something like that<br>happens and you can forget your dividend and the principle may be in<br>danger at times, too," Ueki tells Shukan Gendai. "It's really<br>important to look into whether the place you want to invest in is<br>risky or not. And don't forget some places won't let you pull out<br>after only a year. Whatever way, these funds should only be invested<br>in if you have money you can afford to lose."<br></div>
