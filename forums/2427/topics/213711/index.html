            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Phuket Party Girl<br>Sex is all around</strong><br><br>When I first started writing about my life as a single girl on Phuket, I wondered if anyone would actually read it. If they did though, then surely they would find it amusing and not offensive. After all, sex is what makes the world go round.<br><br>Hands up all those who have ever woken up with that spinning feeling after a night out in Phuket? And I don't just mean the hang-over.<br><br>Ignoring the fact that sex is freely available to anyone on the island (well, perhaps not completely free), all you need do is pick up the latest issue of Cosmopolitan and read the true life confessions, or even fictional stories, Cosmo's audience is far more global audience than mine (although I am working on that).<br><br>So it would seem that sex is all around us.<br><br>Six months into my new `career', however, and my columns would appear to be causing something of an uproar in certain island circles and, interestingly, a lot of the noise is coming from men.<br><br>Now I would be hard pressed to find any man living on Phuket who finds sex offensive, so it baffles me somewhat that they are so concerned with my behaviour.<br><br>One time I even listened to a man who makes no secret of his liaisons with Patong's female magicians (ladies who do tricks) talk about my column as if it was the most disgusting thing he had come across.<br><br>Unfortunately I was not in a position to point out the irony. It was interesting that my admirer, Jeff Â– who wrote in to the Post a few weeks back - is a successful and knowledgeable man. Based on the photos he included with his email he could have his pick of women, yet he chose to pursue the one he saw as being honest, witty and intelligent.<br><br>Yet my most severe hate mail has come from a man who was too gutless to even give his name, and who admitted he was not a fan of farang women at all [see Editor's Inbox].<br><br>I'll leave it to you to figure out the calibre of the men who really do see me as a threatÂ…<br><br>It's not just my behaviour that's got people talking though, it's my identity. Am I young or old, Thai or farang Â– and am I even female? While a few people have spoken to me about the Phuket Party Girl, none have so far realised that I am the one writing it.<br><br>Miraculously, I have never been accused of producing this column, yet I know a large number of farang females who have. There are many people, it would seem, who could fill Miss Manolo's shoes.<br><br>Surely, this evergrowing list of potential candidates is all the proof needed that there is more than one single farang girl on the island who is enjoying herself?<br><br>I'll say it again, sex is all around us. Have a look back over the past dozen issues of the Phuket Post, and note if you will, Animal Corner, which features regular tales of shagging dogs and photos of grown men with collars and leads round their necks Â– (which, of course, is how it should be).<br><br>The guy from Body Talk has an excuse I suppose, but with a million and one medical conditions that could be talked about, isn't it interesting that those related to sex crop up so oftenÂ…<br><br>Then we have Mr John from Mind, Body and Soul discussing how to master the Great Orgasm. Now, as much as I appreciate this subject and am pleased that it is being given such consideration, I do have to voice my concern over a few other comments Mr John has made in the past:<br><br>1. Casual Sex cannot be fulfilling<br>2. It can actually be more satisfying NOT to experience an orgasm<br><br>Surely these were typos, Mr John?<br><br>Finally Â– and this is the one I am most impressed with Â– even Steven Roberto, the wine columnist, has been discussing sex lately. I'd share a glass with you any day, `Mr Pinot'.<br><br>So, it would seem that, despite some assumptions, I am clearly not the only girl on this island who is hard at it. I'm quite frankly amazed that anyone thought that in the first place.<br><br>Based on my friends and acquaintances, I am certainly no more outrageous than anyone else. I would even go so far as to say that they are far, far worse Â– just wait until you hear what a friend of mine told me over coffee and toast yesterday morning........<br><br>To be continued.......</div>
