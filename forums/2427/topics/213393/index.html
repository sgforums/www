            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Korea: Illegal sex trade dying hard</strong><br><br>Police declared Sept. 23, 2004, as the last day for legal prostitution<br>in the country.<br><br>Two years later, however, it seems that the clampdown on illegal sex<br>will require much more than just shutting down brothels, as the sex<br>industry enjoys a rebound using underground means, such as massage<br>parlors, bars, private homes and the Internet.<br><br>Adopting a "zero-tolerance" approach to the sex trade and the<br>trafficking of women, the anti-prostitution law enforced in 2004 could<br>put brothel owners in prison for up to ten years with a maximum fine<br>of 100 million won for hiring prostitutes. Any financial gains<br>acquired by selling sex could be confiscated by the state.<br><br>Buying sex was also made a criminal offense punishable by up to one<br>year in jail and 3 million won in fines.<br><br>Police officials claim that the strengthened crackdown on the sex<br>industry is achieving important results, as the number of red-light<br>districts, once easily seen from the street corners of any city, have<br>dropped sharply in recent years.<br><br>According to statistics of the National Police Agency, there were<br>1,679 red-light districts around the country as of September 2004,<br>with the sex shops employing about 5,500 prostitutes.<br><br>As of May this year, the number of red-light districts was 1,097, with<br>about 2,660 prostitutes working in brothels.<br><br>In Seoul, existing red-light districts in Yongsan, Chongnyangni,<br>Chongam-dong and other areas are expected to be cleared up next year<br>through new urban development plans.<br><br>Since the adoption of the anti-prostitution law, police have charged<br>more than 40,000 brothel owners, pimps, prostitutes and customers.<br><br>"Although some of the brothels that went under because of the<br>strengthened police crackdown at the start are reopening, the number<br>of shops and prostitutes have dropped significantly, as has the number<br>of customers," said Sgt. Yang Sang-mo at the National Police Agency's<br>women and juvenile affairs division.<br><br>However, skeptics argue that the strengthened crackdown on<br>prostitution opened the doors to other venues for the sex industry<br>with which law enforcement authorities find harder to deal.<br><br>According to a survey earlier this year by the Korean Institute for<br>Criminology, more than 60 percent of the 450 adult males who said they<br>bought sex in the past year said they used massage parlors, which are<br>quickly becoming the center of the underground sex trade.<br><br>Numbers released by the Financial Supervisory Service show that credit<br>card spending at massage parlors rose 23 percent year-on-year in 2005.<br><br>Illegal sex transactions are also frequent at bars, hotels and even<br>private homes, according to police, with pimps sending out prostitutes<br>disguised as masseuses.<br><br>Internet dating services that connect prostitutes, and sometimes even<br>teenaged girls, with sex buyers are also a problem.<br><br>The police charged more than 3,300 people for engaging in the<br>Internet-based sex trade in a crackdown this summer, which accounted<br>for more than 22 percent of the sex offenders caught during the period.<br><br>Last week, the police detained 25 prostitutes, pimps and Japanese<br>tourists in a crackdown on Internet-based sex rings.<br><br>There are also worries that an increasing number of Korean women are<br>being lured into trafficking rings and forced to participate in<br>commercial sex services overseas.<br><br>Last year, about 60 people were arrested in the San Francisco Bay Area<br>and Los Angeles on charges of smuggling Korean women into the country<br>and forcing them to work as prostitutes at massage parlors and other<br>businesses.<br><br>"Although most people now accept that selling and buying sex is a<br>criminal offense, there is still a significant demand for sex. For<br>brothel owners and pimps, its just about finding an easier way to<br>sell," said Kim Young-rahn, who co-heads the civic group Naeil Women's<br>Center for Youth.<br><br>The sex industry in 2004 accounted for over 4 percent of Korea's gross<br>domestic product, according to a report by the Korean Institute for<br>Criminology.<br></div>
