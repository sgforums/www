            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Kim Yun-jin in Sexy Spread for U.K. Arena </strong><br><br>Kim Yun-jin, whose stock has seen a sharp upward trend ever since she was cast on the hit series "Lost," graces the covers of two big-name magazines from the U.K. and the U.S.<br>The first Korean to appear on the cover of TV Guide, one of the U.S.'s most highly-circulated magazines, in the late August edition, she is also featured on the cover of the September-October edition of Golf for Women (U.S.) and the October edition of the English menÂ’s monthly Arena. There, she not only appears on the cover but is also featured in a sexy six-page spread on the inside.<br><br><img src="http://english.chosun.com/media/photo/news/200609/200609070011_00.jpg"><br><br>Appearing in a black tank-top and hot pants, Kim shows off her copper-tone skin as she flaunts her down-home sexiness. This is a departure from the innocent and sophisticated image of her character in "Lost", which has now picked up a worldwide audience. The pictures were taken in a Los Angeles studio by fashion photographer Nino Munoz.<br><br>The article that accompanies it dwells on her onscreen character Sun and the story of how she landed the role, as well as tales of her everyday day life, which includes frequent travel between Korea and the U.S.<br><br><img src="http://english.chosun.com/media/photo/news/200609/200609070011_01.jpg"><br><br>"The shoot and interview were actually done back in May, but to be in line with the airing of the third Season of Lost, publication was pushed back to October," Kim's manager says. "In season three, Sun becomes a more active character. The photo shoot concept was to reflect this."</div>
