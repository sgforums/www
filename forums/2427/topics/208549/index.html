            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Low-priced "gourmet" getaways give guys cheap chance to grope a gal</strong><br><br>Day-return trips operated by domestic travel agencies are ubiquitous in Japan. Practically everyone, notes Uramono Japan (October), has seen these flyers for tours, which, for 10,000 yen (give or take), appeal mainly to budget-conscious middle-aged people.<br><br>Typically, they consist of a bus jaunt to the countryside, upon which one disembarks and spends an hour or two picking grapes or semi-wild mountain vegetables, and then lunches at a nearby restaurant offering a fresh local cuisine. Sounds about as exciting as taking your kid to a petting zoo stocked with stuffed animals, right?<br><br>Not necessarily.<br><br>Last spring, Uramono Japan's writer was persuaded by a male friend into taking a weekday jaunt. Euphemistically billed as a "gourmet tour," its brochure proclaimed "Visit a garden with 100,000 lavender plants, followed by all the ripe peaches and melons you can eat -- for just 7,980 yen!"<br><br>They signed up for the tour and at the appointed time went to the bus departure point. Being a weekday, predictably, a large percentage of the participants were made up of frumpy "baachan" (women age 50 and over), among which could be found a sprinkling of pairs of younger women in their 40s or 30s. The latter appeared to be bored housewives seeking a break from their mundane chores.<br><br>The other men on the tour, numbering four or five, were in their 60s. They wore wrinkled shirts and appeared to be widowers or divorced men, no doubt thinking the tour might be an opportunity to meet female company.<br><br>The lavender garden was the first stop, with a 40-minute, fragrant-wafted stroll followed by lunch. By this time the reporter and his friend had singled out a pair of reasonably attractive younger women and arranged to sit beside them at the restaurant where they could strike up conversation.<br><br>After the meal, the herd was directed to the inevitable stop at the garden's gift shop. The reporter and his companion by this time had paired off with the two ladies and begun their pitch. "Where's home," the reporter asked. "Yokohama," she replied.<br><br>"You're very attractive, you know," the reporter said. "I really envy your husband."<br><br>"Oh come on!" she exclaimed, batting her eyelashes furiously.<br><br>He poured on the honey.<br><br>"If I were married to a lovely gal like you, I wouldn't be wasting much of my nights on sleep!"<br><br>They continued their stroll to a private corner of the garden.<br><br>She looked him over, seemed to think for a moment, and then, looking around to make sure no one else was within hearing -- or viewing -- range, mentioned to him that these nights her husband often returned home from work quite late.<br><br>"Forgive me for being so forward," the reporter says, "but are you saying the two of you don't, you know, have much of a physical relationship any more?"<br><br>"Well, I guess we've sort of lost interest in each other," she sighs.<br><br>"But you're still in the bloom of youth! What a waste not to..."<br><br>He then made what could be described as an unmistakable gesture of interest, by begging permission to fondle her b r e a s t.<br><br>"Uh, I happen to be a 'batsu-itchi' (one-time divorcee) myself," he says by way of confession, "but I really must admit I've never had the pleasure of enjoying the tactile sensation from such a lovely b r e a s t."<br><br>"Are you completely nuts?!" she replied.<br><br>"Just for one minute. Sixty seconds. Please. That's all I'm asking. Take pity on this lonely man.""<br><br>With a worried glance she looked around to see if they were being watched. Then she led him behind the small shed that housed the outdoor toilet.<br><br>He ran his hand gently along the smooth skin of her neck and heard her exhale loudly. Soon his hands were roving southward and her breathing became harsher.<br><br>He tugged at the zipper on his trousers and his soldier snapped to attention.<br><br>"Please..." he urged her.<br><br>She went down on him.<br><br>About 10 minutes into the action, he was about to let fly when the bus guide summoned the customers to prepare for departure. Undeterred by this act of megaphonus interruptus, the two exchanged e-mails and pledged to get together soon.<br><br>Just lucky? Not hardly, claims Uramono Japan's reporter. On a similar mountain-vegetable picking tour soon afterwards, he succeeded in obtaining a hand job from a slender housewife in her 30s, and afterwards the two consummated their new relationship on a hotel bed. But he struck out completely on his next attempt, a trip to Akita Prefecture made up entirely of women over 60.<br><br>Well, concludes the reporter, you pay your money and you take your chance. And if you're attracted to older women, consider one of these tours a real challenge!</div>
