            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Shimizu still blabbing Jolie sex secrets</strong><br><br>Apparently not satisfied with her years-long rants to anyone who will listen about her "deep relationship" and lesbian love affair with actress Angelina Jolie being yapped about the airwaves, the blatherings of actress Jenny Shimizu are now being memorialized in print, according to a story in the NY Post.<br><br>Word has that tattoed Asian actress Jenny Shimizu, who speaks whenever can of her and Jolie's supposed sexual obsession with each other, has gotten her stories into a blog called "The Starr Sisters Of Malibu" by Randa and Patte Starr starrsecrets.com, one of which is a tale of sexual antics with herself and Jolie in a dominatrix den.<br><br>Says Shimizu, "She loved it!"<br><br>This and other stories are reportedly included in a new book proposal, "Starr Secrets: The Down &amp; Dirty Truths About Today and Yesteryear's Celebrities," from the Starr sisters, according to Matt Cohen of the Marianne Strong Literary Agency.<br><br>Shimizu's passion for Jolie was reportedly set ablaze when they played lovers in the 1996 film "Foxfire."<br><br>"We used to visit strip clubs and there was this tension," the tattooed Asian beauty told the London Sun. "After the second week of filming, we kissed.<br><br>"There has never been an ending to her and I. I think there never will be. I think we will continue to have a deep relationship ... her passion is people and it's hard to just settle down with one person when you have a whole world in front of you," she said.<br><br>The New York Daily News quoted Shimizu saying, "I think we will continue to have a deep relationship. It really does go beyond just the sex ... her passion is people and it's hard to just settle down with one person when you have a whole world in front of you," she said, in what was an apparent reference to Jolie's inability to remain in a relationship with Brad Pitt or any other one person.<br><br>"She's always had lovers that she relies on. If she can ring you and you can meet up, then she can take care of her sexual need ... whenever she calls me up I go and visit her. It's not always the case that we get together and have sex. Sometimes we go to her property in Cambodia and explore the jungle."<br><br>Jenny Shimizu admits that she hasn't slept with Jolie since 2000 and they haven't kept in touch lately, but basically says that she wants to hook up again with Jolie once she is single again.</div>
