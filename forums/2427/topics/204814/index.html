            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stripping back to bare facts and naked truths about neo-nudism in Japan</strong><br><br>Yasuyo works from home as an IT consultant, going out only when she<br>has to give a presentation or attend a meeting. She punctuates her<br>work with some vacuuming, cleaning and preparing meals. It's a life<br>like any other woman, except as AERA (8/7) notes, Yasuyo does<br>everything in the nude.<br><br>Yasuko is one of Japan's growing throng of neo-nudists, or newdists,<br>if you will. The nudist boom is being buffered by more celebrities<br>revealing they spend much of their private lives in their birthday<br>suits, the emergence of Ekoda-chan, a popular manga character whose<br>entire family goes naked to save on energy costs, and the mixi SNS,<br>which has over 1,000 members of its "naked families" group.<br><br>"I take off my panties and strip fully nude, which unconsciously seems<br>to bring me closer to what I'm really feeling, which in turn makes me<br>feel like I'm going to come up with productive thoughts," Yasuyo tells<br>AERA.<br><br>Earlier this year, a Californian IT company conducted a worldwide<br>survey, finding that about 10 percent of men and women who worked from<br>home did so while naked. And Japanese nudists are catching on, like<br>Satoshi, who runs an IT company.<br><br>"I'm more creative when I'm naked," he says. "When work is really<br>pressuring me, I head out naked onto my verandah and gaze out into the<br>distance while I think. Nakedness gives you a liberating feeling you<br>couldn't possibly expect to find in a corporate atmosphere and I think<br>there have been many occasions when it has directed me toward arriving<br>at a decent business plan."<br><br>Yu Natsumi, author of "Nuudo Raifu he no Shotai (Invitation to a Nude<br>Life)," and her family have been living a naturalist's lifestyle for<br>the past 20 years. She implores potential "newdists" to try out nudity<br>as a way to, well, buff up character.<br><br>"It can turn introverts into positive thinkers," she says. "Go to a<br>nudist beach overseas and there are all types there. By getting nude<br>with them, all your complexes are openly accepted and it feels like<br>you are freed by the experience. If you're nude every day, you're<br>being yourself in the rawest possible form and that seems to make<br>communication smoother."<br><br>Pshrink Rie Ueki is not surprised.<br><br>"Going nude is the most effective way to create a successful work<br>routine. Especially for those doing creative work, there's a need at<br>times to re-think the way you interpret things and stripping<br>everything off can be a good start toward achieving that," the<br>psychologist tells AERA. "Being naked is thrilling and that<br>stimulation can spark all sorts of good ideas."<br></div>
