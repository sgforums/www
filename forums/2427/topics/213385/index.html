            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Teachers come not-so-clean on their sexy moonlighting jobs</strong><br><br>Akiko, Sayoko and Hisako (no family names given) are aged 45, 43 and<br>43, respectively. The first two are teachers at high schools, and the<br>latter is employed at a nursery school.<br><br>So what, asks Asahi Geino, do these three gals have in common,<br>aside from being in their 40s and looking after other people's<br>children? The answer is that they all moonlight for "delivery health"<br>businesses, which in Japan is a euphemism for outcall sex services<br>performed in hotels or at the customer's home.<br><br>Asahi Geino brought the three women together to conduct a panel<br>discussion, in which they shared their thoughts and experiences<br>concerning these lucrative moonlighting activities.<br><br>All three women told the magazine they found their jobs via the internet.<br><br>"I entered the keywords 'kou shuunyuu baito' (high-paying part-type<br>work, a euphemism for sex-related services) into a search engine,"<br>says Akiko.<br><br>"Since I didn't have any prior experience in this kind of work, I<br>didn't know what the interviewer was talking about when he said<br>'sumata,'" Sayoko recalls with a smile. "Even now there are still<br>plenty of specialized terms I don't understand."<br><br>For readers unfamiliar with this term, "sumata," literally 'real<br>crotch,' is a popular service in which the woman straddles her<br>customer and brings him to orgasm by sliding her lubricated labia<br>majora along the shaft of his penis, without actual penetration.<br><br>The petite Hisako, who stands only 148cm tall but boasts a whopping<br>100cm bustline, tells Asahi Geino that before starting her<br>moonlighting job, she perused Internet sites that utilize animated<br>cartoons to demonstrate the various services and techniques that<br>hookers were expected to provide to their johns.<br><br>In the course of their part-time work, the women regularly come across<br>customers with what could be described as "unusual" needs.<br><br>"Even though my daughter is grown up, if my mammaries are stimulated,<br>I still lactate," says 45-year-old Akiko. "Some customers notice see<br>the milk coming out and ask permission to nurse, making infant-like<br>requests. You'd be surprised how many men go for this sort of thing."<br><br>Sayoko reacts to Akiko's remarks by saying, "Wow! You should be in the<br>Guinness Book of Records."<br><br>To which Akiko responds, "What surprised me the most was being asked<br>to pee in front of them. I guess it's because I had no experience<br>doing this -- not that I feel any resistance. One of my customers who<br>was a physician wanted to poke his finger in my anus to 'examine' me,<br>and make sure I didn't have colon cancer.<br><br>Sayoko admits that one of her motives for moonlighting is the sheer<br>physical pleasure of a good romp in the sack. "I really get off on<br>sex," she says. "By the time a customer and I are finished, the bed<br>sheets are usually soaked all the way through. Even with a first-time<br>customer, we might go at it for two hours straight, and to be honest,<br>I was a little scared by the excretion of so much fluid -- I worried<br>at that rate I'd complete dry up and wither."<br><br>[Here, they all explode with laughter.]<br><br>"Things related to eroticism and sex are never raised at a nursery<br>school," says Hisako. "But customers who know that I work in one take<br>an interest in what I do. 'Do you ever have sex with the headmaster?'<br>they ask me. They seem to fantasize over this."<br><br>So, Asahi Geino's interviewer asks the three ladies, what has changed<br>since you started working in the sex business?<br><br>"For me," replies Akiko with a completely serious expression, "I've<br>realized more than ever we can't allow public order and morals to<br>decline."<br><br>Hisako agrees. "When I'm doing my regular job, I say to myself,<br>'Nobody knows I work in the sex industry.' So I get a strong sense of<br>the importance of being a completely honest person who always keeps<br>her promise."<br><br>Sayoko says her moonlighting work has changed her view of men.<br><br>"Before, I'd always been more attracted to younger men," she<br>confesses. "But young guys these days have longer limbs, and their<br>private parts tend to be bigger. There was a time when I preferred<br>that, but since I started doing this work, I lost interest in younger<br>guys. It's become much more enjoyable to be in the company of older men.<br><br>"It's like I've finally come into bloom," she says with a shy giggle.<br></div>
