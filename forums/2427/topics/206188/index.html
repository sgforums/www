            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Read your gal a titillating tale, then get ready for a frantic frolic</strong><br><br>"This is the first time I've ever made love outdoors," Kaoruko blushed, her hands modestly covering her bare breasts.<br><br>"Should we stop, then?" asked the now-tumescent Yohei, in a slightly irritated tone of voice.<br><br>"Uh-uh," she replied, with a shake of her head.<br><br>This scene, excerpted from Yu Kusanagi's erotic novel, "Matsuri no Yoru ni" (On the night of the festival), was included on the list of 10 erotic novels recommended for summer reading by fiction critic Morihiro Nagata.<br><br>"Its combination of exotic sexual venues and expressions that aim to titillate produce an invigorating atmosphere that has the effect of really turning on women," Nagata asserts.<br><br>Reading the lewd lines out loud to your lady love, says Shukan Gendai, is an effective way to kindle her latent libidinous lusts.<br><br>In the abovementioned tale, Yohei Ogami, a 29-year-old TV commercia producer, returns to his home town for the first time in 10 years to shoot scenes at the local festival, and while there encounters his old high school flame Kaoruko.<br><br>Kaoruko, now married, runs a small drinking establishment. During the festival she winds up imbibing a bit too much of her wares and while in her cups confesses her undying love to Yohei. Promptly disregarding her matrimonial vows, the two soon find themselves stretched out on the grass beside a riverbank.<br><br>"Kaoruko lifted her knees to form the shape of a letter 'M,' and Yohei, intoxicated by the fragrance emanating from her shadowy thatch, thrust forward with his tongue. 'Aaaaahhhhhhh!' she cried."<br><br>This story, Nagata suggests, features two qualities that lend themselves well to seduction. "First," he says, "the narrative is well-composed, with good characterizations. And second, the erotic passages ought to be extremely effective in getting her horny."<br><br>Nagata ought to know; he reviews about 30 such books a month, making him familiar with current trends in the smutty book trade.<br><br>"I see more and more titles these days in which the male characters take on passive roles," he tells Shukan Gendai. "I suppose it's because there are more female authors turning out these books, and also because female readership has been increasing.<br><br>"Another recent development I've observed in these books is that after their characters have engaged in sex, they are often beset by feelings of loneliness, like post-coital depression," Nagata adds.<br><br>Nagata also recommends Toshiue no Shukujo: Juuki furu koosu (An older woman: A full course of soft flesh) by Ryo Makimura, in which an 18-year-old college aspirant named Yuichiro is initiated into the ways of carnal pleasure by his 32-year-old stepmother, Keiko.<br><br>"Oh, mom, that feels really good," he moaned, as she clasped his pole of flesh at its base and squeezed it gently.<br><br>"Relax, Yu-chan," she murmured. "This is just the start. I've got lot more ways to make you feel good. Here, how's this, hmmmmm?"<br><br>Others in the list of the 10 recommended titles included:<br><br>- Hajirai Manadala (The chant of shyness) by Kagero Mutsuki, about a handsome young doctor who's very popular with his female patients;<br><br>- Kyonyuu Kuiin: Oshiete ageru (Big-busted queen -- I'll show you how to do it), by Fubuki Takazawa, about forbidden fruits offered by a secret SM club in Roppongi; and<br><br>- Kashin no Madoromi (A snooze among the flower petals) by Jin Ando, in which Kotaro, the leading male character, leaves his job in the big city to return to the countryside, where he enjoys cavorting with a series of females. These include a winsome widow and a mail delivery agent named Hisako, whose ample 93cm bre asts manage to dispatch Kotaro's jism by express airmail.<br><br>Try picking up one of these titles and read it aloud to your lady friend, advises Shukan Gendai. This sultry stuff should have her panting with passion in no time.</div>
