              <p class="MsoNormal">1. Hoan
               Kiem Lake
                &amp;  Ngoc son
               Temple<br> Hoan Kiem lake which had been considered the most beautiful lake in the city
              was in the 19th century added with another object to make it more beautiful and
              famous. That was the construction of a temple on the Ngoc (Jade) islet in the
              lake. Initially the temple was called Ngoc Son Pagoda. Later it was renamed Ngoc Son
               Temple because in the
              temple is dedicated to saints. Saint Van Suong was a person considered the
              brightest star in Vietnam's
              literature and intellectual circles. Tran Hung Dao was worshipped because he
              was the national hero who led the Vietnamese people to a resounding victory
              over the Nguyen aggression. The temple as it is seen today was attributable to
              the restoration afforts of Nguyen Van Sieu in 1864. A great Hanoi literature writer, Nguyen Van Sieu
              himself had a large pen-shaped tower (Thap But) built in at the entrance to the
              temple. On the upper section of the Thap but there are three Chinese characters
              Ta Thanh Thien which means literally that to write on the blue sky is to imply
              the height of a genuine and righteous person's determination and will. Behind
              Thap But is Dai Nghien (Ink Stand). The ink stand is carved from stone
              resembling a peach, which is placed on the back of the three frogs on top of the
              gate to the temple. Passing through Dai Nghien visitors are to tread on the
              wooden bridge called The Huc. The Huc is literally understood as the place
              where beams of morning sunshine are touching. <br>  On the long way that leads to the temple there are several <em>cau doi </em>(parallel
              sentences) written on the wall. These <em>cau doi</em> are considered part of a
              traditional ward puzzle entertainment, a lifestyle literally educated persons
              of ancient Thang Long used to follow.<br> <br> 2. Hanoi Old Quarter<br> <br> The Old Quarter, near Hoan Kiem lake, has the original street layout and
              architecture of old Hanoi.
              At the beginning of the 20th century the city consisted of only about 36
              streets, most of which are now part of the old quarter. Each street then had
              merchants and households specialized in a particular trade, such as silk
              traders, jewellery, etc. The street names nowadays still reflect these
              specializations, although few of them remain exclusively in their original
              commerce. The area is famous for its small artisans and merchants, including
              many silk shops. Local cuisine specialties as well as several clubs and bars
              can be found here also. A night market in the heart of the district opens for
              business every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening with a variety of clothing,
              souvenirs and food.<br> <br> 3.Temple of Literature</p>
              <p>Temple of Literature-Quoc Tu Giam was the first university of Vietnam
              where many students graduated with high flying colors. Some became doctors of
              philosophy. In 1482 King Le Thanh Tong ordered the erection of steles with
              inscription of all the names, birth dates and birth places of doctors, and
              other excellent graduates who took part in examinations since 1442. At present
              there remain 82 steles standing in the premises of Van Mieu. Aprt from its
              cultural value, each stele presents an artistic project of stone carving. Each
              stele is placed on the back of a turtle representing the nation's longevity.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">4. The <strong>Vietnam Museum of Ethnology</strong> (Vietnamese: <em>Báº£o
              tàng Dân tá»™c há»�c Viá»‡t Nam</em>)
              is a museum in Hanoi, Vietnam,
              which focuses on the 54 officially recognized ethnic groups in Vietnam. It is
              located on a 3.27-acre (13,200 m<sup>2</sup>) property in the Cáº§u Giáº¥y
              District, about 8 km from the city center.</p>
              <p>It is widely considered to be the finest modern museum in Vietnam and a tourist attraction in Hanoi.</p>
              <p>The proposal for the museum was officially approved on December 14, 1987.
              Construction lasted from 1987 to 1995, and it was opened to the public on
              November 12, 1997.</p>
              <p>The exhibition building was designed by the architect Hà Ä�á»©c Lá»‹nh, a member
              of the Tày ethnic group, in the shape of a drum, and the interior architecture
              was designed by the French architect Véronique Dollfus.</p>
              <p><strong>Opening hours is 8:30am to 5:30pm Tuesday to Sunday</strong></p>

              <p>If you're a culture vulture Hanoi
              has so much to offer. With a 1,000-year history and many well-preserved
              buildings along with lush and verdant parks as well as a well-appointed zoo, Hanoi will quite simply
              keep you busy for days on end.</p>
              <p>One of the loveliest features to this French-colonial city is its many lakes
              and these provide many beautiful locations to rest in between venturing out in
              the capital's streets.</p>
