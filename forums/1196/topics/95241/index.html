Brother and sister not working. Please donate.'<br><br>Next to the note was a plastic container for donations.<br><br>Goh Sung Wee, 25, did not seem to be doing too well on Tuesday night - there was just 60 cents in the container.<br><br>The New Paper watched him for over an hour before approaching him - and saw only one donor.<br><br>But he didn't seem too hard-up in his fancy Reebok trainers, bermudas and polo shirt.<br><br>Ah, but that's why he was there.<br><br>He said proudly: 'I got these shoes and my spectacles with the money I got from here.'<br><br>Indeed a chat with him revealed his persistence.<br><br>He claimed he has been begging for more than a year because he hasn't been able to find a job.<br><br>But then he has been rather choosy.<br><br>He wouldn't say at first what kind of work he was looking for.<br><br>But after repeated questioning, he said he was looking for work as a cleaner.<br><br>And when was the last time he applied for a job?<br><br>He hesitated, then said: 'I tried a few times already, cannot find.'<br><br>Then out came his choosiness.<br><br>He said in Mandarin: 'I only want to find a job near where I live in Hougang. It must be within walking distance, if not I don't want.<br><br>'It's not worth it if I have to pay to take the bus and MRT to work every day.'<br><br>Yet, he travels from Hougang to Orchard Road to beg.<br><br>'I don't come here every day. Maybe two, three times a week,' he claimed.<br><br>Even then he takes it easy.<br><br>'I come down here when I wake up, about three or four in the afternoon,' he said.<br><br>And then he begs for five to six hours before heading back home.<br><br>But why does he get up so late in the day?<br><br>'I sleep very late at night,' he said.<br><br>He likes to watch TV late into the night.<br><br>HAS NEVER WORKED IN HIS LIFE<br><br>Goh revealed he has never worked a day in his life.<br><br>He stopped school after Sec 4 and has been jobless ever since. He got by on pocket money from his parents.<br><br>The eldest of four children, Goh said his father is a taxi driver and mother a housewife.<br><br>He said his parents still give him pocket money, but declined to say how much.<br><br>'It's indefinite. Some weeks I get more money.'<br><br>His parents have been supporting him for over 20 years. Isn't it time he started looking after them?<br><br>He stared blankly before answering: 'The best is if they can fully support me.'<br><br>It was clear that he had also not thought about the day when his parents can no longer give him money.<br><br>When this was put to him, he stared vacantly.<br><br>Then, he said: 'Wah, I hope that day never comes.'<br><br>One of his younger brothers, he said, is a swimming instructor who earns his own keep and even gives his parents money. Another brother is still in secondary school and his sister, is studying in a polytechnic.<br><br>Initially, he claimed his parents were aware he was begging and had no objections since he was getting money.<br><br>But later, when we asked to get in touch with them, he admitted they do not know he's been begging.<br><br>As a cleaner he could earn about $750 to $1,200 a month, compared to the $10 to $40 he said he can get each day by begging.<br><br>But he insisted he wanted to work only near his home in Hougang.<br><br>And it's not as if he never strikes it rich.<br><br>Once, he said excitedly, he had collected about $230 in a day - $200 was from a single donor.<br><br>He also recounted how he had met a young woman in the Orchard Road underpass, who received $4,000 from a donor. He never saw her again.<br><br>'I see other other people do it, so I also come and be a beggar. Also good what. Just sit here can get money, I can buy cigarettes,' he said, opening up his cigarette case to show this reporter.<br><br>'OTHER PEOPLE ALSO CHEAT'<br><br>When asked if he was cheating people into believing he is poor and accepting their donations, Goh simply said: 'Other people also cheat other people what. I'm just sitting here.'<br><br>Goh declined to reveal more about himself, and after a short while, he abruptly said he was going home and left.<br><br>But doesn't he know he could be fined, even jailed, for begging?<br><br>He walked off before we could ask that question.<br><br>He was lucky.<br><br>Two police officers appeared in the underpass just as he upped and left.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">BEGGING AN OFFENCE<br><br>THE Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports' (MCYS) director for social support, Mr Kevin Shum, said habitual beggars can be fined up to $3,000 or jailed for up to two years.<br><br>Mr Shum said: 'MCYS' Destitute Persons Team conducts an average of 12 to 16 patrols a month. Ninety-one people were picked up by the ministry for begging in 2002 and 80 were picked up in 2003.<br><br>'They were returned to their families or admitted to a welfare home.'<br><br>He advised that the public should not encourage begging activities but instead call the ministry to inform of these activities.<br><br>To report on begging incidents, call MCYS' toll-free line 1800-4785379.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">PENALTY<br><br>Habitual beggars can be fined up to $3,000 or jailed for up to two years.</span></div>
