He didn't even know a single word of afgani but he still managed to sell 2 old second hand construction cranes and pocketed abt USD120k in commissions. I think since then he has managed to sell even more over there.<br><br>Every cloud has a silver lining and normally after a war during reconstruction phase, building materials or heavy machinery will be in great demand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the answers and reasons to that question varies<br><br>There was a story abt 10years back raised by SM Lee in parliament around the time when china was just starting to open up. To cut it short this young man with VITB certificate in construction built a highway for chinese government, in return as payment the government gave him a huge plot of land there with raw marble resources. SM Lee used this story as an example to get people interested in china investing.<br><br>During the interviewed with that young man, he said if he stayed back home he would have to be contented if he could get government tenders to fill holes in back alley pavements. So he went to china to try his luck.<br><br>I think that's what sets the enterprenuer apart from the rest is his dare to try spirit despite uncertainty. The government will always play it safe and announce such things. We may see danger but the enterprenuer may see great opportunity.<br><br>I always believed the great or wealthy people you see today did not fall out of the sky great or wealthy they too like everyone else started out from humble beginnings, but they are the ones who never let opportunity pass them by, the same opportunity which appeared to everyone else.<br><br></div>
