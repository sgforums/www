            <div class='col-md body'>Several Definitions of Spam that I found -<br><br>1) unsolicited advertising through e-mail or related sources.<br><br>2) To indiscriminately send large amounts of unsolicited e-mail meant to promote a product or service<br><br>3) many people also refer to excessive posting as spamming<br><br>4) To post irrelevant or inappropriate messages to one or more Usenet newsgroups, mailing lists, or other messaging system in deliberate or accidental violation of netiquette.<br><br>5) Posting a message to a significant proportion of all newsgroups is a sure way to spam Usenet and become an object of almost universal hatred.<br><br>6) To abuse any network service or tool by for promotional purposes<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I found 1 forum that states :-<br>No spamming. Spamming is characterized by the initiation of threads or posts that contribute nothing to a forum, be it off topic or on topic. Examples include: empty bodies, bodies with few words that have no relation to the current thread or discussion and those posts that state they are spam, either to annoy or increase a member's post count. This determination is made by the forum Moderator or Administrator and is not up for discussion.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Another forum states :-<br>Spamming<br>First lets take a look at the definition of spam:<br><br>To flood any chat forum or Internet game with purposefully annoying text or macros.<br><br>Now that we have a definition of spam, lets talk about it at The Forumz. There is a spamming board built to test signatures and other features you are testing out. If you spam any other board besides the spamming/test board, moderators will warn you that what you posted is considered spam. If you continue to spam other forumz the moderators will warn you again and delete the spam. If spamming still continues mods have the right to temporary ban you or permanently ban you from The Forumz. The Forumz works hard to create a productive environment for people looking for help and chatting. When people spam it detracts from the main purpose of The Forumz. To keep the productivity level high in The Forumz, spam will not be tolerated, and if continued the offending user will be dealt with swiftly.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>
