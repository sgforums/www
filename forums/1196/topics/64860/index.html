            <div class='col-md body'>He has admitted to take the nude photos, but denies molest.<br><br><blockquote>NON-Constituency Member of Parliament Steve Chia admitted taking 'sexy photos' of his Indonesian maid, but denied molesting her, at a press conference held on Sunday morning.<br><br>Mr Chia revealed that he had originally taken some 'decent' photos of the maid as she wanted to send them home to her family. However, he then convinced her to take the 'sexy' pictures in her bra and jeans.<br><br>He deleted the sexy photos of the maid from the computer at once, as agreed with the maid, but forgot to empty the computer's trash bin where his wife later found them.<br><br>He maintained that she was never naked, and neither was he in any nude photos with her, although he had separately taken shots of himself in the nude.<br><br>As for his political career, he said: 'It's for the public to decide after hearing my side of the story, to see whether I am still able to lead them.'<br><br>Mr Chia, who is the secretary-general of opposition political party, the National Solidarity Party, will meet party officials on Monday to discuss the matter.<br><br>For the full report, please read The Straits Times on Monday.<br></blockquote><img src="http://websmileys.bei.t-online.de/div195.gif">[/quote][/quote]</div>

Sigh..Guess that he will be branded in future with the likes of Chee Soon Juan instead of people like Chiam See Tong. I mean when was the last time u saw a member of parliament baring half of his ass on the Straits Times...I dunno how the PAP is gonna take this..There goes his reputation and his seat in the parliament...He can effectively call his political carrer to an end...coz in Singapore..there is no place for comeback kids like Bill Clinton..Sorry to say that</div>

Why would the PAP wanna ruin Chia just to suggest that PM Goh doesn't have every good foresight....U tink bout it<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Quote<br>am sad that you defered so much to PAP as if they GOD.

The Ottoman Empire,Hapsburg Empire,British Empire all died out less than 500 years after their beginning.It's just viewed as a natural process.I'm confident that the PAP wouldn't be running Singapore in 200years time.<br><br>The people of Singapore are not closed up.We are an educated population which some have been exposed to real democracy abroad. In any countries, there is a need to spent time establishing real democracy in any countries .It's the same with countries like S.Korea,which was under dictatorship till the 80s and Taiwan,which was a one party state which praticese democracy only in name until 2 decades ago. I'm sorry still to say that the United States could accept Bill Clinton cause they are the No 1 democractic country which spread liberialism across the globe. The United States is a  country that had established democracy for nearly 250years(and even the US needed a civil war to firmly establish democracy in their country). Where as for Singapore, we are still in a transcational period of time where so called democracy has been praticsed for less than half a century. Thus. i would advocate that real democracy be given time to establish and not through your silly ranting of the so called "PAP DICTATORSHIP".<br><br>and in Singapore...we view the moral standard of a politican as important as his capablility..thus...refer to above and do not impose the US standard on Singapore<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>
