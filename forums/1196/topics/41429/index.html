            <div class='col-md body'>KUALA LUMPUR -- Two crew members on luxury cruise liner Star Cruises, are suspected to have been stricken by the Sars virus while on board, a spokesman from the company said on Friday.<br><br>The two, who work for the Singapore-based luxury ship operator have been warded, one in Singapore and the other in Malaysia.<br><br>Malaysia's health ministry confirmed that one of them, a 26-year-old woman from India, was quarantined aboard the ship when she fell ill on March 30, and is now warded in Malaysia.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-04-11/virgo.jpg"><br><br>A Star Cruises official said that the woman was aboard the SuperStar Virgo, which sails every Sunday from Singapore to Langkawi in Malaysia and to Thailand's Phuket resort island, and has the capacity to take 2,008 passengers and 1,003 crew.<br><br>The woman was hospitalised on Langkawi island a week after falling ill. Thirteen other crew members have also been quarantined on board and others in close contact with the woman were actively being pursued, the health ministry's deputy director-general Ismail Merican told reporters.<br><br>There was no cause for alarm because the ship's management had adhered to strict measures recommended by the World Health Organisation, he added.<br><br>The other crew member, also Indian, is warded in Singapore's Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is not known if the two cases are linked.<br><br>The Star Cruises official said there were no plans at present to halt routes to China and Singapore which have been hit hard by the Sars outbreak, but a panel was closely monitoring daily developments.<br><br>Apart from the SuperStar Virgo based in Singapore, it also has another mega liner, the SuperStar Leo, which is based in Hongkong and conducts cruises to China.<br><br>The official said business had been affected by the Sars epidemic, even before the crew member fell ill, but that there were 'more requests for postponement than cancellations'.<br><br>The two ships have the procedures and facilities, including isolation areas with ventilation systems, to cope with any medical emergency, he said. -- AFP<br><br><img src="http://www.casey-online.de/smilies/headphones.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Current Affairs Manager, COB<br>Singapore</span></span></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cruise ship checked after 2 crew members warded<br>Both feverish, one was taken to hospital in Langkawi, the other to Tan Tock Seng when the luxury liner stopped here again<br><br>By Ben Nadarajan<br><br>TWO Star Cruises employees working on board the luxury liner SuperStar Virgo have been warded for severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in two separate countries.<br><br>The first, a 26-year-old Indian national woman, was taken off the ship when it reached Langkawi on Monday, a day after it left Singapore.She had had a fever and been to see the ship's doctor, said a company spokesman. She was kept isolated till they reached the Malaysian island, where she was sent to hospital.<br><br>Temperature checks on the 814 passengers and remaining 1,350 crew who returned here yesterday turned up no fevers. Thirteen crew members who had come into direct contact with their sick-female colleague had been kept isolated on board. The vessel is being disinfected. -- THOMAS WHITE<br>Malaysian authorities yesterday said she was a 'probable' Sars case, although she is said to be recovering.<br><br>The ship later sailed to Phuket and then back to Singapore for a stopover on Wednesday, when the second crew member, also from India, was taken ashore.<br><br>He had a high fever and was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he is now under observation.<br><br>The ship continued on the last leg of its six-day, five-night cruise, setting sail for Malacca and then Port Klang. It returned to the Singapore Cruise Centre yesterday afternoon with 814 passengers and 1,350 crew.<br><br>The spokesman explained that the cruise had continued because the company was not sure the two cases were Sars-related.<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-04-12/h1.jpg"><br><br>Still, 13 crew members who had come into direct contact with the sick woman were kept isolated from everyone else on board the ship. But no one was quarantined in connection with the second sick employee.<br><br>The Health Ministry said that after the ship docked here yesterday, nurses boarded it and took the temperatures of all onboard. No one had a fever and the passengers were allowed to disembark. The crew remained onboard because Star Cruises had suspended all shore leave for crew in Sars-affected areas. The ship is being disinfected.<br><br>Two other cruises, scheduled to depart yesterday and tomorrow, have been cancelled. The company will offer a full refund on the cruise fare and hotel accommodation.<br><br>Star Cruises declined to comment on what the two employees who had fallen ill did on board ship, and whether they had direct contact with passengers. The SuperStar Virgo's last cruise was an eight-day trip to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia from March 30 to April 6.<br><br>Crew members, who have been wearing masks at all times since March 27, were not allowed to disembark at either destination, although passengers could, said the company spokesman.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Health Ministry continued to carry out checks at Changi Airport. Two Singaporean women - out of 35 people taken aside at the airport - were admitted to TTSH on Thursday evening as suspected Sars cases, the ministry said yesterday.<br><br>One had returned from Yunan province in China and looked visibly unwell, while the other had returned from Hongkong with a fever.<br><br>Seven additional Sars cases were reported yesterday, six of whom are linked to the Singapore General Hospital cluster. Three are staff; two were visitors to and one a patient from Wards 57 and 58.<br><br>The seventh case is linked to Madam Seah Kuay Chee, who died on April 2.<br><br><img src="http://www.casey-online.de/smilies/headphones.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Current Affairs Manager, COB<br>Singapore</span></span></span><br><br></div>
