'The world needs to work together to find its cause, cure the sick, and stop its spread.'<br><br>The advisory said there was no reason to restrict travel but urged travellers to seek medical attention if they have shown symptoms of the illness after traveling to an area with reported cases. Symptoms include coughing, high fever and shortness of breath.<br><br><img src="http://www.casey-online.de/smilies/headphones.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Current Affairs Manager, COB<br>Singapore</span></span></span></div>

While atypical pneumonia is usually associated with milder forms of pneumonia, pneumonia caused by Legionella can be quite severe and lead to high death rates.<br><br>Symptoms:<br>* chills<br>* fevers<br>* cough -- may be dry or produce phlegm<br>* headache<br>* muscular stiffness and aching<br>* shortness of breath<br>* loss of appetite (anorexia)<br>* confusion (especially with Legionella)<br>* rash (especially with Mycoplasma)<br>* diarrhoea (especially with Legionella)<br><br><span style="color: orange;"><strong>Treatment:</strong></span><br>Antibiotic therapy: In mild cases, treatment with oral antibiotics at home may be all that is required. Severe cases (especially common with pneumonia, due to Legionella) may require intravenous antibiotics and oxygen, to aid breathing . There are no proven methods for preventing it, and no vaccinations are available at this time.<br><br>Source: University of Pennsylvania Health Illustrated Enclyclopaedia<br><br><img src="http://www.casey-online.de/smilies/headphones.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Current Affairs Manager, COB<br>Singapore</span></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AP said another 155 passengers who were transiting through Frankfurt were held in quarantine at the airport or sent home and told to remain there.<br><br>The remaining Singapore-bound passengers will be flown here on another flight. When they arrive, officers from the ministry and the National Environment Agency will tell them what to do if they develop symptoms of atypical pneumonia.<br><br>The ministry said yesterday that all the seven new cases here were people who had been in close contact with the victims. They were two relatives of patients and five hospital staff, bringing the total number of people infected here to 16.<br><br>All the patients are in isolation wards and their condition is stable. Though the bug responsible for the infection has not yet been identified, investigations suggest a viral origin, the ministry said.<br><br>It also 'strongly advised' that people avoid travelling to Hongkong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China unless absolutely necessary.<br><br>The latest deaths have also prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva to issue a rare emergency travel advisory. It said it had received more than 150 reports of the illness, which it is calling 'acute respiratory syndrome', or Sars, in the past week.<br><br>'Sars is now a worldwide health threat,' said WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland.<br><br>Officials said the outbreaks are unlikely to be related to terrorism.<br><br>Mr Dick Thompson, a WHO spokesman, said: 'Until we can get a grip on it, I don't see how it will slow down. People are not responding to antibiotics and antivirals, it's a highly contagious disease and it's moving around by jet. It's bad.'<br><br>The atypical pneumonia is believed to have made its way to Canada because one of the dead and two other family members had visited Hongkong recently.<br><br>In the territory, 47 people are now under observation. Two are critically ill. Anxious residents swept surgical masks off shop shelves. 'The government bought 10,000 masks for ambulance workers.
