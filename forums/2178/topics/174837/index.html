            <div class='col-md body'>"Love is in the air<br>In the whisper of the trees<br>Love is in the air<br>In the thunder of the sea"<br>- John Paul Young<br><br>Indeed, as Valentine's Day is just a month away I have people around me falling in love.<br><br>Within the teachings of Abrahamical faiths like Christianity, Islam and Judaism, the Almighty God decides over a person's destiny. Who he would love, who he would be loved and who he would marry is decided by God alone and no one can defy His laws.<br>Your true love is created and decided by God.<br>That's where the term, 'Match-Made-In-Heaven' probably originates from.<br><br>In Buddhism, the concept of an 'Almighty Supreme Being' and His interference into our daily life does not apply. However, there is indeed such a thing in Buddhism that I have aptly termed, 'Match-Made-By-Kamma'.<br><br>Most living beings, especially evident within the human race have an individual, usually from the opposite sex with whom they maintained an intimate and personal relationship. Such a relationship with the kammic seeds being cultivated can span countless of lifetimes. Life after life, individuals come together to renew and reconnect their relationships, assisting each other in life and in the development of spiritual cultivation. Such devoted companions are integral and essential to one's quest for perfection and to become a fully-enlightened being - a Buddha.<br><br>To cite a story, long before the advent of our Lord Sakyamuni Buddha in a past aeon of the world, there is an earlier Buddha known as Dipankara. At that time was a young forest-dwelling ascetic known as Sumedha. When Sumedha knew that Dipankara Buddha was crossing the area, he immediately took upon the task to prepare a smooth road for the Buddha to cross. Sumedha was still in the midst of preparing when Dipankara Buddha arrived. Full of devotion, Sumedha prostrated himself into a muddy hollow for the Buddha to cross smoothly and made a vow to become a Buddha himself in the future.<br><br>At the same time, a young lady known as Sumitta stepped forward joyously, bearing incense and fresh flowers to congratulate the young ascetic. However, Sumedha immediately rejected her support, affirming that he was a forest-dwelling ascetic and wanted to live alone. Dipankara Buddha witnessing the entire episode step forward to cautioned the young ascetic Sumedha. He announced that the young ascetic would one day become a fully-enlightened being but he also told Sumedha that for every aspirant to Buddhahood had a spiritual companion who was his inseparable partner throughout the long, arduous quest for spiritual perfection. The lady Sumitta was his spiritual companion.<br><br>And through many lifetimes, this couple had to go through many obstacles as they strive for the benefits of all beings and their spiritual cultivation together. There are many stories in the Jataka where one can find tales about this special couple and the unwavering love and support both has for each other.<br><br>Finally in our world 2,500 years ago, the young ascetic Sumedha, reborn as Prince Siddhartha achieved perfection and became the fully-enlightened Buddha. The lady Sumitta, reborn as Princess Yasodhara attained arhanthood.<br><br>This idea of 'match-made-by-kamma' can be further cemented within the Anguttara Nikaya (The Numerical Discourses). There was a layperson Nakulapita who together with his wife, Nakulamata expressed their wishes to the Buddha to be reborn repeatedly as companions.<br><br>The Buddha on hearing those words replied, "If man and wife, who are leading a harmonious life, wish to be together in the next existences, they should have the same faith, the same morality, the same liberality and the same level of knowledge. Then they will be in one another's sight so long as this life lasts and in the future life as well."<br><br>He added on further, "When both are faithful and bountiful, self-restrained, of a righteous living. They come together as husband and wife, full of love for each other."<br><br>These examples may shock many as Buddhism is often seemed as hardlined teachings against marriage, love commitments and lay life.<br><br>In fact, the Buddha was so often full of praises for happy and virtuous couples during His time!<br><br>So have you found your 'Match-Made-By-Kamma' yet?<br>If not, take your time.<br><br>Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu!<br><br>- Samadi</div>
