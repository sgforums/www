However true that could be, I'll need to meditate and find that out for myself in my practice.<br><br>#2: I see this as a question which an answer would lead to the questioning of how compassion could arise from 1 without the aggregates.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kaiyi, I've seen your private message, but I feel I shld post here so that everyone can see the message.<br><br>I believe if you are interested in Koan, you shld seek a teacher bcos in Zen, an enlightened teacher is very very important bcos he can point the way and correct you. When you get a koan, an untrained/unenlightened mind will surely use all their conceptual/intellect to answer that koan... and that will be futile. Even when one achieve a certain level of samadhi where certain discrimination falls apart/the koan falls away, a person may think that he has attained enlightenment but actually he has not, but only reached a 'unified stage' of mind. Therefore an enlightened teacher is very important <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Personally, I am not into practising Koans, and I am not exactly in the Zen sect although my Master is from the Zen lineage. My master teaches 'human vehicle buddhism', so that dharma can reach out to more people, more people can practise the dharma and not just certain people with higher capacities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>10.   The Last Poem of Hoshin</strong><br><br>The Zen Master Hoshin lived in China many years. Then he returned to the northeastern part of Japan, where he taught his disciples. When he was getting very old, he told them a story he had heard in China. This is the story:<br><br>One year on the twenty-fifth of December, Tokufu, who was very old, said to his disciples: "I am not going to be alive next year so you fellows should treat me well this year."<br><br>The pupils thought he was joking, but since he was a great-hearted teacher each of them in turn treated him to a feast on succeeding days of the departing year.<br><br>On the eve of the new year, Tokufu concluded: "You have been good to me. I shall leave tomorrow afternoon when the snow has stopped."<br><br>The disciples laughed, thinking he was aging and talking nonsense since the night was clear and without snow. But at midnight snow began to fall, and the next day they did not find their teacher about. They went to the meditation hall. There he had passed on.<br><br>Hoshin, who related this story, told his disciples: "It is not necessary for a Zen master to predict his passing, but if he really wishes to do so, he can."<br><br>"Can you?" someone asked.<br><br>"Yes," answered Hoshin. "I will show you what I can do seven days from now."<br><br>None of the disciples believed him, and most of them had even forgotten the conversation when Hoshin called them together.<br><br>"Seven days ago," he remarked, "I said I was going to leave you. It is customary to write a farewell poem, but I am neither a poet or a calligrapher. Let one of you inscribe my last words."<br><br>His followers thought he was joking, but one of them started to write.<br><br>"Are you ready?" Hoshin asked.<br><br>"Yes sir," replied the writer.<br><br>Then Hoshin dictated:<br><br>I came from brillancy<br>And return to brillancy.<br>What is this?<br><br>This line was one line short of the customary four, so the disciple said: "Master, we are one line short."<br><br>Hoshin, with the roar of a conquering lion, shouted "Kaa!" and was gone.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

When all these constituents are identified and disallowed to continue working, one will be enlightened, and the 'self' will exist no longer.</span><br><br>I have two questions:<br><br>1) does that mean that each of the 5 skhandas are independant of each other?<br>2) you said 'constituents are identified and disallowed to continue working', in that case, does the Buddha lack the 5 Skhandas?</div></blockquote>I bring answer for your 2nd question and the way it is presented is accordingly to a presumption that you are already well informed of the pali terms, so I'll explain them only at further request:<br><br>In a conventional body/form, the <span style="font-style: italic;">citta</span> and the 5 <span style="font-style: italic;">khandhas </span>will remain interdependent until the moment - popularly known as 'death' - when the mundane 5 <span style="font-style: italic;">khandhas</span> and the transcendent <span style="font-style: italic;">citta</span> go their separate ways. At death, <span style="font-style: italic;">samatha</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">vipassana </span>cease to function (which Arahants rely on to ease the discomfort that is experienced between the <span style="font-style: italic;">citta</span> and the 5 <span style="font-style: italic;">khandhas</span>), disappearing like all other mundane phenomena. Following that, nothing further can be said.<br><br>Continuing to the question of how Compassion could arise, it is already answered above.<br><br>My interpretation? They need to take on a form where the 5 <span style="font-style: italic;">khandhas </span>could be present for Compassion to arise. Perhaps that's why Boddhisattvas prefer to stay in samsara to continue their assistance to the worldly beings. When they enter Nirvana, nothing further can be said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>For all those perturbed by this, please do not worry. What's more important is to practise right now and not wait for this human lifetime is extremely precious. And when you are skilled in your practice, you'll see for yourself what all these mean.<br><br></div>
