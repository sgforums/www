            <div class='col-md body'>The following is a list of common misunderstandings of what Buddhism is really about in Singapore. If you wish to contribute to this list to dispell and disallow any misconception to continue, please message me.<br><br><strong>Misconception #1: Buddhists burn joss papers, burn paper houses and ask for answers from the Buddha by shaking those sticks in a canister.</strong><br><br>Those are traditional Chinese practices and more often than not associated to Taoism, not Buddhism. Buddhists do not engage in such practices.<br><br><strong>Misconception #2: Buddha is like so powerful, man! People are going to him for lottery numbers, good health and fortune!</strong><br><br>The Chinese culture of seeking divine favor from celetial beings has been mistakenly related to Buddhism through the generations. People refer freely the Buddha and Boddhisattva like Guanyin to gods and deities popular in Taoism. They are in fact very different.<br><br><strong>Misconception #3: All bald people in Buddhist robes are Buddhist monks.</strong><br><br>From numerous cases in the news, there are actually people disguising themselves as Buddhist monks to prey on people with a sympathetic heart. These imposters often seek money and other valuables, sometimes even asking for payment for certain services they offer such as blessings or chantings. To have an understanding of Buddhist practices should prevent yourself from being cheated by these fakes.<br><br><strong>Misconception #4: Buddhists are so boring! Chanting and chanting everyday!</strong><br><br>Chanting is only one of the many practices of Buddhism. Meditation is actually the mainstay practice but there are various methods that have been devised through the ages. Though varied the practices are, they should always point towards realising the 4 Noble Truths, and to help others to see them. On a much simpler term: Realising who we really are and why we exist. Buddhist aren't boring. Just you wait for the next Vesak @ Ngee Ann City!!<br><br><strong>Misconception #5: Buddhists cannot eat beef.</strong><br><br>That's not true. Sakkyamuni Buddha himself was not a vegetarian then, nor did he specify that we are not allowed to take any kind of food. The concept of abstaining from taking beef finds root in the traditional Chinese culture. The bulls were heavily relied on to cultivate their lands and as a gesture of gratitude, they are spared from the kitchen. As you may know, the agricultural industries use machines to cultivate the fields now.<br><br>Will add more soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Heavenly joy is a worldly, impermanent joy, while Buddha's Nirvana is a permanent bliss with absolute mental clarity, freed from illusions as he has attained Enlightenment. Buddha has many names, some people called him World Honoured One, Tathagatha, Thus Come One, and so on. One of them is 'The Teacher of Gods and Men', meaning Buddha also teaches the gods and deities, because some of them also seek Buddha's wisdom and enlightenment. There is an interesting website about this:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/bps/wheels/wheel414.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/bps/wheels/wheel414.html</a><br><br>Contents<br><br>* I. Introduction<br>* II. The Buddha Teaches Deities<br>* III. Devas and Brahmas Honor the Buddha<br>* IV. The Role of Devas in the Buddha's Career<br>* V. Liberation for Humans, Devas, and Brahmas<br>* Notes<br>* Abbreviations<br>* Bibliography</blockquote>Furthermore, many deities that Chinese worship nowadays are not deities from the Heavens, they are spiritual deities, in other words deities that come from the spirit realms. They may possess a spirit medium, give divinations and so on. Buddhists are advised to stay away from such practices. We seek rebirth in higher realms, not lower realms, and ultimately, end the cycle of samsaric rebirth.<br><br>Guan Yin is Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. The famous Maha Bodhisattvas (Da4 Pu2 Sa1) are role model for all Mahayana Buddhists who wish to achieve Buddhahood. Guan Yin represents Great Compassion, there are other great bodhisattvas like Manjusri, who represents Great Wisdom, and so on. Guan Shi Yin is also known to save everyone whose lives are in danger, and hears the cries and sounds of all sentient beings. That is why he is called 'Jiu4 Ku3 Jiu4 Nan4', saving sufferings saving hardship, 'Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa', Bodhisattva Who Listens To The Sounds Of All The World.<br><br>In Short, a Bodhisattva is a person who is seeking/on their path to Buddhahood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have something to add to misconception (1) and (4).<br><br>The offering of incense is done back in India, nowadays Buddhists do burn incense/joss sticks. But those incense back in India were much more fragrant, their aroma is those of floral, sandalwood, etc.<br><br>In Chinese Buddhism, what does Incense represents? It represents the "fragrance of Dao De". And what exactly is Dao De? In short, Dao is benefitting self, De is benefitting others, Dao De together means benefitting self and others. Actually if you have Dao De, there is no need for you to put incense at every place a monastery. We do however burn incense during chanting, meditation.<br><br>as to (4), meditation is just one aspect of Buddhist practise. Although meditation is a part of the Buddha's time table, the Buddha is most of the time doing other things/spreading the dharma, helping others, etc. If you know eight-fold path, Right Meditation is one aspect, but there are many factors that is required for enlightenment also.<br><br>Dharma can also be said a way of life, a way of liberation even in the midst of living.</div>

Come, I explain! To put it very simply:<br><br><strong>Deities and gods </strong>are still in the cycle of birth and death as explained by the Buddha. We are also in this cycle, just that we are of a different 'dimension' or realm, that's why we can't see them with our mortal eyes and have afternoon tea with them.<br><br><strong>Buddha</strong> has gone beyond the cycle of birth and death, so he ain't coming back to get knocked down by reckless drunks or get his heart broken by nasty guys.<br><br>As for <strong>Boddhisattva</strong>, they are beings with high level of wisdom and realisation but opted for the last ' express plane' to Nirvana the Buddha has attained, so people stranded on the planet with terrorists and natural disasters could go ahead of them first to safety.  (Boddhisattva originated from the Mahayana tradition, I think... To find out more about the different traditions, please stay tune!!)<br><br>Hope I have explained very simply for you.

I have heard of such things, but I have yet to see monks driving expensive cars. Maybe one of his disciples lend him or someone donated to him? And then big organisations like Ren Ci Hospital also got expensive cars I think, I may be wrong. But Ven. Shi Ming Yi does not receive any salary at all, or rather, he returns all the "salary" to the hospital itself therefore he receives no money.<br><br>Anyway I doubt monks shopping in shopping centres have much things to buy.

Although we often say we shouldn't be critical about the Sangha since we should uphold the sanctity, but if the sanctity isn't sustained within the Sangha, everything will crumble, no matter how much faith we have all the time.<br><br>Furthermore, since the Sangha is to guide laypeople to practise the Path, I believe giving us a reason to lose faith should not never be an agenda!

Buddha did not stay in his monastery all day, he and his monks go to all kinds of places to preach the dharma. In his 49 years, Buddha has walked throughout India, northern India to Pakistan area to Southern India/Sri Lanka, etc. My master also walked throughout Taiwan for several years preaching the dharma. <span style="font-style: italic;">Once when I was in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you cultivating? I replied, "ThatÂ’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha teaches us to cultivate our conduct (xiu1 xing3). He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down (xiu1 zuo4)! In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds, I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."</span><br><br>Sometimes a monk/nun needs to get something important to be done, may not be what we think they are doing. But I agree with you, being a renuncant doesn't mean he is a perfect person. But he has to hold 200+ precepts (training rules) by the Buddha that shld be strict enough to make them observe their conduct.<br><br><blockquote>not judgemental lor, just saw with mi own eyes... big merc benz... well, go see for yourself lor... and since now investigation is done on charitable organisations, hope not we see a temple be involved in the scam...</blockquote>Rest be assured that Ren Ci Hospital is definitely not involved in any scams.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The $15K monthly salary is accorded to the highest paid executive of Ren Ci Hospital &amp; Medicare Centre.
