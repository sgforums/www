              <p><strong>Major fire causes 150 to evacuate; mosque to close till further notice</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A major fire at a mosque in eastern Singapore on
              Tuesday afternoon caused thick plumes of smoke in the Marine Parade
              Road area, and resulted in a rapid evacuation of more than a hundred
              people.
              <br> <br>Only one person was injured. A man in his 50s was brought to Changi
              General Hospital following complaints of pains in his shoulder and knee
              after he fell while trying to escape from the fire.
              <br> <br>Police arrested a 14-year-old in connection with the fire at about
              3.30pm. He will be charged in the Juvenile Court on Wednesday. If
              convicted, the youth could be jailed up to seven years and fined.
              <br> <br>Many viewers called Channel NewsAsia about the fire at the Kampong
              Siglap Mosque on Marine Parade Road which broke out just after 2pm.
              <br> <br>Eyewitnesses told Channel NewsAsia that the fire was believed to
              have started in a corner of the prayer hall. When it went out of
              control, about 150 people in the mosque were evacuated, including 120
              pre-schoolers in the kindergarten housed within the same compound.
              <br> <br>By the time the Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF) officers
              arrived, the fire had fully engulfed the rooftop and had threatened to
              spread to the other sections of the mosque.
              <br> <br>The SCDF deployed at least two fire engines before the fire was
              under control after 45 minutes. They then spent some time cooling down
              the site with water jets.
              <br> <br> Two red rhinos, three support appliances as well as one ambulance were also deployed.
              <br> <br>Before the SCDF officers arrived, two people - the mosque's
              operations manager and a part-time religious teacher - had tried to put
              out the fire. However, the fire got too big to be put out with the
              available extinguishers in the mosque.
              <br> <br> The road nearest to the mosque, heading towards Bedok South Road, was closed for at least three hours due to the fire. 
              <br> <br>The fire is believed to have spread from bookshelves on the second
              level of the main prayer room to the roof, according to Maj Iskandar
              Mirza, commander of Changi Fire Station.
              <br> <br>The roof, measuring 15 by 20 metres, has collapsed in the fire. The
              Islamic Religious Council (MUIS) said the mosque will be closed until
              further notice.
              <br> <br> The mosque, which has a capacity of 3,000 prayer spaces, also ran pre-school classes for 180 students. 
              <br> <br>During its closure, MUIS said the congregation can perform their
              prayers at other mosques nearby. There are four mosques - Abdul Aleem
              Siddique, Al-Ansar, Mydin and Kassim - located within a two-kilometre
              radius of the Kampong Siglap mosque.
              <br> <br>The staff at the mosque are in touch with parents of the
              pre-schoolers on alternative arrangements for their children's
              schooling.
              <br> <br> SCDF said the Building and Construction Authority will assess the condition of the building.

              <p>The 14-year-old boy who allegedly set fire to the Kampung Siglap Mosque
              earlier this month was slapped with two new charges this morning. <br> <br> The boy who cannot be named, supposedly trespassed into the grounds of
              an old folks home, Apex Harmony Lodge, in Pasir Ris in the wee hours of
              October 4 with the intention of stealing money from a maid there. <br> <br> He was discovered and a student EZ-Link card belonging to another boy was found on him when he was caught. <br> <br> The 14-year-old is suspected to have stolen the EZ-Link card. <br> <br> He will appear in court again on 28 October when his psychiatric assessment report will be ready. <br> <br> He is now remanded in the Boys' Home.</p>
