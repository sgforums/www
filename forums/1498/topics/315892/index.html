              <h1 class="clr">Major public emergency exercise to be held on May 23</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The next major public emergency exercise, which is known as the Northstar exercise, will be held on May 23.</p>
              <p>The exercise scenario is a large—scale simulated sea mishap on board
              a cruise ship. This was revealed by Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng
              at the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) annual workplan seminar on
              Monday.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong also disclosed that a new system will be
              introduced to the emergency ambulance service which will allow
              ambulance personnel to assess a patient’s condition earlier.</p>
              <p>This new medical protocol system will be introduced to the 995 service next year.</p>
              <p>Through
              a simple set of questions, the crew will be able to assess a patient’s
              condition before they arrive at the scene. Private ambulance operators
              will also be linked to the new system.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The emergency ambulance
              service, which is run by the SCDF, received 109,459 calls in 2007 — 14
              percent higher than the number of calls received in 2006.</span></p>
              <p>As for
              this year’s Northstar exercise, the home affairs minister said unlike
              previous exercises that involved land—based emergency scenarios, the
              next one will be on board a cruise ship.</p>
              <p>"It will involve 13
              agencies to test and validate their emergency response plans. The SCDF,
              the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and other agencies have
              been working with the shipping community and cruise operators to
              minimise disruptions and inconvenience," said Mr Wong.</p>
              <p>He also reminded the SCDF officers that they will face new challenges with major infrastructural changes in the next few years.</p>
              <p>These
              challenges include the establishment of taller skyscrapers and mega
              installations on Jurong island to handle alternative fuel such as
              biofuel.</p>
              <p>At the seminar, Mr Wong was also briefed on Singapore’s
              first Fire Investigation Dog Unit, which will be fully operational by
              the middle of this year.</p>
              <p>The dogs at this unit are trained to
              sniff out traces of flammable material, left behind after a fire, and
              each dog requires about six months of training. — CNA/so</p>

              <p><span><strong>Northstar VI to simulate multi—agency response to casualties at sea</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singapore will hold its largest maritime exercise in about two weeks. Code—named Northstar VI, it will involve 13 agencies from the public and private sector.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The simulated fire—rescue operation aims to test a multi—agency response involving mass casualties out at sea. This exercise is similar in scale to the previous Northstar land exercise two years ago.</p>
              <p>Northstar VI will take place onboard a luxury cruise ship. On the day of the exercise, there will be a simulated fire on board the SuperStar Aquarius, some three kilometres offshore.</p>
              <p>Firefighting and rescue vessels will be deployed to help. The Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal and Marina South Pier will serve as receiving points for survivors and casualties before they are taken to Changi General Hospital.</p>
              <p>Some 40 sea vessels will help evacuate passengers back to land and a Super Puma helicopter will be on standby to air—lift the severely injured.</p>
              <p>The Changi—Simei Community Club will be turned into a family assistance centre to help anyone locate and get in touch with relatives.</p>
              <p>As this exercise is out at sea, it will pose different challenges from the previous one, which simulated near simultaneous attacks at multiple land transport hubs.</p>
              <p>Colonel Eric Yap, Director Operations, Singapore Civil Defence Force, said: "One major challenge as far as a maritime scenario as compared to a land—based scenario is that of accessibility to the incident site. In a maritime scenario, these challenges will be multi—fold and of course it will require a lot of ships and boats to be able to mobilise land—based resources to move towards the incident site that is out at sea."</p>
              <p>While the luxury cruiser can carry some 2,800 passengers and crew, no real passenger will be on board during Northstar VI.</p>
              <p>On the day of the exercise, SuperStar Aquarius will drop off its cruise passengers, before taking on the role—players at around 10am. After the exercise is over, the ship will go back to shore to pick up more passengers for its night cruise, which starts at 9pm.</p>
              <p>David Wendel, Vice President, Nautical Ops, Star Cruises, said: "We will return to cruise bay and be back about 4.30pm when we start to embark our normal passengers and leave for a cruise as per normal.</p>
              <p>"We still need to do all the cleaning, the turn around, but they’re still going to participate in this exercise. There will be some extra overtime, but we think that this is so important for us to participate (in)."</p>
              <p>The Marina South Pier will be closed during the exercise, while the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal will be partially closed. — CNA/vm</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Star Cruises gears up for emergency exercise next week</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Star Cruises will take part in the largest maritime emergency exercise alongside 12 government agencies on 23 May.</p>
              <p>Crew members of SuperStar Aquarius will be tested in a simulated fire rescue operation during the Northstar VI exercise.</p>
              <p>Of the 1,200 crew members, Star Cruises said 750 are trained to handle emergencies.</p>
              <p>Martin
              Van Den Berg, captain of SuperStar Aquarius, said: "From the initial
              stage when we discover the fire by detector or manually, it takes about
              a minute until we have people there. (Within a) maximum (of) five
              minutes, we should have the fire groups starting to attack the fire."</p>
              <p>"Everybody is responding on the PA (public announcement) system, on the radios and on the pager system," he added.</p>
              <p>A medical team will also be on hand to help the injured.</p>
              <p>There
              are about 70 lifeboats and life rafts on board. They can hold up to
              3,500 people and will be used to evacuate passengers and crew members
              in the event of an emergency.</p>
              <p>The lifeboats and life rafts,
              however, will not be dispatched during the Northstar VI exercise, so as
              to test the responsiveness of the government agencies involved.</p>
              <p>In the exercise, about 1,000 passengers will be evacuated on 40 vessels from the Navy and Coast Guard, among others.</p>
              <p>Starting
              this week, posters will be displayed at various places, such as Tanah
              Merah Ferry Terminal and Singapore Cruise Centre, to alert the public
              about the exercise. — CNA/ac</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Maritime exercise Northstar VI tests emergency preparedness of agencies</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s largest maritime civil emergency exercise, code—named Northstar VI, was successfully concluded on Friday.</p>
              <p>The six—hour long exercise involved over 3,000 volunteers,
              officials, uniformed and medical personnel in a mock fire—rescue
              operation.</p>
              <p>The scenario for the exercise took place on board the SuperStar Aquarius cruise ship just three kilometres off—shore.</p>
              <p>Some
              40 fire—fighting and rescue boats were mobilized to help evacuate over
              1,000 passengers and crew ’trapped’ onboard to safety.</p>
              <p>Helicopters
              were also deployed to help get passengers off the ship. Joining them
              were rescue teams from the Maritime and Port Authority and the
              Singapore Police Coast Guard who had only 30 minutes to carry out their
              task.</p>
              <p>’Casualties’ at the scene were taken care of by medical
              personnel and two Chinook helicopters were also deployed to airlift
              those with ’severe injuries’ to the Changi General Hospital.</p>
              <p>This
              year’s Northstar exercise involved 12 agencies from both the public and
              private sector, as well as volunteers from schools and grassroots
              organizations.</p>
              <p>It was also the first such exercise to be held at
              sea and was carried out to test the ability of different agencies to
              deal with a large—scale fire on—board a cruise ship.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime
              Minister Wong Kan Seng said the exercise is crucial to test the
              readiness of agencies that safeguard Singapore’s reputation as an
              international maritime hub.</p>
              <p>“When it’s at sea, you have the
              additional challenge of distance, you have the challenge of water, and
