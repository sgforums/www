              <p>OIL giant ExxonMobil faces court proceedings for allegedly failing to
               let Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers in to put out a fire 
              at one of its refineries.</p>
              <p>In a highly unusual case, the company was on Tuesday issued three summonses in a district court for violating fire regulations.</p>
              <p>SCDF is believed to have been alerted by a telephone call from a 
              person who noticed the fire in the Pioneer Road refinery on Jan 6.</p>
              <p>ExxonMobil is accused of not allowing the officers to enter 
              to put it out at about 2am. It is also said to have failed to let them 
              in around two hours later to investigate and determine its cause.</p>
              <p>The third summons is for allegedly failing to make sure that
               the refinery's fire safety manager notified the SCDF immediately about 
              the fire.</p>
              <p>The proceedings on Tuesday were conducted in chambers and the case was adjourned until Dec 28.</p>

              <p><strong>SCDF withdraws charges against ExxonMobil</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has withdrawn charges against ExxonMobil.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SCDF alleged previously that the oil giant had failed to let firemen put out a fire at one of its refineries.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SCDF did not elaborate on its latest decision during a brief court hearing on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>When queried later 
              by Channel NewsAsia, an SCDF spokesman said: "The management of 
              ExxonMobil has appealed and also taken prompt corrective actions...in 
              view of this, SCDF decided to issue a stern warning in lieu of 
              proceeding with charges against the company."</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The fire in question
               at the Pioneer Road refinery occurred on January 6, and SCDF officers 
              were also not allowed in some two hours later to investigate and 
              determine its cause.<br><br>A third summons was for allegedly failing to notify SCDF immediately about the fire.<br><br>ExxonMobil
               apologised on Monday for the company's "part in the circumstances 
              leading to the charges". "We've since reviewed our internal processes to
               ensure that such an incident won't occur again," its spokesperson told 
              Channel NewsAsia. "We're also working with SCDF to ensure a closer 
              alignment in our operational processes with all the ground personnel."<br><br>ExxonMobil gave assurances about the safety of its workers and the community.<br><br>"The
               Singapore refinery, as with other ExxonMobil sites, has an emergency 
              response plan, and the employees prepare themselves through regular 
              training and drills," said its spokesperson.<br><br>She said the company
               was equipped with a range of fire fighting equipment, which are subject
               to SCDF audits, and response teams were staffed with personnel trained 
              at the SCDF Academy.<br><br>Under the Fire Safety Act, authorised 
              personnel have the right to enter any premises to check for fire hazards
               and to determine the causes of a fire, among other duties.<br><br>Breaching the law carries a maximum fine of S$10,000, up to six months in jail, or both.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
