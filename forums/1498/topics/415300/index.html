              <p>Hey guys, so i got enlist to SCDF on the 14th December 2010 and i've got some questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is PesBp training like? Is it very tough? I broke my knee 3 years ago and it was quite severe, went to hospital, had surgery and stuff. When the MO in CMPB ask about my knee i told him everything and he said he will send a letter to the hospital requesting for documents about my knee, and gave me PES D in the mean time. 2 months later, received letter that i was PesBp, how is this possible?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've got very minor asthma, i fracture my collar bone before which wasn't too severe, and the knee is the worst. How come i still PesBP? I've got friends with small problems like maybe asthma or abit of back problem and they get posted to Pes C.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, i really want to use the training to lose as much weight as i can, but i also am worried about my leg, i don't want to put too much into it and injure it again. As it is, i can't even kneel down and put pressure on that knee, it will hurt. So is there a way to just enlist under Pes Bp first, then train for abit and see if i can take the training, if i can't am i allowed to request to down Pes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And do i need to bring any of the medical documents down to prove it to them? Am i able to request for spare documents from the hospital? I'm not sure if i still have them at home.</p>
              <p>Thanks, and anyone else enlisting on that day? Mine is at 11am.</p>
              <p>Oh and i read in one of the topics, someone said something about CD got no confinement period, is this true? Means i go in tuesday, i'll be out on friday?</p>

              <p><strong>A: During my intake, the Pes BP recruits will mostly head to CDA for their aqua exercise but there may be changes &amp; with regards to your Pes status, feel free to look for the MO on your day of enlistment.</strong></p>

              <p>if your eyesight is not that bad then you can be selected to be a firefighter..<br>but you'll still get to choose in terms of 1st option, 2nd option &amp; so-on..</p>
              <p>for the smoking part, it all depends &amp; my advice to you is "do what you want but just don't get caught" (disclaimer: I'm not encouraging you to smoke when I say that)..</p>

              <p>In NS itself, your basic training (<abbr title="Basic Military Training">BMT</abbr>/<abbr title="Basic Police Training">BPT</abbr>/<abbr title="Basic Rescue Training">BRT</abbr>) will be much longer than the usual.</p>
              <p>This gives you more time to lose weight and get fit in a safe manner.</p>
              <p>Would strongly advise you to aim for the medic course as I was once an ambulance medic as well but then again its not for the faint hearted..</p>
