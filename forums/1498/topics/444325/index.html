              <p><strong>Friday, 23 December 2011</strong><br><strong>Alert on Unauthorized Business Activities and Impersonation of SCDF Officer</strong></p>
              <p class="data-content">The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has 
              received a number of complaints about companies claiming to be endorsed 
              by the SCDF to sell fire extinguishers and/or conduct fire safety talks 
              to the public.  In some of these instances, the company personnel had 
              shown the SCDF Emergency Handbook to give the impression that they are 
              representing the SCDF.  Furthermore, aggressive, ‘hard-sell’ techniques 
              were adopted by them to get members of public in purchasing their 
              products, fire insurance or signing up for their fire safety talks and 
              training seminars.  In a recent case, a member of public claimed that a 
              woman had impersonated as a SCDF officer and tried to sell a fire 
              extinguisher to his father.  The complainant also claimed that the 
              impersonator had mentioned that SCDF would provide $30,000 worth of fire
               insurance to them if they were to buy the extinguisher.</p>
              <p class="data-content"> </p>
              <p class="data-content">SCDF would like to inform members of the public 
              that our officers are not involved in any direct sales of fire 
              extinguishers and we have not authorized any company to conduct such 
              activities.  It is also a standard procedure for all uniformed regular 
              staff of SCDF to display their warrant card when on duty.  In addition, 
              Full-time National Servicemen are issued with the NS identity Card.  
              Both these cards bear the name, NRIC number and photograph of the card 
              holder. When approached by anyone claiming to be SCDF personnel on 
              official duties or as an authorized representative, the public are 
              advised to request for their warrant card, NS Identity Card or letter of
               authorization, as proof of authentication. A sample of the warrant card
               and NS Identity Card are shown below.</p>

              <p class="data-content">The public should note that knowledge on fire 
              safety and Community Emergency Preparedness Programmes (CEPP) are 
              provided free of charge at all SCDF Division Headquarters. For more 
              details on CEPP, the public can visit our SCDF website at 
              http://www.scdf.gov.sg/scdf_internet/en/community-and-volunteers/community-preparedness/community-programmes/cepp.html. </p>

              <p class="data-content">A list of companies certified by TÜV SÜD PSB 
              Singapore (previously known as PSB Corporation) for the servicing and 
              maintenance of fire extinguishers is available on the SCDF and NFEC 
              websites at the following links:  <br> a)  http://www.scdf.gov.sg/scdf_internet/en/building-professionals/downloads.html<br> b)  <a href="http://www.nfec.gov.sg/prods_fire_safety_equip.html">http://www.nfec.gov.sg/prods_fire_safety_equip.html</a></p>
              <p class="data-content"> </p>
              <p class="data-content">Members of public can also contact SCDF general 
              enquiries (1800-286-5555) if they encounter suspicious person(s) 
              claiming to be representing SCDF or conducting unauthorized activities 
              on its behalf.  For cases involving the impersonation of SCDF officer, 
              members of public are advised to lodge a police report.</p>
              <p class="data-content"> </p>
              <p>In addition, individuals who wish to file a 
              complaint against such companies can call CASE’s hotline (6-1000-315) 
              for assistance.  They can also file an online complaint via CASE’s
