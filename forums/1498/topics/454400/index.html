              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Response time to emergencies on Sentosa could soon be
               halved, with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) lining up plans 
              to build a new fire station to cater to the increase in infrastructure 
              and population density on the island.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The proposed 
              four-storey building will replace the four-year-old Sentosa Fire Post, 
              according to a Request for Information (RFI) posted on June 19 on 
              government tender website GeBIZ.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Besides providing emergency fire and ambulance services, security has also been cited as "a top concern".<br><br>"To
               provide sufficient first-response coverage at the most timely 
              intervention to the island in any case of terrorist threats, SPF 
              (Singapore Police Force) Special Operations Command will also deploy a 
              unit at the same premises to effectively perform its function swiftly 
              and effectively in responding and containing any terrorist or criminal 
              attacks on the island," said the SCDF's RFI document.<br><br>The SCDF 
              said the new fire station will be completed by the end of 2014. It is 
              seeking project management consultancy services for the development of 
              the new station, estimated to cost S$19.8 million, according to tender 
              papers.<br><br>Currently, intervention for fire outbreaks are provided 
              first by the Sentosa Fire Post, which houses a four-man crew, and one 
              light fire attack vehicle.<br><br>Additional resources from the nearest 
              full-fledged Alexandra Fire Station would take an average of 15 minutes,
               under good traffic conditions, to reach the most remote part of 
              Sentosa.<br><br>The SCDF is hoping to cut the response time for fire 
              rescue to eight minutes after it has been notified. In addition, the 
              station could also provide emergency response coverage to the 
              Harbourfront area.<br><br>Noting that daily visitor numbers to Sentosa 
              increased by more than two-fold within the last three years, the SCDF 
              said in tender documents: "The increase in infrastructure, as well as 
              population density and activities, incidents on Sentosa Island would 
              have a greater impact in terms of the extent of damage and casualty 
              numbers."<br><br>Today, Sentosa receives over 19 million visitors 
              annually and is home to more than 200 attractions, hotels, beach bars, 
              retail outlets, as well as the Sentosa Cove residential enclave, which 
              has more than 4,000 residents.<br><br>In its media response, the SCDF 
              said there are plans for this new station to incorporate environmental 
              friendly features, such as the use of NEWater in the fire station and 
              the installation of solar panels at various parts of the station. The 
              Sentosa Fire Station will also supplement the existing 16 fire stations 
              island-wide.<br><br>Sentosa Leisure Group's Rangers Department director 
              Koh Piak Huat told MediaCorp that the planned expansion of the Sentosa 
              Fire Station "is part of the island's long-term safety and security plan
               to boost the island's resilience and responsiveness during 
              emergencies".<br><br>Regulars like Michelle Goh, 27, who visits Sentosa 
              at least once a month, felt the enhanced security and fire prevention 
              measures are essential in providing a faster response.<br><br>"Visitors will definitely feel safer and tourists will also feel more secure to spend long hours on the island," she added.<br><br>- </span><span class="path">TODAY</span></span></p>
