              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A study here has found that <strong>patients who encounter 
              acute heart attacks are not calling for ambulances, resulting in a delay
               in receiving medical help. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The study, the 
              findings of which were published in the Internal Medicine Journal last 
              year, surveyed 252 heart attack patients at the National University 
              Hospital (NUH). </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The study found that
               only <strong>35 per cent of these patients used emergency medical services</strong> when
               presented with symptoms of a heart attack.<br><br>Some <strong>98 patients took
               their own transport</strong> to the hospital, while another <strong>22 per cent sought 
              assistance from their general practitioner</strong> (GP) first. <br><br>For <strong>those
               who did not call for an ambulance</strong>, the <strong>period between the onset of 
              symptoms and receiving medical help was prolonged by an average of 82 
              minutes</strong>, according to the study.<br><br>National University Heart Centre
               registrar Tan Li Ling, who led the study, said: "There is a need to 
              educate the public on the symptoms of a heart attack as patients might 
              not use the emergency medical service when they do not recognise the 
              symptoms."<br><br>She added that <strong>greater awareness of the benefits of 
              using an ambulance was needed.</strong> For instance, in the case of a 
              life-threatening heart attack, <strong>paramedics and equipment like 
              defibrillators are on hand to provide prompt treatment on the spot</strong>, she 
              said.<br><br>GPs TODAY spoke to said educating patients could be 
              challenging. For one, heart attack symptoms may not be easily 
              recognisable. Dr Kevin Chua of Drs Chua &amp; Partners said: "The 
              symptoms of a heart attack vary and it is not clear cut. Hence, patients
               might turn to their GP if they see the symptoms as something mild."<br><br>He
               encounters patients suffering heart attacks once every few months and 
              refers them to the hospital after assessing their condition. <br><br>The
               researchers said the tendency to brush off symptoms could be cultural, 
              as the findings are in line with overseas studies which have <strong>found that 
              Asian patients were more likely to not call for emergency medical help</strong>. 
              This may also be the case when it comes to older patients, they added. <br><br>The researchers noted some patients may <strong>assume they could reach the hospital faster in their own cars. </strong><br><br>However,
               the study would have to be expanded to be more representative as it 
              involved a relatively healthy group of participants with a low mortality
               rate and this was not an accurate reflection of NUH's heart attack 
              patients, they said. </span></span></p>
