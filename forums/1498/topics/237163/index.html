            <div class='col-md body'>Can anyone in the SCDF tell me more about the life there while in NS? For me, I would like to get ERS. What's the requirement for it? Also, what to bring for the first day? Or will a new letter containing all the details be sent to me when the reporting day is approaching? Anyway, my reporting day is on 9 or 10 April 2007. Anyone going there as well? Hope to make some friends there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, actually IMO serving your NS with SCDF is a much better thing as compared with the SAF as you see, you can apply the thechniques that you've learnt as a recruit as well as when you're being posted to the vocation of your choice (hopefully), you're able to apply what you've learnt in real life.<br><br>From what I know, getting into ERS must first got thru an interview and if I'm not wrong, a diploma must be the minimum expectation but now, I do not know as there could be some changes...Not to worry, regarding what you neeed to bring on your first day, a new letter would be mailed to you &amp; just follow all the instructions there &amp; you'll be fine...<br><br>First few days, sure nervous for some coz its a whole new environment &amp; you'll surely make some friends in time to come &amp; last but not least, wishing you all the best in your recruit life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. thankz! That i know about SCDF being a better choice than SAF. That's what I've been telling mates about it. Me being the only one in SCDF among all the schoolmates that I know. Lol.. Diploma?? What about A level certs? Is it enough? Well then.. There's still the interview. I hope I can pass through it. Hope to be at least a Seargent and make my NS much more worthwhile with the experience and allowance. Any other guys going into SCDF this April?</div>

I'm already an SCT!! lol... got into ERS. And suddenly, it seems slacker than what i have expected. Seems like the firefighters get more hell than us. For us, it's 8am-5pm training. 5.30 onwards play soccer. shiok seh. not much pressure. perhaps i've faced much more hell during my NCC days.<br><br>as for the towel, it needs a few washes and it's good to be used. And i love the fireman suit. A few days of training in it and suddenly my fitness level went up a few notches. nice.</div>
