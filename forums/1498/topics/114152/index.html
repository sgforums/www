We don't carry arms in SCDF so what you'll learn during your time in BRT is basic rescue stuff ! Like how to handle a power saw, spreader cutter, basic 1st aid &amp; fire fighting, etc etc..

I've two bros, one SCDF and one army signaller.. Seriously, i listen to them recounting their tales, i've more respect for the firefighter. While the other do endless drill, fighting invisible enemies and preparing for war scenarios that would probably never happened in our lifetimes, the other was dealing with REAL life and death scenarios on a daily basis, saving lifes and properties, tending to the wounded and injured.<br><br>No prestigelah but then thats how REAL heros in real life are treated, people dont know one. Let them be lah, later their properties on fire , who they call? Army issit? lol those green guys cant do crap. The men in blue are the real unsung heroes.</div></blockquote>those green guys probably blow up more things......hehe....each playing a part to complement each other....SCDF good at wat they do...SAF good at wat they do...u cant expect a day to day war happening 24/7 for the next 2 years rite?</div>
