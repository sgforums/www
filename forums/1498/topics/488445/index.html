              <div>SINGAPORE: Three accidents involving heavy vehicles took place on Wednesday morning (May 20).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the first accident occurred at a filter lane from Airport Boulevard entering PIE towards the City. The accident was reported at around 7.40am and two fire bikes, two fire engines, a Red Rhino, two ambulances and two support vehicles, including Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) personnel were sent to the scene, it added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>SCDF said that upon arrival, a 16-wheel trailer was found lying on the left side. The passenger had managed to get out but the driver was trapped in the vehicle. The passenger, who is in his 20s, complained of shoulder pain and was conveyed to the Changi General Hospital (CGH).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>SCDF said a team of medical staff from CGH was also activated for medical assistance. The whole rescue operation to extricate the driver took approximately two hours as SCDF officers had to “secure and stabilise the trailer”, it added. Paramedics at the scene monitored the driver’s vital signs and said he was conscious throughout the whole rescue operation.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Rescue tools including a cutter, a spreader and airbags were used to free the driver, whose legs were trapped at the dashboard, while the cabin roof of the trailer had caved in, said SCDF. The driver, who is in 30s, was later conveyed conscious to CGH. SCDF added that he sustained head and spinal injuries.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The second accident happened along PIE towards Tuas, near the Bukit Batok Ave 3 exit. Police said they received a call at 10.08am about an accident involving a trailer. No injuries were reported.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The third accident that occurred Wednesday morning happened at Nicoll Drive near SAF Ferry Terminal. Police said the accident involved a lorry, a trailer and a motorcycle. The lorry had overturned on the side, which caused the motorcyclist’s left leg to be trapped at the front of the lorry.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to SCDF, it received a call at 11.48am and dispatched two fire bikes, a Red Rhino, a fire engine, a support vehicle and an ambulance. SCDF officers lifted the lorry up with an airbag and were able to extricate the motorcyclist who had injuries to his leg. The 35-year-old was conscious when he was sent to CGH, police said. </div>
