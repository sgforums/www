              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unsafe cladding removed from 17 buildings, 2 more non-compliant cladding models identified</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Seventeen buildings have completed the removal of cladding that do not meet safety requirements under the Fire Code, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a press release on Friday (Dec 8).<br><br>SCDF's update follows its announcement earlier this year that 39 buildings had used cladding that did not meet the fire safety requirements. Five of them later tested compliant.<br><br>The discovery of the use of the non-compliant combustible cladding came after an industrial building at 30 Toh Guan Road caught fire in May, which resulted in the death of a 54-year-old woman. <br><br>Investigations by the SCDF found that the Alubond composite panels used as cladding on the building's external walls were not certified as Class 0 as required under the Fire Code.<br><br>In its statement on Friday, SCDF said that the removal of the cladding on the remaining 17 buildings are in progress.</p>
              <p><strong>NEW NON-COMPLIANT CLADDING MODELS IDENTIFIED</strong><br><br>SCDF also said that it has identified two more composite panel models that may not be certified Class 0 as well - Bolliya and Bolli-Core FR. Seven buildings could be affected, it said.<br><br>An additional two building projects could also be affected by other non-compliant models of composite panels. Investigations are still ongoing to determine how non-compliant materials were used for these buildings.</p>
              <p>On-site fire safety assessments to inspect ignition sources and escape routes were also conducted by the SCDF on the new buildings identified to have other non-compliant cladding models. <br><br>According to the SCDF, all affected building owners have been contacted and if non-compliant cladding is found, the building owners must work with qualified persons to remove the cladding within 60 days. <br><br>The building owners must also strengthen fire safety practices by ensuring their fire safety systems are in good order, removing fire hazards and being vigilant. <br><br>The SCDF will be working with certification bodies and qualified persons to check if there are other buildings with non-compliant cladding by having an annual audit for all current composite panels that meet the Fire Code. <br><br>Information on whether buildings meet the Fire Code requirements will also have to submitted systematically to the SCDF.<br><br>Plans to tightened fire safety regulations and certification processes are currently under review and will be announced next year.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has formed an advisory panel to review the regulatory regime on cladding.<br><br>In a press release on Thursday (Feb 1), the SCDF said the Cladding Regulatory Regime Review Advisory Panel will provide industry feedback to its recommendations and assist in their implementation.<br><br>The 13-member advisory panel comprises key representatives from government agencies, certification bodies, the building industry and academia.<br><br>It will review the fire safety regulations and certification processes relating to the use of Aluminum Composite Panels (ACPs) as cladding.<br><br>The panel will announce the results of its review by end-2018.Â  <br><br>In September 2017, SCDF identified several buildings that may have used unsafe cladding on their external walls. The investigations were triggered by a fire which broke out in an industrial building at 30 Toh Guan Road in May 2017, killing a 54-year-old woman.<br><br>In a subsequent update in December, SCDF said 17 buildings have completed the removal of cladding while the removal process for 17 other buildings were in progress.<br><br>"The regulation of the fire safety products and ensuring that they conform to the relevant standards ensures that our buildings are fire safe. That is of utmost importance," said Member of Parliament Lee Bee Wah, who is a professional engineer. <br><br>She added that as the panel consists of representatives from various sectors, this would help ensure the review is "comprehensive".<br><br>The Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore said it supports the initiative and will work closely with industry partners to "contribute actively".</p>
