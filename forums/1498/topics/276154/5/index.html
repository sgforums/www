If you're into fighting fires(or playing with fire? lol) and doing the heavy lifting in rescue operations, then go ERS/FFC. If you're into blood, gore, and "saving lives", then go medic. If you're into simple non-physical work, go clerk.<br><br>Let me add some points which is relevant, from what I've observed-<br><br>- Clerk doesn't mean no stress, cos you're under the big shots/officers and there may be politics.<br>- Seems like most guys would rather go ERS/FFC because it's "siong" and is "more manly".<br>- To me, as long as you're posted to station it's going to be more or less fun, as you'll be seeing real action; not many ppl have such opportunity.<br>- However not everyone will be able to handle such "real action", as it can be intense.<br>- Firefighters have less calls then medics, thus ambulance work can be exhausting.<br>- You should have character and a sense of responsibility if you're posted to station, if not, I got nothing to say..<br>- Lastly, there are other vocations, and the decision is not up to you anyway! ahaha</div>
