"<br><br>"Don't be big head"<br><br>"Don't be yaya"<br><br>"I don't like to shout and scold, its not my style, but I have to do it.."<br><br>"I'll help you kiss the bar, we kiss it together"<br><br>"Give me push ups, my standard. If you cannot do 30, I'll make you do 40, you understand??"<br><br>And my DRC, Encik Ibrahim's favourite phrases (he left the force already) :<br><br>"The rank on your shoulders is just an empty gun. The bullets are the knowledge you have in your head"<br><br>"This is my lightsaber" *Refering to his SOG, a swiss army knife kinda tool*<br><br>"Darth Vadar has arrived!" *Appearing in his black coated fire helmet*<br><br>"There are only 2 commandments for fire fighters.. Never be late for a turn out, and never to return to the same fire."<br><br>"I am the Jedi Master, and you all are my padawan, you know what's a padawan?"<br><br>"Helmi, one fine day, I'm going to kiwi you!"<br><br>"Don't assume! I told you many times, assumption is the mother of all cock ups"<br><br>"I told you right? I don't like the word 'I thought' "<br><br>"I'm very well versed with the ladder, its the bread and butter of a fire fighter"<br><br>"I'm very well versed with the tempest blower, it once saved my life"<br><br>"You want to know the answer? Later come find me with a sarong and apple"<br><br>"Safety, is the utmost importance"<br><br>"No one fights fire alone, it all takes team work and coorperation"<br><br>"This rank, is just a piece of cloth.."<br><br>"I'm going to teach you my last commandment, how to know if your men are lying to you, this skill will help you manage your men.. this isn't a bullet for you.... this is an atomic bomb."<br><br><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/245/1749/400/DSC06220.jpg"><br><br>To them, I'll forever be grateful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
