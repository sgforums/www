              <p><strong>SCDF engages private ambulance operators </strong></p>
              <p>Come 1st June, Singapore will have more ambulances to respond to emergency calls.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force has engaged two private operators
                  to provide support to its Emergency Ambulance Service or EAS.</p>
              <p>The Private Ambulance Operators or PAOs will be adding ten more ambulances to the current EAS fleet of 40.</p>
              <p>SCDF says the initiative aims to cater to the rising number of EAS calls it receives every year.</p>
              <p>This increase is attributed to the country's rapidly ageing population.</p>
              <p>SCDF projected that by 2030, the number of EAS calls it receives will almost double to more than 230,000 annually.</p>
              <p>It responded to nearly 120,000 calls last year.</p>
              <p>To help cope with this increased demand, the two selected PAOs --
                  Unistrong Technology and Lentor Ambulance -- will each be providing
                  five brand new ambulances and fifteen additional crew members to the
                  current EAS team.</p>
              <p>Each ambulance will be manned by a driver, a medic and a paramedic.</p>
              <p>Jonathan Koh, who's the Chief Operating Officer of Lentor Ambulance
                  says his company has put aside about half a million dollars for the
                  five ambulances.</p>
              <p>He will also be recruiting more employees to support the EAS team.</p>
              <p>" We have already advertised. We are planning to recruit about 24
                  people. The driver, the paramedic's assistant, the paramedic. And most
                  of the paramedics, they've already gone through the one-year Higher
                  NITEC courses with ITEs and the Civil Defence. In the tender document,
                  they have specified they will assign at least five calls per vehicle
                  per day for us. So for five vehicles, we will have a total of 25 calls."</p>
              <p>SCDF's Operations Director, Colonel Anwar Abdullah says the two PAOs
                  were handpicked from a pool of six companies that submitted their
                  tenders last December.</p>
              <p>The force awarded both of them with a three-year contract and the
                  companies also have an option to extend it for an additional two years.</p>
              <p>Colonel Anwar assures the public that the PAOs will be just as capable as the SCDF's EAS team.</p>
              <p>"We will be closely monitoring their performance. There are audit
                  systems which we have already introduced to ensure that the
                  competencies are all maintained. The paramedics and the other emergency
                  personnel, they need to pass their competency tests every six months."</p>
              <p>The PAOs will only be operating during the peak periods for
                  ambulance calls, namely from Monday to Saturday, between 8am and 8pm.</p>
              <p>SCDF will be also rolling out a new call-taking framework on the
                  15th of April to further enhance its current emergency ambulance
                  service.</p>
              <p>The Medical Protocol System or MPS will make use of computer-aided technology to better process emergency calls.</p>
              <p>Under the new initiative, operators will ask callers a set of
                  pre-approved medical questions pertaining to their chief complaints.</p>
              <p>Colonel Anwar says, this will allow the operators to diagnose the patients' conditions before the ambulance arrives.</p>
              <p>"It helps the operator to derive critical information when we
                  receive calls from the public. This information will enable our
                  operators to diagnose the condition of the casualty and at the same
                  time will relay this information to the paramedics enroute to attend to
                  the case."</p>
              <p>Colonel Anwar says, these questions will not affect the time taken for an ambulance to be deployed to a scene.</p>
              <p>It will still be dispatched within one minute after information such
                  as the patient's location and contact number have been ascertained.</p>
              <p>The MPS will start its two-week trial run starting tomorrow.</p>

              <p>The 2 PAOs who got the deal to help SCDF should have Large size ambulances like SCDF to deal with 995 calls..All ex &amp; current SCDF medics should know working in a converted Nissan or Toyota Van does not have "Space" to work in, esp in StandBy cases...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, anyway, till pics of the PAOs ambulance fleet is out for us to see, i will not say so much. As mention by SCDF in news, Lentor &amp; Unistrong bought new ambulances. So, just have to wait till these PAOs turn out for 995 calls, then we can see what type of vehicle they are using...</p>

              <p>the private ambulances will be based at the busier fire stations &amp; my guess would be central fire station being one of them..</p>
              <p>operating hrs are from Monday - Saturday from 0800hrs to 2000hrs which is the traditional peak periods for emergency ambulance calls..</p>

              <p>the current ambulance by ST kinetics is in line with the standard of the star of life as an emergency ambulance.</p>

              <p>does the local regulations require such standards for an emergency ambulance?</p>
              <p>in such a case, the PAOs should purchase ambulance of such a standard?</p>

              <p>LoL, should be the sprinter then? since urvan or hiace dont cost that much?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>besides, i think emergency ambulances have to have an external cab mounted on instead of the nomal cab.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1 more month an it should be out on the streets? haha</p>

              <p>i stumble upon this directive which the current STK ambulances adhere to.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6205332/Federal-Specification-for-the-StarofLife-Ambulance">http://www.scribd.com/doc/6205332/Federal-Specification-for-the-StarofLife-Ambulance</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and the local directive which is prolly outdated but doesnt touch much on the issue of vehicle type</p>

              <p>thanks for providing some useful info..</p>
              <p>I've briefly read through them &amp; its not that very outdated as we're still using more or less of the same items as stated in the directive..</p>

              <p>I shall keep an eye out for the nissan urvan ambulance used by Lentor, as the article mentioned they will be using 5 brand new ambulances, so I need to take note of the plate no. to check if its registered recently. If possible, do take note of the plate no. for me the next time you get to spot it again..</p>
              <p>Well, it all boils down to cost &amp; to get a much bigger van plus the retrofitting will cost the private operators but 1st June is fast approaching, can't wait to see them on the roads attending to 995 calls..</p>

              <p><br>Oh isitz? I must keep a lookout for this ambulance.. Lentor likes to standby @ TTSH during non-call time..maybe can see this updated livery there..but using a Nissan ?? It's too small to use for 995 calls.</p>
