              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: A 17-year-old male died after he fell four storeys at Orchard Central mall on Orchard Road on Friday (Feb 24).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"This afternoon, a member of the public vaulted the railing of the level 4 linkbridge between Orchard Central and Orchard Gateway onto a ledge and subsequently fell to the atrium. He was rushed to the hospital. We are deeply concerned and are currently assisting the police with their investigations of the incident," said Ms Mavis Seow, chief operating officer of the Retail Business Group at Far East Organization.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed that a man was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It added that it was alerted to the incident at about 4.05pm. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Police said the man was found lying motionless on the ground when their officers arrived at the scene. He subsequently died in hospital. Police said they are investigating the unnatural death.</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>"A lot of people were trying to do CPR on him. They kept trying and trying for a good 15 minutes at least," said Devi Rajaram who was at the scene. "He was just motionless."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>She added that there was "whitish" debris on the floor.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Another eyewitness, Mike Tan, told Channel NewsAsia that he was having coffee with a friend when they heard a scream and saw the man falling. He said he called for an ambulance at 4.02pm and was instructed to look for an automated external defibrillator. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The SCDF said CPR was administered by its paramedics on the way to the hospital, which was on standby to receive him.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The area on the ground floor where the man fell has been cordoned off and a link bridge on the fourth floor is now closed.</div>

              <p style='margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"Help me take a Snapchat video and I’ll jump.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Those were the last words of 17-year-old Jonathan Chow before he vaulted over a barrier at Orchard Central and fell four floors to his death last Friday (Feb 24), according to the teenager's friend, Ruth, who witnessed the incident first hand.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Leaked security camera footage that surfaced online over the weekend showed the two teenagers standing together in a linkway between Orchard Central and Orchard Gateway before Jonathan jumped.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“We were window shopping for clothes (at the mall) and when we went to the bridge, he came up with the idea of doing the stunt," said Ruth, 17, who declined to give her full name.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Speaking to TODAY at the teenager's wake at Punggol Central, Ruth said Jonathan had wanted to take a video of her doing the same stunt. Jonathan leapt before she could say no, Ruth added.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“We both thought the parapet was made of concrete, but when he jumped, he fell straight through,” said Ruth, who is currently assisting the police with investigations. “I knew it was dangerous, but before I could stop him, he already jumped over. I swear I wanted to jump over too but I knew it was too late.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Earlier reports had suggested that Jonathan jumped over the barrier in order to retrieve his phone.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The two teenagers got to know each other through social media, and became good friends after meeting up for the first time after Chinese New Year this year. “I was just like a female version of him,” said Ruth. </p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Jonathan, affectionately known to his friends as “Chow”, was a talented skateboarder who occasionally filmed his stunts, said his secondary school mate Muhammad Bazeel Ridzwan, 18.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Mr Matthew Chow, Jonathan’s father, said he was shocked when told about his son’s death on Friday. “No one would believe things like this would happen in a shopping centre," he added.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>At least four passers-by rushed to help and attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Jonathan after he fell. He  was unconscious when he was sent to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital and later died there.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>According to Mr Chow, Jonathan, who had been studying in Australia, returned to Singapore in December to await his call up for National Service. “He had already completed his medical check-up (but) his life was cut short,” said the teen's father, a Singapore permanent resident.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>He said he bore no grudges against Ruth, who had explained to him the events leading up to Jonathan's death.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Mr Chow, however, said the incident raised some safety concerns at shopping centres here. He added: "We don’t want other families to experience what we went through. I think this is the time to raise awareness and (make) some improvements in the safety aspects of public spaces, such as shopping centres.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Ms Mavis Seow, chief operating officer of the retail business group at Far East Organisation that owns Orchard Central, said in a statement on Saturday (Feb 25): "The glass railing along the link bridge is 1.2m high and acts as a safety barrier for members of the public. It also prohibits access to the plasterboard box-up, which is an interior architectural treatment.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"Together with our building consultants, we are currently reviewing if any other measures, in addition to the glass barrier, are required. In the interim, our security officers will be patrolling the various link bridges at more frequent intervals."</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Jonathan would be cremated on Thursday. His friends and family say they will miss his cheery personality and sense of humour.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“Chow just knows how to make people love him,” said his friend, Jamerson Chua, 18.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'> </p>
