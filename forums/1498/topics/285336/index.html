The incident took place at the former Asia Insurance Building on Friday while it was being demolished.<br><br>The loud bang and dust clouds took the lunchtime crowd by surprise, even though demolition works had been going on at the former Asia Insurance building for some months.<br><br>According to Civil Defence officers, a 5 by 5 metre concrete floor slab on the 17th storey of the building had given way at around 12.20pm, creating a domino effect as it crashed onto the lower floors.<br><br>SCDF said the falling debris slammed into an excavator on the ground floor, before finally coming to a halt at the basement.<br><br>One man said his coÂ—worker, a Chinese Singaporean in his 40s, was in the excavator then.<br><br>Civil Defence officers extricated the body of the worker at 10.10pm from the collapsed rubble, and have called off search operations.<br><br>The Building and Construction Authority and the Manpower Ministry are investigating the case and have revoked the demolition permit at the site.<br><br>Many questions remain unanswered at this point.<br><br>But what is certain is that there would have been more casualties had workers who were inside the building not gone out to lunch when the concrete slab gave way.
