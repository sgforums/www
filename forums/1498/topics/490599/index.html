              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCDF unveils new Red Rhino, packing more medical equipment to better respond to emergencies<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: An improved version of the Light Fire Attack Vehicle, better known as the Red Rhino, was unveiled by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Saturday (Nov 14).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fifth-generation Red Rhino packs more medical equipment, including an oxygen cylinder and blood pressure set, in addition to the automated external defibrillator already carried by the current vehicles. Cabin space has also been improved, with more leg room to allow the rapid and safe exit of firefighters from the vehicle.<br></p>
              <p>The additional equipment complements plans to deploy emergency medical technicians trained to respond to both fire and medical emergencies. The first batch of emergency medical technicians is currently undergoing an operational tour on patient care with SCDF's Emergency Medical Services.<br></p>
              <p>The SCDF also plans to develop a multi-purpose fire-medical hybrid vehicle that can respond to a range of emergencies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the launch of the new Red Rhino on Saturday, the SCDF pitted its skills against firefighting and rescue organisations around the world in the Singapore-Global Firefighters and Paramedics Challenge.<br></p>
              <p>Coming up tops in the Braveheart Challenge, the pinnacle event, was Singapore's defending champion Staff Sergeant Azmir Ali. With a completion time of five minutes and 35 seconds, he once again edged out Australian Josh Caddy who came in at five minutes 49 seconds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I felt relief because the competitors this year are a bit tough – they're very, very fast," said Sgt Azmir. "I'm so relieved, and very, very delighted to win this again for SCDF."<br></p>
              <p>Mr Caddy said his competitor deserved the win. “I gave it everything and obtained a near 30-second improvement, so you can't ask for more if you still come second after that. Azmir did a fantastic job."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Braveheart Challenge centres around an eight-metre high scaffolding structure, with each stage designed specifically to challenge the physical and mental capabilities of participants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SCDF also won the Rip-it-off challenge, a simulated road traffic accident rescue with contestants judged based on scene assessment, vehicle stabilisation, extrication techniques and medical intervention. The SCDF took first place with a score of 168, while Western Australia’s Department of Fire and Emergency Services came in second with a score of 141. <br></p>
              <p>This year's event saw 46 participants from 13 countries taking part.</p>
