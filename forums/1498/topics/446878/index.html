              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The number of non-emergency calls to Singapore Civil 
              Defence Force's (SCDF) Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) rose 40.5 per 
              cent - from 2,131 cases in 2010 to 2,995 cases in 2011. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The data was released in SCDF's annual Fire, Ambulance and Enforcement Statistics. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SCDF's EAS responded to 131,806 calls in 2011, an increase of 5 per cent from 125,603 calls in 2010.<br><br>Emergency
               calls made up 96 per cent of the total calls responded. The remaining 
              2.3 per cent were non-emergency calls and another 2.2 per cent were 
              false alarms. <br><br>SCDF says it will step up public education efforts
               on the use of its Emergency Ambulance Services through exhibitions, 
              distribution of posters and leaflets. <br><br>For medical cases that are
               non-life threatening, SCDF urges the public to call 1777 for the 
              non-emergency ambulance services run by Private Ambulance Operators 
              (PAOs).<br><br>This, SCDF says, will allow more emergency resources to be channelled towards life threatening cases. <br><br>SCDF
               says over the next two year, it will be working with the PAOs to 
              increase their fleet of ambulances as well as to increase their 
              operating hours based on the projected demands. <br><br>The increase 
              will be carried out gradually and in phases to ensure that the PAOs 
              continue to meet the service standards expected. Since June 2009, SCDF 
              has engaged the services of two PAOs to supplement its fleet of 
              operational ambulances. <br><br>SCDF says the overall number of calls 
              responded to within 11 minutes improved - from 80.9 per cent in 2008 to 
              84.7 per cent in 2011, with the introduction of private emergency 
              ambulances. <br><br>Other statistics released pertain to fire incidents and fire safety enforcement. <br><br>The
               number of fire incidents last year was 4,470 fires, a decrease of 3 per
               cent from 4,600 fires in 2010. This is the lowest number of fire 
              incidents recorded in more than a decade. <br><br>SCDF says there was a drop in number of fires across all types of premises. <br><br>But there are three areas of concern. <br><br>The
               number of unattended cooking fires accounted for 15 per cent of the 
              total number of residential fires. The number of fires for this category
               went up - from 474 in 2010 to 500 last year.<br><br>The number of gas 
              fires also went up 115 per cent - from 20 cases in 2010 to 43 cases in 
              2011. Such fires result from the accumulation of LPG gases which may 
              have leaked from a faulty LPG cylinder, regulator, hose or stove. <br><br>The
               number of fires involving household contents went up by 79 - from 259 
              cases for the same period last year. Fires involving furniture, 
              clothing, mattresses are usually caused by the indiscriminate disposal 
              of lighted materials such as cigarette butts or children playing with 
              lighted materials. <br><br>The SCDF adds that the number of injuries 
              arising from fires increased by 22 persons to 165 persons last year. 
              There were four fatalities due to fire incidents last year. There were 
              none in 2010.<br><br>As for fire safety enforcement, SCDF stepped up its
               enforcement checks last year but issued fewer Fire Hazard Abatement 
              Notices (FHAN) and Notices of Fire Safety Offence (NFSO). <br><br>A FHAN
               serves as a warning to building owners and management to remove the 
              hire hazard. 2,632 FHANs were issued in 2011, a drop of 12.8 per cent 
              compared to 2010.  <br><br>A NSFO is issued instead of a FHAN when the 
              contravention is of a serious nature and warrants a heavier penalty. 
              2,164 NSFOs were issued in 2011, a decrease of 0.9% compared to 2010. <br><br>SCDF says the most common fire hazard resulting in FHANs in 2011 was the obstruction to exits and fire engine accessways. <br><br>As
               for NSFOs, SCDF says  the main contributing offence was unauthorised 
              change of use, for example, of premises to workers' dormitories. <br><br>SCDF
               says it takes violations of fire safety requirements seriously and will
               not hesitate to take firm action against building management that do 
              not promptly take action to rectify fire safety violations despite 
              warnings and fines. <br><br>Court action will be taken for serious 
              cases. Last year, 49 charges were filed for court action against fire 
              safety offenders. 53 per cent of the cases were for unauthorised change 
              of use.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
