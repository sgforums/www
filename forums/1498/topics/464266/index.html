              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Would need your advice on this. I just POPed from SAF BMTC recently and posted to the SCDF Officer Course in two days time. Done my research, but cant find that much info. So I have some burning questions regarding the Basic Officer Course at CDA:</p>
              <p>1. Duration of the course.</p>
              <p>2. Any confinement at the start.</p>
              <p>3. Anything I need to bring for the my first reporting day at CDA.</p>
              <p>4. Any other good advice.</p>
              <p>I had been told to report in my SAF number 4 and not to bring any SAF items. Would appreciate it guys. Thanks.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Civil defence
              service</strong></span><br> <br> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) is the emergency rescue
              force of Singapore and they provide firefighting, rescue and
              ambulance services, and has been one of the three National Service
              postings since 1972. Those enlisted into the SCDF typically undergo
              seven weeks of training at the Basic Rescue Training Centre (BRTC),
              where they are given basic rescue training (BRT), exposed to
              regimental discipline, and trained to maintain a level of fitness
              required of all NSFs in Singapore.<br> <br> Much like the SAF's SISPEC course, selected NSFs are also posted to
              the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) to undergo the Firefighter Course
              (FFC) or the Emergency Response Specialist Course (ERSC) within the
              first two weeks of their BRT stage, passing out as Firefighters for
              FFC trainees, and as Fire &amp; Rescue Specialists for ERS trainees
              who would also simultaneously be conferred with the Sergeant rank
              (Firefighters mostly pass out as Privates prior to station
              posting). Firefighters would typically be posted out to the various
              fire stations island-wide after passing out, while Fire &amp;
              Rescue Specialists would be posted as Section Commanders at
              territorial division, fire stations or at the Special Rescue
              Battalion; based largely on rankings at the time of course
              completion, a small number may also be posted as Instructors back
              in the CDA to staff the Command and Staff Training Center (CSTC),
              Specialist Training Center (STC), or Firefighting Training Center
              (FFTC).<br> <br> While a certain level of health and fitness pre-requisites are
              expected by both the FFC and ERSC administrators before one can be
              selected for these courses, admission into the ERS course typically
              requires a certain set of additional qualifications, namely either
              a minimum of a GCE Advanced Level certificate, a Diploma or a
              Higher Nitec Certificate. These added pre-requisites are viewed as
              necessary in the light of a Section Commander's operational and
              administrative role when posted out. One marked difference between
              the FFC and ERSC is the added rescue and emergency training
              received by ERS Specialist Cadet Trainees (SCTs), as well as the
              General Command &amp; Control Term, which includes the Basic Home
              Team Course held at the Home Team Academy and an outward-bound
              Brunei trip which serves to equip and develop the necessary
              leadership skills required of a specialist junior officer. In terms
              of administration and duration, the FFC is under the charge of the
              FFTC and lasts three months, while the ERSC is under the purview of
              the CSTC and lasts six months.<br> <br> In addition, there is also the Basic Officer Course under the
              charge of the CSTW, designed to train NSFs and regulars as Senior
              Officers of the SCDF, with NSFs graduating as Lieutenants (LTA).
              While the BOC is traditionally largely made up of NSFs from the SAF
              who had just completed their Basic Military Training (BMT) at Pulau
              Tekong, the top 5-10% of the ERSC will also be offered to cross
              over to the Basic Officer Course (BOC) to be trained and
              commissioned as Senior Officers after passing out, spending the
              last three months of the BOC together with Officer Cadet Trainees
              (OCTs).<br> <br> NSFs who undergo the full 7-week basic rescue training at the BRTC
              are subsequently posted and trained to become medical orderlies
              (medics), dog handlers, provosts, information and communications
              and logistics specialists or instructors (such as Physical Training
              Instructors) among many other vocations upon passing out from the
              BRTC.[18]</p>
