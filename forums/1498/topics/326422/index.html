              Police Coastguard are searching for a man in the sea off East Coast
              Park.
              <br> <br>They received a call from a member of the public around 10:30pm on
              Monday reporting that a couple were seen struggling in the water near
              Carpark C.
              <br> <br> The woman was pulled out by passers-by and sent to the Singapore General Hospital.
              <br> <br> Witnesses told Channel NewsAsia that the couple were foreigners believed to be studying at a local polytechnic.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The body of the man who went missing in the sea off
              East Coast Park has been found this morning near the shore, not far
              from the MacDonald's fast food restaurant. </span></p>
              <p><span> This came shortly after authorities called off the search at about 6.10am on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> Navy divers had been searching for the man since Monday night after the
              police and civil defence received a call from a member of the public
              around 10:30pm, saying a man and a woman were seen struggling in the
              water near Carpark C. <br> <br> The woman was pulled out by passers-by and sent to the Singapore General Hospital. 
              <br> <br> Aghilesh B Nair, an eyewitness, said: "I saw the guy dragging the girl
              towards the sea. She was opposing and screaming something in Chinese. I
              don't know Chinese, so I didn't get what she was saying. <br> <br> "About two minutes later, there was no response from the girl. A few
              Chinese guys and me went looking for the girl and we saw the girl
              floating. We pulled her out. She was almost unconscious. We gave her
              first aid, and she was able to breathe."
              <br> <br> It is believed that the couple were foreigners studying at a local polytechnic.     - CNA/vm</span></p>
