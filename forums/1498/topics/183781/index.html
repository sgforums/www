You are correct, it is common for cadets to fall prey to the heat and puke or faint because they are not used to it at the beginning.<br><br>when you pass out from BOC (Basic Officer's Course), you will be sent to the frontline ( a fire station ) for about 1-2 years before you are posted elsewhere.<br><br>Haha, I think you asked the right person, I was a Hazmat officer also ;p.

It is not easy as you have to lead an additional 14-15 men (Hazmat ) as compared to normal fire stations. In terms of logistics, manpower, training, there are much more things to do. However you get $200 more allowance as compared to your fellow colleagues in normal fire stations.<br><br>I hope it helps. BOC is tough but very fun.

Like, 1 year as normal rc, then another as a rc at a hazmat stn? Does that also mean leading the hazmat team wld be your secondary appointment? Does a hazmat officer still have the usual rota shifts, i.e. 24hr duty, then 2 days off, then duty agn?<br><br>And this wld also mean that I should know pretty early whether im in hazmat or not isit. Coz I thought I had to wait till the end of the 2year rc tour before knowing if Im assigned the staff appointmt, or specialization or command. Oh ya, Im majoring in biomedical sciences, hopefully tt helps haha.<br><br>About the staff tour after 2 years at the frontline, Hazmat officers are usu posted to hazmat in HQ under operations department? or is there chances tt they'll be posted to other departments like public affairs or elsewhere?<br>After a few years at the hq, is there a chance to be posted back to the frontline? er, quite concerned about this coz it seems that ladies are usually not posted back to fire stations and are more or less confined in the hq for a long long time.. humph</div>
