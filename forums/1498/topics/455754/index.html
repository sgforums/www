              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The fire at East Village Hotel at Marine Parade Road was put out on Monday after five hours.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Eleven people -- four children, five adults and two fire-fighters -- were injured as a result of the fire.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Singapore Civil 
              Defence Force (SCDF) said one of the fire-fighters suffered heat 
              exhaustion, while the other sustained burns to his hands after he 
              tripped and fell. <br><br>Channel NewsAsia understands the four children
               and two of the adults who sustained injuries are from the same family 
              who came to Singapore from Pakistan for a holiday. <br><br>The mother, who suffers from asthma, is being treated for smoke inhalation.<br><br>SCDF received a call about the incident at 9.06am. <br><br>Lieutenant-Colonel
               Abdul Razak, SCDF's public affairs director, said the fire was one of 
              the more challenging fires SCDF has faced in recent years. <br><br>Its 
              fire-fighters used foam to tackle the blaze, which started in the 
              basement of the retail annexe. Foam is usually used in more challenging 
              situations. <br><br>SCDF said about 80 officers were deployed to battle 
              the fire. It also deployed six to eight Disaster Assistance and Rescue 
              Team (DART) officers to break through a wall.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia understands that the blaze could have started in a restaurant under renovation. <br><br>Viewers,
               who called the Channel NewsAsia hotline in the morning, said the hotel,
               which was located at 25 Marine Parade Road, was engulfed in thick, 
              black smoke. <br><br>One motorist, Mr Tan, said visibility along East Coast Road was also affected by the smoke. <br><br>Far
               East Organization, which manages the East Village Hotel, said in a 
              statement that the fire occurred in a separate retail annexe at about 
              8.30am.<br><br>All guests and staff have been accounted for and safely 
              evacuated, said Mr Raphael Saw, the CEO of Far East Organization's 
              Hospitality Business Group. <br><br>The few guests and workers who were 
              affected by smoke inhalation were receiving medical attention, while 
              alternative arrangements were being arranged for affected guests at 
              Changi Village Hotel, added Mr Saw. <br><br>Cherie Hearts @ Eastgate, a 
              kindergarten and infant care centre at 46 East Coast Road, had asked 
              parents to pick up their children from the centre as the air quality in 
              the area was affected. <br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>
