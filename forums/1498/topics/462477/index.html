              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SCDF to Step-up on Enforcement Checks</strong></p>
              <p class="data-content">With the year end fast 
              approaching, the SCDF would like to extend its season’s greetings to 
              everyone and would also like to remind everyone to exercise caution to 
              minimise fire hazards and prevent the outbreaks of fire during the 
              joyous occasion.</p>
              <p class="data-content">Some useful fire safety tips are listed in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Annex A</span></strong></p>
              <p class="data-content">As the number of patrons and customers are usually higher during the 
              festive season, we would also like to remind owners and management of 
              public buildings and places of recreation/entertainment including hotels
               and shopping centres to ensure compliance to all fire safety 
              requirements.</p>
              <p class="data-content">Escape passageways should be free of obstruction and fire exit doors 
              should be kept accessible for use during emergencies.  Overcrowding in 
              building premises especially public entertainment outlets, such as 
              discotheques and pubs, should be avoided as it would impede the safe 
              evacuation of people from the premises in the event of fire. </p>
              <p class="data-content">SCDF will be stepping up inspections and conducting an enforcement blitz
               at commercial buildings to check on fire safety violations.  SCDF takes
               a serious view against offenders flouting fire safety requirements.  
              Under the Fire Safety Act, violators may be fined up to $10,000 or be 
              sentenced to a jail term not exceeding 6 months, or both.  Anyone who 
              notices fire hazards should report them to SCDF at 1800-280-0000.</p>
              <p class="data-content">Fire safety is a collective community responsibility and together we can help to reduce fire occurrences in Singapore.</p>

              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GENERAL FIRE SAFETY TIPS DURING THE FESTIVE SEASON<br> FIRE SAFETY TIPS – HOMES Cooking </strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong> </strong>1. Never leave cooking unattended as it can result in fires. Turn 
              off the gas supply and cooking appliances whenever they are not in use.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">2. Petrol or kerosene should not be used to start a BBQ fire – they can flare up unexpectedly. Use fire-starters instead.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">3. Keep a bucket of water or a garden hose nearby in case of emergencies. Never leave the barbeque unattended.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">4. Charcoal should be doused with water when cooking is done. 
              Smouldering charcoal and embers should not be thrown into rubbish 
              chutes/bins which may lead to rubbish fires.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Electrical Appliances</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">1. Never overload electrical outlets with electrical appliances. Always unplug the appliances when they are not in use.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">2. Do not run wires under carpets or mats and keep them away from hot surfaces.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">3. Check the condition of wires regularly. Frayed wires or cracked cords
               should be replaced or repaired by licensed electricians.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Housekeeping</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong>1. Keep cooking appliances including the stove-top, cooker hoods
               and ovens clean and free of grease.  Never store combustibles near heat
               sources.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">2. After parties or gatherings, check for smouldering cigarette butts around and under the sofa, chair cushions and carpets.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">3. Ensure that cigarettes and cigars are fully put out in the ashtrays before they are discarded.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">4. Ensure that all unwanted furniture and items which are combustible in
               nature are discarded properly.  Do not discard them at the common 
              areas, such as lift lobby or staircase lobby, of your residential 
              flats.  Contact your local Town Council or Management Office if you 
              require assistance for the disposal of unwanted bulky items.  If you 
              notice discarded item/s at the common areas, please alert your local 
              Town Councils or Management Office.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decorations and Lightings</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong>1. Check the decorative lighting fixtures before use and 
              regularly thereafter. If there are wear and tear problems, such as blown
               bulbs and frayed wires, replace them with new ones immediately, using 
              the service of licensed electricians for repairs if necessary.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">2. Do not leave decorative lighting fixtures, including the lit 
              Christmas tree, switched-on when leaving home or when going to bed. 
              Indoor lighting fixtures should not be used in outdoor area to avoid 
              electric shocks and short circuits.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">3. Use decorative lighting fixtures which carry the SAFETY Mark. Similar
               to electrical appliances and accessories such as fans and adaptors, 
              decorative lighting fixture is also a Controlled Goods under the 
              Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme, which is 
              administered by SPRING Singapore.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">4.     Decorations made of light tissue paper or cardboard burn easily. 
              Do not attach them to lights or other heat source, and always keep them 
              away from candles.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">5. Lit candles should be placed in stable holders on heat-resistant 
              surface, so that they will not fall over. Lit candles should also be 
              kept away from Christmas trees, paper or cardboard decorations, foliage,
               curtains and furnishings. It is also not advisable to leave candles 
              burning in a room unattended.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preventing Children from Starting Fires</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong>1. Keep matches, lighters and candles out of children’s reach.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">2. Educate children on the dangers of fires.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">3. Children playing with sparklers must be supervised by parents/adults.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Handling Sparklers</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">1. Sparklers should be kept in a closed box and away from flames.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">2. When being used, it should be lit at arm’s length and only one at a time.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">3. Lighted sparklers should never be thrown at combustible materials.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">4. When a sparkler goes out, do not immediately touch the hot end for it
               could still burn. Ideally, put the hot end in a bucket of water to 
              fully cool it down before disposing it safely.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">5. Follow the safety instructions as stated by the manufacturer. These 
              instructions are typically found on the box housing the sparklers.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE SAFETY TIPS – COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong>1. Escape passageways should be free of obstruction and fire 
              exit doors should be kept unlocked at all times for use during 
              emergencies.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">2. It is also important to observe other fire safety requirements, 
              including the approved occupancy load for premises (to avoid 
              overcrowding), so as to enhance fire safety standards in buildings.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">3.  If you are in any public premises, ensure that you look out for the 
              nearest exit door or staircase.  Such knowledge will greatly facilitate 
              you when you need to evacuate during an emergency.</p>
