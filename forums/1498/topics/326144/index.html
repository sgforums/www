              <h1 class="clr">Police, Civil Defence forces on standby during NDP</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Some 200,000 people are expected to gather at the Marina Bay
              area as Singapore celebrates its 43rd birthday on August 9.</p>
              <p>With a crowd that big, Singapore’s security agencies are not leaving
              anything to chance. Police and Civil Defence officers said they are on
              full standby in case of any attacks on the parade grounds or elsewhere
              in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Some 150 police officers and 25 vehicles from the
              Singapore Police Force (SPF), including the Special Operations Command,
              will be deployed on National Day to maintain law and order.</p>
              <p>And depending on the nature of the incident, they may order a mass evacuation.</p>
              <p>Deputy
              Assistant Commissioner Anthony Ng, SPF, said: "There will be a vigorous
              assessment made by the SPF’s Director of Operations to do an evacuation.</p>
              <p>"Then
              a message will be displayed at the parade area, together with a voice
              message to urge the public to stay calm, and at the same time, to
              evacuate orderly, following the instructions of the ushers as well as
              the officers at the scene to a safe location.</p>
              <p>"At the same time,
              we will activate the contingency forces to do the rescue work and
              implement necessary measures to restore normalcy."</p>
              <p>The main
              parade venue is not the only place where there will be a major security
              presence. Forces are also deployed in other areas where the public is
              expected to soak in the festivities.</p>
              <p>These areas include the
              Merlion Park, the Esplanade Park, the Padang and major transportation
              nodes like the Raffles Place and City Hall MRT stations.</p>
              <p>About
              500 officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and its
              supporting agencies, as well as some 80 emergency vehicles, will also
              be on standby.</p>
              <p>Major Gobiselvan Govindasamy, senior staff
              officer, SCDF, said: "We are strategically located at the vicinity of
              the parade area and we can respond within a moment’s notice.</p>
              <p>"Over
              and above this, we have been working with the police and SAF (Singapore
              Armed Forces) organisers, planning for any contingency, looking at
              areas where we can gel our responses and synergise our efforts."</p>
              <p>Where
              needed, paramedics and doctors will also be called in. In case of a
              chemical attack, a bus can transform into a personnel decontamination
              vehicle that can also serve as a mass casualty ambulance.</p>
              <p>The decontamination vehicle is equipped to handle about 60 casualties an hour. — CNA/so</p>
