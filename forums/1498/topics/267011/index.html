            <div class='col-md body'>So, on the 10th of April 2006, there I stood at the parade square. Looking at the new place that surrounds me, I knew this is it. This is my NS life. I wondered what I will be doing for the next two years. Nothing is ever predictable.<br><br>So, the first four days was spent at Basic Rescue Training Centre(BRTC). Just some orientation and stuffs before I was despatched over to Civil Defence Academy(CDA) for my Emergency Response Specialist(ERS) course, skipping the basic 7 weeks of BRTC training altogether. Had freaking tough trainings for 3 weeks before I got out-of-course(OOC). Then, slackened off for 3 more weeks as I waited for the rest of my batch to finish their 7 weeks of BRTC training. It's a whole load of differences between the 2 three weeks though.<br><br>After that long 7 weeks, I was posted for a new vocation training and that is Medical Orderly Course(MOC). Basically, my job is to help the paramedic in the ambulance. Little did I know that after those MOC days, what I learnt will be useless. So, after 6 short weeks of fun, training in the MOC, I learnt lotsa skills. CPR, assessment of patient and many many more.<br><br>I thought I will be better prepared to face any kind of casualties, be it asthmatic or brain spilling ones(literally). But there's still one more shock in the box left for me. Lo and behold... I wasn't posted to any firestation nor will I be an MOC instructor. I was chosen to be a hospital Medic!!!!<br><br>Yeah... You heard it right. Hospital Medic. What do I do? Oh... I just need to liaise the ambulance's patient with the hospital. Supposedly to shave a few minutes of that ambulance's waiting time so that they can immediately go off for another call. So that's about it. Ohh.. And one more thing, while my other friends are in the Army, seeing greens all over the jungle, I'm equally paid to do this simple task as well as check out the hot nurses in the hospital. Yeah.. I know it's a tough vocation. Need to control my mating instinct while on the job. I'm just serving my 2 years of NS. Need to get it done and over with.<br><br>What's next for me? 3 months I'm done with. Still got 1 year and 7 more months to go. A painful countdown to freedom.<br></div>
