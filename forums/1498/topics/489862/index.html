              <p><em>Koh Yufeng</em></p>
              <p><em>The New Paper</em></p>
              <p><em>Thursday, Aug 29, 2015</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First, vulgarities were hurled at him. Then, he got punched in the face.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was what Corporal Arun Raj Manivannan endured just six months into his national service as a medical orderly with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). And all he did was answer a call for help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel were abused in the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the SCDF warns anyone who lays a finger on these lifesavers will be dealt with severely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On Feb 13, Cpl Arun Raj, 20, and Staff Sergeant Yao Hong Bin, 27, found a man near the basement toilet of Jurong Point Shopping Centre, who was complaining of discomfort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 57-year-old man was verbally abusive, hurling vulgarities at a security guard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although he was cooperative and agreed to be put on a stretcher, the man turned on the paramedics as they placed him onto the gurney and took him to the ambulance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He continued his tirade as the ambulance drove away from the mall towards the National University Hospital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As Cpl Arun Raj tried to take the man's blood pressure, the man jerked back his right arm and punched him square on his right cheek.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SSG Yao immediately told the ambulance driver to stop before calling the police.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cpl Arun Raj was given three days' medical leave and his attacker was sentenced to 10 months' jail on June 29.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cpl Arun Raj said he was no stranger to verbal abuse and credited this to his past working experience as an inline skating instructor and a lifeguard. But the punch took him by surprise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "I was shocked and, of course, I was angry. But as a public servant, we have our own rules. So I just kept calm and patient."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cpl Arun Raj and SSG Yao are not the only EMS personnel who have been abused by patients and patients' relatives and friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Increase</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement released on Tuesday on its midyear statistics, the SCDF said there were 10 such cases between January and June this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is four more than the six reported cases over the same period last year and includes verbal abuse, physical abuse or both.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such assailants pay a heavy price as anyone who verbally abuses a public servant on duty can be jailed up to a year or fined up to $5,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who voluntarily cause hurt to a public servant on duty can be jailed up to seven years, fined, caned, or a combination of the three.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two other offenders received stern warnings while the remaining cases are still pending.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SCDF said in the statement that it does not condone any forms of physical or verbal abuse against its personnel and will report any abuse to the police.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chief Medical Officer Ng Yih Yng said that SCDF's EMS provides critical emergency care to patients in need of medical attention.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "Threatening or abusing the EMS personnel would not only delay medical treatment but also put the patient at risk, especially in the event of a medical emergency."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cpl Arun Raj, who went back to work after his medical leave, is not giving up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "Singaporeans look up to us. When they need medical assistance, they call the SCDF. Nothing has changed. I still feel like I need to be there for the people who are looking for us to help them."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SCDF's mid-year report also highlighted an increase in the number of non-emergency calls made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although they made up only 4.2 per cent of all calls SCDF has responded to, the number of such calls more than doubled over the same period:from 1,465 between January to June last year to 3,453 this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These calls place an unnecessary strain on resources and deprive those who are in genuine need of emergency medical assistance, said the SCDF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While there is no fee imposed for emergency cases, $274 will be charged for each non-emergency patient taken to hospital by the SCDF.</p>
