              <p><br>In the early morning yesterday (Mar 21), a man wielding a
               keris, or dagger, sat on a chair in front of the grille gate of his 
              Clementi flat and refused to let his wife send their children to school.
               The family and tenants living in the flat were eventually <a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/583922/man_allegedly_threatens_7_with_parang_scdf_rescues.html">evacuated by the SCDF through the bedroom windows</a>.</p>

              <div>
              <p><br>She
               tried to persuade him to out down the dagger, to no avail. As he 
              pointed the weapon at them, he shouted: "No going out! Cannot go out!"<br><br>The drama was <a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/583922/man_allegedly_threatens_7_with_parang_scdf_rescues.html">first reported in STOMP last night</a>.<br><br>According
               to The New Paper report today (Mar 22), the wife, 40, told reporters 
              that her 45-year-old jobless husband had been speaking incoherently 
              since the night before, and that he was stressed out because he had to 
              go to court to face a charge the next day. Her husband has been in and 
              out of jail for drug offences and petty crime. <br><br>The frightened 
              woman then called her mother, and before long, about 20 police officers 
              arrived at the fourth-storey flat at about 7.45am. <br><br>When he saw the police officers, the man got more aggressive.<br><br>Through a phonecall, the police instructed her to take her kids into another bedroom and lock themselves in there. <br><br>SCDF
               officers helped the wife, her three children and three tenants (two 
              Bangladeshis and an Iranian student) escape on ladders placed at the 
              front and rear bedrooms.<br><br>Five hours into the standoff, police 
              eventually decided to cut the metal front gate of the unit to arrest the
               man, after he refused to give up.<br><br>The wife told The New Paper 
              that her husband of 16 years, who used to be a loving husband and doting
               father, had changed for the worse after he quit his job at the Turf 
              Club.<br><br>The wife has since become the sole breadwinner of the family.<br><br>Source:<a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/584030/keriswielding_man_refuses_to_let_wife_and_kids_leave_flat.html"><br>http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/584030/keriswielding_man_refuses_to_let_wife_and_kids_leave_flat.html</a></p>
