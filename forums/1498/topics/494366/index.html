              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fire breaks out in residential unit at Tiong Poh Road, 2 sent to hospital</span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A fire broke out at around 1.05pm at a residential building unit at Block 82, Tiong Poh road in Tiong Bahru estate on Sunday (Jul 30), the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said, adding that the fire was put out.</p>
              <p>Two occupants of the unit were taken to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) after one, in his fifties suffered burn injuries, while another in his thirties suffered from smoke inhalation. The hospital updated at 4pm that one had been discharged, while the other will be placed in the intensive care unit. </p>
              <p>The two had self-evacuated before the SCDF personnel arrived, SCDF said, and added the fire involved the contents of the living room of the unit on the fourth floor. </p>
              <p>It said the fire was put out with one water jet. Two fire engines, one red rhino, two fire bikes, an ambulance and a support vehicle were sent to the scene, it said.</p>
              <p>SCDF said it conducted forced entry into the unit. It added that the cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
              <p>Video footage and images sent to Channel NewsAsia from the scene showed Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) personnel responding to the incident and crowds gathered along the road.</p>
              <p>Smoke was seen rising from the building as SCDF personnel were attempting to put out the fire.</p>
              <p>Melissa Ho who lives in the area told Channel NewsAsia that she was heading to the Tiong Bahru market when she senses a "very strong smell of burning rubber".</p>
              <p>Kalaradhakrishnan, who also lives in the area said "people were shouting that there was a fire at Block 82".</p>
              <p>"So I came down, rushed down and I saw very thick black smoke. One fire engine couldn't contain it," she said, adding that some of the Seng Poh RC members helped police with the traffic.</p>
