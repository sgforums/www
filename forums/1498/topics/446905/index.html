              <p>think theres something odd.well since he went for police which is classed as home affairs...and as civil defence is also under ministry of home affairs section.i think he is under home affairs ministry after the interview thing other than the ministry of defence which would complicate the admin if i try to put it in logically.</p>

              <p><br>well he had interview with police under home affairs department .but processing might take months b4 they ask him to sign contract as a full time police career.think they check background from dad etc etc.</p>
              <p>so i guess while processing, they put him in civil defence which is part of home affairs department .so when all checks are done in him they can contact him faster within the ministry other than if he were to get posted to the army where it might get problems due to different ministries and admin.</p>
