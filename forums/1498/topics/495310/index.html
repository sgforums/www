              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>15 people, including infant, taken to hospital after yacht catches fire at Sentosa Cove</strong></span></p>
              <p><br>SINGAPORE: Fifteen people were taken to hospital after a yacht caught fire at the One degree 15 Marina in Sentosa Cove on Thursday (Mar 22). <br><br>Three, including an infant, were taken to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for burn injuries. The other 12 were taken to SGH and National University Hospital for smoke inhalation. <br><br>Channel NewsAsia understands that some people were onboard the yacht when it caught fire. <br><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that it was alerted to the fire at 4.30pm. The yacht was berthed at a fuel dock at the marina. <br><br>Members of the in-house emergency response team tackled the burning yacht using three hosereels, said SCDF. Two waterjets were used to extinguish the fire after they arrived.<br><br>It is understood that some members of the in-house emergency response team were part of the 12 taken to hospital for smoke inhalation. <br><br>William Ng, a 32-year-old chef from nearby restaurant Quayside Isle, told Channel NewsAsia he was starting work when someone in the restaurant shouted about the fire at about 4pm. <br><br>"I turned around and saw quite a huge smoke and a fire ... it all happened for like 15 to 20 minutes," said Mr Ng, who also took a video and posted it on Facebook.<br><br>In his video, thick black smoke can be seen billowing into the sky from the marina. Mr Ng added that SCDF officers arrived on scene within five to 10 minutes. <br><br>Another video of the incident that was circulated on Telegram showed a boat on fire. A person can be seen running away from the boat in the background. <br><br>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
