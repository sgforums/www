              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Coming soon - Private Ambulance Operators in SCDF EAS fleet </span></strong></p>
              <p>Come June this year, up to two private operators are expected to be
              incorporated into the Emergency Ambulance Service or EAS fleet, headed
              by the Singapore Civil Defence Force.</p>
              <p>This move aims to alleviate the stress faced by current emergency
              ambulances due to the increasing number of such emergency calls SCDF
              received in recent years.</p>
              <p>SCDF says, it handled nearly 120,000 EAS calls last year - some 8,000 more than the total number received in 2007.</p>
              <p>SCDF is expecting nearly ten more ambulances with this move.</p>
              <p>Each will manned by three personnel - all trained to deal with emergencies.</p>
              <p>It adds that it currently has 40 ambulances in its fleet.</p>
              <p>Colonel Tan Eng Hoe, is SCDF's Chief Medical Officer.</p>
              <p>He says the force called for tenders in December last year and six
              Private Ambulance Operators or PAOs have expressed their interest in
              joining the EAS fleet.</p>
              <p>SCDF is currently in the midst of selecting the most suitable candidates says Colonel Tan.</p>
              <p>"They are just helping us to supplement our fleet. The contract is
              for three plus two, five. That means, three years plus two years
              optional. It is important to tell the public that the level of service
              is still the same. They are trained just like our paramedics. They'll
              be based at our fire stations. They are to augment our fleet. They
              operate as part of the SCDF EAS."</p>
              <p>SCDF will announce the selected operators next month.</p>
              <p>It also adds despite the recent rise in the number of emergency
              calls, an increasing number of Singaporeans have stopped calling EAS
              for non-life threatening cases.</p>
              <p>EAS received more than 2000 non-emergency calls last year.</p>
              <p>This is about half the total number of such calls received in 2007.</p>
              <p>Colonel Anwar Abdullah who's SCDF's Director of Operations attributes this drop to its public education initiatives.</p>
              <p>"Public education in terms of telling the members of the public to
              call 1777 for non-emergency cases. And we have decals among other
              things which are displayed on vehicles to call the number in
              non-emergency situations."</p>
              <p>This drop benefits the community as more resources could then be
              channelled towards genuine life-threatening cases, says Colonel Anwar.</p>

              <div class="top_headline"><strong> More emergency vehicles</strong></div>
              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>Private operators to add 10 emergency vehicles to support SCDF fleet of 40.</p>
              <p>TEN more emergency ambulances, manned by paramedics from private companies, are expected to hit Singapore roads from June.</p>
              <p>The added resources will help support the Singapore Civil Defence
              Force's (SCDF) fleet of 40 vehicles, as emergency calls continue to
              climb due to an ageing and growing population.</p>
              <p>The SCDF's plan to open up some of its emergency ambulance services to
              the private sector is a move away from the current practice where these
              companies only handle non-emergency cases.</p>
              <p>Using them for emergency ambulance cases also means that private
              operators can be counted on to help out in a mass casualty situation,
              the SCDF said.</p>
              <p>When the topic was raised two years ago, Commissioner James
              Tan said costs and manpower were the reasons why the SCDF could not
              'just keep buying' more ambulances.</p>
              <p>Chief medical officer Tan Eng Hoe said yesterday that six
              operators responded to the tender which was called last month and by
              next month, details of who had made the cut would be announced. 'We
              will choose either one or two operators, depending on what they offer,'
              Dr Tan said.</p>
              <p>The SCDF has also clarified that there will be no differences
              in the look, competency of the crew or the equipment available,
              regardless of which ambulance responds.</p>
              <p>'Safeguards and stringent measures will be put in place to
              ensure that the ambulance service delivery standard will not be
              compromised,' the SCDF said yesterday at a briefing on its fire and
              ambulance statistics.</p>
              <p>Just like their SCDF counterparts, the performance of private
              ambulance crew members will be assessed every four months. They will
              also have to take half-yearly proficiency tests.</p>
              <p>The winning operator's first step will be to have its crew follow SCDF's paramedics for on-the-job training.</p>
              <p>The private ambulances will also be placed at fire stations
              under the command of the SCDF. Details about how the operators will be
              paid will be announced at a later date, the SCDF said.</p>
              <p>Hope Ambulance Services, one of the private operators in the
              running for the tender told The Straits Times that opening up emergency
              services is a welcome change. 'Whether we get the tender or not, we're
              happy that Singapore is taking this step towards making more emergency
              ambulance services available to the public,' said its operations
              director, Ms Theresa Yeap, 39.</p>
              <p>The SCDF said using private ambulance operators would also help alleviate the stress its current fleet faces.</p>
              <p>Last year, there were 111,127 emergency calls made to the SCDF,
              9 per cent more than in 2007. Of these, more than 70 per cent of them
              were for medical emergency cases such as those involving chest pains or
              heart attacks.</p>
              <p>Non-emergency calls saw what the SCDF called a 'healthy drop'
              of 42 per cent to 2,481 calls last year. The dip was attributed to
              greater public awareness.</p>
              <p>The 1777 non-emergency hotline saw a corresponding rise of more than 250 calls to 5,732 calls last year.</p>
              <p>'A further drop in such cases would benefit the community since
              more resources can then be channelled towards the emergency
              life-threatening cases,' the SCDF said.</p>

              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="top_headline">That ambulance you see in a rush on the road might not actually have an emergency case to attend to.</div>

              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>It could be responding to a false-alarm call instead.</p>
              <p>Last year, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said 4,288 trips - or about 12 a day - were triggered by such calls.</p>
              <p>This number was up by 16 per cent from 2007's 3,687 figure.</p>
              <p>In 2006, the number was 2,865.</p>
              <p>False alarms include non-emergency cases and prank calls.</p>
              <p>'The calls are largely from well-meaning adults who summon
              ambulances out of good intent and not as pranks when they see people in
              medical distress,' said Lieutenant-Colonel N. Subhas, director of
              public affairs department at the SCDF.</p>
              <p>However, these cases often turn out to be minor. There are
              also instances where the people involved tell the paramedics that they
              do not want to go to the hospital or have already left the scene.</p>
              <p>But for those who insist they be taken to a hospital, even if their condition is deemed minor, they have to pay $165.</p>
              <p>The rising number of false-alarm calls was among the statistics released by the SCDF on Thursday.</p>
              <p>There were 111,127 emergency calls made last year, up 9 per cent from 2007.</p>
              <p>The higher demand for ambulances, due to an ageing and growing
              population, has led the SCDF to rope in one private operator whose 10
              ambulances will join SCDF's fleet of 40 from June.</p>
              <p>Given the demand, it is naturally imperative that ambulances are not diverted to handle prank calls.</p>
              <p>Those caught making these calls face a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to three months, or both.</p>
              <p>Private ambulance operators said they also get one or two prank calls each a month.</p>
              <p>'We try to make sure they give us a number and we will call
              them back while the ambulance is being activated,' said Ms Josephine
              Ham, 39, operations manager of Hope Ambulance Services, which runs a
              fleet of 10 vehicles.</p>
              <p>Still, prank callers can get away scot-free as service
              providers like M1 and SingTel are unable to reveal a caller's identity
              for confidentiality reasons, unless it involves a serious crime case,
              she added.</p>
              <p>At Civic Ambulance Services, which has 30 ambulances,
              operations director Pritpal Singh, 45, said: 'We have a team of
              operators at our 24-hour call centre to handle and screen every call.'</p>
              <p>Over at the SCDF, although false alarms make up only 3 per
              cent of calls, Lt-Col Subhas said: 'Attending to prank calls is a waste
              of resources that could be dispatched to genuine cases instead.'</p>
              <p>Ms Indranee Rajah, an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC, warned prank callers that they are 'tying up a resource'.</p>
              <p>'Unlike many other agencies, the SCDF has to deal with life and
              death situations. When you interfere with that role, it is no longer
              funny. Someone can die as a result,' she said.</p>
              <p>She advises those unsure of their conditions to check with the operator before asking for an emergency ambulance.</p>
              <p>'The operators can explain to them the difference between an
              emergency and civil ambulance and advise them on the options
              available,' she said.</p>

              <div><strong>More emergency vehicles</strong></div>
              <div>
              <p>Private operators to add 10 emergency vehicles to support SCDF fleet of 40.</p>
              <p>TEN more emergency ambulances, manned by paramedics from private companies, are expected to hit Singapore roads from June.</p>
              <p>The added resources will help support the Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF) fleet of 40 vehicles, as emergency calls continue to climb due to an ageing and growing population.</p>
              <p>The SCDF's plan to open up some of its emergency ambulance services to the private sector is a move away from the current practice where these companies only handle non-emergency cases.</p>
              <p>Using them for emergency ambulance cases also means that private operators can be counted on to help out in a mass casualty situation, the SCDF said.</p>
              <p>When the topic was raised two years ago, Commissioner James Tan said costs and manpower were the reasons why the SCDF could not 'just keep buying' more ambulances.</p>
              <p>Chief medical officer Tan Eng Hoe said yesterday that six operators responded to the tender which was called last month and by next month, details of who had made the cut would be announced. 'We will choose either one or two operators, depending on what they offer,' Dr Tan said.</p>
              <p>The SCDF has also clarified that there will be no differences in the look, competency of the crew or the equipment available, regardless of which ambulance responds.</p>
              <p>'Safeguards and stringent measures will be put in place to ensure that the ambulance service delivery standard will not be compromised,' the SCDF said yesterday at a briefing on its fire and ambulance statistics.</p>
              <p>Just like their SCDF counterparts, the performance of private ambulance crew members will be assessed every four months. They will also have to take half-yearly proficiency tests.</p>
              <p>The winning operator's first step will be to have its crew follow SCDF's paramedics for on-the-job training.</p>
              <p>The private ambulances will also be placed at fire stations under the command of the SCDF. Details about how the operators will be paid will be announced at a later date, the SCDF said.</p>
              <p>Hope Ambulance Services, one of the private operators in the running for the tender told The Straits Times that opening up emergency services is a welcome change. 'Whether we get the tender or not, we're happy that Singapore is taking this step towards making more emergency ambulance services available to the public,' said its operations director, Ms Theresa Yeap, 39.</p>
              <p>The SCDF said using private ambulance operators would also help alleviate the stress its current fleet faces.</p>
              <p>Last year, there were 111,127 emergency calls made to the SCDF, 9 per cent more than in 2007. Of these, more than 70 per cent of them were for medical emergency cases such as those involving chest pains or heart attacks.</p>
              <p>Non-emergency calls saw what the SCDF called a 'healthy drop' of 42 per cent to 2,481 calls last year. The dip was attributed to greater public awareness.</p>
              <p>The 1777 non-emergency hotline saw a corresponding rise of more than 250 calls to 5,732 calls last year.</p>
              <p>'A further drop in such cases would benefit the community since more resources can then be channelled towards the emergency life-threatening cases,' the SCDF said.</p>

              <p>I am now wondering which private ambulance will get the deal to help 995 calls...my bet is either:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope Ambulance wz fleet of 10Ambulances</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Civic Ambulance wz fleet of 30Ambulances</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But like i said before, responding 995 calls wz Nissan or Toyota vans converted to Emergency Ambulances can be hard to work inside for amb crew esp for standby case: CPR, RTA case...But maybe SCDF will loan the old Ambulances to the private ambulance company who got the contract...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
