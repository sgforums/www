              <p>WE THANK Ms Esther Lu for her letter last Tuesday ('Ambulance call: Every second counts in an emergency').</p>
              <p>She mentioned that precious seconds had been wasted when her initial 
              call to the Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF) operations centre on 
              Nov 29 for an ambulance was routed to a voice recording. She also 
              claimed that had her initial call been answered immediately by the 
              operator, an ambulance would have been dispatched sooner.</p>
              <p>According to our records, SCDF operations centre received an 
              emergency ambulance call at about 1.22pm that day. The caller said a man
               in his 40s walking along Marine Parade Road required immediate medical 
              attention. An ambulance was immediately dispatched and it arrived at the
               scene within 11 minutes of the call.</p>
              <p>Between 1.20pm and 1.25pm, our operations centre experienced
               an unusually high volume of emergency calls. As a result, all our 
              operators were engaged during this period. Calls that could not be 
              attended to by an operator were automatically diverted to a voice 
              recording as per established procedures. As soon as an operator became 
              available, the calls would immediately be answered according to their 
              position in the queue. On average, the waiting time in such an uncommon 
              situation is 10 seconds before an operator answers.</p>
              <p>In Ms Lu's case, our telephone records indicate that there 
              was one telephone call that had been diverted to the voice recording 
              between 1.20pm and 1.25pm. However, the caller hung up less than 10 
              seconds after the call was diverted.</p>
              <p>We appreciate Ms Lu's feedback and would like to assure her 
              and the public that we take all calls to our 995 emergency hotline 
              seriously. This is why we strive to answer them within 10 seconds as 
              time is of the essence during an emergency. However, there may be 
              instances when, due to a surge in the volume of emergency calls, an 
              operator may not be able to answer a call immediately. Callers should 
              remain patient and wait for their calls to be answered. <br></p>
