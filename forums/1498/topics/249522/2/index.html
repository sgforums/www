For me, i was from the 'FIT' squad and my platoon was tekan much more than others due to us being the 'FIT' squad which we never ask for anyway. Just be good and they'll be good to you.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Erm... for the documents rite, you mean i dun even hav to let them take my NRIC? I thought they'll take away the NRIC for the next 2 yrs?<br></blockquote>they will take it.. rmb to bring it. just in case, just bring a phtocopy one la.<br><br><blockquote>Marker Black or Blue? Thick or Fine one? Erm... For the tape... use rubber tape? not Masking tape?</blockquote>doesn't matter black or blue. just standardise one bunk/platoon can already. masking tape also can la. but the smaller width one. and fine marker. cos need to write your particulars nicely. (rank name,platoon)<br><br><blockquote>Will they guide us on where the standardise place to stick the names and the length and followed by name, rank, company?</blockquote>yeap... not to worry about that. just make sure you do as they say.<br><br><blockquote>So... no charger? I have to bring afew more extra battery likdat?</blockquote>yeah... 2 spare batts should be enough. cos u can only use it from 5.30pm onwards till u sleep.<br><br><blockquote>Hm... where did u get the rule? i realise how come the letter i got didn't tell me anything~ only ask me to bring toiletries, NRIC, Cert, Bank Book. So i must get a spec that has a plastic frame and it MUST be black?</blockquote>if u want, just wear your current one. they will give you up till the next book-in to change your specs. it's all about standardising. who knows if your platoon is slack and they don't give a damn about the colours or type of your specs. well... they also didn't say about rubber tape and marker. it's all up to your platoon superiors to set the additional rules. just don't argue with them even if they don't make sense.<br><br><blockquote><br>Something like this?<br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p147/vonacid/soho40black.jpg"><br><br>or this?<br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p147/vonacid/soho3black.jpg">[/b]</blockquote>yeah... as long black or plastic will do..<br></div>
