Non of my family members were in the force too. Dad was a commando, Uncle was a pilot for the RSAF and another uncle in the navy. Being part of the SCDF will teach you alot too, Life Saving !<br><br>Why would they ask you to bring in a cert ? I didn't have to during my time.. Well as for toiletries, the basic stuff you use at home. Don't need me to list it down here right ? Put your face mask and crap like that at home. Won't be needing it there. About the cert, i'm sure someone else that just enlisted can help you.<br><br>Situation on the day ? Nothing much to worry about. Just alot of talking and collection of uniforms and stuff. Yes, i would suggest a haircut. During my time, we got our haircut at 11am and we couldn't shower till 6pm. YOu don't want to be walking around with all the hair behind your back eh.<br><br>Pes C9L2 ? Don't worry, i don't think you will be an ERS or going to the FFC. Most prob a clerk, storeman or a driver.. Best among those 3 voc, be a clerk in a Fire Station !</div>

Ok, its easy for me to say this since I have ORDed but it is in fact the most effective way now that I think about it.<br><br>Just go in and use common sense and you will be fine. PES C9 means no ippt for you and the training will not be tough at all. Most likely you will be posted to a "non-combat" voaction in terms of SCDF. Feel your way around and you will be fine.</div>
