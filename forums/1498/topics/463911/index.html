              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I have just entered my 5th weeks of PTP stage , in other words leaving with another 3 more weeks before ending it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">To my understanding, this is the procedures:</span></p>
              <p>8 Weeks PTP - 6 Months SCC</p>
              <p>8 Weeks PTP - 3 Months FFC </p>
              <p>8 Weeks PTP + 2 Weeks BRT - 6 Months SCC / 3 Months FFC</p>
              <p>8Weeks PTP + 5 Weeks BRT - SRB / Clerk / Infocomm / Driver / Storeman / Medic / more...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I want to clarify somethings , I have a diploma (Private) but I have hyperextended knee &amp; slightly dis-align back bone. But I only informed my PC &amp; instructors but do not have any doctor proves. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of my questions:</p>
              <p>1) What are the chances to be posted to SCC / FFC ?</p>
              <p>2) Anyone knows about posting to NCDCC ?</p>
              <p>3) What is the criteria to be a NSTI Instructor ?</p>
              <p>4) Will BRT stage be as physically tough as PTP ? </p>
              <p>5) Who usually posted to SRB ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you in advance!! </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Civil defence service</strong></span><br><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) is the emergency rescue force of Singapore and they provide firefighting, rescue and ambulance services, and has been one of the three National Service postings since 1972. Those enlisted into the SCDF typically undergo seven weeks of training at the Basic Rescue Training Centre (BRTC), where they are given basic rescue training (BRT), exposed to regimental discipline, and trained to maintain a level of fitness required of all NSFs in Singapore.<br><br>Much like the SAF's SISPEC course, selected NSFs are also posted to the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) to undergo the Firefighter Course (FFC) or the Emergency Response Specialist Course (ERSC) within the first two weeks of their BRT stage, passing out as Firefighters for FFC trainees, and as Fire &amp; Rescue Specialists for ERS trainees who would also simultaneously be conferred with the Sergeant rank (Firefighters mostly pass out as Privates prior to station posting). Firefighters would typically be posted out to the various fire stations island-wide after passing out, while Fire &amp; Rescue Specialists would be posted as Section Commanders at territorial division, fire stations or at the Special Rescue Battalion; based largely on rankings at the time of course completion, a small number may also be posted as Instructors back in the CDA to staff the Command and Staff Training Center (CSTC), Specialist Training Center (STC), or Firefighting Training Center (FFTC).<br><br>While a certain level of health and fitness pre-requisites are expected by both the FFC and ERSC administrators before one can be selected for these courses, admission into the ERS course typically requires a certain set of additional qualifications, namely either a minimum of a GCE Advanced Level certificate, a Diploma or a Higher Nitec Certificate. These added pre-requisites are viewed as necessary in the light of a Section Commander's operational and administrative role when posted out. One marked difference between the FFC and ERSC is the added rescue and emergency training received by ERS Specialist Cadet Trainees (SCTs), as well as the General Command &amp; Control Term, which includes the Basic Home Team Course held at the Home Team Academy and an outward-bound Brunei trip which serves to equip and develop the necessary leadership skills required of a specialist junior officer. In terms of administration and duration, the FFC is under the charge of the FFTC and lasts three months, while the ERSC is under the purview of the CSTC and lasts six months.<br><br>In addition, there is also the Basic Officer Course under the charge of the CSTW, designed to train NSFs and regulars as Senior Officers of the SCDF, with NSFs graduating as Lieutenants (LTA). While the BOC is traditionally largely made up of NSFs from the SAF who had just completed their Basic Military Training (BMT) at Pulau Tekong, the top 5-10% of the ERSC will also be offered to cross over to the Basic Officer Course (BOC) to be trained and commissioned as Senior Officers after passing out, spending the last three months of the BOC together with Officer Cadet Trainees (OCTs).<br><br>NSFs who undergo the full 7-week basic rescue training at the BRTC are subsequently posted and trained to become medical orderlies (medics), dog handlers, provosts, information and communications and logistics specialists or instructors (such as Physical Training Instructors) among many other vocations upon passing out from the BRTC.[18]</p></div>
