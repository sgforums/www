              <p>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighter who was injured while helping to put out a taxi on fire in Buona Vista is recovering well, according to Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam in a Facebook post on Sunday (May 7).<br><br>"CPL Eka was injured, while putting out the fire of a burning taxi which exploded at Buona Vista," wrote Mr Shanmugam after a visit to the full-time National Serviceman's house. "I went to his house and met him and his mother.<br><br>"The boy is recovering well. They are the only persons in the household. The father has passed away, and the other children are all overseas."</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam added that CPL Eka plans to study mechanical engineering after completing his National Service.<br><br>The firefighter sustained first-degree burns to his face and neck while putting out a fire caused by a taxi explosion on Commonwealth Avenue last week.<br><br>"I have also alerted his MP, Ms Tin Pei Ling. She will drop in on the family to check, offer assistance that local grassroots can give," he said. "The men and women of the Home Team put their lives at risk every day to protect Singapore."<br><br>Four men, including the SCDF firefighter, sustained minor injuries and were taken to National University Hospital, SCDF said.<br><br><strong>"SELFLESS" MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC RECOVERING</strong><br><br>Among them was ITE student Yazid. On Thursday, Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC Christopher De Souza visited him at his house.</p>
              <p>Mr Yazid was burnt by flying debris from the blast while dismounting from his motorbike at the scene to try and help the taxi's passengers, according to Mr De Souza in a Facebook post.<br><br>Yazid burnt his thighs, hands and shoulder when the burning taxi exploded.<br><br>"Thank you, Yazid, for your selflessness in the face of such odds," Mr De Souza wrote. "Instead of being deterred by the thick black smoke from the taxi, Yazid rode his motorbike toward the smoke at Commonwealth Avenue as he instinctively felt he needed to render assistance to passengers."<br><br>Thankfully, Mr Yazid has "healed well" and is recovering at home, he added.</p>
