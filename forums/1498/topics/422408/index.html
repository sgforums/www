              <p>A WEEK after Muhammad Sazali and his friends were involved in a gang 
              attack in Clarke Quay in 2003 where a youth died, he escaped into 
              Malaysia by walking along two water pipes at Marsiling. Seven years 
              later, he turned himself in. On Wednesday, he was sentenced to 21/2 
              years in jail and six strokes of the cane for rioting while armed with a
               knife. Muhammad, now 29, was also jailed a year and three months for 
              deserting the Singapore Civil Defence Force since April 2003.</p>
              <p>Fourteen accomplices involved in the attack have been dealt with. 
              They received sentences ranging from probation and reformative training 
              to prison terms of six months to 11/2 years as well as caning.</p>
              <p>The group called themselves the Ubi Boys, after the neighbourhood 
              they hailed from, and on Wednesday, a district court heard a 
              blow-by-blow account of how the group planned and carried out an attack.
               At about midnight on April 16, four of the group went down to Jams The 
              Club at Clarke Quay, where they knew the rival group would be. They were
               soon joined by the rest of the Ubi group, most of them arriving in two 
              vans.</p>
              <p>A fight, involving knifes and screwdrivers, then erupted 
              between the two groups. The target of the Ubi group was Mr Suhaimi 
              Salleh, then 22. He was not injured but his friend Mohamad Sadik Senin, 
              19, suffered multiple slash and stab wounds and died at the Singapore 
              General Hospital at about 3.50am.</p>
              <p>The cause of death was determined as acute bleeding of the 
              aorta and forensic evidence indicated that the injury was likely to have
               been inflicted by a screwdriver stabbed into his back and into the 
              heart.</p>
              <p>In May, Muhammad decided to surrender himself to the 
              Malaysian police, and was jailed four months for entering the country 
              illegally. He was released on Aug 20 last year and handed over to the 
              police here.</p>
