              <p>The revised edition of the Fire Code[1], which is into its 7th edition, 
              was recently introduced on 15 January 2013. A 6-month grace period was 
              given to the building industry to plan ahead for any new building 
              projects. Building projects that are submitted to SCDF for approval from
               15 July 2013 will be subjected to the new code.</p>
              <p class="data-content">An example of a new addition to the Fire Code is
               the provision of visual alarm in the form of a strobe or flashing light
               device at designated locations in non-residential buildings. This will 
              help to alert the hearing impaired during emergencies. Other previously 
              introduced fire safety requirements to facilitate the evacuation of 
              persons with disabilities in non-residential buildings are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Provision of up to 2 designated holding points within buildings. 
              Holding points provide a temporary safe space for persons with 
              disabilities to await for further assistance during an emergency.<br> </li>
              <li>Suitable means of communication, in the form of a distress button or
               voice communication device, should also be provided between the holding
               point and the Fire Command Centre within the building. This will allow 
              persons with disabilities a means to call for assistance during a fire 
              emergency.<br> </li>
              <li>For buildings with lifts, one lift is required to be designated for 
              use by CERT[2] personnel or fire fighters to assist in the evacuation of
               persons with disabilities during emergencies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Chaired by SCDF, the Fire Code is reviewed by the Fire Code Review 
              Committee comprising representatives from the building industry, 
              government agencies and academic institutions.  The Fire Code is 
              designed to support the local building industry’s practices, experiences
               and the architectural heritage of Singapore. As part of the review 
              process, feedback was also gathered through SCDF’s consultation 
              sessions, seminars and workshops with the industry. The feedback was 
              beneficial in the formulation of the latest fire safety requirements.</p>
              <p>An electronic version of the Fire Code is available on SCDF’s website at <a href="http://www.scdf.gov.sg">www.scdf.gov.sg</a>.  Hardcopies of the Fire Code are also available and can be purchased at SCDF headquarters.</p>

              <p class="data-content"><em>[1] Fire safety standards for buildings in 
              Singapore is governed by the Code of Practice for Fire Precautions in

              authoritative source on fire safety standards for local buildings and is
