              <p>A person dying and in need of CPR is a scene for which no amount of training can prepare a person.</p>
              <p>It explains why, when former SCDF paramedic Abdul Rasheed Doad
              reaches the victims, he often finds a crowd, but no one giving first
              aid.</p>
              <p>This, even though chances are that someone in the crowd could be trained to do so.</p>
              <p>To help first-aiders overcome their fears of giving CPR, Mr Rasheed,
              founder of the Singapore First Aid Training Centre is starting a course
              called My True Hero.</p>
              <p>He shares how in his six years as a paramedic, he's seen people giving CPR in only one of 50 instances.</p>
              <p>"Most of the time, the usual response we get is we'd rather not
              touch the victim, we might do something wrong and hurt him even more
              and what if I break a rib, there's always all these fears that come
              about when it comes to helping. Some of them just fear of stepping
              forward because there's a crowd and they just don't want to step in
              front of people to do something which they themselves might not be very
              comfortable."</p>
              <p>Existing CPR courses, Mr Rasheed says, focus more on the techniques of first-aid, than overcoming such fears.</p>
              <p>The course that he'll conduct with his colleague, an enrolled nurse,
              draws on their collective experiences and how they've overcome it
              themselves or have helped others to do so.</p>
              <p>Mr Rasheed gives on example of what participants could pick up at the one-day seminar.</p>
              <p>"We've this activity which is done during the lunch break so they're
              supposed to go for lunch in a group and they've to look for the
              opportunity to help others. And they'd score points on that. We turn it
              into a kind of game. Helping someone, you've to build up the confidence
              of going up to someone and talking to them - alot of people have that
              kind of fear."</p>
              <p>The seminar today will also address myths like whether a person can get AIDs or be sued for giving CPR.</p>
              <p>A second seminar is being planned for August 15th and if response is good, more will be organised.</p>
              <p>Mr Rasheed thinks such courses should form a pre-requisite for CPR training programmes.</p>
              <p>"If you understand the psychological theory behind it, it helps you
              when you learn CPR so you learn it with an open mind and open heart
              rather than thinking what if I do this and do that and do this? Most of
              these people, if CPR is not applied within the first few minutes, the
              brain cells start to die. So even if you call the paramedics and we get
              there within 10 minutes, it's really too late for us to do anything
              actually."</p>
