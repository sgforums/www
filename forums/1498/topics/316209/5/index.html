              <p>no offence again but medical centre medics also kinda boring vocation coz you'll only get to see those recruits or whoever who is not feeling well but administer flu jabs for example..</p>

              <p>our instructors or the paramedic in charge will let the
              casualities know what will be their injuries, either P0, P1, P2, P3
              or P4..</p>
              <p>but we being the medics to rescue them won't know what are their
              injuries till we found them..</p>
              <p>after we assess then we bring them to the triage area aka 1st
              aid point..</p>

              <p>fire floor can really be chaotic during exercise. sibei frustrating if you don't get the back up you need while you are squatting with an uncontrollable fire in front of you. the acrid smoke make your eyes water and painful, you have to find casualties, and make sure you don't die in the process. everyone plays a part. imagine one sabo kia, turn off the water while you are fighting a flash over, or one goondu rambo, rush in solo, without hearing his friend signal that water is up.

              <p>Hey guys, been a while since I posted in this thread. I got posted to the medical orderly course. Same batch like Sacredsoul but was posted to station. I wanted medical centre also initially, was abit terrified when Encik called my name and released my posting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Been two days in station now, today is my off day. Kind of stressful and scared to let the paramedics and the station medic in the station down. Still nervous in calls and other stuffs. So many things to improve so little time. I'm so going to be dead in station.</p>
