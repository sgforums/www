My friend messaged me and asked if there was a blackout at my house too," said Shi Ying.<br><br>But over at the Golden Mile hawker centre, it was dining and cooking with candle-lights until the lights came on.<br><br>"The lights went off suddenly and I was shocked at that time. I don't know what is happening, but the business has to continue," said a hawker.<br><br>At several other areas, such as Jalan Eunos where our news team was, road traffic and business was normal.<br><br>Many were also happy that power was restored before the evening peak period.<br><br>News of the power failure which affected some parts of Singapore came as Singaporeans were just recovering from Tuesday's spell of a heavy downpour which affected a large part of the island and disrupted the lives of many people.<br><br>But the good thing was power was restored to the affected areas quite quickly. - CNA /ls</div>
