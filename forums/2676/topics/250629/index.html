            <div class='col-md body'>Montfort Secondary School is a Catholic school in Singapore, founded in 1916. Originally named Holy Innocents' English School, it was renamed to its current one in 1959 in honour of the Founder of the Gabrielite Brothers, St Louis Marie Grignion De Montfort.<br><br>Its motto, "Age Quod Agis" means "Do well in whatever you do." Montfort has celebrated its 90th Anniversary in 2006 with a 90km run to its former location and a thanksgiving mass conducted by the Archbishop Of Singapore, Nicholas Chia, who happens to be an old boy of Holy Innocents' English School (Later renamed to Montfort School) at the Church Of The Nativity Of The Blessed Virgin Mary which is the church that has been beside the old location of the school all along and a dinner held at the school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>History</strong></span><br><br>Montfort School was initially set up as Holy InnocentsÂ’ English School. It was first set up in 1916 by the parish priest, Father H. Duvelle next to Nativity church at Upper Serangoon Road. At the request of the Inspector of Schools, he organized an English class on the top floor of the two-storey building between the church and the school canteen. The teacher was Mr Lee Ah Kow. The class lasted for three years.<br><br>In March 1920, Father E. Becheras, the new parish priest restarted the school with a class of some 30 pupils under the charge of a Mr Monterio. In the following year another class was added.<br><br>In 1922, Mr P A DÂ’Costa was recruited as teacher and administrator. From 1922 to 1936 he was a tower of strength to the school and a source of inspiration to both pupils and staff.<br><br>The school grew from strength to strength. A new class was added each year and additional teachers recruited.<br><br>The increased intake of students necessitated the need to expand the school premises. A block of 5 classrooms along Upper Serangooon Road was completed in 1927. In 1929 three additional classrooms along Holy Innocents Lane were added. Yet in 1932 another floor was added to the second block.<br><br>1936 marked the beginning of a new era when the management of the school was placed in the hands of the Brothers of St Gabriel, Rev. Bro. Gerard Majella came from Bangkok to become the first Brother Director of the school.<br><br>Brother Adolphus and Brother John de Breboeuf came in December 1936. 1936 was also the first year when the school produced its School Certificate class.<br><br>It was Bro. Gerard Majella who was responsible for the smooth charge over in the school management. In 1938, he was succeeded by Bro. Louis Gonzaga.<br><br>The Japanese Occupation of Singapore interrupted the work of the school. Immediately after the war, Bro. Louis Gonzaga worked tiredlessly to reorganize and rehabilitate the school. He extended the block along Upper Serangoon Road by adding another floor to it.<br><br>The new extension was opened by His Highness the Sultan of Johore.<br><br>In 1949, Bro. Louis Gonzaga also started the afternoon school - the Holy InnocentsÂ’ Afternoon School - under the charge of Bro. Basil.<br><br>In 1955 Rev. Bro. Noel. became the Director of the Holy InnocentsÂ’ and he set up a committee on 3rd April 1955 to raise funds to further extend the school. Within three years the extension was completed.<br><br>In 1959 Holy InnocentsÂ’ English School was renamed Montfort School in honour of the Founder, St Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort, of the Gabrielite Brothers.<br><br>In the late 1980s, a decision was made to relocate Montfort Junior and Secondary Schools so as to make them comparable to the newer Government Schools. A Building Fund Committee was formed to raise the necessary funds to finance the building project, the cost of which amounted to $24 million. Capital grant from the Government was 18.5 million, therefore the schools had to raise $5.5 million.<br><br>Piling began in August 1989 at the new site at Hougang Avenue 8, immediately after a ground breaking ceremony on 12th August 1989 which was officiated by His Grace, Mgr Gregory Yong D.D. The main building works of the two schools started in March 1990 and took about 21 months to complete.<br><br>On 2nd January, 1992, the two schools, Montfort Junior and Montfort Secondary, started functioning at their new premises.<br><br>In 1997, the school underwent its first R &amp; R (Repairs and Redecoration).<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Facilities</strong></span><br><br>1 Canteen and Hall(air-conditioned) with 3 badminton courts each Air-conditioned AVA and language rooms Air-conditioned classrooms (mostly on the 3rd and 4th levels) Air-conditioned Music rooms Air-conditioned Computer labs CCA rooms Prayer room Viewing Gallery Games couples with 2 squash courts, basketball, sepak-takraw and netball courts, tennis-court, multi-purpose field and games rooms. A 132-seat theatrette Staff recreation centre A Heritage Gallery<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Uniqueness Of The School</strong></span><br><br>Montfort secondary school is also the only school in Singapore which starts school at 8.30am. It is unique in its way because its current principal, Mr Simen Lourds is trying to reduce the rate of late-coming by students. Common tests are also suspended from the school following a new system of teaching introduced to the school. With handphones being allowed in the school, students really have nothing to complain at all except the strict hair checks. The school have 2 types of uniform, the proper school uniform and an alternative uniform.E-Gaming is soon going to be introduce into the school as well .</div>
