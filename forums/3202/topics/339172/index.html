              <p>just asking, i thought do more reps with lighter weight better than doing few reps with heavy weight? (i dont wanna get bodybuilder-type muscles, but i wan muscles. altho there's still a LOONG way to go)</p>
              <p>and, for girls, chest too?? wouldnt that be too.. erm.. i think u get what i mean. For guys, of cos chest exercises i understand lah.</p>
              <p>how about butt exercises? my bod isnt too proportionate.. upper half looks okay though fat.. den lower is too fat.. pear shaped actualy. im pretty happy with my thigh muscles, but i want to get rid of the thick layer of blubber so that i can see my leg muscles.. XD help pls?</p>
              <p>i hope to train abs too, will google about the rope crunches. but i think i have lower back problem i cant even do 3 situps without my lower back hurting. it doesnt hurt that bad, just when im doing situps/crunches (on the half ball thingy)/vertical crunches (those that i use my arms to support my body and bring my legs up) so i totally dont train abs at all.</p>

              <p>training with heavy weights at less reps is definitely a good muscle-building-fat-losing method. however, you, along with many others, have this misconception: that just by doing heavy weights with less reps, you will have muscles like a bodybuilder which you might not want. the truth is bodybuilders train with much harder weights, take much more protein than you and are blessed with mesomorph genes. it is extremely hard for one to merely train with heavy weights and less reps and become a bodybuilder. so you need not worry about gaining body-builder muscles, unless you are taking excessive amounts of protein (more than 1.5g per pound of bodyweight) and train with extremely heavy weights (lifting 1.5 times your weight at least).</p>
              <p>to train the butt, there is little point in doing isolation exercises. the only effective method is doing squats. if you have a bad back, consult your doctor and do not attempt squats first. if your doctor gives the go-ahead, you might consider getting a weight lifting belt to give extra support to the lower back. then try squatting half your weight, since you are a female. this also helps develop the thighs.</p>
              <p>only other advice i can give to training your legs and thighs are sprinting intervals. forget about the leg press. leg press should only be done after squats.maybe you should try sprinting first and having a good diet to lose the fats before squatting to gain some nice muscle.</p>
              <p>for abs, if you have lower back problem, then i only have 3 solutions for you</p>
              <p>1) continue doing half situps though there will be little progress</p>
              <p>2) forget about training the abs, and focus on sprinting to burn fat overall</p>
              <p>3) do hanging leg raise (hang on a chinup bar, keep your legs together and raise them till they are parallel to the ground.</p>

              <p><br>there are 4 essential supplements to a healthy and strong diet.</p>
              <p>1) fish oil capsules. they provide the omega 3 that is found in salmon. but it is not everyday that you get to eat salmon because it's costly. it is a worthwhile investment as it helps strengthen the heart through the healthy fats</p>
              <p>2) multivitamins (an extremely economical brand is Nutrifirst multivitamins 100 capsules for $12 <a href="http://www.nutrifirst.net">www.nutrifirst.net</a> - i'm not their advertiser by the way). actually just by taking about 2 oranges, 2 slices of papaya and 2 apples will be good enough for your diet. top it up with tomatoes and carrots</p>
              <p>3) Whey Isolate Protein. They supplement your diet. ideally, ectomorphs should take 1g-1.5g protein per pound of bodyweight. mesomorphs and endomorphs stick to 0.8g-1g per pound of bodyweight. take casein protein before sleeping. personally, i am abstaining from supplements and am sticking to natural food though it's harder. at least there are no risks of any contamination or quality deterioration.</p>
              <p>4) Creatine. It provides the extra boost to your workout and fuels faster growth and recovery when combined with protein. Take 5g a day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i do not really like calcium supplements because just by drinking milk which is high in protein and calories, i can get all the calcium i want.</p>

              <p>GNC and Nature Farm inflate prices by 2 1/2 times and claim to give 30-50% discounts. You can get much cheaper from online supplement stores listed above.and gnc protein and creatine brands are EAS Myoplex. Because EAS is such a good brand, the price is all the more higher:)</p>

              <p><br>no you need to change your diet mainly. take your weight in pounds, multiply that by 18-20. that is the minimum amount of calories you must consume a day. for protein, consume 1g per pound of bodyweight. take 6 meals a day, instead of 3. and the calories must be clean , i.e. only from meat, mass gainer, bread, oats, rice</p>

              <p><br>HL milk gives 50g. a can of tuna can give you 40g. take whey, each serving gives you  20g. 110g is easy if you take two slabs of beef for lunch that would make 60g. in fact, to grow fast, one is recommended 1.5g per pound</p>
