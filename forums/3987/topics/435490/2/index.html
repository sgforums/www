              <p>don't label me as a clubber. it's a means to an end. i like dancing especially with cool looking (to me) dudes, but really want to search his brain and exchange info if he wanted to take me our of there to somewhere quiet where we could talk etc. for me physical attraction first and then if there is some mental attraction or meeting of the minds it's something i will like to explore further. BTW mental attraction is when there may be not meeting of minds but the dude has intriguing ideas and views which are not to antogonistic but another wants to try and undertstand and perhaps be persuaded? i realise guys will just look for a ONS as I am passing through. maybe? who knows how convincing and alluring...... but most tourist when on holiday let their hair down and want to party!</p>

              <p>don't label me as a clubber. it's a means to an end. i like
              dancing especially with cool looking (to me) dudes, but really want
              to search his brain and exchange info if he wanted to take me
              our of there to somewhere quiet where we could talk etc. for me
              physical attraction first and then if there is some mental
              attraction or meeting of the minds it's something i will like to
              explore further. BTW mental attraction is when there may be not
              meeting of minds but the dude has intriguing ideas and views which
              are not to antogonistic but another wants to try and undertstand
              and perhaps be persuaded? i realise guys will just look for a ONS
              as I am passing through. maybe? who knows how convincing and
              alluring...... but most tourist when on holiday let their hair down
              and want to party!</p>

              <p>Oh yeah totally get that. I move around as well, so I know what you mean. I was just shortlisting venues / events where you might meet those like-minded folks. </p>

              <p>I'm not a regular at places where you can dance, but I can tell you that Ku De Ta might be out of your budget. The places where people your age and mine go to are Butter Factory, Zouk (where there's this Mambo phenomenon late on Wednesday nights), Attica and, less commonly, Rebel and Home.</p>
              <p>If it's a concern for you, some ladies go to Play and Taboo at weekends to dance among men without getting hit on...</p>

              <p>works fine here - are you referring to the timeout link? if it is not working - try "timeout singapore" on google and look for the Clubbing sub-link. it's like Timeout in any other world city, just lists the latest current shindigs to check out </p>
