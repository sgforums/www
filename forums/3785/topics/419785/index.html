              <p>Personally, I think the reason why Facebook is said to shorten attention spans would be the fact that youths are getting more and more addicted to it. When a person gets addicted to something, he or she will unconsciously keep thinking about it. As for the addiction towards Facebook, he would keep thinking about, for example, whether or not his friends has uploaded new photos from their recent outings, if his friend has commented about his status, if a friend has accepted his invitation to a game, etc.</p>

              <p>The issue about the virtual world overtaking the real-world social interaction would be mainly because, in my opinion, a person is either too shy to be able to communicate well with others in real life due to low-self esteem and etc. or he just wants to pretend to be someone he isn't. For those who do not communicate very well with other people, virtual world interaction is actually a very good solution for them as they are able to take their time to think about what to say next, not having the need to maintain eye contact while talking, not having to worry about his body signals, etc. As for the pretending part, most of us are actually not very happy with our looks and feel that it affects how others see/treat us. Thus, the virtual world interaction comes in handy as they are able to customize the way they look through their profile and stuff like that.</p>

              <p>I agree with your view. Facebook and other social media can be a portal for youths who are shy to interact with other people. Using Social media gives them more confidence to speak with people as this helps them to break the barrier between them and other people. With long term use of Facebook it may help a shy youth to gain enough  confidence to interact with other people in real life</p>

              <p>Well, i would say is only partly correct, as the impacts of Facebook, or rather how Facebook change a person is solely on the user itself. They have to use it properly, thats for sure. However, i feel that making users to shorten attention spans is not quite real as i feel that Facebook encourages people to be more aware of the surroundings, pay attention to more stuffs around the user.</p>

              <p>Well, good question. I feel that it makes youths more sociable to a large extent as they will be able to meet new friends because they can actually make new friends through their existing friends. However, the part "but do not meet face to face" it is actually a 'obstacle' where the user or rather youths have to face. They can meet a lot of new friends online but actually do not want to meet them in real life so how does that make them more sociable? Then again, it all boils down to the user itself, being sociable or not is solely based on the youth itself.</p>

              <p> yes, i agree to some extent to what you have said. we need to again go 
              back to the definition of sociable. does meeting your friends make you a

              <p>I understand what you are trying to say. For me, as my personal opinion i feel that being a sociable person, the most basic thing is to meet more friends in real life, what is the point of getting hundreds of friends virtually and only knowing a few in real life? Being sociable is to understand more to the surrounding knowing whats happening and to make new friends in the process. There is no point using Facebook as the core of socialising but not having to meet them up, this is far from being sociable. Keep communicating online on Facebook does HELP to make a person more sociable BUT does NOT neccesary make one a sociable person. I can talk to you 24/7 online on Facebook but be total silent in front of you in real life. Therefore socialising using Facebook is only a 'stage' in becoming more sociable but it is not the whole process of being a sociable person.</p>
