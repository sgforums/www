              <p>I understand what you are trying to say. For me, as my personal
              opinion i feel that being a sociable person, the most basic thing
              is to meet more friends in real life, what is the point of getting
              hundreds of friends virtually and only knowing a few in real life?
              Being sociable is to understand more to the surrounding knowing
              whats happening and to make new friends in the process. There is no
              point using Facebook as the core of socialising but not having to
              meet them up, this is far from being sociable. Keep communicating
              online on Facebook does HELP to make a person more sociable BUT
              does NOT neccesary make one a sociable person. I can talk to you
              24/7 online on Facebook but be total silent in front of you in real
              life. Therefore socialising using Facebook is only a 'stage' in
              becoming more sociable but it is not the whole process of being a
              sociable person.</p>

              <p>Yes i agree to what you have said. I personally feel that you have to interact with other people and meet them in order to be sociable. Facebook can help us get back in contact with our old friends and can help us make new friends. All these potential friends to go out with will bring us to the process of being sociable.</p>

              <p>I do not really agree with your "meetin them in order to be socialable". This can be very dangerous if you do not know the person you have met online well enough yet. In contrast to that , I think if the person you met online is a friend of your friend whom known each other well enough then it might be a more possible way.Â </p>

But normally teenagers as you said wanted "to be socialable" do not really consider the consequences and just meet with their newly met online friends. Another reason to consider is that when in Facebook anybody can make a fake appearance to fool the other person, some teenagers fall for this trick and end up meeting the person because he/she look handsome or beautiful in the profile picture. Though there is not much of such incident happening lately, it is better to make sure who are your friends and who is not.</p></div>

              <p>Yes, i agree that it could be quite a problem when teenagers fall for such scams, thats is why the teenager or rather youths have to think smart and dont be too gullible, only meet up with people that they are 100% sure who is it. There MIGHT be many of such cases happening, only that it is not reported to the public.</p>
