              <span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins</p>
              </span><span style="color: #000080; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion. When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size.</p>
              <p>2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.</p>
              <p>3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumours.</p>
              <p>4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors.</p>
              <p>5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.</p>
              <p>6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.</p>
              <p>7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.</p>
              <p>8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction.</p>
              <p>9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.</p>
              <p>10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.</p>
              <p>11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.</p>
              </span><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p>WHAT CANCER CELLS FEED ON:</p>
              </span><span style="color: #000080; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p>a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal,Spoonful, etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be Manuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts. Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in colour. Better alternative is Bragg's aminos or sea salt.</p>
              <p>b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened soy milk, cancer cells are being starved.</p>
              <p>c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish, and a little chicken rather than beef or pork. Meat also contains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer.</p>
              <p>d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment. About 20% can be from cooked food including beans. Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including bean sprouts) and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).</p>
              <p>e. Avoid coffee, tea,ea and chocolate, which have high caffeine. Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it.</p>
              <p>12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrified and leads to more toxic buildup.</p>
              <p>13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.</p>
              <p>14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence, Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.</p>
              <p>15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger, unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells.</p>

              <p class="arial12"><span style="color: #000000;">After years
                                  of societal changes, millions of pounds of marketing spend and
                                  technological advances
                                  we, as a race, are now facing more dietary based health challenges
                                  than ever before.  It is no coincidence that the rapidly growing
                                  numbers of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes correlate
                                  almost exactly with the rise in consumption of acid forming foods
                                such as sugars, saturated fats, and white breads.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">At the
                                  same time our consumption of fresh vegetables and essential fatty
                                  acids has decreased dramatically, making way for convenience and
                              a generation hooked on sugary treats.</span></p>
              <p class="arial12"><span style="color: #000000;">This is not as
              difficult or as technical as it sounds.  When we talk about eating
              alkaline foods or starting an alkaline diet we are referring to
              consuming those foods and drink which have an alkaline effect on the
              body.  This effect is based upon the mineral content of the food and
              therefore the ash residue that remains after our foods are consumed. 
              Some foods leave an acid ash, whereas others leave an alkaline ash.
              Conveniently for us, it just so happens that the foods that contain
              alkaline minerals (and leave an alkaline ash) are all the foods we
              already know are good for us: low sugar foods, fresh vegetables etc.
              And the foods that contain minerals that leave an acid ash? You guessed
              it, sweets, alcohol, saturated fats, meats, dairy etc. </span></p>
              <p class="arial12"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, <em>everybody
                            is different</em> - but most of us should aim to eat <span class="ariel12bold">70-80%
                              alkaline  foods</span> and<strong> </strong>a maximum
                            of <span class="ariel12bold">20-30%
                          acid forming foods.</span></span></p>
              <p class="arial12">This
              does not have to be measured in calories, grams or anything technical,
              just look at your plate! Is 70% of the food on it alkalising? And for
              the other 30%? You can do with this what you like (how acid is up to
              you - dependent upon the results you want), but feel free to go for
              some oily fish, wholemeal pasta or wild rice for example.</p>
