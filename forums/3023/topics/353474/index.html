              <p>Dear Diary,</p>
              <p>I just realised that I became the moderator of a forum, THIS forum. I was just replying tiny in another thread that it is quite unlike me to be so kaypo thus the reason I'm NOT a moderator. And within the next 5mins I got to know I was already a moderator when I said that. How ironic.</p>
              <p>It's 2a.m. now, and I'm still wide awake, I'm suppose to feel drowsy because I took some flu medication but the effects seems to take forever to kick in. I have been having a running nose for aweek now, and that is not good for performance both at work and play. I got to recover from this soon.</p>
              <p>Now I shall really try to get some sleep. See you again tomorrow diary.</p>

              <p>Dear Diary,</p>
              <p>Today I woke up so early I'm surprised I'm still awake now. The morning was pretty eventful as I got to meet a friend I have lost contact for a long time. He was actually my mentor in law in my younger years. He seems to have aged alot but other than that I also sense that he is now more peaceful with life. He is a good man, but he was known for being a very strict person previously. I guess life's experiences has soften him and thus allowing him to be more leinient. I guess that is something I have to learn myself.</p>
              <p>I had a nice phone chat with a nice lady just now. I really like her jovial and frank character and it is really a pleasure to talk to her. I just wish we have more time alone to get to know each other better in a closer manner like the phone chat just now. Nonetheless, the experience was very much treasured.</p>
              <p>I think I have many bad habits, First it's my inabilty to sleep, then there is alcohol and smoking. I'm wondering when I can become a really healthy lifestyle person. I have not drunk alcohol for a week. It is some progress I think. Though I'm not alcoholic, the doctor did remind me to stay away from it. I guess it can remain my social habit and I always believe that everything should be moderated and that includes my smoking. Smoked only 18 sticks today, less than the 21 sticks yesterday. But I'm smoking now as I type this, rather contradicting I would say, but let's put it as I'm consoling myself. I can foresee a real fight if I would have to quit smoking some day in the future.</p>
              <p>The running nose is still pestering me and is not allowing me to go easy into the night. Could it be withdrawal symtoms from alcohol and nicotine? Nah, I doubt so, it's just the weather I hope.</p>
              <p>Time to sleep again. It's past 12 and I should be trying to get over my insomania an hour ago. Goodnight Dairy.</p>

              <p>Dear, Diary,</p>
              <p>I slept early last night and thus did not visit you. As a matter of fact I fell asleep in front of the computer on the chair when I was waiting for you to load. It seems I must change a chair for the computer, it is getting a bit too comfortable. </p>
              <p>Had to go meet a friend at the last minute yesterday. She just broke up with her bf and was looking for someone to talk to. She felt that I'm "SAFE", someone she would not fall for as a rebound, very logical of her, I would say. Did not talk for very long and was home by 11p.m. Nothing much happen, I just gave her a friendly hug and send her home.</p>
              <p>What I'm worried about is her getting into another round of r/s without letting go of the baggage from the current one. Damn, she have not even let go of the baggage from her 3 previous r/s and is already out of this current one. She is what I call a serial-rebounder. It always seems like she gets only emotionally attached to the r/s after she broke it up. I wish I can help her get her thinking straight but then she has to help herself get out of this vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>Watch a DVD last night, "Lady Cop and Papa Crook". the storyline is pretty interesting except for the ending being abit abrupt. Well it is hard to get good movies nowadays.</p>
              <p>Ok, so much for yesterday, I need to get back to work now. See you again dairy.</p>

              <p>Dear Dairy,</p>
              <p>Was busy at work today, I got through alot of backlog and cleared quite a fair bit of work. I'm finally able to get my butt back to working after the break last week. I think I was suffering from post-break blues.</p>
              <p>My "Friend" started calling me again. I finally managed to make her accept certain things last week and she stopped calling me for the past 5 days. Although she called me again, she made it a point to say that we can still be friends and would not like to force me into doing something I do not wish to. I hope she is genuine. She told me she will be coming to Singapore in Mid April and asked if she can stay with me. I'm told her to let me think it through. I'm not really worried about her staying with me. I'm just worried that it might be awkard for her despite her assurance to me that she would not be.</p>
              <p>My mum had a brush with "death" just now. Her friend had a heart attack and she came back home pretty shaken after witnessing the incident. I had to coax her to eat dinner and watch TV with her to help her relax as she said her heart is beating very fast and she feels like fainting. One of the reasons me and my sister tries to keep certain things from my mum is due to the fact that she can be rather timid in the face of problems. She worry too much sometimes, especially in issues where there is nothing she can do about. I hoped I'm able to take good care of my mum alone, should my sister get married in future. I sure hope I can.</p>
              <p>See you again dairy. Time to try and sleep.</p>
