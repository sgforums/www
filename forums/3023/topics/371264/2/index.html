              <p>So you already know it's not a joke, you already know how badly

              <p>Lots of people gave you pretty reasonable advice over the past
              few weeks, but you willingly chose to turn it all down. So, what
              can I say? Good luck. You had better realize that anything good (or
              bad) that comes out from all this is entirely your
              responsibility.</p>
              <p>You are a man now. Once reality bites, and you come back here to

              <p>what is done can be undone at this point, u can write a letter of appeal to school, find a part time job that gives u flexible hours, make pocket money, drag ur haversack and ur ass to school, fall asleep in the bus, find a nice corner in campus, smoke in the toilet, there's so much freedom and possibilities in school, y do u want to Give It All Up, get drafted into NS prematurely at this point?</p>
              <p>my observation is this - this whole quitting bullshit is a character flaw that needs 2 b corrected during the formative years of ur life - Right Now.</p>
              <p>if u think u're buying an experience in school given ur background and circumstances, u're making a mistake. u need to buy a result. that result is improving ur character, ur determination and later on, achieving something u started. this leads to an improved quality life for urself and ur folks. </p>
              <p>this is not about a piece of paper or defining urself with a diploma. it's about molding ur own character.</p>
