              <p>no point saying anything else since the deed is done. Though I second the violence to befall if we meet.</p>
              <p>anyway think about what you want to do. sales is still possible of course and possibly good money. But note it's onyl some who make it, not most.</p>
              <p>Insurance is frankly not likely nowadays O lvls may not even let you  become an agent. But other things like housing agents or products are still ok.</p>
