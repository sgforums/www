              <p>what is done can be undone at this point, u can write a letter

              <p>my observation is this - this whole quitting bullshit is a
              character flaw that needs 2 b corrected during the formative years
              of ur life - Right Now.</p>
              <p>if u think u're buying an experience in school given ur
              background and circumstances, u're making a mistake. u need to buy
              a result. that result is improving ur character, ur determination
              and later on, achieving something u started. this leads to an
              improved quality life for urself and ur folks. </p>

              <p>Well, each of us have our own interests. But draw a line between reality and what really fantasizes you. I mean, if you want to earn big, then you have to start from scratch and put in a sizeable amount of effort. There's no shortcuts in life man.</p>
              <p>Stay positive and dun comprain so much without reflecting on your own doings. No offence bcus I have met ppl who always feel they are right and everybody else is wrong. They think at a very shallow perspective and dun see the rationale of what they are doing. U shld at least have a simple goal in mind (maybe be able to pay off all your outstanding bills) so that you won't feel that work is dull and boring for you.</p>

              <p>it's not the end of the road, really.  like u said, u are taking a little bit more time.  some people take one year to get there....maybe u just need a little break and take two or even three years to get there.  the outcome is important, but the journey there is also important.</p>
              <p>all the best, pika.  no regrets.  any experience is an experience.  most importantly, we learn from whatever experience we have and take it from there.</p>
              <p>i am glad u have a plan.  perhaps, when u have a taste of the working world and your ns experience, u will return to school and who knows, u will get really motivated and inspired the next time around.</p>
              <p>rem....aristotle said "an unexamined life is not worth living".  so have a goal.  search within....if u can't find it the first time, it's alright.  take a break and search again.  good luck and all the ver best in your new journey.  and here's something for you:</p>

              <p>Do you think I will never log in to sgf ever again? Or you really think I will never find out?</p>
              <p>I think I have made myself very clear the last time we spoke. If this is the way u wanna do things, alright. Don't ever regret it. You jolly well know what is coming your way if you quit school, but you still wanna walk the hard way.</p>
              <p>There are so many ppl sharing their experiences about tetiary education, and I have shared mine too. If after seeing all these responses and you really have thought hard about it, including weighing the pros and cons, I don't think you would have made this decision. Since it's not the money, I don't understand why you want to quit? If it's the course, I think you still can appeal to change course.</p>
              <p>I cannot ask you to undo the decision. But this is the last time I'm telling/advising you this: THINK THOROUGHLY. Your decision does not only affect you, it will cause repercussions in the future or to those around you.</p>

              <p>as what Detached pointed out, this is the easy way out for u. and in the end, u fuck u.</p>
              <p>it's
                              instant gratification. it has a 5 year shelf life for a kid like u.
                              insouciance, on the other hand, will stick around longer, with heavier
                              consequences.</p>
              <p>yeah
                              sure u got abundant choices, up down left right and middle. but in
                              Life, the choice u make, the words u say, must remain intact, u must
                              Deliver what u promise urself. right now u didn't. u cut urself too
                              much slack, and in the near future, into adulthood, it becomes a Habit.
                              u fall into a pattern.</p>
              <p>i'm not preaching herd mentality to u - get a diploma, a degree and u'll survive in Singapore bullshit.</p>
              <p>but leaving school is too big a decision to make without u being Resolved in ur own mind.</p>
              <p>right now, u don't even know what u're gonna do before u even do it. that's half measure. that's a whole lotta weak will.</p>
              <p>right
                              now u can say, in the future i will do this. but become what? what
                              future? one day ur folks will depend on u to bring home the bacon. put food on the table.</p>
              <p>get some perspective.</p>
              <p>don't build the life u seek on poor foundation. for every bad move u make, the ripples spread further than u can imagine.</p>
              <p>(and i know i know... i could care less if u label me a long winded naggy auntie).</p>

              <p>I'll be blunt about this: I am very, very sick and tired of people who have romantic notions over quitting higher education and pointing to Bill Gates as a (cliched) example.</p>
              <p>Let me just say this: Bill Gates is an exception, and thousands of Tan Ah Kows and John Smiths who followed his example have burnt and gone kaput in the process.</p>
              <p>Pika: regardless of what you may say, no, trust me, you know <em>nothing</em> about the consequences of your actions. You have <em>not</em> thought about it thoroughly. You did <em>not </em>consider your alternatives and options properly. I thought I told you to talk it out with your academic mentor who can surely help you work through your issues. In the worst case scenario, you could have taken a semester off to work things out. Almost anything would have been better than just quitting.</p>
              <p>Like both soleachip and detached have pointed out, you don't even seem to have an exit strategy right now. Despite whatever romantic notions that you have about walking 'the long and hard path', the fact is that all you did was to walk off the straight and narrow path, with no firm idea of what on earth you're gonna do next.</p>
              <p>I'm really trying my best not to nag at you, but I've seen what happened to my cousins who became the wrong sort of PhDs (poly-halfway-dropouts). Long story short, one of them eventually got tossed in the brig over gangfights.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that that <em>will</em> be your future. What I'm saying is that I don't want to see anyone else wilfully throwing away a promising future.</p>
              <p>'Nuff said. I know that nothing I do can make you rescind your letter of withdrawal. But I do hope you will eventually wake up your ideas - sooner better than later.</p>
              <p>This is my last posting on this matter.</p>
