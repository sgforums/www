              <p>If you quit now and enlist, the highest rank that you'll likely get is that of corporal, and that's at the end. It means you're going to get less allowance.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned earlier, ease off on the work, or take a couple of days off to rest. 7-Eleven's suggestion about retaking your O-Levels to get into your preferred course is a good one as well. Whatever it is, you've got to study, research, read up and do your work properly in order to find it meaningful and interesting and make it productive. It's not going to fall into your lap without that.</p>

              <p>Pika, I hope you can see that we are not out to nag at you. What
              we are saying is that while we understand your situation, many of
              us have gone through pretty much what you are going through right
              now.</p>
              <p>What I can say is that tough as your studies may be, quitting
              poly will most likely make things even worse. A lot of doors are
              going to be closed to you, and the remaining open doors aren't all
              that great.</p>
              <p>Try throwing a rubber ball into the crowd at Orchard Road.
              There's a 50% chance that it will hit someone with a
              diploma/degree. There's another 50% chance that it will hit another
              diploma/degree holder on the rebound.</p>
              <p>Then the dude who picks up the ball will have a 50% chance of
              being another diploma/degree holder. Then when he angrily throws it
              back to you and misses, there's another 50% chance that it will hit
              yet another diploma/degree holder.</p>
              <p>I was exaggerating in the last two paragraphs.... but not by
              very much, either.</p>

              <p>Well,</p>
              <p>If you don’t like studying, then quit school. Go out and work and then go for NS. Many of my friends are not so well-educated and yet they turned out to be quite good.</p>
              <p>If you like studying but don't like the course, then you can always switch course, wasting one year is better than wasting 2 - 3 years...</p>
              <p>Seriously, there is no need to think about 10-20 years, personality and interest changes over time.</p>
              <p>Some of my friends previously not interested in studying suddenly become interested in studying now. Those who are degree holders some also did not fair as well as they should be. It really depends on people.</p>
              <p>There are other vocations like swimming coach ($3-4K), life guard ($1.8 -2 K), personal trainer ($1.8K - $10K), security ($1.2 K-$10K), bus driver ($1.8K-$3.5K)… which need certification, licenses but not qualification.</p>
              <p>The only problem faced by people who are less educated, they felt the lack of knowledge, emptiness in the mind, inferiority and lack of job satisfaction...</p>

              <p><br>On my part, I just don't want to see another poly-halfway-dropout case. Seen too many of that in real life. Quite a few of my cousins are such cases.</p>
              <p>Pika: in all seriousness, if you're having problems with your studies and personal life, then go and talk it out with your academic mentor or school guidance counsellor or someone like that. I'm sure your poly would have people like that who are in a good position to help.</p>
              <p>In the worst case scenario, shoot an email to a lecturer/facillitator whom you think you can trust. Ask him/her for some guidance. At the very least he/she can point you in the right direction.</p>

              <p>Pika, I hope you can see that we are not out to nag at you. What
              we are saying is that while we understand your situation, many of
              us have gone through pretty much what you are going through right
              now.</p>
              <p>What I can say is that tough as your studies may be, quitting
              poly will most likely make things even worse. A lot of doors are
              going to be closed to you, and the remaining open doors aren't all
              that great.</p>
              <p>Try throwing a rubber ball into the crowd at Orchard Road.
              There's a 50% chance that it will hit someone with a
              diploma/degree. There's another 50% chance that it will hit another
              diploma/degree holder on the rebound.</p>
              <p>Then the dude who picks up the ball will have a 50% chance of
              being another diploma/degree holder. Then when he angrily throws it
              back to you and misses, there's another 50% chance that it will hit
              yet another diploma/degree holder.</p>
              <p>I was exaggerating in the last two paragraphs.... but not by
              very much, either.</p>

              <p>well said ..</p>
              <p>I gotta agree with you on this.</p>
              <p>Should try to finish your poly studies and get a diploma ..Singapore is such a qualification country .. the minimum qualification will open enough doors for you to get started in your career .. </p>
              <p>Bear with it, take a break from work for a while and focus on your studies first. Nothing should be more important than finishing your dip!</p>
