              <p><em><span style="color: #999999;">Friday, June 12, 2009</span></em><br><br><span style="color: #008080;">New research by scientists at The Scripps 
              Research Institute and other institutions provides a close-up look at the 
              cone-shaped shell that is the hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
              revealing how it is held together—and possible ways to break it apart. 
              <br><br>Previously, scientists had known that the genetic material within HIV is 
              enclosed within a shell called the capsid, which is formed by a honeycomb 
              arrangement of about 250 hexagonal protein building blocks. For HIV to infect 
              human cells, the virus binds to cell surface receptors, and then the capsid is 
              delivered into the cytoplasm of the cell. <br><br>Now, in an advance, online 
              issue of the journal Cell published on June 11, 2009, Professor Mark Yeager and 
              colleagues at The Scripps Research Institute, the University of Virginia, and 
              the University of Utah describethe first high-resolution molecular structure of 
              the hexagonal protein building block, called CA, that makes up the HIV capsid. 
              This detailed description may help scientists identify new ways to block HIV 
              infection. <br><br>Bringing Down the Capsid <br><br>Since HIV/AIDS was first 
              recognized in 1981, several drugs and drug combinations have allowed infected 
              individuals to live longer and healthier lives. However, resistance to the 
              existing drugs has created an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. 
              <br><br>Current drugs target critical steps in the virus life cycle. For 
              example, protease inhibitors block the protein cleavages that generate viral 
              components—one of them being the protein CA. <br><br>Other possible ways to 
              block infection would be to prevent formation of the capsid by blocking assembly 
              of CA molecules or to find a way to disassemble the capsid once it is made. 
              <br><br>"Anything that destabilizes the capsid, either by inhibiting assembly or 
              accelerating disassembly should attenuate or even kill the virus," says Owen 
              Pornillos, an investigator in Yeager's lab and first author of the Cell paper. 
              <br><br>But to destabilize the capsid, it's necessary to know precisely how it 
              is held together. <br><br>Making Crystals <br><br>"No one had been able to 
              visualize the CA hexamer at atomic resolution," says Yeager. "Other groups had 
              been able to solve structures of individual regions of CA. But it was not clear 
              from these structures exactly how the CA proteins fit together." <br><br>To make 
              the capsid, sets of six CA protein molecules first form hexamers, which then 
              associate with one another to build a honeycomb-like shell comprised of about 
              250 hexamers. The ends of the shell are closed by insertion of seven and five CA 
              protein pentamers, yielding the characteristic cone-like appearance of the 
              capsid. <br><br>In 2007, Yeager's group managed to view the CA hexamers by a 
              type of electron microscopy in which the samples are quick frozen in buffers, 
              which preserves the inherent structure of proteins. That study provided the 
              first glimpse of how CA proteins are arranged in the capsid. (The first author 
              of the 2007 article was Barbie Ganser-Pornillos, Owen Pornillos' wife, who was 
              also involved in the current study.) <br><br>In order to view the CA hexamer at 
              even higher resolution, Yeager's group turned to X-ray crystallography. This 
              technique requires growing 3D crystals of a molecule and then scattering a beam 
              of X-rays off the crystals, which are recorded on a detector. Computational 
              methods are then used to interpret the scattering patterns to calculate the 
              position of every atom in the crystallized molecule. <br><br>But growing large, 
              3D crystals of the CA hexamer was no easy feat. The two ends of each CA protein 
              molecule are held together by a "floppy" bridge, which precluded formation of 
              orderly arrays of CA hexamers to form 3D crystals. <br><br>To overcome the 
              problem, Pornillos and Yeager turned to molecular biology. They engineered CA 
              proteins that would form sturdy chemical links between them, relying on the 2007 
              structure as their roadmap to determine exactly where to place the links. 
              <br><br>"Our work takes advantage of so-called hybrid methods—molecular biology, 
              biochemistry, electron microscopy, and X-ray crystallography," says Yeager. 
              "These methods are synergistic. The EM results guided the molecular biology to 
              engineer stable CA hexamers that were then amenable to 3D crystallization and 
              X-ray structure analysis at atomic resolution." <br><br>The structure they 
              obtained provided a view of the CA hexamer at an unprecedented resolution of 
              two-Ångstrom (one Ångstrom equals one ten-billionth of a meter). <br><br>A 
              Close-Up Look <br><br>All proteins are composed of linear chains of amino 
              acids—with one end called the N-terminus and the opposite end the 
              C-terminus—that are folded in three-dimensional shapes. In the CA protein, amino 
              acid chains are twisted into several rods, called a-helices, with 
              extensions—called side chains—that protrude from the main chain to interact with 
              other folded regions of the protein. <br><br>The two-Ångstrom structure showed 
              the positioning of these a-helices and, for the first time, the location of the 
              atoms in the side chains. "We could precisely delineate all the chemical 
              interactions that stabilize the hexamer," says Yeager. <br><br>The center of the 
              CA hexamer is formed by 6 N-terminal ends of the CA protein subunits. The 
              C-terminal domains form a "floppy" belt around this central core, connecting 
              adjacent hexamers. The fact that the belt is not held rigidly in place, helps 
              explain how the honeycomb shape of the capsid forms. "The curvature of the 
              capsid is not constant," says Pornillos. "Now we can see in atomic detail how 
              flexibility in CA makes this happen." <br><br>The group discovered another set 
              of interactions critical to stabilizing the capsid—connections between the 
              N-terminal and C-terminal ends of adjacent CA protein molecules in one hexamer. 
              "Think of the fingers of one hand as the N-terminal domain and the palm as the 
              C-terminal," says Yeager. "Imagine the fingers of one hand being cradled in the 
              palm of the other, and so on as if you had six hands in a ring." <br><br>Knowing 
              precisely how and where CA proteins interact gives researchers clues on how to 
              interfere with these connections. One approach is to design small molecules that 
              can insert themselves at strategic positions, impeding capsid assembly or making 
              the capsid less stable. <br><br>While finding HIV therapies is a main driver for 
              Yeager's work, he points out that it also provides fundamental insights into 
              biology. "Determining the assembly of a relatively simple structure like the 
              capsid of a virus can help us understand how more complex biological structures 
              inside the cell are organized," he explains. <br><br>### <br><br>Scripps
