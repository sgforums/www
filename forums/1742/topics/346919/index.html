              <p><strong>Singapore Badminton Association braces for next step</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE - Breaking the piggybank is usually the last option for
              any organisation. But with the very real possibility of ending
              FY2008/09 on March 31 in the red, the Singapore Badminton Association
              (SBA) have a hammer in hand, and they’re ready to dip into their
              reserves. <br> <br> Despite receiving over S$2 million from the Singapore Sports Council
              for the current financial year, rising costs have affected the
              association’s bottomline.
              <br> <br> “We could run into a deficit this financial year; it could be S$0.5 million,” said SBA chief executive officer Edwin Pang. 
              <br> <br>“The main reason for the shortfall is the loss in rental revenue
              when we moved out of the old Singapore Badminton Hall on Guillemard
              Road after our lease expired.” <br> <br> The SBA’s operating budget for this financial year is estimated to be
              S$4.5 million, including sponsorship deals and revenues from organising
              tournaments. Their total operating cost is currently estimated to be
              S$5 million. <br> <br> TODAY understands the SBA’s loss of rental revenue from Fatty Weng
              Restaurant and Health Spa to be around S$900,000, and the association
              currently pay rent for their office and training facility at the
              Singapore Sports School, where they moved to last January. <br> <br> “We also had to send players to many tournaments in the Olympics
              qualifying year, and paying the salaries of about 50 full-time players,
              coaches, sparring partners and support staff,” Pang added. <br> <br> As a result of the decline in revenue, the SBA slashed their overseas
              tournament budget for the current financial year to S$270,000, a 55 per
              cent drop from S$600,000 for FY2007/08. <br> <br> “The cut in the overseas tournament budget is a reflection of our
              financial prudence,” Pang explained. “Funds are limited. As such, we
              are always on the lookout for ways to reduce spending.” <br> <br> Despite the developments, SBA assured TODAY that the team’s
              preparations for the Laos SEA Games in December, and next year’s Asian
              Games in Guangzhou and the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, are on
              track. The SBA plan on sending national players to more regional
              tournaments. <br> <br> “We are fortunate as the standard of play in this region is high,” said
              Pang. “Our players can still get a high level of competition if we cut
              travel and accommodation expenses by sending them to more tournaments
              nearby. We are also allowing our players, with the agreement of the
              team sponsor, to source for individual sponsors who can help fund their
              travel overseas.” <br> <br> </span><strong>Eye on the future </strong><span> <br> <br> The national team have also been boosted by the return of Ronald Susilo and Jiang Yanmei, albeit in different capacities. 
              <br> <br> Former women’s doubles player Jiang, who retired last month, will coach
              the national juniors while Susilo was recently appointed assistant
              coach (part-time) to the men’s singles and national junior (10-12 years
              old) teams. <br> <br> Susilo, 29, is now playing badminton part-time in order to pursue his
              management diploma at SIM University and plans on retiring from
              competitive badminton next year. <br> <br> The SBA’s 10-strong coaching staff, led by technical director Zheng
              Qingjin, are now focused on cultivating the next crop of national
              shuttlers with the set-up of a national senior team 2, comprising
              graduates from the Singapore Sports School. <br> <br> A new quarterly internal ranking of national team 1 and 2 squad members
              will provide more competition opportunities for the players, said Pang.
              <br> <br> “Efforts to build up the next echelon of top national shuttlers is
              ongoing, and we’re also working with the Singapore Sports School,
              through our joint National Badminton Youth Academy, to develop our
              national youth players,” he added. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/ar </span></p>
