              <p><strong>futureGov, 26 May 2009, Crystal Low<br> </strong><br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore uses new media to boost recruitment</strong><br> </span> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has
              seen recruitment numbers for its police, civil defence and prison
              functions rise significantly this year, thanks in part to MHA’s use of
              new media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube to appeal to young
              Singaporean job-seekers. </span></strong><br> <br> More than 400 junior officers and 70 senior officers have been
              recruited by the ‘Home Team’ so far this year - a more than twofold
              increase on the same period in 2008. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>However, with a target of 1,500
              officers for the whole year, Second Minister of Home Affairs K
              Shanmugam said that the Ministry has “some way to go” to achieve its
              recruitment goals</strong></span>.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“We have to step up our efforts and explore all avenues to reach out to potential candidates,” said Mr Shanmugam.</strong></span><br> <br> Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)
              have been two of the more notable cases of government bodies embracing
              social media online in Asia. As for today (Tuesday May 26th 2009), SPF
              has 4,917 Facebook ‘fans’. SCDF has 1,040. <br> <br> --------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              I find it strange that at one end, MHA is screaming that their staffs are over stretched &amp; severe shortage of staffs in all line units.
              
              At the other end, tons of graduates and diploma holders are rejected or not shortlisted for VSC or regular appointments.
              
              Not sure what is happening to the recruitment process...

              My NS friend wanted to sign on as PO in 2003 after his diploma from Singapore Poly.  He maintained IPPT Gold all the way during NS and Pes A with perfect eyesight.  He surpass all the academic and physical criteria.  More importantly, he really like SPR work.  
              
              We though he has high hopes of getting the job or at least he can make it for the interview.  To our dismay, he was not even shortlisted at all for the SPF PO interview.  
              
              Anyway, he also applied to Prisons Service (2nd Choice) concurrently and he is a happy Staff Sergeant now.

              My friend does not have criminal record nor any sort of problem.  
              
              Yes, he is 26 years old when he apply but I never know that 26 years old is too old to apply for PO.  Besides there is not max age requirement stated in the brochure or SPF website.  SPF also have provisions for those who completed NS hence there is difference in pay structure.  Imagine a person who complete his NS &amp; join SPF should be abt 23-25 years old.
              
              He is accepted into Prisons at the same time &amp; he heard from Prisons recruitment that SPF dun prefer taking in ppl who complete NS.

              What I mean is simply there are too many qualified people who can be good police officers however due to whatever strange policies that SPF is adopting, recruitment always fall short of target.
              
              The shortage of police officers can be generally attributed to insufficient intake &amp; high turnover rate. The insufficient intake is mostly due to the hiring policies of SPF.  SPF seems to adopt a weird hiring policies whereby suitable &amp; interested people dun normally get the job.  As a result, a high turnover rate is result from these people who mostly choose to leave the force after 1st contract.
