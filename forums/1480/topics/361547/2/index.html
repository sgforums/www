              <p>I somehow agree alittle with wad singmarine says. But I muz say 1st is not because my application was unsuccessful so I agree with him somehow. But I really see quite a few this kind of example. Mr A who always really wanted to protect life and property maintain law and order perfectly qualified to be a PO did not get the police officer post successfully. But Mr B who only wan to join the force because of the pay wise and outside job the pay is lesser,</p>
              <p>SPF is juz a shelter to them after the contract they will definitely quit ,most of the time this people get the jobs. All I can say mayb MR A really wan to job so much that they screwed up the interview, and MR B thinking is even dont get the job is ok, so the interview turn out well.</p>
              <p>of course this is juz my own opinion and thinking.; if really wan to be a PO never give up unless your medical fails. definitely you will become one if u dont give up. I apply again. waiting for the interview date again.</p>

              You are right.  As a result of SPF whatever hiring policies, they seems to be taking in ppl who are looking for a temporary shelter or ppl who want to siam army hence sign on as ppl.  This cause insufficient intake &amp; high turnover for SPF!!   
              
              Besides, this matter happen 6 years ago &amp; I dun want to dwell into it further....
              
              Anyway wish you all the best..hopefully SPF will hire ppl like you who never give up coz it shows you really want to be a policeman!!!

              I dunno where you heard that a candidate will be given a 2nd or 3rd chance..any forumers can verify this statement?  Then may I know the basis of granting a 2nd or 3rd chance since you already screw up the panel??
              
              Though SPF spend so much time &amp; effort to conduct several round of test &amp; interviews for each applicant..does anyone agree that SPF really select the best candidate in the end??

            <div class='col-md body'><p>u went thru 2 panel interview I think is because the 1st interview the officer thought u could do better so they ask u go for another 1 to assess u better. It means that u didnt really screwed up the interview. yesh no interview is 100% fool proof, so they might miss recruiting pple who can be a Good Police Officer, no one is born to be a Police Officer, all needs experience. Anyway this topic wont have end. Those who want the post should continue to go for it. I will become one I believe. And I will never give up. Hopefully u can be a good officer throughout your career in SPF too :)</p></div>
