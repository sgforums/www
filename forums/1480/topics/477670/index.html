              <p>I had a run in with the police somewhere in April this year.</p>
              <p>Although there may have been some mistake on my part, I feel that the police response that I received was not only derogatory, but extremely rude, abusive and unprofessional.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the video, it shows how this police officer uses words such as "What the f***", "bloody idiot" and other worse hokkien vulgarities against someone who has not even been proven guilty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think that it is only right that they treat anyone whatever they may be accused of with some basic level of respect as a human being and not be treated worse than an animal. I don't think even animals have to endure such humiliation. It shames me to be a Singaporean with such people given the authority to police others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope to hear what you may have to say about the encounter by giving your feedback and comments!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Watch the video here and decide if such behaviour from the men in blue should be tolerated.</p>

              <p>Hey ArJoe</p>
              <p>Can you please make your own stand, one minute you were totally supportive of what coolboy90 said and even criticise on the officer. AND suddenly upon seeing what others wrote, you switch your stand 180 degrees and "edited" your comment above.</p>
              <p>What coolboy90 did was definitely wrong and im not saying what the officer did was very correct either. However, the intention of the officer was good and i can see where he was coming from, judging from the dialogue in the video. I admit that the officer could have handle it more professionally but i believe that the reason why the officer reacted in such a manner was purely out of his own goodwill.</p>
