              <p>Hi, I would like to hear how i can take minimum charges for this</p>
              <p>So here's what happened. I was drinking and clubbing with my friends at clark quey and i got really drunk. I don't even remember half of what happened until now. I took a cab by myself and went to some place that i don't even know, i dont remember telling any address for the driver but i remember getting in the cab. There was this building and i climbed over the fence and broke the glass window for some stupid reason. and then i got out of there went on to the road and tried to get a cab. while waiting for the cab i somehow fell asleep on the road. and a police officer comes and asks me for IC, i walked away and he asks again. I turn around and throw my phone at his face. and then the next thing i know they were arresting me. I was handcuffed to tanglin police station and held there for questioning and stuff.I dont remember throw my phone at the officer but thats what the inspector told me. and i was 16 at the time of the offence. and this is my first ever offence. I really dont know anything about lawyers and stuff. Do i need one? the inspector told me to just wait for his call to be summoned to court.</p>
              <p>PS. Im not a singaporean by the way.</p>

              <p>RTC is for everyone,locals and foreigners alike...just like our prisons.Whether U get to be sentenced there is another story.</p>
              <p>U were 16 at time of offence...now 17?</p>
              <p>what is ur current status?on bail or what?If on bail...U have a timeframe to go back and see the IO...he will let U know whether they are going to charge U...and do the paperwork.Throw phone at police officer...I take it as he is not injured...then its just a matter of whether they want to charge U with obstructing a public servant from carrying out his official duties...all I can say is gd luck...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my suggestion is to cooperate fully and if they really charge U...offer to repair the damages U made(windows,etc)...It will not get U off the hook...but it might make U look better with the judge.</p>

              <p><br>what r the charges that the IO has put up against u... from ur story it's either</p>
              <p>Mischief, Criminal Tresspass, Vandalismm, Using Criminal Force on Police officer or Drunk and Disorderly behavior... google for Singapore Statutes to see what r the max punishment for each.</p>
              <p>Ur best bet as i mentioned earlier is to plead guilty for offence with the less punishment</p>

              <p>RTC is for everyone,locals and foreigners alike...just like our
              prisons.Whether U get to be sentenced there is another story.</p>
              <p>U were 16 at time of offence...now 17?</p>
              <p>what is ur current status?on bail or what?If on bail...U have a
              timeframe to go back and see the IO...he will let U know whether
              they are going to charge U...and do the paperwork.Throw phone at
              police officer...I take it as he is not injured...then its just a
              matter of whether they want to charge U with obstructing a public
              servant from carrying out his official duties...all I can say is gd
              luck...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my suggestion is to cooperate fully and if they really charge
              U...offer to repair the damages U made(windows,etc)...It will not
              get U off the hook...but it might make U look better with the
              judge.</p>

              <p>I think i am currently out on bail. They didn't charge any money but just needed a local citizen to bail me out. The inspector is not giving me much information. He said that the window i damaged was a some foreign private school and the window was a very thick tainted glass. And i dont even know the name of the school. He also said that the officer was injured, his tooth was loose or something. He did not want to give me the officer's particulars as i wanted to apologise personally. And at first when i was out they kept my passport to keep me inside the country until the case was solved. But they returned it to me around this year march, i dont why. and they told me to stay in the country, if not they could put me in wanted list and track me down if i flee or something. this incident happened on last year june. i am currently gonna be 17. the inspector incharge of my case told me to wait for his call to be summoned to court. oh and they also took my blood sample to confirm that i was under the influence of alcohol when the offence occured.</p>
              <p>Thanks for taking to effort to for the post, and everyone else. Really appreciate it.</p>
              <p>Hopefully with this more detail, you can tell me what to expect? Thanks.</p>

              <p>u should have a case card or something w the IO's contact yah? give him a call to see how's ur case pending.</p>
              <p>think u don't worry so much.</p>

              <p>I think U are most likely out on bail....and in that case...U should have a piece of paperwork with the IO's particulars...ur bailor's particulars...and of course...ur particulars..it should also state whether U are expected to make regular appearances at the police station or whatever is the arrangement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case...just get in touch with the IO and ask for an update on the issue.close to 1 year already...I dun see anything wrong with asking...</p>
