HP may change already. Anyways, from that day on, I do not trust police, not only they are not working very hard, they are breaking the law themselves and getting away with it.  If they claim that they are luring the swingers by "being one of them" - then its entrapment. Just that the image in Singapore is good not like Malaysia. There are still increasing number of rape cases, con cases, traffic accidents on the rise and etc. So what exactly is the law enforcement doing other than being on Ops when the ministars fly.<br><br></div>

But you shouldn't taint everyone in the Police Force with the same brush, right? There will always be bad apples in every cart.<br><br>Well, in one HDB flat there will be about a few hundred people maybe? In a housing estate, there are more than a few flats. In a neighbourhood, there are more than a few housing estates.<br><br>For example, 1 flat = 100 ppl. 1 estate = 10 flats 1 neighbourhood, 5 estates.<br><br>And let's say that one NPC [neighbourhood police centre] is in charge of 1 neighbourhood. Add that to coffeeshops, shopping centres, roads, expressways, etc, and what you have is actually about 20 police officers on duty, to cover an area spanning 80 over square km, and having to ensure the safety of a few thousand people. All at the same time.<br><br>And this is just an example. Different police divisions/centres/posts deal with different settings. Like for example, the policemen in our neighbourhood and those based in orchard road. Different settings.<br><br>If you need to make report, they have counter personnel to generate reports for you. If they're on patrol, and there's an accident on the road, police must attend.<br><br>If snake found, also police . If got crime in progress, also the same. If crime already happened, same thing. Sometimes if people injured and SCDF ambulance come, you can see Police car coming too [cos I ahve seen it quite a number of times in my housing area].<br><br>So the Police actually do a lot of things you know.<br><br>But, sad to say, they don't have enough people lah. that's the main problem actually. A lot of things to do, but too little people.<br><br>Any police officers want to share their sentiments?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to also know that out of desparation to recruit, some guys who are not suitable are also in police force. I had met one quite trigger happy police. They were sent to the IT department for attachment. No one dares to tell the person to work.  Anyways, I used to work for MHA for a department the rest dislike.<br>Its not that I want to see police in this or that way. I've had some good experience as well but there are extremely bad encounters. Anyways for everyone, its just a job and the system is ...  good luck if you want to attract good people.<br></div>
