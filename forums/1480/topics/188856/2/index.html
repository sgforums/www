I know my results is really bad and is a very low chance to get into SPF. but.... really hope that SPF will accept me. My family encourage me to get a diploma first before joining, cause if i join now, the salary will be very low. but i really dont mind. I just wanna become a police officer. I had submitted a application form on april 13th. and still waiting for reply while continuing with my ITE studies.
