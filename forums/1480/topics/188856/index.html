            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I am a female, 17 going 18 this september, and hope that i could become a female PO. I only have a O lvl cert of C6 english, B3 Maths, B3 Chinese, C6 combined science phy/chem, D7 combined Human his/SS, D7 Food n Nutrition. I am now a higher Nitec Student in ITE.. But i would hope to join SPF now cause i am really keen to join. If SPF wants me, i will quit my ITE and take up part time diploma courses. I know my results is really bad and is a very low chance to get into SPF. but.... really hope that SPF will accept me. My family encourage me to get a diploma first before joining, cause if i join now, the salary will be very low. but i really dont mind. I just wanna become a police officer. I had submitted a application form on april 13th. and still waiting for reply while continuing with my ITE studies. Btw.. just now i went thru some thread and post, there are a lot of replies which demoralised me now.. haha. like dun even think of getting in with 3 O lvl credits. I only have 4 man!<br>So i post this just hoping to get reply with are encouraging and optimistic.~</div>
