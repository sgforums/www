              <p>Im so confused about whether i should pursue my career in the police or not.</p>
              <p>I am a specialist in SAF and will be ORD-ing in 6 months. I have a poly diploma. I am interested in police work because it seem very adventurous and exciting, lots of stories to tell. I would like to become an investigator some day.</p>
              <p>I have thought of becoming a police officer when i was younger in my secondary school days.. during my BMT, i went for the interview but was too late and was thus rejected. Now, i am 6 months from ORD and i am really confuse if i should sign on.</p>
              <p>However, there are many issues holding me back..</p>
              <p>1) I heard that the police forces is full of people wanting to leave. The force is full of people that simply don't care or feel proud of their job.</p>
              <p>2) If i sign on, i do not have a choice to choose my posting? i hope to go into land division and subsequently into C.I.D as a detective investigator.</p>
              <p>3) I intend to go for part time degree studies but i heard PO in the force does not bother to study part time because there is no point in obtaining a degree unless they are going to quit and work outside.</p>
              <p>This is because the conversion from PO to SO is almost <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NIL.</span></p>
              <p>Obtaining a degree as a PO is useless?</p>
              <p>SPF only want scholars to hold SO position and nuture them from young, work experience is insignificant?</p>
              <p>So basically if you join as an PO, you are stuck there forever.</p>
              <p>4) The system is cocked up, your promotion is based is up to your Team leader? and many team leader in the force has no integrity and pride, they just want to leave the force. So basicially if your team leader don't like you, you can forget about promotion and advancement. ( thats what i heard)</p>
              <p>5) Increment of salary is very slow.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I had really want to join the force, am willing to work hard and give my best but i do feel that i have to get realistic as i have parents to feed.</span></p>
              <p>I need advices and helps , becoming a police officer has been a dream and i do not want to regret making the wrong decision.</p>

              <p>1) people wanting to leave would have left.</p>
              <p>2) In the begining, not much choice. over time, if you reflect your request to your superiors, they will try to arrange for you. Investigating officer definitely need some ground experience first, so you will never start as one.</p>
              <p>3) If all PO can get a degree and become SO, than the police force will be full of SO.only the best of the best will have the chance.</p>
              <p>4) Your friends know many Team Leader or only know one Team leader?l</p>
              <p>5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If your objective is money go join something else</span></p>

              <p>Boy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you have a whole life before you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>are you really sure you will stick to a police carreer only?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>plenty of folks like you, dont dare to join spf outright, take on outside job or do their degree studies before applying into the the spf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you could do the same too.  Maybe take your degree and join the VSC.  When you see that you are ready to join SPF full time, then apply and join.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is too short to be worrying about stuffs you wouldnt even borther to think about in 5 years time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>heck.....we dont even expect you to stick to a g/f till you die.  So no point thinking too far along.</p>

              <p>skythewood, thanks for the advice..  i think that my friends are just too negative about the force and has been influencing me..</p>
              <p>Fatum, i have went for the interview, i was rejected because i went for the first interview too late in my BMT phrase, i was then told to try after i finish my NS. Btw, is it very hard to be selected?</p>
