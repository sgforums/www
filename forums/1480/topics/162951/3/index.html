Hence, vice versa, once you are in a supervisory role, it is always appreciated to have that human touch. Since you mentioned that you are a MPO, I assumed you hold a SO rank. Promogulating a "regular dislike VSC" is infectious. When your co-workers and subordinates (including newbies) also adopt such a view, I shudder to think of the consequences. Bottom line is, the cup is either half empty or half full. Take the good and make the best out of it.<br><br>In the second part of the posting, I cannot fully understand the message in the last 2-3 lines. Maybe you would like to elaborate on that.<br><br>Work hard and have fun as  a VSC <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
