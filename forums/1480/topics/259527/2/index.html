            <div class='col-md body'>it all boils down to how much you are willing to compromise on your ideals, i guess. we all have certain hopes and expectations, and give-and-take ensues once the reality of the situation [us joining the force] sets in [although i know most people give more to the force than take. and even get unappreciated for all their work like you mentioned  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> ].<br><br>i think, to be honest, most of the 4-digiters don't leave simply because they cannot afford to. most have families to feed now, and once they leave, they  find it hard to nail jobs outside because they have zero industrial experience.<br><br>all in all, the average age of the force is going down. JOs getting younger and younger.<br><br>but i suppose we all do what we can lah. i'm still of the opinion tha JOs run the force though. All SOs [at least, those direct entry ones] do is basically do IO for a couple of years and then scoot off into management positions, whether it is middle-management or senior management. their ground experience is limited to their two-year IO stint and another stint as team leader.<br><br>the ones who do the actual ground work, interacting with people, making ground-breaking, life-changing decisions, will always be ultimately us JOs.<br><br>it might not be measurable in monetary terms, but I suppose the pride in knowing that is a valuable item in itself.<br><br>at least, I feel that way. I hope most JOs share the same sentiment too, despite the trying times that we all face in the line of duty.<br><br>Cheers to all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
