              <p>I wonder if anyone is aware of suspicious activities in the first back alley along Kandahar Street , North Bridge Road. There are indonesians sleeping in the back alley and there are young women sleeping with them behind the shop houses. Sometimes they will sleep under the lorries parked in the alley. They seem to be hiding things along the side doors of Sultan Mosque. I have notified the police at Rochor NPC a few times. Those people who sleep there were gone for a couple of weeks. Now, THEY ARE BACK.</p>
              <p>There are always non-SDPC stamped cigarette butts on the ground and empty cigarette boxes without Warnings. The malay helper of the food stall at the entrance of Kandahar Street seem to be selling illegal cigarettes to others in the vicinity. At night, indonesians will come and make a niusance there. There are some black bins in the back alley where they keep their stuffs.  </p>
              <p>The first back alley at the entrance of Kandahar Street, which is also the back of Sultan Mosque leads to a dead end. I have seen police cars patrolling Kandahar Street, but I have never seen the police get out of the police cars and walk into the back alley to check out the activities there!</p>
              <p>There is a fat malay botak who has nothing to do with any of the shops there, yet he still loiter around the back of the shops. What can we do to chase him away?</p>
              <p>Are those people allowed to sleep on the streets or in the back alley behind the shop houses?</p>
              <p>Will the police put it in their agenda to patrol the back alley at least once a day after 11pm?</p>
              <p>What else can I do to stop them from coming into the back alley?</p>

              <p>you can notify all the various enforcement agencies about this matter.</p>
              <p>Singapore customs, to address the selling of non-duty-paid cigarettes.</p>
              <p>Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority, to see if these Indonesians are in Singapore with valid documents [i.e. not illegal immigrants or overstayers].</p>
              <p>the Police, to look into the area.</p>
              <p>PS: sometimes the Police are tied up in other incidents within their jurisdiction. Hence, they might not be there when you are watching, and / or they might be there when you are not.</p>

              <p>The only thing you can do is call for Police. It will be a cat-and-mouse game: sometimes those people will be there, sometimes they will move away [voluntarily or enforced]. Even when they have moved away, there is always a possibility that they will return, even after a large time lapse.</p>

              <p>for sleeping along the streets or back alleys, it will depend. Under the destitute persons act, the police can take the person into custody to be referred to a welfare home, provided they have no means of subsistence, etc. For people who might be loitering and awaiting opportunities to committ crime, there are laws that can be used to deal with them as well.</p>
              <p>essentially if you asked me, sleeping in public is more of a safety concern lah. basically because:</p>
              <p>1) you don't want vagrants sleeping in the streets. should they have no genuine means of subsistence, they should be referred to the relevant authorities.</p>
              <p>2) if people actually do have homes, etc, it'd be bset to not sleep in public, as you will actually be more prone to crime than you realize [with thefts from your person being the main one].</p>
              <p>Unlawful assembly usually consists of five or more people. But some conditions must be met first. Under section 141 of penal code:</p>
              <p><strong><strong>Unlawful assembly</strong></strong><br><strong>141.</strong> An
              assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an “unlawful
              assembly”, if the common object of the persons composing
              that assembly is —</p>
              <dl>(a)
              to overawe by criminal force, or show
              of criminal force, the Legislative or Executive Government, or any
              public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public
              servant;</dl><dl>(b)
              to resist the execution of any law,
              or of any legal process;</dl><dl>(c)
              to commit any offence;</dl><dl>(d)
              by means of criminal force, or show
              of criminal force, to any person, to take or obtain possession of
              any property, or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right
              of way, or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which
              he is in possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right;
              or</dl>
              <p>(e)
              by means of criminal force, or show
              of criminal force, to compel any person to do what he is not legally
              bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do.</p>
