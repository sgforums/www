As long as you indicate to the recruitment officer that you want to go PCG and you are selected.<br><br>2. You will not be able to sign up for SPF scholarships to sponser your part-time degree. There are SPF sponsered degree and diploma courses, but you can to fufill certain criteria, eg. yrs in svc, performances etc to be selected.<br><br>3. Yes<br><br>4. Depending on your leader/supervisor, you may be allowed to leave early to attend classes. However, be warned, if you are posted to PCG patrol unit, don't think there is chance for you to leave early. can you imagine the boat making a trip to shore just to let you get down? Unless you want to swim back to shore yourself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
