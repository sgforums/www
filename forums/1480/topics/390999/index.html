              Hi,
              
              I am new in this forum.
              I am here to share a question to all of the forumers here.
              My question is to check whether is it foreign worker like blangadesh allowed to come into the residence garden park area and the hdb lobby in the evening time.
              
              I have recently walk pass through fernvale area, seng kang west zone.  A groups of blangadesh worker after work as usual like to go down the fernvale blk 412b and 413b area to sit at the garden park benches and when they saw maids or single ladies they will try to follow them to their hdb lobby area.
              
              My question is to ask can residence like me alone can question this worker why are they so late still in the hdb estate area instead of their own hostess area.  Three groups of construction worker staying very near to the fernvale vicinity area. One of the construction company is chip eng seng construction pte limited and while the others i cant see clearly where they are from and all 3 construction site workers are all stay in the fernvale construction site and it is very near to the residence area.
              
              A walking path is being constructed and it lead the way to the bus -stop area. Very funny every night the walking path street light areas come to night automatic black out.  This again endanger the fernvale residence especially single ladies and  maids be it go for marketing or return late from their work.  The groups of blangadesh like to follow them and even all the way to see where the maids and single ladies stay and got chance try to molest  them when no one saw.  Most of the blangadesh like to go ntuc and pass their hp number to the new maids and this young blangadesh are very naughty thinking of get maids to have sex with them if the owner not in.
              
              Can the residence act as a checking officer on this blangadesh and ask them to leave the fernvale area if they find very unwillingly to leave this area.  Due to the fact my friend and me are not a police officer and we would like to find out will the mobile police patrol can patrol fernvale 408ato 409a, 412a and 413a. This forum of the thing said are all truth.
              
              Can anyone in the SPF given me a definite answer.
              Thank You

              Hi gasband
              
              Sir, thank for your prompt reply.
              This is not true, according to the working act cap. Worker are not allow to loiter around the hdb vicinity area if they are not the residence members.
              
              They are supposed to be housed in their hostess area and be official book in b4 2300 hrs if you are not sure can check with those worker work in other construction site like jurong or yew tee areas.  This construction company had a good leadership command and control on their foreign worker.
              
              As you know, the worker had to wake up early to start their daily routine work and if they are loitering so late hours and suddenly touch wood not enough sleep and do the work sloppy and worst still fell down from the construction site. Blame who our government or the construction boss this is becauses the construction site supervisor or management had not done a proper safety precautions measures.
              
              I still think the only way to prevent thing happening in singaporean especially the hdb or landed properties area.  Foreign worker applied to all only those on construction site should be house in their hostess area b4 2300 hrs.  There is no reason they should come out this time to do like rape women or molest residence people or maids.  
              
              We must be strict to them and they must obeying our rules and regulations.
              
              I am sure singaporean citizens like you and me would like to see thing go smoothly and safety and our police force should have concentrate more on others theft or drug cases.
              
              Had anyone in the forumers got any other better ideas to suggest.
              I am open up to all suggestions.
              Thank You

              <p>what you just asked was extremely racist. you treat foreign workers as another class of human below yours. if i were the police, i would arrest <strong>you</strong> instead.<strong> </strong>aparthied was wrong, and it's over. if they're engaged in illegal acts, of course you're entitled to call the police. but if they're just spending time there and only you think they're about to commit crimes, you deserve a lesson with ISD.</p>
              <p>regarding the book-in rule, individual hostels have their own rules, and if they don't follow it, it really isn't the police's business, just like it isn't illegal to break school rules.</p>

              <p>To TS, if you feel unsafe, report it to your TC. Let them handle this case. Usually those blangla dont distrub pple, they just wanna have a place to sit, relax and drink with friends. If not never cause any trouble, let them be. If goes out of hand, report to police.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am new in this forum.<br> I am here to share a question to all of the forumers here.<br> My question is to check whether is it foreign worker like
                      blangadesh allowed to come into the residence garden park area and
                      the hdb lobby in the evening time.</p>
              <p>I have recently walk pass through fernvale area, seng kang west
                      zone. A groups of blangadesh worker after work as usual like to go
                      down the fernvale blk 412b and 413b area to sit at the garden park
                      benches and when they saw maids or single ladies they will try to
                      follow them to their hdb lobby area.</p>
              <p>My question is to ask can residence like me alone can question
                      this worker why are they so late still in the hdb estate area
                      instead of their own hostess area. Three groups of construction
                      worker staying very near to the fernvale vicinity area. One of the
                      construction company is chip eng seng construction pte limited and
                      while the others i cant see clearly where they are from and all 3
                      construction site workers are all stay in the fernvale construction
                      site and it is very near to the residence area.</p>
              <p>A walking path is being constructed and it lead the way to the
                      bus -stop area. Very funny every night the walking path street
                      light areas come to night automatic black out. This again endanger
                      the fernvale residence especially single ladies and maids be it go
                      for marketing or return late from their work. The groups of
                      blangadesh like to follow them and even all the way to see where
                      the maids and single ladies stay and got chance try to molest them
                      when no one saw. Most of the blangadesh like to go ntuc and pass
                      their hp number to the new maids and this young blangadesh are very
                      naughty thinking of get maids to have sex with them if the owner
                      not in.</p>
              <p>Can the residence act as a checking officer on this blangadesh
                      and ask them to leave the fernvale area if they find very
                      unwillingly to leave this area. Due to the fact my friend and me
                      are not a police officer and we would like to find out will the
                      mobile police patrol can patrol fernvale 408ato 409a, 412a and
