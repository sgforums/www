Yes but very few. OCT, IMO, will not let you experience your SPF life, as they tend to be posted to do office duties due to their rank.<br><br>2. After BPT you'll get posted to different units where you will receive more specialised training. (Eg. SOC go SOC course, NPCO go NPCO courses etc) Progression will depend on your appraisal 9-12mths after you POP and get sent to your unit. Prior to your promotion you'll go for a 1 week course after which you'll most probably have your Sgt rank.<br><br>3. IPPT you'll need a silver to be qualified for the more interesting vocations.<br><br>Whatever you do, don't apply for the Field Instructor post, which will make you miss out on the ground life.<br><br>NPCO will be fun if you like to experience the real world, where drug addicts, kiddy bengs and illegal immigrants will be your prey.<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Only SCDF and SAF allow NSF commisioned officers to sign on without a degree.<br><br>And for some inexplicable reason, becoming an SPF SO has a rather high number of applicants.

            <div class='col-md body'>well your BPT will be ard 13 weeks.. followed by your vocation course's eg soc , sso , npco , etc.. since u have a dip most likely u will get ur sc/cpl rank when u pass out from hta.. anyway npco will be a interesting vocation and also you will get to know what happens on the ground..chasing after drug addicts, catching illegal immigrants..etc</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup. i personnaly feel that the most enriching experience will be the npco path.<br><br>and do take note: for diploma holders, you only get your sc/cpl rank if you have a minimum of a pass in english.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm NPCO sounds fun...<br><br>Talking about driving license, i already have my class 3 so there is a conversion course right? who is eligble for the conversion, NPC officers only? And i've never really seen a CPL driving around unless its like to ferry those CSOs in the vans. So if i have a license, will i be 'misused'? Its ok if you don't want to answer the last part  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Pass in english as in O levels or is there another test conducted?<br><br>You all say that after my BPT i'll be most probably promoted to CPL, why most probably only, any specific criteria i have to meet first?<br><br>Thanks again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
