              <p>Hello guys , was just wondering how do I apply to serve my 2
              years of NS as a policeman ? What can be done to change from Army
              to SPF ? And no I'm not trying to go SPF to run away from NS . I
              want to make it as my career in future . I was thinking it would be
              better to spend the 2 years learning the drills and things a
              policeman should know rather than Army. This is also to save time
              :o any ideas ??<br>(Ps last post was in the wrong forum)</p>
