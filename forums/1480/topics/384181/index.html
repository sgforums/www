              <p>he can counter back whatever u say, saying the 750 u transfered to him was to return him money u 'owed' him.</p>
              <p>and since there was no form of IOU signed, i think it's rather hard for u to get it back by calling the police.</p>

              <p>He wasn't asking about the possibility of charging the person successfully. The issue on evidence is separate issue under criminal procedure, and the investigator might be able to obtain a confession with the right interview techniques.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>However, in order to proceed with a criminal case, the concern is whether the person committed an offence in the first place. If you look at Penal Code section 415, the incident must satisfy 2 criteria:</p>
              <p>(i) Act of deliver property/consent to retain property/act or omission that causes injury (harm to body, mind, reputation, property) or won't occur if the victim was not deceived</p>
              <p>(ii) Intention of the accused at the time of the act involved deception to dishonestly (wrongful gain/loss) or fraudulently induce (i)</p>
              <p>If the intention of not returning the money does not coincide with the time of the act, Cheating is not the appropriate section to apply. There might be other relevant sections like Criminal Misappropriation of Property.</p>
              <p>The other alternative is to proceed as a civil case rather than a criminal case. In a civil case, you need to engage your own lawyer to seek compensation for the tort. In a criminal case, the prosecution will seek punishment for the offence but you might not receive any compensation.</p>
              <p>You might wish to seek legal advice from proper channel if so desired.</p>

              <p><br>1) It can amount to cheating if the intention of not returning the money is present at the time of borrowing.</p>
              <p>2) There is no such offence as fraudulent debtor. If you are refering to a civil suit, the plaintiff does not lodge a report against the defendant, but initiates litigation to seek compensation for a tort.</p>
              <p>Please refer to my post above. Cheers :)</p>

              <p><br>1) It can amount to cheating (criminal offence) if the intention of not returning the money is present at the time of borrowing.</p>
              <p>2) There is no such offence as fraudulent debtor. If you are refering to a civil suit, the plaintiff does not lodge a report against the defendant, but initiates litigation to seek compensation for a tort. You may still record statements at a police station, but the police does not have special powers of investigation to summon witness, compel the defendant to record statements etc.</p>
              <p>Please refer to my post above. Cheers :)</p>
