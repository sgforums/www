              <p>Although dis Malay S Sgt seems quite a silly clown: "'I did not know 
              what to do,' he said in court", I still think that he should be rewarded
               for his honesty at not accepting the $50 and eventually bringing his 
              bad subordinate (and the other 4 who accepted $50) to justice, unless 
              there's more to his "unauthorized raid"- (See next post for trial 
              outcome or [<a href="http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4285016">link</a>]).<br> Me finds it sad that 5 in 6 policemen in this case were 'corrupt', n if 
              not for the S Sgt refusing the $, they'd have been like the govt mafia 
              conducting "unauthorized raids", robbing other bandits in the dark 
              corners of Singapore.<br> Pls give Staff Sergeant Zulkifli Mohamad some sort of promotion for his 
              'arrest' of 5 corrupt policemen even though he quite IMHO bungled his 
              (illegal) raid on the illegal foreign worker hic. talent.<br> <br> Perhaps our police are trying too hard to 'earn their keep' and satisfy their bosses.<br> Perhaps our junior policemen need a pay increase along with more on-job 
              training- so they can better recognize contraband cigarettes- and not 
              get caught out smoking them themselves.<br> <br> References:<br> - [Reuters: 5Apr2007]:  "'If we don't do that ... corruption will set in

                       to $100,000 and/or a jail term of up to five years on each of the five 
                      corruption charges against him.<br> It all started after a raid at a forested area off Seletar Range on Jan 
                      24, 2008. The prosecution said that the raid itself was unauthorised but
                       during the operation, the illegal immigrant was arrested.<br> Tay's group leader, Staff Sergeant Zulkifli Mohamad, accused Tay of 
                      handing out the contraband cigarettes at a birthday party later that day
                       - at a police station.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli testified yesterday, on the first day of Tay's trial.<br> Even though he knew what was inside the package, Staff Sgt Zulkifli admitted he said nothing.<br> "I did not know what to do," he said in court.<br> This, despite saying a group leader should "act as a mentor" to his colleagues.<br> The men had been working together for about five months in Team Delta in Ang Mo Kio North Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC).<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli said Tay had taken out the pack of contraband 
                      cigarettes while they were seated at a table in the rest area at Kebun 
                      Baru Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) between1pmand 1.30pm.<br> Also present were two other officers, Special Constable Ng Han Long and 
                      Corporal Muhamad Hazim, who were also named as targets of the bribes.<br> That was their official rest period.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli said Tay showed them a carton of Texas 5 cigarettes, about 40cm long, unopened in clear plastic wrapping.<br> He said it looked to be contraband. Unlike cigarettes sold here, the 
                      cancer advisory was missing from the cigarette boxes Tay showed them.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli said he had asked Tay where he got the carton from. 
                      That's when Tay said it came from the "forested area" and he intended to
                       give it to an NSman who was having his birthday that day as a present. 
                      So what did you say to Tay, asked Assistant Public Prosecutor S Puspha.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli said he could not recall if he replied or not.<br> But he thought the cigarettes should have been seized instead.<br> This was when Tay took out $50 and offered it to him, he told the court.<br> He claimed Tay asked him if he would "keep quiet" ifhe took the money.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli said he responded by asking him what he meant by offering him money.<br> "He replied that the illegal immigrant had a lot of money, and he had $300, enough to share with everyone," he said.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli added he did not see the $300, and he did not know if the money came from the illegal immigrant.<br> He said he saw Tay then wrap the carton of illegal cigarettes with old newspapers in the rest area. Money for cake<br> He said he eventually took the $50, passed to him by Constable Ng, but 
                      said that he accepted it only to buy a cake for the party.<br> He returned the money afterwards.<br> At around 3pm to 4pm, he went to the canteen in Ang Mo Kio North NPC, 
                      where the birthday celebration for the NSman was being held.<br> This was after he settled another case.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli said he saw that the birthday boy had a rectangular 
                      box wrapped in newspaper, similar to the shape of the contraband 
                      cigarettes.<br> Tay's lawyer Victor Yip, asked him why he didn't prevent the contraband cigarettes from being given as a gift.<br> Staff Sgt Zulkifli told the court: "I did not know what to do because 
                      what Sgt Tay was doing was wrong, and I knew if I were to bring the 
                      matter up, he may face consequences."<br> He accepted Mr Yip's statement that after an arrest is made, there should be an account given of the items seized.<br> Then why his hesitance?<br> "Because Tay is my colleague and it is different from other cases where an arrrest was made," he said.<br> <a href="mailto:lianyi@sph.com.sg">lianyi@sph.com.sg</a><br> This article was first published in The New Paper.<br> <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20100420-211457.html">http://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BNe...20-211457.html</a></p>

              <p>But the raid was 'unauthorized' to start with...</p>
              <p>ST (print)- 21Aug2010 says other 4 cops who took $ "not charged"</p>
              <p>XinMSN says " will be dealt with at a later date. "</p>
              <p>Now defense lawyer seems to argue that the $ was not bribe but their 'rightful' shares of the 'loot'- a determined (%) share distributable by prior agreement amongst all members of the "unauthorized raid", so trying to throw mud at prosec witness- Staff Sergeant Zulkifli Mohamad et al. So its like a circus like dat in court I guess.</p>
              <p>Think the appeal would be interesting. Press should get more wind about police 'ECAs'- they are bored n too free....</p>
              <p>So dunno what the outcome is after &gt;1 yr since incident occurred.</p>
              <p>Must incr Jr Police pay and up their training opportunities I feel...</p>
              <p>That said, Staff Sergeant Zulkifli Mohamad should at least keep his job even if he's too clown for a promotion(only if the SSG passes a lie detection test) .</p>
              <p>Questions remain if his 'initiative' is recognised.</p>
              <p>His other options for work include VWOs, since he must have had much experience w the 'rough n tough' in society (spends his free time conducting unauthorized raids) or as security manager at an MNC where perhaps his personal initiatives might be better appreciated then within the 'stifling'  civil service police force.</p>
