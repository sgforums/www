              <p><strong>MANGKOK GUIDE TO SPF ENLISTMENT</strong><br><br>Thought since I had some time to kill before going to sleep I'd write this for all the people who are going to enlist in SPF for NS, now and in the future.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Things to bring/wear on enlistment:</span></strong><br><br>- Wear a decent shirt &amp; jeans for oath taking<br>- A pair of running shoes*<br>- 10 days worth of underwear and clothing suitable for PT (including socks)*<br>- Extra jeans in case your No.3/Walk-out attire is issued late<br>- Singlets (At least 3)*<br>- Qualification certificates<br>- Pen &amp; paper<br>- SHAVER, DEODERANT* &amp; other toiletries<br>- A basket that you can hang for your toiletries (very important)<br>- $30 worth of $1 coins (for laundry &amp; drinks)*<br>- A COMBINATION lock*<br>- Kiwi &amp; lint-free cloth*<br>- 8 hangers at least (if you like being neat, if not 6 will do)<br>- Plastic bags for storing your used clothes (there will be a lot)<br>- A torch light*<br>- An extra battery<br>- Some snacks if you want*<br>- An iron* (the OB room has, but a lot of demand once you are issued your uniforms.)<br>- Ear plugs*<br><br>* indicates this is not mentioned in the enlistment letter.<br><br>_You will not be issued any items for a few days, inclusive of running shoes. If you don't wear running shoes you'll be doing PT in whatever you brought, which is not fun at all. Following the initial issues you will find that you will need to change several of your items, and be without them for some time._<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information</span></strong><br><br>Surrender all your cigarettes, lighters and chargers. You will be confined if caught. This is not just a threat, it is true. One of my bunkmates is sleeping in HTA on his own right now. Do not worry you will get them back at the end of your _10 DAY CONFINEMENT_<br><br>Confinement is for 10 days irregardless of whether you are in prep course or fit squad. There is no such thing as waiting for the fit squad before confinement.<br><br>There are partitions in the shower room. You will not be seeing any wild birds.<br><br>Every bunk holds 10 men. Do not bring an over-sized bag on enlistment day because you will be issued an SPF bag. You do not want to try stuffing two large bags into your cupboard, because the FIs will expect you to do that.<br><br>The FIs in HTA are mostly not unreasonable people. If you keng they will know. At the same time, if you are genuinely ill/injured, they will _most certainly understand._ My personal suggestion is you do not try to keng, or you will be marked and confined if found to be on light duty too many times.<br><br>Shave everyday or you will definitely die a horrible death.<br><br>The laundry rooms in all coys are generally heavily used at night. If you want to do your laundry at night, get your clothes and dump it on a washing machine. Make sure you wait for the person whose clothes are being washed to collect his or yours willl be dumped on the floor. Alternatively you can wake up at 5 am and do your laundry - my personal recommendation. The machines take $1 coins, as do the drink vending machines.<br><br>DO NOT WALK OUT OF YOUR COY WITHOUT PERMISSION. If a roll call is done and you are absent, you can be charged for AWOL. This is NOT a light charge.<br><br>You will be punished as a squad. Do not think you can get away with being selfish. You will be punished even if you have done nothing wrong. It is your responsibility to make sure your squad mates do nothing against the rules.<br><br>There is a certain way to iron your uniform. The FIs will tell you this but you do not want to be the squad to wait for this to happen. Make sure there are ZERO creases on your shirt or trousers. The lines must be VERY visible. For your trousers make sure the line ends somewhere at the groin area, on both the front and rear.<br><br>Choose your bed carefully. Always choose the bed in the middle. Never choose the bed at the end of the bunk because all the dust will collect there. Do not choose a bed near the door because when people go to toilet you will wake up. The bed in the middle is the best because you will always have two fans blowing at you.<br><br>Choose your squad IC very, very carefully. If you get an incapable squad IC, be prepared to hear the following very often:<br><br>"WHY YOUR SEDIA SOUND LIKE BIRD SHIT!?"<br>"WHOLE LOT OF YOU TO YOUR RIGHT ON YOUR PALMS DOWN!!"<br>"TOO SLOW! ON YOUR FEET UP! TO THE LEFT ON YOUR PALMS DOWN!"<br>"WHEN I SAY DOWN YOU GO DOWN WHEN I SAY UP YOU COME UP UNDERSTAND MANGKOK???"<br><br>For the unintiated, "to the left/right on your palms down" means push up position 45 degrees in the specified direction.<br><br>I suggest you cut your hair before enlistment. Make sure you cut it extremely short. If you let the barber cut your hair, your hair will stick to your skin and you will feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable before you get to take a bath/wash your hair in the evening.<br><br>CAMERA PHONES ARE ALLOWED IN HTA. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ANOTHER PHONE BEFORE ENLISTMENT.<br><br>There is a recreation room in every coy. Use it.<br><br>Bring an alarm clock, you will need it.<br><br>Coming from a mangkok himself, I hope this guide helps all the future mangkoks enlisting in SPF. If any of you feel like adding to it, go ahead and do so. I should say this is all the information I wish I knew when I enlisted but didn't. All this will make your 10 day confinement and subsequent first few weeks a much more enjoyable time I believe. Cheers!</p>

              <p>(Frack.....so expensive for those rides now.  My 3 year old neice was bleeding me dry with those rides.</p>
              <p>And cannot say dont let that gurl or nephew (5 year old) have their rides......Thank goodness they are returning to USA soon.)</p>
              <p>Anyway, been quite regular see that uncle servicing those rides.  At the moment, I am left $150/- of $1/- coins.  And they are sitting there n my drawers.</p>
              <p>When you guys need to change for them, let me know.  I trust I wont charge you bank rates.</p>

              <p><strong>MANGKOK GUIDE TO SPF ENLISTMENT</strong><br> <br> Thought since I had some time to kill before going to sleep I'd
              write this for all the people who are going to enlist in SPF for
              NS, now and in the future.<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Things to
              bring/wear on enlistment:</span></strong><br> <br> - Wear a decent shirt &amp; jeans for oath taking<br> - A pair of running shoes*<br> - 10 days worth of underwear and clothing suitable for PT
              (including socks)*<br> - Extra jeans in case your No.3/Walk-out attire is issued
              late<br> - Singlets (At least 3)*<br> - Qualification certificates<br> - Pen &amp; paper<br> - SHAVER, DEODERANT* &amp; other toiletries<br> - A basket that you can hang for your toiletries (very
              important)<br> - $30 worth of $1 coins (for laundry &amp; drinks)*<br> - A COMBINATION lock*<br> - Kiwi &amp; lint-free cloth*<br> - 8 hangers at least (if you like being neat, if not 6 will
              do)<br> - Plastic bags for storing your used clothes (there will be a
              lot)<br> - A torch light*<br> - An extra battery<br> - Some snacks if you want*<br> - An iron* (the OB room has, but a lot of demand once you are
              issued your uniforms.)<br> - Ear plugs*<br> <br> * indicates this is not mentioned in the enlistment letter.<br> <br> _You will not be issued any items for a few days, inclusive of
              running shoes. If you don't wear running shoes you'll be doing PT
              in whatever you brought, which is not fun at all. Following the
              initial issues you will find that you will need to change several
              of your items, and be without them for some time._<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General
              Information</span></strong><br> <br> Surrender all your cigarettes, lighters and chargers. You will be
              confined if caught. This is not just a threat, it is true. One of
              my bunkmates is sleeping in HTA on his own right now. Do not worry
              you will get them back at the end of your _10 DAY
              CONFINEMENT_<br> <br> Confinement is for 10 days irregardless of whether you are in prep
              course or fit squad. There is no such thing as waiting for the fit
              squad before confinement.<br> <br> There are partitions in the shower room. You will not be seeing any
              wild birds.<br> <br> Every bunk holds 10 men. Do not bring an over-sized bag on
              enlistment day because you will be issued an SPF bag. You do not
              want to try stuffing two large bags into your cupboard, because the
              FIs will expect you to do that.<br> <br> The FIs in HTA are mostly not unreasonable people. If you keng they
              will know. At the same time, if you are genuinely ill/injured, they
              will _most certainly understand._ My personal suggestion is you do
              not try to keng, or you will be marked and confined if found to be
              on light duty too many times.<br> <br> Shave everyday or you will definitely die a horrible death.<br> <br> The laundry rooms in all coys are generally heavily used at night.
              If you want to do your laundry at night, get your clothes and dump
              it on a washing machine. Make sure you wait for the person whose
              clothes are being washed to collect his or yours willl be dumped on
              the floor. Alternatively you can wake up at 5 am and do your
              laundry - my personal recommendation. The machines take $1 coins,
              as do the drink vending machines.<br> <br> DO NOT WALK OUT OF YOUR COY WITHOUT PERMISSION. If a roll call is
              done and you are absent, you can be charged for AWOL. This is NOT a
              light charge.<br> <br> You will be punished as a squad. Do not think you can get away with
              being selfish. You will be punished even if you have done nothing
              wrong. It is your responsibility to make sure your squad mates do
              nothing against the rules.<br> <br> There is a certain way to iron your uniform. The FIs will tell you
              this but you do not want to be the squad to wait for this to
              happen. Make sure there are ZERO creases on your shirt or trousers.
              The lines must be VERY visible. For your trousers make sure the
              line ends somewhere at the groin area, on both the front and
              rear.<br> <br> Choose your bed carefully. Always choose the bed in the middle.
              Never choose the bed at the end of the bunk because all the dust
              will collect there. Do not choose a bed near the door because when
              people go to toilet you will wake up. The bed in the middle is the
              best because you will always have two fans blowing at you.<br> <br> Choose your squad IC very, very carefully. If you get an incapable
              squad IC, be prepared to hear the following very often:<br> <br> "WHY YOUR SEDIA SOUND LIKE BIRD SHIT!?"<br> "WHOLE LOT OF YOU TO YOUR RIGHT ON YOUR PALMS DOWN!!"<br> "TOO SLOW! ON YOUR FEET UP! TO THE LEFT ON YOUR PALMS DOWN!"<br> "WHEN I SAY DOWN YOU GO DOWN WHEN I SAY UP YOU COME UP UNDERSTAND
              MANGKOK???"<br> <br> For the unintiated, "to the left/right on your palms down" means
              push up position 45 degrees in the specified direction.<br> <br> I suggest you cut your hair before enlistment. Make sure you cut it
              extremely short. If you let the barber cut your hair, your hair
              will stick to your skin and you will feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable
              before you get to take a bath/wash your hair in the evening.<br> <br> CAMERA PHONES ARE ALLOWED IN HTA. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ANOTHER
              PHONE BEFORE ENLISTMENT.<br> <br> There is a recreation room in every coy. Use it.<br> <br> Bring an alarm clock, you will need it.<br> <br> Coming from a mangkok himself, I hope this guide helps all the
              future mangkoks enlisting in SPF. If any of you feel like adding to
              it, go ahead and do so. I should say this is all the information I
              wish I knew when I enlisted but didn't. All this will make your 10
              day confinement and subsequent first few weeks a much more
              enjoyable time I believe. Cheers!</p>

              <p>some other things- <br><br><br>never use eye-power whenever an FI is around.</p>
              <p>fill up bottles to the brim at least 10 mins before water parade (to avoid getting f*cked, but it would still happen anyway)</p>
              <p>never fall asleep anywhere outside your bunk</p>
              <p>refrain from shouting in your bunk</p>
              <p>do not argue,bargain or complain</p>
              <p>those in PES BP squads should NOT buy drinks from the vending machines or bring food in (except some sweets or biscuits)</p>
              <p>do not hang your underwear outside</p>
              <p>to dry clothes quickly, hang them on the clothesline near the wash area. on a hot day, a soaking wet t-shirt would dry up and be as hot as if it was ironed in an hour</p>
              <p>take a bath whenever possible</p>
              <p>do not wake up too early (5.10am is the best) ; try to sleep right after night water parade</p>
