              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A businessman charged with receiving S$1.4 million in
               stolen electronic goods alleged in court on Monday that he was tortured
               by the police for four hours.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Ong Su Ping, 33, 
              claimed he was forced to drink urine and had a toilet brush placed in 
              his mouth. He also alleged that used underwear was placed on his head 
              and he was assaulted on his private parts. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In response to media
               queries about the allegations, a police spokesperson said it takes "a 
              serious view" of all complaints made by accused persons against officers
               and will investigate all such complaints thoroughly. <br><br>The 
              spokesperson added: "The allegations made by Ong Su Ping are currently 
              being investigated by the Internal Affairs Office, a department formed 
              in August 2011 to conduct independent investigations into complaints and
               offences involving SPF's officers. If criminal offences are disclosed, 
              the Police would not hesitate to bring criminal charges against the 
              errant officer. <br><br>On a related note, the Police warns that if the 
              allegations are found to be false, appropriate actions in accordance 
              with our laws will be taken against any persons who furnish false 
              information to the Police, which is an offence under Sec 182 of the 
              Penal Code Cap 224."<br><br>The offence is punishable with a maximum 
              jail term of one year, or with a fine of up to S$5,000, or both. "As the
               case involving the accused (Ong) is currently before the Courts, it is 
              inappropriate to comment further at this juncture," the police 
              spokesperson said.<br><br>Ong and Lee Peng Chou, a freelance courier, 
              are said to have been given the stash, including 1,930 Apple iPads and 
              1,464 iPhones, which had been stolen from the Dnata cargo terminal in 
              Changi Airfreight Centre.<br><br>They were arrested by airport police on
               October 2. More than 2,000 pieces of the stolen devices are believed to
               have already been shipped out of the country. <br><br>The two men face 
              one count each of dishonestly receiving stolen property, and another of 
              assisting in the disposal of the stolen items. <br><br>They will be back in court on October 17.</span></span></p>
