              <p>ok true story here .................</p>
              <p>(fat and ugly) chinese, female 41 has at least 30 reports, filed by 25 people who do not personally know each other, against her for stalking/harrassment. She goes/calls workplace saying that they 1.owe her money   2. promised her marriage 3. are stalking her 4. have "harmed her in some way or other all not true. </p>
              <p>Now each and every time this happens the police (believe it or not ) take her side ..... believing her because he plays on the "i know I am fat and ugly" so they automatically assume that she is the victim when she is actually the perpetrator. </p>
              <p>This has been going on for over 10 years now, the only reason I know this is because my co-worker was also one of her targets and we did a background check on her, 1.  through an policeman friend  2. calling all the previous churches she had attended, this girl is a serious trouble- maker .</p>
              <p>Not once was anything done besides a civil court hearing, to stop her, no arrest, no warnings, nothing ................... so if you are fat and ugly , you  are LEGALLY ALLOWED to stalk and harrass people????</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think the woman you mentioned above most likely have contracted mental illness. Like you say she stalked people for marriage( haven't even enter any relationship with that person at all), claiming that people are stalking her when there's no ppl stalking her, it is most likely that she's suffering from strong delusional thoughts or mental illness that makes her believed and 'imagined' things that are not true in fact. :-X</p></div>

              This is seriously more than mere annoyance. It violates into the privacy of a person's life, imagine you have a girlfriend you love very much and this girl harress you and spread lies like you both have sex before or something, then because of such nonsense you lost the girlfriend whom you love very much...
              
              Not to mention the gossips if things go around in the office...
              
              I was just surprised the police never do anything, because last time when i played soccer at the basketball court, they sent 3 police cars down, these clown jokers so called policeman, i call them clowns coz they got guns and they so scared, need to call backups all 3 cars come to face 11 teenagers playing soccer...

              <p>..........What an eccentric woman. Doesn't she has anything or a job to do meh? She's so free to go down to your office everyday ar? Doesn't she thinks that it's a waste of time and transport money? lol. If she needs attention badly, she should join Star Search competition. This woman definitely has a weird ass thinking I cannot fathom. Since the police is not taking any action, did they advise you to seek help from a lawyer. The last time I came across this newspaper article similar like the situation above. The victim who got harassed seek help from the lawyer. And this butch who harassed the victim has being sued by the victim's lawyer in the court and the final verdict is either paying fine or going to jail for some months. There are some certain matters police cannot take action, you should seek advise about the legal proceedings and discuss this with a lawyer. I believed that a lawyer can help to process a lawsuit against this person.</p>

              <p>I tell you SPH will sure publish the story even if there is not even evidence. That is how they work and I have tried it before. SPH is only interested in making money so they will publish as long as the story is interesting and can attract people to buy the newspaper to make money</p>

              <p>..........What an eccentric woman. Doesn't she has anything or a
              job to do meh? She's so free to go down to your office everyday ar?
              Doesn't she thinks that it's a waste of time and transport money?
              lol. If she needs attention badly, she should join Star Search
              competition. This woman definitely has a weird ass thinking I
              cannot fathom. Since the police is not taking any action, did they
              advise you to seek help from a lawyer. The last time I came
              across this newspaper article similar like the situation
              above. The victim who got harassed seek help from the lawyer. And
              this butch who harassed the victim has being sued by the
              victim's lawyer in the court and the final verdict is either paying
              fine or going to jail for some months. There are some certain
              matters police cannot take action, you should seek advise
              about the legal proceedings and discuss this with a
              lawyer. I believed that a lawyer can help to process a lawsuit
              against this person.</p>

              <p>hi, i happen to be from one of the SPH papers that yall have mentioned here.</p>
              <p>if we do have a first-person account from at least five of these people who have been harrassed, we are very likely to run it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think it's terrible that nothing can be done about it.</p>
              <p>those who were harrassed didn't take any videos etc?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>would appreciate it if i could be put in touch with "just vic here"s colleague. it'd be a good starting point.</p>

              <p>Come come...I also share a story.</p>
              <p>I got this female collegue of mine.  Chinese, divorced with a daughter with her.</p>
              <p>She not bad lah.  Fairly well educated, drives a small car, owned a condo apartment and in a decent enough job.</p>
              <p>Got to know this guy who is supposed to be fairly rich and is a businessman.  They got together, and even register to become business partners.</p>
              <p>She claimed that he started to abuse her verbally and some physically, likes slaps or roughly grabbing her arms here and there.</p>
              <p>Then hor.  Her mother got sick, and she was overwhelmed with paying for the medical bills and tries to sell her condo before the condo will be siezed.  He went and put in caveats, not once, but twice, claiming that she owes him money.  And his intention is for her to marry him, then he will help.</p>
              <p>Anyway, she got upset, and breaks up with him. But he has been following her around, demanding to talk to her, or threaten her to show up for a marriage soloemisation ceremony he arranged.</p>
              <p>And he has been calling us at the office, with comments that she refused to answer her hp and he is her hubby or that her hubby is trying to locate her blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>The best part, is, he even pretend to be some concerned person that tells us that she was been harrassed and stalked.</p>
              <p>She finally made police reports and the recent one, we found out, that he so lucky go to the same police station as she did, to make a missing person report on her.  Lucky the officer at the counter already got his name and details and refused to let him make that police report since its false.</p>
              <p>Some people just have a lot of obsession and time.</p>

              <p>There will always be these kind of persons around.</p>
              <p>The moment you get upset with them, the  more they will be doing these stalking things.</p>
              <p>Just change your numbers or request the telcos to change the numbers and keep track of what the stalker been calling from or how.</p>
              <p>Make sure family members and  other people are aware of their presence.  The more you try to hide the facts that you are stalked, the more people will think you got a reason to being stalked.</p>
              <p>The most defeating emotional attack on the stalker is to treat them like they do not exists.  Just be careful, to simply ignore them and not provoke them further with ridicules.</p>
