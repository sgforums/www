              <p>Concerned, my wife called the police. <br> <br>When no officer arrived after about 20 minutes, she called another police station and was advised that they were informed of her report and would send officers to check. <br>After an hour, and with no sign of the police, my wife called the police to ask why they hadn't come.</p>

              <p>Dear Ed 11790.</p>
              <p>Your claim of police in the USA reacting quickily so as to provide the impression of complete efficiency is regretfully unture. Each system has its flaws and lack of resource. I know of civil suits against local police for taking over 90mins to respond to a 911 call by a  rape victim. Amazingly, although the operator had assured the victim of assistance, no officer arrived and it was later revealed that a police station was "jsut round e corner"</p>
              <p>I am certain that officers in all countries, be it Spore or USA, try their best in fulfilling all their duties.</p>

              sometimes police resource was being used up by those stupid calls. Something like someone playing at the playground causing alot of noise and i cant sleep, demand police to do something about it. if not would complain. where the call came in around 10am in the morning on a sat. If police dont go, kana complain, go already not enough resource to attend other more important cases. so at the end of day, who's fault??
              the person who anyhow call police or police attending cases slow??
              think about it.
