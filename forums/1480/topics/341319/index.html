              <p>currently serving my ns 6months more to ord.had a career talk by prison warden tat time and had some questions i nid to ask frm fellow lao jiao here.</p>
              <p>my educational level was higher nitec and my entry rank would be corporal.i heard tat the average time to promote to sergeant is 4 years and since i served ns,it will be around 2 years b4 i promoted to sergeant according to the inspector frm prison.i was wondering if the system of SPF was similar as prison service.</p>
              <p>i was told tat prison officers had no police power outside prison.is it true for CNB also?</p>
              <p>i was told tat a private diploma will nt be recognized by spf unless it leds to a degree.however if i fail to convert to SPO,my degree is as good as "wasted".tats wad the inspector frm prison said so nid to confirm here.</p>

              <p>1st qns. Promotion frm Corporal to Sergeant. Promotion is much based on performance and your ability. The average period of promotion is 3-4years.</p>
              <p>2nd qns. Prison Officers Power. As said from their position, they are Prison Officers, their authority is different from Police Officers.</p>
              <p>3rd qns. CNB. As said from their position, They are Narcotics Officers, their Authority is different from Police Officers and General Policing.</p>
              <p>4th qns. Private Diploma. SGT Entry Officers should have a A lvl, Local Polytechnic Diploma for NAFA Diploma. According to what i know, other qualifications will be looked on at a case by case basis and may be recognised as long as the modules/time spent is same as Local Polytechnics(I may be wrong)</p>
              <p>5th. You signed on as a Police Officer and will be on the Police Officer Scheme and will be graded based on your rank and Scheme rather than your subsequent education qualifications. Should you be converted to Senior Police Officer, then you will be graded under the Senior Officer Scheme.</p>
              <p>6th. If you have further queries, call up SPF straight.</p>
