              thanks for replying SGT Tan:):)
              
              i feel like calling up the recruitment officer. but not sure if i should though. cos i just went for my medical on 30th may. kinda too soon right? 
              
              are you waiting for a response from them too? or you already gotten yours?

              <p>Hi </p>
              <p>I went for SA in april and medical in early May. Got a call from the recruitment side at the end of May asking me when i can start, to prepare the remaining documents that i have yet to submit and he will notify me soon. Any idea what is the process after this ? When should i submit my documents? What is the possibility of me getting selected into the force? Thanks in advance!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Welcome,I am waiting as my application is undergoing its final processing. For Pokish, take your time as even if you call the Recruitment Officer,he or she is unable to tell you the inside details. They will normally process on what they can and if you have outstanding documents,they will ask you to submit the outstanding documents like your educational certificates/transcripts etc as if you owe them your educational cert (For example,you apply  with a Diploma but  you are yet to get your cert), they are unable to process it further. Normally if you have went through the medical checkup and they ask you for your outstanding documents,you should be more or less accepted into the Force.For the medical checkup requested by SPF,it is not early to do so as they do have a date if you noticed on the letter.The medical checkup is the final checkpoint for the process.Cheers.</p></div>

              Hmmm, so far they haven't contact me yet about the remaining documents yet... so i'm guessing i'm pretty much sitting on the fence eh? 
              
              ahhh. hope they will contact me soon. the waiting game is so torturous. 
              
              When did you go for your SA? i went on May 13. They take so long to process!! :(

              well, i think you should wait for their call, or maybe you can call and ask? 
              
              are you a female patience90? :) 
              
              anyway after u went for your medical checkup, did you call them and ask for the results??

              Patience90 : haha, i am too! :D and i'm guessing you are born in 1990? :D i think you don't have to worry, most probably you are in already. damn, wouldnt it be cool if we enter together? haha. do you think its possible? 
              
              Semper: from what i know there isn't a fixed intake. i think they will send people in once they hit the required number for a batch. not sure about it though. 
              
              Tmhobenjamin: i heard if you waited for a long time for their reply after your medical, high chance you are selected.
