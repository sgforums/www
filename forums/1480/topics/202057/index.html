            <div class='col-md body'>Hey all. I'm really new to this particular forum, but i have a couple of questions for you guys.<br><br>I currently have a diploma (in law) and wish to serve my NS in something related, either the SPF or the PROVOST unit in the Army. I feel that being in a related vocation will serve well in retaining all i learn and putting a hands-on practical use of my knowledge.<br><br>Since i'm NS bound, i'm thinking of signing on to earn enough for my overseas education (in the UK). I figured that i'd save everything i earn in the police force for 5 years. A 3 year LL.B would amount to about 100k in Singapore Dollars.<br><br>How much would that accumulate to? Any ideas or suggestions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Martin,<br><br>It wont be a good idea to do that. I'm not sure of your purpose to join SPF! But i certainly feel that SPF needs people who are serious and not because of money purposes or perhaps some to escape National Service. I will never want to respect those kind of people!<br><br>Initally when they get enlisted they get excited and after months past they get bored and do silly stuffs which make the reputation of SPF tarnished... So you will get people complaining smoking la, eat snake la and whatever excuse....<br><br>Seriously i am quite sad with some of the officer's attidtude. I had a bad experience with 1 from my NPC here. too bad there is noting i can do even if i complain will that help? --&gt; get a scolding and promotion affected? than he will go on being worst?<br><br>Its basically mentality and that cant be changed.<br><br>If you have that mindset of earning money thru spf i strongly suggest not! Just serve your ns in where ever CMPB post you and go find apprentic job in the law firm if u are interested. And be trifty in your expenditure during your NS! you can save alot during training tho.... incamp 5days....<br><br>- Well take care whatever your decision maybe!<br><br>- CheeRs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I'm not sure of your purpose to join SPF!</blockquote>I'm looking at the SPF because I know that since i'm NS bound and if I do sign on, i'll be working in a related field. (though only loosely related)<br><br>It's not that i'm all in it for the money, or that i'm not serious. I have to say, I do have passion for the law and it's counterparts serving to uphold or enforce it. It is something I know I can do. I'm not discouraged because i'm also earning for my further studies, or that i'm not planning to make a career in the force. I'm trying to be a realist and not an idealist.<br><br>I could be a signal specialist in the army, a tech specialist in the navy, or a weapon specialist in the air force. But none of them suit my passion for the law as close to the spf.<br><br>What sort of persons would qualify as a respectable police officer if not someone who wishes to put his heart and knowledge into his work?<br><br>Thanks for the advice though, and all the info.<br><br>I'm very sure i'll take note of them during my NS!<br><br>Cheers!</div>

Honestly, it has been my ambition to study overseas and do well by my own effort. I want to earn my way to study so I will not take the costs for granted. I am discouraged by your reply simply because I know you guys have been through NS and have had the experience to tell me. I had hoped that perhaps me spending time to ask a few question could help me decide on the right vocation. Guess not then.

Its possible if you dont sleep well and suffer in that 5 years....  unless you found a job that earns at least 3k...  well...  enough said...   you can still post quires if doubt about SPF, and i am SURE others will be glad to reply to your quries...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
