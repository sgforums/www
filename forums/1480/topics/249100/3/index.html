            <div class='col-md body'>its nt about your passion. Maybe they have a reason to reject you 2 years ago. Move on to a new job. if u wish 2 be a civil servant that much, u may wish to persue a career in CNB or SPS or ISD or ICA.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ISD is part of SPF I think, so if you cant get into SPF, then you surely cannot get into ISD.<br><br>But CPIB, thats under PMO.</div>
