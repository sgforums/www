            <div class='col-md body'>as a NSF....i have my fair share of friends who r in the SPF. There will certainly be people who are unsatisfied with the job, but there are also people who love the job deeply. Its all down to your own interest and perception of individual matters which will then decide whether u r suitable for the job. Do not take up any job just becoz u wan to have money at de end of the month, but take up the job becoz u will benefit u urself frm the job scope itself. there are people who are 16+ in SPF.</div>
