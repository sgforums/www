            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>Need some help from any POs. here.<br><br>Am curious of what may happen to me. Today as I was leaving my workplace at Jurong Point,got this guy tried to shoplift from the electronics shop I'm working in as a promoter. I gave chase,tackled that guy to the floor with my other colleagues. A plain clothes security officer also came while my colleagues restrained him with raffia we got from the shop. While tackling him, I had wrapped my arm around his neck before pulling him down and making him prone before sitting on him to prevent his escape.The shoplifter tried to swipe at my leg and I pressed my foot on his hand to prevent him from swiping my leg while waiting for more colleagues to arrive and assist in tying/restraining him. It took about 6-7 of us including the security guard before he was subdued.<br><br>While still proned, the shoplifter kept shouting that he can sue me for injuring him and that he wanna report police that we are illegally confining him and assaulting him. But i was concerned with my safety as well as my colleagues as he is a relative large fella, and he was also struggling to break free. Was formerly from NCC,and just reacted to training i used to had. The shoplifter was then led away by the security guard and the shop's branch manager.<br><br>Am alittle worried now,if the shoplifter presses charges, will I be prosecuted or whatever?As I am just trying to prevent him from escaping. Please PM me ur responses...thanks...am really pretty shaken about the incident as it happened so quickly and its my 1st time encountering such an incident.Thanks!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It happened v.quickly,one moment i was heading out the shop,the other i heard hurried footsteps and the sensors at the entrance/exit point sounding and i just reacted. By the time he was prone, one hand was under him, the other was still out, and he was trying to swipe me, so i just stepped on his hand to immobilse it.<br>And when my colleagues came to assist, they pulled his arm from under him quite forcefully and immediately pressed on kneeled on it.<br><br>The shoplifter also spat at the manager.We did not punch or kick him or whatever.We just pressed him even harder before some of my colleagues tied him up with the raffia.<br><br>Nonetheless,am still slightly worried.Coz i read from earlier postings that if someone attacks and u retailate,police will charge both.<br></div>
