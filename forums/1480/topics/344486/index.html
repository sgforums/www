              <p>Anyone knows any info regarding this branch? I am currently

              <p>From what I read in SPF Annual, I think they are part of the CID

              <p> not really...   if you are considering to stay at TCFB... its almost impossible.... as there are no civilian post there......</p>
              <p>CIB/TCFB is just like any other branch....  you will be transferred evantually....  being a police officer, be it PO or SO, they will be posted within the police force in order for them to gain exposure.....</p>
              <p>but of cos, if you are joining as a new officer.... your path will be :</p>
              <p>PO - 6 mths training, to land division or specialist(1-2 yrs) then you will have a chance to apply to CID/TCFB.....  but of cos there are cases that after your training you will be posted to CID/TCFB...</p>
              <p>SO - 9 mths training, to land division to be Investigation officer(1.5 to 2 yrs), to NPC to be Team Leader(1.5 to 2 yrs).... then you can apply for CID/TCFB</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in a nutshell....  wat stated above might not be what will happens too.... So if you are really interested...  when you are applying for to join SPF, let the interview panel knows you are interested in CID/TCFB and see what they can advise u....</p>

              <p><br>Its something like that, you missed out the training, ippt part, but yes, thats roughly the way to go, especially if they know you do have a interest and the ability to work in that field.</p>
              <p>Your career path is not just merely restricted to the SPF though, there is other branches of the Home Team &amp; Ministries that will be interested in you.</p>

              <p>Thank you anfuni and everyone for your replies.</p>
              <p>I have no problem with the SO training, because that is the
              pre-requisite. But if I had to go through the posting rotation, by
              the time I go to TCFB, all the knowledge I have now will be
              irrelevant. However I think I will give it a try and email to SPF
              career and ask them.</p>
              <p>How about the cut-off age for SO application? I will be 33yo by
              the time I graduate. If there are such 'mature' recruits, have you
              heard of any problems during training esp regarding the fitness
              level?</p>
              <p>I am not too keen on non-uniformed postings. The kind of work
              and recognition you get is totally different. I might as well join
              an auditing firm in the private sector.</p>

              <p>You are a SO first and foremost. TCFB posting is secondary. Given your speciality, they might fast forward your posting to TCFB branch, but than again, i am not the guy who decides.</p>

              <p><br>The cut off age is 35 years old.  And there had been VSC officers that join SO training and was posted to SO positions just shy of their 35th Birthday.</p>
              <p>And its not necessary that they be VSC officers first, before joining the regular SO trainings.</p>
              <p>Yes, fitness is everyone of us older folks problem, but the officers prepare for the physical demands of the training with regular jogging, gym &amp; exercise.</p>
