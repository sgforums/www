              <p>SINGAPORE - A maid was fined $2,600 on Friday for stealing a
                       handbag and other items from five shops at Nex mall at Serangoon 
                      central, a day before she was to return to India to get married.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times reported that her former employer paid the fine for
                       her, explaining that she was a "good person who did something foolish, 
                      and I wanted to help her to move on in her life".</p>
              <p>The incidents occurred on Nov 14 last year. At about 4.15 pm, an 
                      Isetan store employee saw Sandeep Kaur, 32, carrying a handbag worth 
                      $49.90 out of the store without paying for it.</p>
              <p>She was stopped outside the store, where the other items, including a sweater and costume jewellery, were found on her.</p>
              <p>When arrested, Kaur admitted to stealing the items, which amounted to $255.</p>
              <p>Her former employer, a businessman, bailed her out and allowed her to
                       stay at his home. Kaur, an Indian national, had been due to return 
                      to her home country for good and her work permit had been cancelled.</p>
              <p>The court heard on Friday that Kaur had never shopped alone, after working in Singapore for seven years.</p>
              <p>Her lawyer, Mr S.S. Dhillon, added that the incident has also 
                      embarrassed her family in Punjab, as the marriage had to be postponed at
                       the last minute.</p>
              <p>Mr Dhillon asked the judge to impose a nominal fine as she is a 
                      first-time offender and the value of the stolen items were not high. </p>
              <p>District Judge Low Wee Ping said he could not understand why she 
                      committed the offences on her last day here, but noted that she had been
                       working dilligently for the past seven years.</p>
              <p>According to her former employer, Kaur would be returning to India today.</p>
              <p>The maximum penalty for theft is a three-year jail term and a $10,000 fine.</p>

              <p>Mon, Jul 25, 2011<br>The New Paper<br><br>HE FOUND his patient to be a bright and promising young woman.<br><br>So when she was put on probation for shoplifting, Dr Tan Chue Tin, 61, gave her a job - to keep an eye on her and to help her stay out of trouble.<br><br>Dr Tan, who was her psychiatrist, even had one of his nurses accompany her on her trips from the MRT station near her home to his clinic at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre. That was in 2005.<br><br>Sadly, his patient Goh Lee Yin, 30, who is unemployed, re-offended. In December last year and in February, she stole a Chanel bag, a Gucci dress and an Emporio Armani sweater.<br><br>While out on bail last month, she nicked items such as women's magazines, plastic containers, shower cream, canned fruit and jelly powder.<br><br>Yesterday, she was jailed six weeks and fined $4,000 for three charges of theft in dwelling after pleading guilty in May. Another similar charge was taken into consideration during sentencing.<br><br>The sentences were backdated to her remand date of June 25.<br><br>This is the same woman who had twice escaped a jail term on appeal.<br><br>In 2005, she made legal history when then Chief Justice Yong Pung How set aside her 21/2-month jail term and placed her on probation for two years.<br><br>But she stole again - filching luxury handbags this time - while on probation in 2006.<br><br>Justice V.K. Rajah's judgment for her appeal the next year was another legal landmark. The prosecution had appealed for a longer jail term than the one day's jail and $8,000 fine ordered by the district court.<br><br>But Justice Rajah disagreed and placed her on 18 months' probation instead.<br><br>Yesterday, Dr Tan told The New Paper over the phone that Goh was "actually a wonderful person" whom he felt deserved a second chance.<br><br>"If you know her well, you'll find that she's a kind, gentle person who cares for people," he said.<br><br>Poor self-esteem<br><br>She sought him out after she was arrested for stealing, then let off with a conditional warning in 2004. The year before, she was also caught and given a conditional warning by the police.<br><br>Dr Tan had diagnosed her as suffering from kleptomania, an impulse control disorder.<br><br>Goh had suffered from poor self-esteem since young and often had suicidal thoughts. She did well at school, scoring a PSLE aggregate of 257.<br><br>She attended CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School, Anglo-Chinese Junior College and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).<br><br>But she had difficulty getting along with her peers and teachers.<br><br>She also had a strained relationship with her mother, a former cleaner in her late 60s who had worked to put Goh and her elder sister through university. Her sailor-father, who was often away, died when she was 17.<br><br>For a few months in 2005, Goh worked part-time at Dr Tan's clinic, earning $10 an hour, until she found a new job.<br><br>"I didn't need an extra person working for me, but I could see that she was an intelligent young lady with good potential. So we created a job for her, to do computer work since she's good at it, to help her build up her self-esteem," he said.<br><br>Before her stint at his clinic, Goh, who graduated with honours in computer engineering from NTU in 2004, was a software programmer with Singapore Airlines.<br><br>Help from others<br><br>Dr Tan is not the only person who has helped Goh.<br><br>CJ Yong had put her on probation as he felt jail would only worsen her condition. Her case was considered unusual because in three previous cases of theft by kleptomaniacs, all had been jailed.<br><br>He said that it was easy for him to "bump" her into jail, but felt that she had a problem which "cannot be resolved by this form of punishment".<br><br>Justice Rajah had also viewed that a jail term was not the best solution for Goh.<br><br>"I am persuaded that (Goh's) rehabilitation for the present will be best continued outside of the prison walls," he had said then.<br><br>He credited her for trying to overcome her condition and stay clean for a year. Her relapse was "an unfortunate blip" in her otherwise successful treatment programme, he said.<br><br>Goh's sister, then an engineer,, and her mother had also rallied around her.<br><br>After she was hauled to court in 2005, they drew up a supervision plan: There was a daily timetable she had to follow and a guarantee that there would always be someone around to ensure she took her medication and to help her resist the urge to steal.<br><br>Walking with her<br><br>This included her sister walking her from their home to the MRT station at 8am every day before being met by Dr Tan's nurse.<br><br>After work, her then-boyfriend's father, a doctor whose clinic was also at Mount Elizabeth, would take her home. On Sundays, she would shuttle between church and home.<br><br>Her loved ones were again key figures in 2007. Negative comments at her temporary job as a conference coordinator at Mount Elizabeth had depressed her and triggered her stealing spree, leading to the shoplifting charges.<br><br>Her family, then-boyfriend and his doctor parents crafted another 24-hour supervision plan to minimise chances of a relapse.<br><br>It was this "army of caregivers", as described by the prosecution in 2007, that formed an exceptional support network for Goh. Yet their hopes for her were dashed by her stealing spree last year.<br><br>In her mitigation, Goh's lawyer, Mr Choo Si Sen, said she had lost her job after she was charged in March.<br><br>For theft in dwelling, she could have been jailed seven years and fined on each charge.<br><br>Shoplifting history<br><br>April 27, 2005: Stole an $83 skirt from a Ngee Ann City boutique.<br><br>May 12, 2005: Stole an $80 haversack, 167 hangers, two bottles of wine, two bottles of lotion, one towel, two bottles of wine cooler, worth about $233, from two stores in Bishan.<br><br>May 16, 2005: Stole 18 boxes of shaving cartridges, one razor, eight packets of insoles, one skin file and two boxes of dental floss worth some $306 from a Thomson Road supermarket.<br><br>Stole body shaving system valued at $90 from a department store in Orchard Road.<br><br>Stole four bottles of sun care lotion, each valued at $45, from a department store at Paragon shopping centre.<br><br>August 2005: Jailed 21/2 months by district court. Appealed against sentence.<br><br>Oct 15, 2005: Stole four pairs of earrings valued at $70 in total from a department store at Wisma Atria.<br><br>November 2005: On appeal, jail term set aside by then Chief Justice Yong Pung How. Two years' probation, with stringent conditions, was ordered.<br><br>Nov 20, 2006: Stole $375 wristlet clutch bag from Coach boutique at Raffles City Shopping Centre.<br><br>Stole Louis Vuitton denim handbag valued at $1,960 from LV boutique at Raffles Hotel.<br><br>When caught, she was also found with a $143 blouse, a $39 handbag and a $56 handbag, for which she was charged with fraudulent possession.<br><br>May 2007: Fined $8,000 and jailed one day by district court. Prosecution appeals.<br><br>Nov 29, 2007: Appeal dismissed. Further 18 months probation ordered for breaching the original probation order.<br><br>February and December 2010: Stole a $4,790 Chanel bag, $3,200 Gucci dress and $610 Emporio Armani sweater.<br><br>May this year: Pleaded guilty to two shoplifting charges, with one similar charge taken into consideration.

              61, gave her a job - to keep an eye on her and to help her stay out
              of trouble.<br> <br> Dr Tan, who was her psychiatrist, even had one of his nurses
              accompany her on her trips from the MRT station near her home to
              his clinic at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre. That was in
              2005.<br> <br> Sadly, his patient Goh Lee Yin, 30, who is unemployed, re-offended.
              In December last year and in February, she stole a Chanel bag, a
              Gucci dress and an Emporio Armani sweater.<br> <br> While out on bail last month, she nicked items such as women's
              magazines, plastic containers, shower cream, canned fruit and jelly
              powder.<br> <br> Yesterday, she was jailed six weeks and fined $4,000 for three
              charges of theft in dwelling after pleading guilty in May. Another
              similar charge was taken into consideration during
              sentencing.<br> <br> The sentences were backdated to her remand date of June 25.<br> <br> This is the same woman who had twice escaped a jail term on
              appeal.<br> <br> In 2005, she made legal history when then Chief Justice Yong Pung
              How set aside her 21/2-month jail term and placed her on probation
              for two years.<br> <br> But she stole again - filching luxury handbags this time - while on
              probation in 2006.<br> <br> Justice V.K. Rajah's judgment for her appeal the next year was
              another legal landmark. The prosecution had appealed for a longer
              jail term than the one day's jail and $8,000 fine ordered by the
              district court.<br> <br> But Justice Rajah disagreed and placed her on 18 months' probation
              instead.<br> <br> Yesterday, Dr Tan told The New Paper over the phone that Goh was
              "actually a wonderful person" whom he felt deserved a second
              chance.<br> <br> "If you know her well, you'll find that she's a kind, gentle person
              who cares for people," he said.<br> <br> Poor self-esteem<br> <br> She sought him out after she was arrested for stealing, then let
              off with a conditional warning in 2004. The year before, she was
              also caught and given a conditional warning by the police.<br> <br> Dr Tan had diagnosed her as suffering from kleptomania, an impulse
              control disorder.<br> <br> Goh had suffered from poor self-esteem since young and often had
              suicidal thoughts. She did well at school, scoring a PSLE aggregate
              of 257.<br> <br> She attended CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School, Anglo-Chinese Junior
              College and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).<br> <br> But she had difficulty getting along with her peers and
              teachers.<br> <br> She also had a strained relationship with her mother, a former
              cleaner in her late 60s who had worked to put Goh and her elder
              sister through university. Her sailor-father, who was often away,
              died when she was 17.<br> <br> For a few months in 2005, Goh worked part-time at Dr Tan's clinic,
              earning $10 an hour, until she found a new job.<br> <br> "I didn't need an extra person working for me, but I could see that
              she was an intelligent young lady with good potential. So we
              created a job for her, to do computer work since she's good at it,
              to help her build up her self-esteem," he said.<br> <br> Before her stint at his clinic, Goh, who graduated with honours in
              computer engineering from NTU in 2004, was a software programmer
              with Singapore Airlines.<br> <br> Help from others<br> <br> Dr Tan is not the only person who has helped Goh.<br> <br> CJ Yong had put her on probation as he felt jail would only worsen
              her condition. Her case was considered unusual because in three
              previous cases of theft by kleptomaniacs, all had been
              jailed.<br> <br> He said that it was easy for him to "bump" her into jail, but felt
              that she had a problem which "cannot be resolved by this form of
              punishment".<br> <br> Justice Rajah had also viewed that a jail term was not the best
              solution for Goh.<br> <br> "I am persuaded that (Goh's) rehabilitation for the present will be
              best continued outside of the prison walls," he had said
              then.<br> <br> He credited her for trying to overcome her condition and stay clean
              for a year. Her relapse was "an unfortunate blip" in her otherwise
              successful treatment programme, he said.<br> <br> Goh's sister, then an engineer,, and her mother had also rallied
              around her.<br> <br> After she was hauled to court in 2005, they drew up a supervision
              plan: There was a daily timetable she had to follow and a guarantee
              that there would always be someone around to ensure she took her
              medication and to help her resist the urge to steal.<br> <br> Walking with her<br> <br> This included her sister walking her from their home to the MRT
              station at 8am every day before being met by Dr Tan's nurse.<br> <br> After work, her then-boyfriend's father, a doctor whose clinic was
              also at Mount Elizabeth, would take her home. On Sundays, she would
              shuttle between church and home.<br> <br> Her loved ones were again key figures in 2007. Negative comments at
              her temporary job as a conference coordinator at Mount Elizabeth
              had depressed her and triggered her stealing spree, leading to the
              shoplifting charges.<br> <br> Her family, then-boyfriend and his doctor parents crafted another
              24-hour supervision plan to minimise chances of a relapse.<br> <br> It was this "army of caregivers", as described by the prosecution
              in 2007, that formed an exceptional support network for Goh. Yet
              their hopes for her were dashed by her stealing spree last
              year.<br> <br> In her mitigation, Goh's lawyer, Mr Choo Si Sen, said she had lost
              her job after she was charged in March.<br> <br> For theft in dwelling, she could have been jailed seven years and
              fined on each charge.<br> <br> Shoplifting history<br> <br> April 27, 2005: Stole an $83 skirt from a Ngee Ann City
