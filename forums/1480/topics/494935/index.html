Witness silencing only serves to sweep the issue of crime and injustice underground and like lipstick on a pig, only serves to silence news media and DECEIVE the public that the police are doing the right job.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The Singapore Police force should stop such cloak and dagger operations because silencing the media does not help them do a better job nor aid the cause of justice when their dirty bag of tricks are revealed.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">High time the anti-competition commission of Singapore investigate the SPF for the anti-competitive and media silencing dirty tricks they use to look good.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">=================</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-decoration-line: underline;">Eight months of beatings that ended in death.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">1 of 4</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">From top: Miss Annie Ee first met Tan Hui Zhen when they were teenagers and they rekindled their friendship in 2013.

While she lay slumped in a chair from exhaustion, the couple decided to punish her for her "bad attitude".</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">It would be the last round of beatings Miss Ee, who was intellectually disabled, would suffer before dying in her sleep hours later in the early morning of Apr il 13, 2015.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">She was hit repeatedly by the shrink wrap and fell to the floor, but even the sight of her on the ground inching towards her room did not stop her abusers. Pua continued to hit her legs, abdomen and buttocks, which already had open wounds and blisters.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">SIGNS OF INJURY</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Once, she said she had been beaten by a colleague, so I told her to tell her manager or call the police. The other times, she said she fell, but I did wonder how it was possible that she could fall so often.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">RETIREE XU WEI JIAN, on asking Miss Ee about the bruises she had around her eyes.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Pua then picked up a plastic dustbin and smashed it down on Miss Ee with such force the bin cracked.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Earlier that day, she had tried to commit suicide by cutting her wrists, having felt "useless" when she could not carry out Tan's instructions.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">She was found dead in bed the next day.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Miss Ee first met Tan when they were teenagers and they rekindled their friendship in 2013.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Estranged from her family, Miss Ee moved into Tan and Pua's four-room Woodlands flat in late 2013 and was given housework to do.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Over the eight months of abuse - from August 2014 until her death - Miss Ee started showing up for her waitressing job with bruises on her body, arms, face and neck.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The beatings and their increased intensity over time, with some sessions lasting up to two hours, meant she had difficulty walking, standing and breathing. She also became incontinent.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The couple made Miss Ee surrender her salary of $1,200, from which she was given a weekly allowance of $50. This was later cut to $30.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;">When The Sunday Times visited Miss Ee's former workplaces, ex-colleagues declined to comment and said they had been told by the police not to share any details.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">However, court documents revealed they had noticed that Miss Ee would hide her injuries by applying a thick layer of concealer, letting her hair down and wearing a cap. She would keep mum when questioned, but on one occasion, had told an assistant manager "my family", when asked about the injuries.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">An autopsy report revealed the extent of abuse she suffered: 12 fractured ribs, seven fractured vertebrae, a ruptured stomach and a body crowded with blisters and bruises. The report also said she died of acute fat embolism. She had been beaten so severely that fatty tissue below the skin had separated from the muscle and entered her bloodstream, interfering with blood getting oxygen in the lungs and leading to progressive cardiac and respiratory failure.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">On Friday, Tan, 33, was sentenced to 16½ years' jail, and Pua, 38, was given 14 years' jail and 14 strokes of the cane.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">They were initially charged with murder, but the counts were amended after police completed investigations and on the basis of forensic pathologist reports.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Tan suffered from depression and borderline personality disorder. Justice Hoo Sheau Peng said she gave this little weight but took into account as a mitigating factor that </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;">the couple had come clean in revealing what they had done.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The pair had pleaded guilty on Monday to various charges for the extensive torture of Miss Ee.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">A person said to be Miss Ee's younger sister, who did not want to be named, told Channel NewsAsia that her family was concerned that Miss Ee's simple nature could lead to her being "bullied or cheated".</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">She said Miss Ee felt that the family did not give her the freedom to make her own friends. Miss Ee later moved out to live with Tan and Pua. Her younger sister said Tan had exerted "total control" over Miss Ee.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Miss Ee was said to be the eldest among her brothers and sisters.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Her sibling said her family "will never be able to forgive (the couple) for what they did, especially Tan".</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Neighbours The Sunday Times spoke to said the trio did not interact much with others, but the sound of mahjong games could be heard from the third-floor unit at Woodlands Avenue 9.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">"I don't remember any shouts or screaming. We were all surprised to find out that such severe abuse was happening right under our nose," said a neighbour who wanted to be known only as Miss Lee, 35, a secretary.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">As Miss Ee usually left the flat early around 9am, neighbours did not see her often, said retiree Xu Wei Jian, 70.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">They would greet each other as she walked past Mr Xu's flat. He had on at least two occasions asked her why she often had bruises around her eyes.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">"Once, she said she had been beaten by a colleague, so I told her to tell her manager or call the police.

God created the conscience in man to convict or acquit them.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">For all the corrupted public servants who bully others, cheat etc and do a bad job just like the misconduct of the police who abuse their authority and try to censor/silence the press to make their own jobs easier/ themselves appear good will probably get premature heart disease and cancers because they will self discover in later life that they did a lousy job by taking short changing justice by cheating the freedom of information / press system.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">More than just a high salary is needed to achieve the satisfaction of doing a really good job. Thus, many PAP politicians and Singaporean civil servants with bad attitudes, laziness, cutting corners will suffer premature cancers and heart ailments from the stress of self sabotage by serving their own self interest and doing a lousy, short-sighted job.</span></p>
