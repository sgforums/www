              <p>Hi guys, first time posting here! I have been following this thread ever since I applied to be a JPO in Jan this year haha, so anyway, here is my timeline for  the whole application process.</p>
              <p>9 January 2015 - Applied through Careers@gov for JPO position</p>
              <p>26 January - Went for selection assessment and invterview</p>
              <p>-waited 6 weeks-</p>
              <p>10 March  - Got a call to book my medical appointment at Mt E Novena</p>
              <p>17 March - Did my medical checkup</p>
              <p>-waited 3 weeks-</p>
              <p>10 April - Call form my recruitment officer that my bond signing is next week!!!!</p>
              <p>I guess the reason why my application process is alot faster than some of you guys is because I'm a pre-enlistee? And I am actually supposed to serve my NS in Tekong, but I really have a deep interest in joining the SPF so I chose to sign on with the SPF instead and they helped me do the admin work quickly so I would not have to spend 3 months doing BMT (although I would not mind going for the experience and people I would meet)</p>
              <p>Lastly, my advice if you are going to call them and ask about your application status, DON'T call the recruitment hotline that is shown everywhere, you are better off calling the recruitment officer's on phone (Not mobile phone ah, like their work phone at their own table, get it right? haha) But do bear in mind the recruitment officers handle alot of applicants and that is why they might be slow in processing your application. Well thats all I have to say, thanks for reading this long ass post!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi Guys...Anyone applied for CPO in Nov last year and already got in? I attended the SA on 21 Nov 2014 and was asked to go for a medical checkup on 16 Feb 2015. After 2 months of waiting, I finally emailed to recruitment and asked for the status of application. However, their reply is the normal 'still in-process.' I am pretty anxious about the result....just wondering is there anyone out there who are in the same situation as me. </p></div>

              <p>Hi, I wouldn't say you screwed up! Don't have to be so pessimistic haha. Take it as they would like another opportunity to better assess you and get to know you. Be confident and honest. All the best! </p>

              <p><span style="color: #666666;">@Zealous123 I have to admit not everyone needs to go for a second interview, but there are those who get rejected even without getting a second interview too. I wouldnt be able to tell you the chances because I am not an interviewer haha but I can definitely say that you still have a chance to get in after your second interview. All the best!!</span></p>
