              <p>Okay,here's my timeline so far..</p>
              <p>Early June - Applied via Gov@SG</p>
              <p>Mid June - Received email to attend selection assessment. Status at gov@sg changed to 'shorlisted'</p>
              <p>23 June - Selection Assessment (interview, documents submission, English profeciency essay, no psychometric). Please note that i was serving NS at that time I told them wish to start only after Ive ORD.</p>
              <p>Mid July - Shenton medical called for appointment booking</p>
              <p>31 July - Medical screening at Shenton medical</p>
              <p>11 September - ORD</p>
              <p>18 September - SPF received medical review from Shenton medical</p>
              <p>4  November - Someone from SPF recruitment informed me that they're in the final stages of my application and I just need to submit a copy of my NS certificate of service and IC via email. Status at Gov@SG changed to 'in process'.</p>
              <p>5 September - Received another email, inviting me to come down to HTCC to take my psychometric test only. Status at Gov@SG reverted back to 'Shortlisted'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So there it is, like a rollercoaster ride. Hopefully it'll all pay off. Don't see myself doing any other job other than policing :)</p>

              <p><span>Hi everyone! I've been stalking this page for
              quite some time now. It really helped me during my Selection
              Assessment and Interview and I roughly have the idea about the
              whole process. For those who are still waiting, never give up! Just
              wanna share my waiting time line. Take note that I'm still waiting
              for the confirmation date for me to start training.</span></p>

              <div>30th July - Applied via Careers @ gov
              <div><br>
              <div>31st July - Got a text saying that I'm shortlisted for
              Selection Assessment and Interview</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div> 7th Aug - Selection Assessment and Interview</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>2nd Sep - Got a call from Shenton Medical to make a medical
              appointment</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>18th Sep - Medical check up</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>8th Oct - Got a call from the recruitment centre. One of them
              asked how many weeks/months I need to quit my current job (2
              weeks)</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>10th Oct - Got another call from them saying that I can sign
              bond on the 15th Oct and start training on the 20th Oct. But! I
              told them I'm going on a holiday and will only be available on
              Nov.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>14th Oct - Got another call from them. This time they asked me
              if I can start training on the 4th Nov but that's the date I came
              back to Sg. They said they will re-schedule again.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Early this morning, I called them back saying that I'm ready
              anytime now and they said they put my name under 9th
              December intake. However, not yet confirm. They might give me
              earlier slots if there's available and just wait for their call for
              the confirmation date.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div>Hopefully some of you from this forum will start
              training on the same date as me! :)</div>
