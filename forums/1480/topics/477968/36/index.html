              <p>Hey there! Judging on the high volume of applicants this year it is quite likely that your application will take at least 3-5 months after medical! </p>
              <p>Even so, there are also people who gets rejected after like 1-2 months wait thereafter their medical. </p>
              <p>Not trying to pull down your morality! But just wanna say expect the worst as it will least thee disappointment! </p>
              <p>But I personally believe if all goes well for you,  probably you may enter the October intake! There's one on the 6th! </p>

              <p>Hey! Nope! The next intake after July is on 11th August! That will be my intake! Basically, for your case you will most likely (90% chance) get into the intake closest to your NS enlistment, which is 6th October! And there is no way to bring forward your enlistment because there are too many applicants in process currently! Atleast that's what I heard from my recruitment officer!</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">im a pre-enlistee as well!  And I've tried to request enlistment way earlier, but was rejected. :(</span></p>

              <p>Hey Mary! As suggested by darklighter, you really have to be patient. The average wait for results after the first SA is about 1 month. Depending what your next outcome will be.</p>
              <p>Usually for rejection, you will receive it within 2 weeks after your SA.</p>
              <p>For second interview, you will receive it about  1 month after your SA</p>
              <p>and if medical straight after, you will receive it about 2 months after your SA</p>
              <p>when I meant receive, it would mean somebody will call you up, and an email will be sent to you thereafter. There is no way for you to check the status yourself. And calling them will just give you a very standard reply, which will be "application is still processing". Unless you're lucky enough to get something more than that. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS. my answers to you are basically rough estimation from what I had observed, definitely there are also cases that vary/differ much from these suggestions.</p>

              <p>Mary you have to be patient. Calling recruitment won't help;
              they'd just say your application is processing :) </p>
              <p>YNWA why not become a SPO since you're a uni grad?<br> The road to fitness doesn't take a day, so definitely embark on it,
              ease it into your schedule, make it a discipline. That said,
              there's no rush</p>

              <p>Hey Mary! As suggested by darklighter, you really have to be
              patient. The average wait for results after the first SA is about 1
              month. Depending what your next outcome will be.</p>
              <p>Usually for rejection, you will receive it within 2 weeks after
              your SA.</p>
              <p>For second interview, you will receive it about  1 month
              after your SA</p>
              <p>and if medical straight after, you will receive it about 2
              months after your SA</p>
              <p>when I meant receive, it would mean somebody will call you up,
              and an email will be sent to you thereafter. There is no way for
              you to check the status yourself. And calling them will just give
              you a very standard reply, which will be "application is still
              processing". Unless you're lucky enough to get something more than
              that. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS. my answers to you are basically rough estimation from what I
              had observed, definitely there are also cases that vary/differ much
              from these suggestions.</p>
