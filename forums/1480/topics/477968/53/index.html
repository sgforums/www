              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>i'm trying to enter the <span style="color: #0000ff;">SPF</span> with my diploma as a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Direct Entry - Sergeant</span></strong> under the MTE scheme.</p>
              <p>I have a few questions i wanna know, </p>
              <p>1) Is there a 2nd panel interview and a medical checkup or only if you have passed the SA + 1st interview. Because i've seen some replies here that some people only have to go for the SA and have been interviewed on that day itself and did not have to go for a 2nd interview. </p>
              <p>2) Ive contacted SPF facebook recruitment page asking how long does it take for them to send a an acceptance/rejection confirmation? And they replied "<span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4b4f56;"><span style="font-size: 12px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #f1f0f0;">2) Results will be known to you within 1-month time. You might like to drop us an email at spf_career@spf.gov.sg to check on your status instead. " </span></span></p>
              <p>However , I've seen a range of users on this forums being notified  2-6months only to get rejected.</p>
              <p>3) Anyone has friends who sign on and knows more information regarding the % of people going in , appreciate if you can share more thoughts. Seems like its hard to get into the spf, but still goodluck to all going for their SA or waiting for their replies.</p>

Just to share with you guys, I went for first SA, second interview, medical, then I got in... Total duration I've waited..  9 months. So don't give up hopes. SA to second interview takes about 1mth... Second interview to health screening... About 1mth plus... And another 6mths of long waiting is after the medical. So I suggest... To find a temp job while waiting.</p></div>

              <p>Yeah I went through other sites and realise that many of them who attempted to reapply after 6 mths straight were all rejected... it's best to wait for another month before applying. I hope you dont have to wait another 6 mths for this unsuccessful application? Meanwhile I'm currently applying to be a vsc to help boost my knowledge on spf, maybe you should try that too</p>

              <p>Hi all, I'm new to this forum.</p>
              <p>My intake (as a sergeant) will be this november. So I'm hoping that you guys can give me some suggestions on what to bring on my reporting day. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The list provided to me by them was rather short:</p>
              <p>-2pcs plain white t-shirt (polo or round neck)</p>
              <p>-1 pc plain white shirt (short-sleeved) <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Any idea what type of shirt they are refering to? Similar to formal wear or??]</span></strong></p>
              <p>-2pcs plain white singlet</p>
              <p>-2 pcs black track pants (females only)</p>
              <p>-2 pcs black shorts (male only)</p>
              <p>-jogging shoes</p>
              <p>-stationeries</p>
              <p>-toiletries</p>
              <p>-passport sized photo</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who are in HTA now, it will be great if you guys can provide me with a list of suggested items to bring :) Also, what are some of the prohibited items? And any idea if they'll be providing us any items? (eg sandals,etc)</p>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Thanks :D</p>

              <p>Also, some things that I want to know about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. I have a very bad fear of swimming. Will that affect anything? Do we have to learn swimming as part of the training? And if yes, will we be graded?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Is there confinement period when we first enter? (as a sign on regular, not NS)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Do girls need to cut their hair short? If yes, shld I get it cut before or when I enter? And any idea if there is a name for that hairstyle for girls (because i know guys have no.1/no.2 haircut).</p>
