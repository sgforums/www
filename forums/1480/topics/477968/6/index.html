              <p>Although before the first interview with the panel took place, an officer who was sorting out my documentation told me to bring my Driver's licence and secondary school testimonial for the second interview. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope i didnt screw up my medical check up. Was on e9L9 status due to skin rashes that i got during my outfield reservist 2 years ago. Status already expired last year but medical board yet to update!</p>

              I think it's all depending on their office team . 
              1 friend of mine waited 3 weeks , he got offered
              Another friend of mine , waited 8 months before getting offered .
              One more friend of mine, waited 12 months, got rejected .

My question is, do I have to pass that Psychometric Test in order to be qualify for the interview? also, I am 21 this Sep but to be honest with you all this is my first time attending a job interview as I have never work before because of my parents restricting me to have freedom. I really find it nerve wrecking and I wanted to ask you guys what are the questions that will be asked by the interviewer? its ok if you dont want to share your answers but I just want to familiarize with the questions so that I can anticipate and practice what I have to say before the interview begin. Oh and btw, my interview is this upcoming Mon at Home Team Career Centre, 178 Neil Road Singapore 088889. This interview really means alot to me as I really wanted to successfully sign on with SPF as I do have passion for it and I hope to hear from your responses soon! </span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.799999237060547px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.799999237060547px; background-color: #e2e2e2;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.799999237060547px; background-color: #e2e2e2;">Thank you!^~&lt;</span></p></div>

              Assessment and I wanted to know how are the procedures carried out?
              they did mentioned in the email to wear in formal attire and stated
              to arrive early for those who are scheduled at 0900 Hrs for a
              Psychometric Test. My question is, do I have to pass that
              Psychometric Test in order to be qualify for the interview? also, I
              am 21 this Sep but to be honest with you all this is my first time
              attending a job interview as I have never work before because of my
              parents restricting me to have freedom. I really find it nerve
              wrecking and I wanted to ask you guys what are the questions that
              will be asked by the interviewer? its ok if you dont want to share
              your answers but I just want to familiarize with the questions so

              <p>Congrats on the invitation first and foremost. Tbh, if you ask me, it doesn't take a genius to pass the psychometric test. If you have gone thru NS, you would have probably done something similar at cmpb. The answer is yes of course, I think you'll have to 'pass' the test. And for the interview, based on my experience, I think it isn't something that you can study or anything. For myself, they asked me about my service, employment history and personal background. Of course some basic information of the spf would come good. Just be yourself and you'll be fine. All the best!</p>

              <p>Hahaha I think you're worrying too much about the psychometric test. Bro, there's a lot of questions. The whole thing will take 1-2 hrs. It's just patterns, common sense and logic. No Fourier series or periodic elements involved I assure you. ðŸ˜‰</p>
              <p>The procedure for mine was: verification of documents, filling up forms, tests, height and weight, body check, break, interview.</p>

I see but lets just say la bro for those who actually fail that Psychometric test means its really no chance of being eligible for the interview? Or they still interview you even if fail the test? </p></div>
