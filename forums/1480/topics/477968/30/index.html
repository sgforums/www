              <p>Yeah. Pretty sure if u get rejected aft medical could be that.
              Cos they wouldnt want to send a rejected person to go for medical
              right? Anyway i applied together with my friend and his medical
              date was last month and mine was this mnth. He got rejected like
              last few days. Gosh this is really scary. They didnt even tell him
              what went wrong. Guess dont get your hopes up till u get a
              call/email from them for bond signing. </p>

              <p>Ya man,the most devastating moment is to accept the fact you're rejected and you do not know the reason for it. How long did your friend waited after the medical check up before he received the rejection email?. Mine after the request for photo, no news till now. So nervous</p>

              <p>Don't worry so much, once you've been asked to go for medical, it's most likely you'll get in. For now just wait for your cert and send the transcripts over to the officer in charge. </p>
              <p>BTW, did you went for 2nd interview before medical? And also which poly are you in? I'm also in NP now, final sem, just waiting for my results and certs. My last process was medical check up which was on 19 Dec'2014.</p>

              <p>Don't worry so much, once you've been asked to go for medical,
              it's most likely you'll get in. For now just wait for your cert and
              send the transcripts over to the officer in charge. </p>
              <p>BTW, did you went for 2nd interview before medical? And also
              which poly are you in? I'm also in NP now, final sem, just waiting
              for my results and certs. My last process was medical check up
              which was on 19 Dec'2014.</p>
