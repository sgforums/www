              <p>@mags hi there, sorry for the late reply, as far as i can remembered, they asked something like this:</p>
              <p>introduce ur family background: as usual we spoke about our family haha</p>
              <p>why do u want to be in a police force?:</p>
              <p>i want to be in a police force is because i want to be able to help others like example due to some family problems at home, i can help to claim them and give some advises and also to give low crimes as possible.</p>
              <p>what do you know about spf?:</p>
              <p>i forgotten what i answered, but in short, i didn't do homework and give some answer that is not even a pinpoint at all, maybe that's why i got rejected i guess.</p>
              <p>have you ever work in a big team before? (i think what he meant was work and communicate as a team amount colleagues):</p>
              <p>yes. in my previous company, i had worked with my team of colleagues where if we r not sure, we don't hestitate to ask amount colleagues and we had given tips and advises too so that we are able to grow knowledge together.</p>
              <p>if you are being accepted, which department do u wish to be posted too?:</p>
              <p>if possible, i may want to be in a IT department, or else i had no preference.</p>
              <p>after that one of the interviewee voice out that i didn't do homework about what i know about spf and then he explained a little bit that i dun even remember.</p>
              <p>ya thats all. i hope u all can be able to help me what i had done wrong during my interview. as i am a higher nitec fresh entry graduated this year april and my first full time job was during june-sept 2016 probation period as system administrator, my performance did not meet their enquiry standard thats y i can't continue. so thats why i do not have much experience for interviews questions like how to sometimes bluff or what and do not many working experience in my portfolio too :(. thank u all</p>

I was quite lucky tho. An officer was talking to me about the SPF and the scholarships they have and I used it in my essay and interview. I think what they want to see is that you are keen and prepared.</p>

You can also talk to the officers themselves. When I went for the interview, I managed to talk to the officers who were there and learnt more about the job. (The person I talked to was the lady who checked the documents when we first arrive)</p>
              <p>I think that asking questions about the police force during the interview also gives a good impression as it shows that you are keen to know and learn more about the police. I asked about the police that patrol around the mrt and stuff like that</p>

They will check your hearing, sight, urine, blood, etc. They will also ask if you have any pre-existing medical condition (scoliosis in my case) and send you for an additional checkup if required. The doctor will also need you to give her a rough estimate for your 2.4km, push up and sit ups. (You can do this at home and email it to the doctor. The whole checkup didn't really take that long. Maybe 2.5 to 3 hours?</p>

              <p>Assuming the interview is the same as mine, you'll be filling up a form, passing your relevant docs, doing tests in a room and a quick check, before waiting in line for the interview itself.</p>
              <p>Everyone gets different questions i think. I was asked about my family, what I know of SPF and why I want to join, was my decision approved by my family, and strengths and weaknesses. Just answer them to the best of your knowledge and be positive.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@sivahopeful, hi there, normally for Assessment u will go through submitting of ur documents and some test such as what is stated in ur email like example English profession test, physical test etc. U can read through my previous reply around page 47 onwards. It will take half a day. If u r shortlisted on the day itself den it's good, if not they will notify u through SMS or email or both if u r selected for an interview, duration about a week after ur SA, some r lucky they will be having an interview on the day itself of the assessment day. So far some of them had share what do they answered the questions given by the interviewer. For my case, I was being asked exactly the same as what firtree said above during my interview, so do try to think about how to answer them, they also do ask me "if u r being selected, which department do u want to go?", u can go to some website or try to go to the roadshow and look at the position each policemen does, so that u can let them know what u want to do and explain urself why. Do answer the best you can. Even though I failed during the interview, at least I experience it how it is like :)</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sigh, just got the rejection letter today after 6 months of waiting as well. (after application in June 2016, SA in July 2016, and medical in October 2016). Not sure whether I want to try again or not, since throughout this 6 months of waiting I have rejected other job offers as I was really committed to joining, and plus applicants who failed need to wait another 6 months from the rejection date to apply again. Anyone know of anybody who still managed to get in after their 2nd/3rd try etc? much advice needed, thanks :(<br><br>P.S.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@<a href="http://sgforums.com/users/327725">srazin</a>, most likely medical got hidden problem? i'm just guessing cos based on previous applicants, once you get to the medical stage, you are almost more or less confirmed. once medical clear, some submission of docs and you will be offered the letter already.</p></div>
