              <p>Your test will be done on paper. So theres no way you will get to know the result same day. Yes you will still be interviewed. But eventually the results of both your test and interview outcome will be determined if you are suitable for the job. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Test is not hard. Just need to be fast. I dont think it's easy to fail the test unless you really really screw up.</p>

              <p>The typical questions i think they would ask is why you want to join the force. And what you know about job scope of a police officer. I was nervous so i turned the tables by asking about career progression and how did the 2 interviewers ended up where they are. They spend a whole 10 mins (i think) sharing about their experiences. I would strongly suggest you prepare few questions to ask the interviewers so at least they would think that you are keen. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But again i think it depends on who is interviewing you. Mine was really friendly whereas a friend of mine was the opposite. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I did answer them because my dad, brother and 3 of my best friends are also on the force. So it helps. </p>
              <p>I dont know if they will still consider if you do badly for test but did well for interview. Because no one except the assessor will know of the results any way</p>

              <p>You are applying for JPO position so obviously they will ask you questions that related to that position</p>
              <p>Whether it's 2 or 3 or 4 panels it doesnt really matter. It's not within your means to decide the numbers. Just give your best shot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont think any of us keep track a number of question thats being asked. Thats not how interview works. They'll ask 1 question and it's a 2 way conversation. When you are done with your answer, they'll ask another. Probably until they've decided whether you are suitable or not. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw the typical answer they get during interview is 'im passionate about joining the force.'. So if you really have passion about being in the force, convinced them in how and in what way you are passionate. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Bro, like I mentioned, I can totally understand your anxiety, not knowing what to expect. Hahaha but you really need to calm your horses bro. I really believe if you sincere enough with your answers, you'll be just fine. You wouldn't wanna go there 'over-prepared' expecting whatever everybody shares here to actually happen exactly in order. The last thing you wanna face is, emphasizing too much preparation on something, but on the day something else is thrown at you. So stay cool brotha! </p>
