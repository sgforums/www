              <p>Yes, you can. But do take note this "2 years" does not include your training (6mths) and should you break the bond, you've to pay an additional (i believe it's) 30k in addition to the 10k you receive. </p>

              <p>hi, i would like to ask,what will they ask during interview?
              like eg. SPF core values.and is the interview hard? just applied
              today</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In my opinion, it is basic interview qns (eg. Tell me more about yourself, why u want to join spf, your understanding towards spf and the role that u applied for. Good to know things like the core values, various departments,etc. Just have some basic knowledge. </p>
              <p>Tip:</p>
              <p>Be honest and certain towards your own values and your answers.</p>
              <p>Be well prepared and try not to be too nervous. </p>
              <p>Most importantly, be yourself.</p>

              <p>Yes camera phones and chargers are not allowed. You have to remove the whole camera(not tape). But this is not advisable as you are not allowed to bring any chargers/ portable chargers. I did what you did and I regretted on day 3...</p>

              <p>Currently a regular in the force and I notice many questions about signing on so I'll share what I know.</p>
              <p>I signed on as a Pre-enlistee and my interviews and assessment took much longer than what some of the bros above shared. In my opinion, it is easier to sign on if you are an existing Police NSF (best to do it 6 months before you ORD). </p>
              <p>A tip for people looking to sign on: I heard it is much harder to get in because management has declared that manpower across all departments are at 'comfortable' levels (even though I still hear complaints of lack of manpower everywhere lol). In fact, the 30k scheme is being reviewed and there are rumors that it might be reduced back to the initial 10k scheme (because too many people take money and run after the bond ends). </p>
              <p>Policing work is not as simple as it seems and it will benefit you alot if you do your own research or ask your family members/friends who have served as regulars in SPF.</p>
              <p>For the training itself, its 6 months of training in HTA. 3 months of POBC (Police Officer Basic Course) and 3 months of ATC (Advanced Training Course) or also known as GRF (Ground Response Force) course. PNSFs who are posted to NPCs as NPCOs (Neighborhood Police Centre Officer) and sign on before they ORD will not have to go through the training again.</p>
              <p>The first 3 months will be pretty physical in terms of training and there will be a FI (Field Instructor) taking your squad. The FI is normally an NSF who has passed out from POBC a few intakes before. A quick tip to note is that everyone outranks you in HTA whether they are regulars or NSFs so it is not advisable to play the 'you-are-just-a-NS-boy' card because Trainees are at the bottom of the hierarchy. However, there is an unspoken rule that FIs would not make things diffcult for you on purpose like they do to the NS trainees. Still, you might encounter one or two FIs that hate every regulars they see and would go all out to punish your squad. Not to worry, you can always feedback to your OC and they will be disciplined accordingly.</p>
              <p>The only ones that get better treatment are the Senior Officer Trainees (SOTs). Back in my time, they were untouchable and only had to answer to their OC and whoever that was higher up. </p>
              <p>A normal daily routine would be waking up for water parade, then breakfast followed by singing of National Anthemn and taking Police Pledge at the Parade Square. (As of 2016, it is no longer a daily affair because too many people faint from standing LOL). You would then head for PT which lasts all the way till lunch. After lunch, you would head for lessons followed by PT/lessons till dinner. After dinner is where you get about 1.5/2 hours of OTOT (free time) where you can do your self training at the gym/stadium/track or even head to the library. You will also receive a laptop for training purposes where you have to carry it with you whenever you have lessons so you can also self study in the bunk during OTOT. Afterwards you would have to go for supper before you end the day with another water parade.</p>
              <p>During the first 3 months, there will be 3 IPPT sessions where you have to pass the final one in order to move on to the next course. (Can fail the first two but die die must pass the last one). You have get 61 points in 3 stations to obtain a Pass. You would also have to complete the PSOC (Police Standard Obstacle Course) your full uniform and Police utility belt under a set timing. You would also have to pass your Shooting. In short, the 2 main requirement to be in SPF is to pass your annual IPPT test and Shooting test. </p>
              <p>The next 3 months will be a breeze where you will have lessons daily and will move on to SBT (Scenario Based Trainings). You will go through trainings that are more directly related to policing work and pick up skills that an NPCOs requires. You would also be sponsored fully a Class 3 Driving License if you do not have one yet. It is a crash course and if you pass on your first attempt, you would get your license in 3 months. If you fail, SPF will sponsor you another 2 attempts. Subsequent attempts would have to be paid out of your own pocket. (It is advisable to pass early as subsequent attempts would have to be booked by your CM.)</p>
              <p>For those who already have Class 3, you would have to wait for the rest of your squad mates. (Those holding Class 3A would have to go for conversion test which is similar to retaking your license but in a shorter duration).</p>
              <p>Basically if you do not pass your TP by the time you pass out, you will have to book the test through your Division Training Branch (4th attempt onwards you book on your own). This will delay your Police Driving Course as you can only go for the course after obtaining a Class 3. The course is also important as you will receive your Police Driving Permit after you complete the course and it allows you to drive the Police FRC (Fast Response Car) and vans.</p>
              <p>When it comes to choosing your vocation, you can choose any of the 6 land divisions (7 in 2018) or other specialist units like SOC, PCG, APD, etc. You can submit 3 choices however there is no guarantee you will get your first choice. It is advisable to choose a land division for your first posting as it is where you build up your ground work. It is also harder to transfer out of a specialist unit.</p>
              <p>To sum it up, being an NPCO is meaningful and challenging at the same time. You get to meet all kinds of people and you have to be good at taking the shit people throw at you. Take it as a job hazard and suck it up. </p>
              <p>Good luck to everyone applying! :)</p>
