              <p>Hey guys. I think the standard reply was "still in process". No point calling recruitment.</p>
              <p>Ive been waiting since last year. Medical was in sept 2014.</p>
              <p>However i did emailed the officer who asked for my NS transcripts and Photo of myself. Instead of gg thru recruitment hotline. And he said my application was in the last stage.</p>
              <p>So long as we dont receive the rejection letter within 2 weeks-1month, i assume that the application is still ongoing. And 99% you will get though.</p>
              <p>But just imagine. Ive been waiting since last year sept. Rotting myself with part time jobs while waiting for this.  I had a friend who waitied for 7months, another only 4months. Haiyaa. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless. Hopefully the looooong wait will finally pay off. :)</p>

              <p>For the first 3 months of the training it will be called the Police Officer Basic Course. Main focus here will be clearing your ippt, marksman, police defence tactics and learning basic law. The last 3 months of the training will be more focused on scenario based training. There will be classroom lessons almost everyday.</p>
              <p>After graduation most of the trainees would be posted to various land divisions as an NPCO unless you are being posted to specialised unit like PCG. Promotion wise it will take about 3-4 years to promote to the next rank, provided you pass your IPPT.</p>
              <p>Piece of advise for all those who are joining, train up on your physical before enlisting and take some time reading various penal codes online so you will have an easy time learning law. Good luck to all of you!</p>

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>        My NS was SPF PCG and i ORD on 2011 which is past 4 years now..its my 2nd time applying this year April, 1st time was last year June 2014 and got rejected after 1st interview bcos i myself knew that i didnt do well during interview and expected the rejection which it did. Now my 2nd time applying for this year it went well for me during my 1st interview, surprisingly i bypassed 2nd interview and i got called up 1/2 week after for medical @ shenton on 21st May. 1 month later which is few days back 23rd June i received rejection email and i was sadden and disappointed like what most of us said we didnt know the reason why bcos it was classified info and my PES status was A, healthy and fit. I've been waiting 1 year plus for this exciting career which i have heart,soul and passion for it. I had few commander award achievements for my talents as a police officer during ns. What are the possibilities and reason why they rejected me? Bcos its been a tough time for me, i dont wish or can't afford to wait another 6 months to apply again(3rd time) as now i currently working as a part time auxiliary police officer certis cisco and sacrifing my time for 1year plus/almost 2 yrs just to get into SPF. I called up my Regular SPF friend and asked for advice and he said get help from MP(Meet the people session) for my issue which he said it did work fr his colleagues. I'm going to see MP for assistance regarding about my SPF career on 1st July bcos i believe my explaination is valid enough and wish me all the best and hoping that spf will eventually turn things around for me hoping for good news. I strongly believe everyone deserves an opportunity and 2nd chance to shine once a person had a talent in him or her with achievements. I'm 25 this year, NITEC cert, i myself know i still have alot in me to embark on this journey..its never too late for this. I wont give up, will keep believing that this will go through somehow! Best of luck to me *prays hard*.</p>
