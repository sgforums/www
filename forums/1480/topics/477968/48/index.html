              <p>Hi guys, need some help :/</p>
              <p>I've always wanted to be a cop since young and Im really keen in joining SPF all the way.</p>
              <p>On Dec 2013 I applied once, got shortlisted, went through all the tests and both interviews and finally went for the medical check up, took a total of 6 months.</p>
              <p>5 days before my enlistment day (9th May), SPF sent me the dreaded rejection e-mail and off to tekong I go. During my NS years, both in BMT and Unit, I asked my officers (My CO was notified as well) whether a transfer was possible and they said something along the lines that it wasnt possible because -</p>
              <p>Firstly, my year of enlistment quite unlucky because shortage of manpower in SAF which may have contributed to the rejection, which is kinda true because usually in a company there would be about 200+ recruits, but mine only had 120.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I got posted to a special unit which all the more couldnt release me, so I had no choice but to wait until I ORD.</p>
              <p>So after ORD, I worked a few part time jobs first, then I sent my application to SPF like 2 days ago (April 24th) and then I got rejected straight by that e-mail again like yesterday without an interview this time. </p>
              <p>Really confused right now as to whats going on and why I got rejected this time without an answer. :( </p>
              <p>Im 21, PES B1, IPPT Silver</p>
              <p>Nitec in Electronics</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">I hope someone can help shed some light on this :/</span></p>

              <p>Hi risyfozy, a community policing officer is more focused on
                          interacting with the community such as go to schools hosts talks,
                          attend Resident Committee meetings etc. For a regular police
                          officer they are the ones that respond to 999 calls and conduct
                          either foot patrols or cruise around in the police car and patrol.
                          Training wise, I believe CPO and PO both go through Police Officer
                          Basic Course which is 3 months followed by Ground Response Force
                          which is also 3 months in HTA. </p>

              <p>CPO has shortened ground response training. i can't remember the exact duration.<br><br>CPUnit not as easy to get in for fresh job seekers stepping out into the workforce as SPF is looking at hiring mid career switchers with work experience to fulfill the role of working so closely with the public (like NotThomas said, attend RC meetings!)<br><br>A quote from the recruitment officer to a CPO applicant when I was at my SA, 'So young can run one be PO ok?' Basically his application was changed to PO on that day itself lols</p>

              <p>hey guys, i applied last year june. Went both interviews and medical check up. i was rejected with no reasons. I have to wait for almost 4 months just to get rejected.</p>
              <p>I am NS inspector during my spf time. im quite close with my supervisor which is an ASP. So i got to know a few reasons why some of us get rejected even after gg through medical check up.</p>
              <p>What i got to know from my supervisor(during my first cycle reservist), some of us may have family members that have criminal record and whatsoever. Yes. They will check all your family members, aunties, uncles, grandfather uncle from father side and all. All you have to do is to apply again, and ask ur NS supervisors to write a reccomendation letter of your performance during your NS time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope i answered some of the doubts here.</p>

              <p>Hi guys i have a question to ask. If lets say my interview panel consists of only 2 interviewers, does that mean that I have to go for a second one that usually consists of 3 interviewers ? I recently just went for an SA that included the interview on the 7th of July. There were roughly around 20 candidates that were present. My interview went okay, typical questions asked. Im enquiring if there need be a second interview cause like Ive mentioned my first one only consisted of 2 interviewers. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any feedback is welcome. Thanks !</p>
