My mum was so worried that she cried the whole nite. After 24hrs, me and my dad went to the police post to report the case but the attitude damn bad lor. They take their own sweet time to come to the counter when we were there. Take down report halfway then chat with each other as there's 2 policeman on duty there. Really pissed at them lah.<br>Then 2 days later, my bro finally call and say he's in police custody the nite he's not at home cause the police went to the coffeeshop which he's at and catch people back to the station suspecting them of drug abuse. Donno why my bro kanna brought to the station  also since he dont touch drug at all.<br>Knn, since he's already at police custody on the nite he's missing, then they should have records of him in their database or whatever shitty computer they have what. So why can't those idiots at the police post just tell us that my bro is in their custody when we made the report the second nite.
