However even with handcuffs, your legs are free to move. Furthermore, the two male officers have to be cautious in handling her since no woman officer was around initially. I believe the officers shown some restraint in this case because she's  female. I believe things may be different if the person is male. I'm not suggesting that the police will beat him up. But I believe the arrest would have been more swift.<br><br>I have to disagree with you that the police are "weak" in this instance as you have mentioned. You are free to portray whatever image you like, however, in this instance you are making as assumption based on what you have read. I don't think this is sufficient for you to arrive at such a conclusion. You won't know the various problems faced on the ground. Things are quite diffferent on the ground.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>After they asked her to stop making a scene, Aneeza <strong>kicked Corporal John Sng near his groin </strong>as he handcuffed her. ( OUCH!!!)<br><br>She then hit another officer, Sergeant Deng Dehui, on the head with the handcuffs.<br><br>When a female officer, Inspector Ng Wan Ying, arrived shortly after, Aneeza hurled vulgarities at her and kicked her on the shin before she was finally subdued and taken to Central Police Division headquarters.[/b]</blockquote>Actually if I can picture this hor, it seems more like CPL Sng try to handcuff her...manage to cuff on one side only or something, and she struggle and kick him NEAR the groin (by horse kick?). SGT Deng comes to assist, and she whack him on the head with the handcuff still hanging on one of her arms. So in theory, she still isnt restrained yet. The two decided that they are dealing with a violent female suspect, so they called in enforcment for a female officer. She came later, and kana kick while they try to pin her down and all loh.<br><br>Nothing particularly useless of the cops what. Its just normal procedures. But then, I am mor concerned about the circumstances behind CPL Sng's groin attack. Was he utilising the "proper procedures" according to what we are taught? The instructors did say our groin is actually rather vulnerable in that stance...hmm.....</div>
