              <p><br>Are your degree from private instituition or local universities? Although it was stated that the degree must be from universities accredited by the home government of the country where the university is located. Also do you completed your National Service with PES A or B? : <a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/career">http://www.spf.gov.sg/career</a></p>
              <p>Also I think you can considered other options like CAD or Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau </p>

              <p>Honestly, just reading your post, I can say that further education is absolutely necessary.</p>
              <p>Firstly, your language is horrible. With your level of English, you can't even file a proper police report or understand the lessons on law. How to be police officer?</p>
              <p>If you really want to fulfil your dreams - study hard. Or you can try join CISCO or AETOs are an auxiliary police officer. They have lower entry requirements because they do not need to handle police reports etc. - just need to carry gun and protect a place.</p>

              <p>Like everyone here has said..... further your education first.</p>
              <p>These days we have university graduates entering the police force. So to be brutally frank, why should the police hire an N Level graduate?</p>
              <p>And before you say it, yes, they do need relatively well-educated people to serve in the force. How can you enforce the law when you are not educated enough to understand its basics? How do you write a police report when your English is too poor for others to understand? Can I trust you to learn the police academy syllabus when you have difficulties learning our school syllabus?</p>
