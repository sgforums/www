Saw traffic cops with glocks, berettas the works. But then again, are they subsidised by their dept.? If not...its gonna cost them an arm or leg for it right?</div>

You should show up and make some new contacts.<br><br>BTW, do you shoot IPSC in Singapore? If you do, then you can always ask the boys for some contact info too.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by viciouskitty74:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, can we request for SPF to help pave the way for more training in scenerio shoot by sponsoring our membership with the IPSC organisation?</div></blockquote>IPSC is not the right choice for realistic scenarios type shooting. You want IDPA; it's more realistic in terms of contact distances, use of cover, magazine capacity, etc. The first IDPA event in Singapore was hosted in May and the next one might be in December (not confirmed). I ran the match in May; had a lot of attendees from several units.<br><br>I could be wrong but I think the range at CCK rents out pistol and sells ammo for those who want to participate in any of the events.

And I have not shot for what 2 years since my last Road Accident.  Its hard to drag around a leg that cannot bend at the knee.<br><br>Hmmm.....think its time I check with some shooters from Singapore that may be going up to Phuket for the Thai Competition.  Easier to have friendly face there.<br><br>Thanks for the info.<br><br>LOL. They will only rent to those that needs it since they cannot bring in their own gun.  For locals, they rather we dont participate until we joined the club.</div>
