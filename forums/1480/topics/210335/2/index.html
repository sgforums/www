They come in single, single/double, DAO (double action only), etc. I've shot revos that have a sweeeet 6 pound trigger and at the same time the NYPD Glocks have triggers that are 12 pounds. But let me tell you something else...<br><br>If you have decided to draw and engage, no amount of trigger weight will make a damn difference when the adrenaline flows through your body. You wil mash the trigger when the brain says 'shoot!'.<br><br>Some folks consider heavier trigger for fear of accidental discharges (AD). The bad guy is front of you, you told him to show his hands, your finger is on the trigger at this point and the adrenaline, as I've mentioned, is flowing. If you had a super light trigger, that death grip is going to result in an AD.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by viciouskitty74:</div><div class="quote_body">I agree.

And I have to agree with that laser grip issue. I have personally seen SPF officers who are 'chasing the dot' during a course of fire. Instead of looking at the target and where they need to deliver the shot, they're bouncing all over the target. And if you fumble the draw and don't activate the laser, what happens then?<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I think the laser is a great aid BUT rather than teach the recruits to sight with the dot, teach them the basics of sight picture and alignment. The laser is there to confirm and assist your basics.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">Personal preference is a semi-auto handgun as (1)it holds a large magazine,(2) reloading is easier,(3) easier to mount accessories ie.enlarged magazine well,compensators etc. </div></blockquote>Spec, if your talking IPSC, I can understand the comps and the large mag well. If we're talking police issure here, that ain't gonna happen.<br><br>Personally I do not have any problems if I am issued a revo or semi-auto, if I am LE. It all bores down to practice; if you don't practice, you ain't gonna react fast, shoot fast and shoot accurately. My only problem is if you're gonna issue a revo, why only a 5-shot wheel? I'd like to know the reason behind that.</div>

What makes me wonder is why the SPF mandated a 5-round 2.5" to 3" barreled M85 Taurus (did I get that right?) rather than a standard 6 shot. They picked a firearm that is a tough to find accessories for. Even a standard holster for the M85 is hard to come by in the US. Only reason I know is that I tried looking for accessories for the damn thing to submit for a bid and all my distributors had no idea if anyone makes anything specifically for the M85. If they had stayed with a J-frame S&amp;W....<br><br>BTW, no disrepect but I don't think it has anything to do with the 'stoping power of each round'. It's a 38; in some competitive events in the US, that caliber is banned because it is under powered. In our circle, a carry caliber is nothing smaller than a 9mm. A 38 or 32 is almost always relegated to that of a back-up gun.<br><br>Anyway, you're right to say that this is Singapore. It doesn't have the crime rate like others do. That said, the world is changing. I am pretty sure someone  at Home Team Academy is asking themself if the SPF needs to go to semi-autos in the near future. The 5 year period (??) for the M85 will be up very soon.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Deunamist:</div><div class="quote_body">If there is a rise in gun crimes, what do we have SOC for?

What makes me wonder is why the SPF mandated a 5-round 2.5" to 3" barreled M85 Taurus (did I get that right?) rather than a standard 6 shot. They picked a firearm that is a tough to find accessories for. Even a standard holster for the M85 is hard to come by in the US. Only reason I know is that I tried looking for accessories for the damn thing to submit for a bid and all my distributors had no idea if anyone makes anything specifically for the M85.

There is definitely a difference between what you can find and what LE agencies can find. E.g. an authentic H&amp;K MP5</div>

When you are entering a room, house, bldg, etc, you wanna make sure you have as much ammo as yu can carry because you never know what is around the corner. In Singapore, CQB might mean facing a individual with a parang. In the US, CQB might mean entering a house with a criminal behind a stolen AR15 (that's 30 rounds).<br><br>FYI, one of things we do during training is a tactical reload (swap out a new magazine - where possible) before entering the next room, after the first or last has been cleared. We do so becos' we do not know what to expect and don't want any surprises like a slide lock because there was only one round left.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by viciouskitty74:</div><div class="quote_body">That guy has a handgun at every nook and cranny of his home. Are you somewhat in the same kind of home? Where weapons are a norm?</div></blockquote>I'm outside DC and I don't have one in every nook and cranny. I have to be concern about my little one. I do carry one and my wife (who's  Asian) has 'skills' too. I like to say we have a few 'well placed' firearms for home protection. Have you ever heard the saying that a pistol is only good to buy time to get to a rifle? A Remington 870 pump is our home defense tool.<br><br>I work in the industry, so to speak, which means that even during some of my travels to the other states, I do check in my firearm at the airport.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Deunamist:</div><div class="quote_body">There is definitely a difference between what you can find and what LE agencies can find.

H&amp;K are trying to get rid of their stocks of refurbished units at well below market prices and they are literally about 45 minutes away from where I am. No matter what some of my associates here think about the MP5 (everyone wants a shortie SBR or at least an M4), I think the MP5 is still a very formidable weapon system.<br><br>DVC.</div>
