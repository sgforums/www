But there is a right way and a wrong way to be civic conscious - you will be penalised if you go overboard.<br><br>If the thief died because of a heart attack and not due to any manhandling by your friend, then a court of law will/should find that there was no causal link between the thief's death and your friend's actions.<br><br>You may have found 1000 hits on 'third degree murder', but you should be looking to see if any one of those hits have anything to do with SIngapore law. Third degree murder is more mostly an american concept, which is not even present in UK law.<br><br>You could reach a conclusion that helping anyone in need is wrong, heck, there'll be many posters who will agree with you (this also explains why we will always get people standing around and looking instead of helping) - but I'm sure if you had a relative being attacked; you'd want someone to help.<br><br>If you act with good conscience and with prudence, you will never be in trouble with the law.</div>
