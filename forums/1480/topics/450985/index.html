              The actual story is bit of long but I will try to summarize. This is about my sisterâ€™s bf:
              
              He used to date a married woman (a Malaysian who became a Singaporean PR because she married a local Singaporean-Malay). She promised the bf to divorce her husband but until almost 4 years down the road still no divorce happened. The husband never knew about this incident, no idea at all even until now. 
              Inside their so called 3 years over 3rd party relationship, the married woman has been lending money to the guy bit by bit until it reached 5K. They continuously see for almost 4 years without asking for repayment for the gradual expenditure / loan. 
              
              The bf became tired of the married woman and wanted to move on with his life when he met my sister. The married woman became very angry and kept asking, demanding for the payment of the money gradually lent to him during their relationship. But the bf do not have the money to pay because he thought it was all gifts as a sign of help from the married woman. The married woman threaten to file a police report although she doesnâ€™t have a proof of such loans. She also threaten to sue the bf.
              
              Questions are:
              
              a)	Can she really make a Police Report even though she doesnâ€™t have any proof?
              b)	Can the bf counter claim for harassment? 
              c)	Can the bf go to any Sharia court and tell them the married woman was cheating with the husband? 
              d)	Will the PR Status be affected? 
              e)	Can the bf not pay the married woman? 
              f)	Is there any laws in Singapore that covers this kind of situation?
              g)	Any more advices? The married woman is really nasty and she is too aggressive even to the point of texting my sister to stop seeing her bf.

              <p>The solution is simple: tell your sister to dump the guy and let him solve his own problems.</p>
              <p>No, seriously. Would you want your sister to marry a guy who borrowed money from and dated a married woman?</p>
              <p>And actually, as nasty as the married woman is, she's right about one thing: your sister should stop seeing that fella.</p>
