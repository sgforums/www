            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I am at my wits end here. So I'm turning to the general public and I hope anybody with a good opinion or two can tell me about them.<br><br>I lost my hp (possibly pickpocketed) on Dec 22nd at Vivocity, I tried repeated to call my hp on the day I lost it. At first I wanted to report lost right away bcos whoever had my phone had off the phone, but later it was switch on again. Holding on that ray of hope, I kept calling and sending msgs and eventually called in to disconnect my phone around midnight (although Singtel claimed I called at 150am).<br><br>Anyway, I later received a bill of $500 for calls made overseas to Thailand, Vietnam, Sweden on Dec 22nd itself. I went to the police and they told me to go to Singtel and I went to Singtel and they told me to go to the police. Basically both parties were rather blase about it.<br><br>Of course, mine would have not been the first case in history.<br><br>However, I was shocked that neither the police nor Singtel even had the slightest interest in investigating into the matter despite the numerous overseas numbers reflected on the bill. I was even more appalled to be informed by both the police and Singtel that they do not have the technology.<br><br>Whether or not technology is really available in our country, it is just unbelievable that basically the reaction I have received is that I'll just have to bite the bullet.<br><br>I have written a letter of appeal to Singtel, but they are unwilling to waive the charges, only those from 150am onwards, which really amounts to little.<br><br>So I am asking if there is anyone out there who has any suggestions on what else I can do. I am not exactly wealthy.<br><br>I have tried calling the numbers on my bill, the individual appears to be thai. I have been unable to communicate with the owners of these numbers because they only speak thai/other languages. (Thai being the majority)<br><br>Please, if you have any idea at all, please email me at stickysoggy@yahoo.com<br><br>I sincerely ask for your help.<br><br>Eileen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest you lodge more reports and sincerely ask for help from both the Police and SingTel, if both still doesn't work. You can always try Straits Time and STOMP. ( I don't suggest STOMP really, but they do have a big number of viewers there.)</div>
