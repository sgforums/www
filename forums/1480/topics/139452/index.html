I follow that.<br><br>But i do have a few question which i hope other SPF regulars can help me wif.<br><br>1) As a Junior Officer is there a prospect in SPF? i mean can i go far?<br>Yes, if your CO is a good one but most likely is a No cos u will end up stuck in NPC for 3-5 yrs unless u know people who can rope u over. The longer u stuck in NPC = more likely to be posted out but also = more likely people dun want u cos u only trained in NPC duties and nothing much. Want to have prospect must quickly go officehours or get transferred to be IO...then u can jump and jump almost anywhere....<br><br>Rule of thumb :<br>1) 2 yrs in NPC then quickly request to go be IO or go officehours. 1 yr then quickly source for the next job....if u wait for MPO to do his/her job...u can wait until u get ur next rank also still there....<br><br>2) Do ur best but dun try too hard, else u will fall down hard...have seen many such cases...they are indeed good but step on too many fellow officers' foot, therefore ganna condemned and the rest is for u to find out.<br><br>2) Can a JO become a SO ?<br>Previously Yes. Now is NO...strictly NO...unless u got super ultra good supporter like a strong Commander or DY Commd or someone who in Cantoment. Max rank is SSI2 which will take u 15-18 yrs at least unless u high flyer then perhaps just 12 yrs can get there. Those who can do so and can afford to do so, resign after they get their SSgt...which is say....abt 5 yrs. From my circle of friends, Sgt-&gt;SSgt on the average is 4yrs but Cpl to Sgt is very fast cos there are things u can't do as a Cpl but Sgt can, wat i won't reveal.<br><br>3) I heard tat SPF sponsors officers to study degree in Justice Studies. I am from a poor background so i dun have the means to go to UNI although i got the grades. Will a normal diploma holder be eligible?<br>AFAIK, they sponsor u go temasek poly study some 'elligible for use in SPF but worthless outside DIPLOMA'.<br>No, they do NOT support Diploma Holders to go Uni but they do support 'A' Level Holders.<br><br>PLease help thankkx</div></blockquote></div>
