              <p>Hello Everybody!</p>
              <p>I'm a British Born Chinese living in London and a Sergeant (MSC) in the Metropolitan Police Service's equivalent to the Singapore VSC.</p>
              <p>I was wondering if you could share some insight with me as to how different volunteer organisations are run within different country's policing models.</p>
              <p>I have a few questions as to how your organisation is run, so as at our next conference certain propositions and ideas can be put to the top-top-top brass as we're looking to over-haul our current system. The SPF website and wikipedia has such limited information.</p>
              <p>So here they are:</p>
              <p>1) How does the depth of your training compare to that of a regular police officer? and if so is the training continous once you leave training school so that you reach the same level of competence?</p>
              <p>2) What kind of duties do you perform? Are you left with operations run only by VSC personnel or are you fully integrated into the regulars organisation?</p>
              <p>3) What kind of specialist units/opportunities can you join/recieve?</p>
              <p>4) Is the VSC rank structure integrated into regular rank structure? Would a VSC Sgt have command over a regular Constable or are they two completely seperate?</p>
              <p>5) How is the working relationship between VSC officers and regulars? Are VSC treated essentially as second class citizens?</p>
              <p>In London I as a Sgt (MSC) have no where near the same level of training as my regular counterpart. In law I am also unable to undertake roles such as custody/station sgt nor do I have the same powers under law to authorise certain sanctions. Our level of training is a minimum so that once officers have left training school they are left really to sink or swim as there is no official training plan for further development/continuation. The opportunities for MSC officers to join specialist roles are almost non-existent and most operations are run independent from the regulars. Our ranking structures are also completely apart, so that if I as a Sgt (MSC) was at the same incident as a regular constable, I would be techinically outranked. And for the reasons above many regulars looked down on MSC officers as not up to standard or a burden.</p>
              <p>I would be very grateful for any insight into how things are in your organisation.</p>

              <p>1) We have to be re-certified for arms and T-baton training annually in order to perform duty. Routine training is held monthly (the standard for regulars), but the attendance is voluntary. You can also volunteer to take extra course such as defensive driving to be certified police driver.</p>
              <p>2) We are welcomed to volunteer for normal duties that are planned by the regulars. Most of our training are conducted by qualified volunteers, with a regular witness for test and exams. There are VSC led operations, but we will still work closely with the regulars.</p>
              <p>3) There are volunteers in all most operational units (special crime force, traffic, narcotics). There are administrative roles within the volunteers organization, but volunteers are generally not deployed at static/logistic post for administrative works, such as custody sgt, clerks, dispatchers.</p>
              <p>4) Rank are integrated. A volunteer SGT outranks a regular CPL. </p>
              <p>5) Volunteers are normally treated with care, as their experience cannot compare with that of a regulars. But for volunteers with alot of experience, they will be treated as an assets, and assigned critical roles. The regulars generally appreciate the assistance of volunteers.</p>

              <p>Hi UK_Police Officer,</p>
              <p>VSC in Singapore is also looking to learn from experiences from other Volunteer police organisations in a number of areas so an exchange of information would be interesting.</p>
              <p>Can we talk offline / by phone and see what we can set up? If yes, please send me your phone details or skype details to email:  sw_world@hotmail.com</p>
              <p>Many thanks</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
