              <p>You can refuse to accept the conditional warning and tell the CIO so. Give your reasons. I am sure the CIO will accept your rejection of the warning and go ahead and prosecute.</p>

              <p><br>Your friend already committed an offence and he still thinks he deserved to be treated fairly?</p>
              <p>Can you ask him DID HE ALSO TREATED HIS VICTIM(THAT GIRL) FAIRLY?</p>
              <p>If the answer is YES, then come and tell me and I'll go represent your friend for FREE.</p>
              <p>Don't give me excuses like this is the first time your friend is committing an offence. Why don't you tell me this is the first time your friend is being CAUGHT for committing an offence?</p>
              <p>Criminals and non-criminals alike, nowadays people think they are overly-educated and imagined they can get away with everything with their excuses.</p>
              <p>Who asked your friend to go commit an offence? If he is brave enough to gamble with the law and commit an offence, then he should also be brave enough to accept his punishment.</p>
              <p>Is he still a guy? Please ask him to go cut off his ku ku bird ok? Maybe then the judge will be lenient towards him. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>1 of my friend sms a girl asking her for sex and that he is willing to pay. She make a police report for outrage of molesty.</p>
              <p>After my friend went down to make a statement, 9 months later the police contact him to close the case.</p>
              <p>The police give him a conditional warning that he is not allowed to commit any crime in the next 12 months or else they will charge him in court for the new case plus this outrage of molesty case.</p>
              <p>It is the Chief Investigating Officer who issue the conditional warning. He seems to be a big shot in the police force because he have his own office and my friend saw alot of other police officers bringing in people to his office for him to give them warning.</p>
              <p>My friend find this conditional warning to be very bullshit. Because it should be AGO who issue him the warning and not a what Chief Investigating Officer. The Chief Investigating Officer does not have the authority to issue a warning. Only AGO and the judge can give warning.</p>
              <p>Moreover, my friend did not have any criminal offence in the past too. This is his 1st case with the police.</p>
              <p>Is the Chief Investigating Officer abusing his authority to give unauthorised warning letters?</p>

              <p>AGC [and not AGO as you have stated] is the one that gives directions for the Police to act on. The Police consult AGC on possible ways to deal with cases, and once AGC give directions for the Police, the Police will then act accordingly. In this case, your friend was given a conditional warning simply because AGC has given the Police directions for this to be done. If AGC says to charge, then your friend would have been charged. AGC has the final say. Simple as that. Judges give sentences to accused persons, not warnings. AGC deals with the process of prosecution, not the final outcome [e.g. warning]. Get your facts right before you shoot your mouth off.</p>
              <p>The fact that this is your friend's first case with the Police is exactly why he is not charged. Also the Chief Investigation Officer is one of the people authorized by AGC to administer, as well as give out, letters of warning.</p>
              <p>All in all, tell your friend to be thankful and take this chance not to reoffend. Rest assured the next time he comes to adverse notice, he will not get another warning.</p>
