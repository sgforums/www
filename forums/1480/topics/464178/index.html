              Hi everyone, recently sth just happened and im kinda paranoid..
              
              just today, i was on my way to get some personal things done at harbourfront centre, near vivo.
              As i was just walking normaly, 2 'singapore police force' ppl approached me. okay,
              one of them was chinese, the other i believe to be malay. so the chinese spf guy
              approached me and ask me for my ic. he said ' you mei you ic? ( do u have ur ic?) ' 
              and i say have. i took out my 11b and showed it to him as im just an nsf. 
              
              den he say, ' oh 11b ah, u regular ah? ' and i said no. he then questioned me 
              what am i doing here and i said that im here to do some personal stuff and that
              im on official leave from my army unit. den he further questioned me where i study 
              last time bla bla bla.. as all these was happening , the malay spf guy just took down my
              particulars. i saw he was writing my address only. Finally, the chinese guy ask me if i got any criminal record and i say no. im a clean and honest person.
              
              i began to get suspicious as it was only like 10+am and they just suddenly want to take
              down my particulars? i mean is this even possible? i didn't even do anything! he also look quite suspicious. He was a sergeant as i recognise the 3 chevrons he had on his shoulders. He didn't had any police hat with him. as for the malay guy, he didn't had anything on his shoulders and remain quiet the whole time. he also didn't had any police
              hat with him.
              
              what im worried is that they have my address and i don't want any of them to disturb my family. Finally i wanna ask, is this standard protocol for police on patrol ? just taking down addresses as and when they like even when u are just walking normaly?

              <p><br>they should have name tags. you remember their ID number or names? if so call police station with the details that happened and ask police is this normal. they should not take down your address if its a routine check. tehy also will not ask you whether you got criminal record or not unless its a case reported. they should radio back to their unit with your id to check criminal records only, not take it down for routine check?!</p>
              <p>alo they should be i proper uniform whenver thye are on duty.</p>
              <p>we only fear they are fake. whatever routine procedure they have is trnsparent yo civilians. we have the right to authauticate and check them first if its ;routine'. if not anyone can also put on NPCC uniform and say they are police.</p>
