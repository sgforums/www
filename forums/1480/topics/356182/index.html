              <p>My house was harassed by loan shark since Feb 26, 2009.  Police reports were made each time.</p>

              <p>The loan shark claimed that my mum was a guarantor for her friend which my mum denied. The debt which was $1000 is increased to $3000 instantly as my mum argued with the loan shark over the phone.  He said that he no longer want to chase after the debtor's $1000 and now only aim at my house / mum to compensate him $3000 for arguing with him over the phone. On top of that, each time his runners splash paint, we have to pay him extra $500 and interests too.</p>
              <p>The whole thing starts with my mum's friend but her house not being harass by loan shark recently.  Whatever information, such as the loan shark hangout, contact details, etc., the friend gives us was duly reported to the police.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Home Affairs Ministry is considering making borrowing from loansharks an offence in the country. <br><br>Speaking at the annual Police Workplan seminar on Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng noted that while the overall crime figure has fallen by three per cent from January to March this year as compared to the same period in 2008, unlicensed moneylending harassment cases for this period have almost doubled. <br><br>It has gone up from 2,066 cases to 3,993 cases. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">To step up efforts to combat this public menace, police have recently acquired more CCTVs which will be installed at harassment-prone sites to detect loansharks and harassers in the act. <br><br>Mr Wong said such CCTV footage will also aid police investigations.</span></strong> <br><br>Another step would be to make borrowing from loansharks an offence. <br><br>He said this would hold borrowers accountable if their reckless borrowing or gambling habits endanger the safety and security of the community. <br><br>The Home Affairs Minister revealed that from the arrests made, police conclude that many borrowers eventually joined the loanshark criminal organisation as runners to carry out harassment and vandalism - hence the need to nip the problem decisively on the bud. <br><br>Mr Wong also touched on manpower challenges being faced by the Singapore Police Force. <br><br>He said the Ministry recognised that resources were stretched and it has been working with police commanders and senior leaders to address this. <br><br>The Ministry will be creating 220 new frontline staff posts at existing Neighbourhood Police Centres. <br>- CNA/yb</span></p></div>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My house was harassed by loan shark since Feb 26, 2009. 
              Police reports were made each time.</p>
              <p>G/20090226/,G/20090227/0064,G/20090302/0095,G/20090403/0187
              &amp; G/20090416/0138</p>
              <p>The loan shark claimed that my mum was a guarantor for her
              friend which my mum denied. The debt which was $1000 is increased
              to $3000 instantly as my mum argued with the loan shark over the
              phone.  He said that he no longer want to chase after the
              debtor's $1000 and now only aim at my house / mum to compensate him
              $3000 for arguing with him over the phone. On top of that, each
              time his runners splash paint, we have to pay him extra $500 and
              interests too.</p>
              <p>The whole thing starts with my mum's friend but her house not
              being harass by loan shark recently.  Whatever information,
              such as the loan shark hangout, contact details, etc., the friend
              gives us was duly reported to the police.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Advised by the police, we changed
              our home contact number to avoid contact with the loan shark, and
              were told that usually they will come less frequently when no money
              was given to the loan shark. </span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now
              things seems to get worse</span>, they start splashing paint at
              mine &amp; my neighbours' doors and start they coming during
              daytime to do the job more regularly.</span></p>
              <p>I am very worried for my neighbours' children's as well as my
              own children's safety.  What if they meet face-to-face with
              the loan shark's runners when coming home from school?</p>
              <p>I am going crazy soon. Waiting at home for my son to reach home
              safely while taking care of my toddler. Each time the runner splash
              paint, my heart start beating very fast and my mind start thinking
              wild.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Other then waiting for
              the loan shark to stop, what can I do???  My son starts
              feeling the pressure and neighbours giving us looks.</span></p>
              <p>What can I do???????????????????????????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>All your reports seem to be calls made to the Police. Did the Police attending to you inform you of the investigator in-charge of the case? It will be someone from CID. If they didn't inform you, you can enquire with Bedok Police Division about who the in-charge case is. Give him a call to enquire about the status of his investigations.</p>
