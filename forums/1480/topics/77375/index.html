Pes B.<br>6 GCE O'level holder, but considering SPF after finishing a poly diploma after NS.<br></div></blockquote>Hi shotgun,<br>yup, its an exciting career as you get to meet people from different walks of life everyday. You will also be able to do escorts of illegal immigrants or robbers in a police vehicle. You will also be able to attend to fatal accidents like 'sky-diving' which is also known as jumping down from a building, and also murder cases.. For some shifts, you will be working at the front desk doing lost/found reports, changing of IC Address, disputes, answering calls and many more..<br><br>The posting depends on the availability of the unit/division and also your preference. Let's say for Police Coast Guard, if they have like 50 vacancies and you are putting PCG as your first choice, you will most probably get in.. But if division lacks of people, you might be pulled to division. You have only 2 choices to be made. Most people might want to go into Division first before going into specialised units as you get to learn more things on the ground first..<br><br>as for those who have not completed NS, you will be bonded for 5 years, including 2 1/2 yrs of NS. Your BMT in Police academy will be 6 months and you will be doing training and studying of law, police procedures, weapon training and many more.. Since you are Pes B, you will be able to join the Police Force, but as for your EyeSight, I'm not very sure about that, they might consider you on a case-by-case basis.. So if you are joining SPF after your NS, your pay will be an additional $200 and your bond should be 2 1/2 years or 2 years..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are a poly grad and your performance is good, promotion within 3 years is not a problem nowadays.<br><br>As for SO posting, i'll be honest and tell you it is difficult nowadays. The SPF get its pick of fresh grads nowadays so promotion from PO rank is far and few.<br><br>If you really want it, be prepared to work for it. That means aleast 2 years as NPCO, 1 or two years as IO (investigation officer), and least 1 year of staff work (OPS). It is necessary as IO and staff work allows you to be high profile and gives you a better chance to be selected.  You can apply for SO selection, but it has to be endorsed by your immediate supervisor and vetted by the respective Cmdr/Dir. Only then you go for the second round of interview conducted by Manpower Department.<br><br>Assuming you are selected, you get have to return to TRACOM for your 1 year SO training course(or known as 'C' course). And FYI, you start at the bottom of the SO rank, as AI (Acting Inspector) for 1 year, PI for 1 year and finally as a normal Inspector.<br><br>You think this is worth it, go ahead. By the time you reach your Inspector rank, you will be in your late 20s to early 30s. And your career options are fairly limited.<br><br>Consider fresh honours grads<br>(male:25, female:23) with second upper and above come in with ASP rank and you figure out where u r in the pecking order of things.<br><br>I am not out to prick your bubble but this is what u must expect if you intend to climb from PO to SO.<br><br>If you stay as PO, you should be able to get your SI (Station Inspector) by your early to mid 30s if you dun screw up.<br></div>

SPF is one of the few organisation that allows that... but of cos pro and cons are explain in the previous post by koxinga....  of cos there are a few exceptional ones that can be promoted to SO in early thirties... and retired as SUPT...  or even AC/DAC.....<br><br>and is it wasting of time its up to individual....  cos SPO and JPO do have different benifits and other things....  hope my reply is satisfactory..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that ricebowl might not be as iron as you might think. In the recent Police WorkPlan Seminar, Deputy Commissionor of Police Mr Goh Liang Kwang, hinted at the possibility of retrenching staff from the police.<br><br>I do not know what is his intention of annoucing this. Maybe it is a wakeup/warning call to buck up. Perfomance measurements have already been in place since 2001 and now this annoucement. But i do not think it will hit frontline staff</div>
