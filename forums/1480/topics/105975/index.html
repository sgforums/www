            <div class='col-md body'>I wont mind telling the complt i pay taxes too.. hahaha.. anyway just to say a point... might be long winded...<br><br>People tend to find fault cause as police we are law enforcers.. we follow the book.. we might be flexible but to a certain extend.. as many people wont know the  law.. they think what they do is always correct and others is always wrong.. so to be spotchecked or questioned by an officer.. they think they are begin suspected as crooks.. but then how we know one is a crook until we check on them.. many people are actually wanted for petty things which they might not know.. like failing to attend court or missing an invesitagtion...<br><br>Speeding is always a good complain. Police car speeding. But then how would one know if the car is attending to an emergency.. people are plain selfish.. they only think of themself.. that is why.. they dont know the head or tail, they just see the middle. Then the worse i heard was people actually complaining that TRAFFIC POLICE is going over the speed limit on the expressway.. HELLO, if TP dont go faster than you, how will they ever catch a speeder by travelling at 90KM.. it is like so DUH....<br><br>Then what is wrong with officers buying food, like i say we are also human. You people are also human, and sitting in office well dont need much energy. No need for lunch i suppose.. hmm... Also in a country where you can sleep peacefully or even go out at night.. it aint that bad right...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow this topic very interesting... really different comments from different mindsets...<br><br>But, typically... pple dislike police becoz... there are those 'black sheeps'. Police used to have many many "benefits" but, think now... its nearly all gonez....<br><br>Just to share with you all..... police force is a place whereby, they also have "laws" for them to abide....<br><br>Maybe, I am wrong.. but traffic police just can't speed to chase speeders... they need to report back using walkies (if I m not wrong) that, they spotted a speeding car.. and seek permission to speed... so as to chase the car..<br><br>Police officer can be also being complaint and marked.... They are humans too.. but, they have to live up a good reputation..and set a good example.. becoz, in the government's eyes.. they must be the last person to go against the law..<br><br>When they check on you.. and sound demanding.. that's probably, becoz.. they need to show some authority..They do not know you... hence, what if you are those rebellious type.. then, you don want to co-operate....<br><br>haiz.... its difficult for them too la..</div>
