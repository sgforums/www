I have to stress that police officers are not king of the roads. If caught beating the red light, we jolly well have evidence to proof that it is justified, or else we kana double charge. Speeding, of coz, is harder to have documentary proof, but should we speed for no reason (and I am wondering why should we speed for nothing anyway), we are liable for double charge too of coz.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to add a different perspective to the issue about the image of the Singapore Police.  In the U.S, there are more various different police in different states.  Each state the police impression to the public is different.  In NY, the policeman are looked upon like gangsters because most of the officers have Italian heritage. In Califonia, the cops are view as snobbish for what reason I've yet to learn.  In New Jersy, the cops are consider as tough guys. And so on.<br><br>In Singapore, a small country with 1 main police force, not including the auxiliary police, you therefore cannot fault the public for expecting a higher standards &amp; impression from the police.  Yes, its true that even policemen are human beings with feelings &amp; emotions &amp; days when everything is bad for a policeman.  The point is how you handle your problems?  The general public expects the police to solve their problem &amp; not add to it.  I understand that some Singapore police officers might think that this is rediculars but the fact is that you've volunteer for a service to the public &amp; have sworn to do it to the best of your abilities.  So how can you grumble that policeman need to eat therefore can illegally park their car to go buy food( its just an example ).  Instead of answering in such hostile manner, a policeman odd to think of his organisation image before he replies, eg, policemen try their best not to inconvin the public by getting their food as quickly as possible &amp; returning back to their station therefore, its unavoilable that some of them might chose to park in an arear closes to the shop which caould inconvin the public for a short time.<br><br>England, a country bigger then Singapore, the policemen there are known to the public with affection as Bobbies.  Until recently, British policemen don't even carry firearms because even the tugs have respect for the boobies doing their service to the public.  And believe me when I said that British policemen have a far tougher job then Singapore policemen, yet they can still professionally carry out their duties.<br><br>As heartless as this might sound, as long as you're wearing a uniform irregardless of whether it be police or army, to be recognise as a professional, you'll have to put the organisation image ahead of your own personal feelings or emotions.  And members of the public are the judges of whether or not you're a professional.<br><br>To know the relationship between the police &amp; the public, pick a random member of public &amp; ask him to name you his estate nearest policeman by name.  At least in U.S, some members of the public do know their policemen by name.<br><br>Please do not view my thread as an insult or anything negative.  I'm just sharing by views.  I've respect for all uniform service regardless of it being a nurse, fireman, police or military.  Without all these people, 9/11 outcome could have been worst.</div>

But I just want to state the fact that neither service prospect are very high if you're just an infantry soldier or a patroling policeman.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Your future prospect from either of these 2 service depends on what MOS or vocation, as I've come to learn, you were in the service.  Of course, if you were a fighter pilot or a medica profession, your chance are much higher in getting a job in the civilian world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I'm not familiar with the military or police force workings here but the length of your service in the military depends on you &amp; your physical standards.  Most U.S soldiers this day prefer to service 1 contract with the military as an experience &amp; then move on to the civilise world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>As for cops, my advise is to further study on subjects that are relevant to the job market in the civilise world, unless your aims to be a rent-a-cop.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway why people like to complain about us? i also like to complain about them... think got at least 100 people looking, a person snatch a bag and run. Victim shout for help.. anyone help? nope 100 people looking... police see man running.. chase man down the MAIN road... 500 people looking, 100 cars on the road.. police shouting for him to stop... anyone help? nope.. 500 people and 100 cars looking.. anyway this crook is really desprate i think, since now he covered at least 2KM and still going.. 3 cars already at scene.. finally one car jump the kerb to block him.. the car blocked a lane on the road...subject detained.. other officers jump out of the car to assist in detaining the subject..<br>blocking another lane.. so now only 2 lanes passable to traffic...5 minutes later.. got info that somemore call 999 to infd that police car parked anyhow on the road... so moral of the story is ... people only know how to complain and dont know how to help. complain is always much easier than actually assisting.. oh well... i mean it is a known fact right...<br><br>It is the society too... last time your mum use to scare you by saying if you dont do this do that, policeman will come and arrest you.. nowadays after higher education. Most people will think they know everything and they cant be wrong. And society has become very selfish too. So the blue uniform will become a target as our job is plain and simple. To follow the book....But of course sometimes we use brains.. If not those jaywalkers will all be fined $20/- anyway...

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">Allow me to add a different perspective to the issue about the image of the Singapore Police.  In the U.S, there are more various different police in different states.  Each state the police impression to the public is different.  In NY, the policeman are looked upon like gangsters because most of the officers have Italian heritage. In Califonia, the cops are view as snobbish for what reason I've yet to learn.  In New Jersy, the cops are consider as tough guys. And so on.<br><br>In Singapore, a small country with 1 main police force, not including the auxiliary police, you therefore cannot fault the public for expecting a higher standards &amp; impression from the police.  Yes, its true that even policemen are human beings with feelings &amp; emotions &amp; days when everything is bad for a policeman.  The point is how you handle your problems?  The general public expects the police to solve their problem &amp; not add to it.  I understand that some Singapore police officers might think that this is rediculars but the fact is that you've volunteer for a service to the public &amp; have sworn to do it to the best of your abilities.  So how can you grumble that policeman need to eat therefore can illegally park their car to go buy food( its just an example ).  Instead of answering in such hostile manner, a policeman odd to think of his organisation image before he replies, eg, policemen try their best not to inconvin the public by getting their food as quickly as possible &amp; returning back to their station therefore, its unavoilable that some of them might chose to park in an arear closes to the shop which caould inconvin the public for a short time.<br><br>England, a country bigger then Singapore, the policemen there are known to the public with affection as Bobbies.  Until recently, British policemen don't even carry firearms because even the tugs have respect for the boobies doing their service to the public.  And believe me when I said that British policemen have a far tougher job then Singapore policemen, yet they can still professionally carry out their duties.<br><br>As heartless as this might sound, as long as you're wearing a uniform irregardless of whether it be police or army, to be recognise as a professional, you'll have to put the organisation image ahead of your own personal feelings or emotions.  And members of the public are the judges of whether or not you're a professional.<br><br>To know the relationship between the police &amp; the public, pick a random member of public &amp; ask him to name you his estate nearest policeman by name.  At least in U.S, some members of the public do know their policemen by name.<br><br>Please do not view my thread as an insult or anything negative.  I'm just sharing by views.  I've respect for all uniform service regardless of it being a nurse, fireman, police or military.  Without all these people, 9/11 outcome could have been worst.</div></blockquote>Thanks for your comments, although I would like to point out that being defensive is not our ethos here. Let me just summarise the above again from the perspective of an officer, which prompted our responces:<br><br>First, while there has been sighting of "policemen" parking their cars "illegally" in order to buy food, which is of coz worthy for complains if proven true, the fact remains that this accusation is pretty groundless right now. One, we cannot ascertain if the person who sighted the offending officers are actually members of the regular SPF. That the complainant has already mistaken immigration officers as regular SPF officers already casts doubts in his abilities to differentiate between the various services and their uniforms. Two, bus interchanges, as far as I know, have a sign which states that "No entry except authorised vehicles" or something like that. In theory, it does not specify that "non-official" uses of the bus interchange is "illegal." Buying food from public places, btw, is not exactly considered "non-official."<br><br>We agree, that basic professionalism of police officers involve not showing undue emotions, nor "giving more problems" to the general public. However, that our responses above are seen as "grumbling" or "unprofessional" is a debatable conclusion. Pointing out the fact that officers need to eat, is perhaps seen as "grumbling" to non-Singaporeans, but an understanding of the Singaporean general public perceptions of the police force invariably shows, that the expectations of policemen are so high, that any form of "bodily maintenance" are expected to be done outside public view. Our internal rules, quite expectedly, forbid us from sleeping and resting in public, including being in any pose that appears sloppy. But in addition to this, the Singaporean public expectations adds a whole range of "rules,"ranging from not having officers seen to be eating in public view (including the act of purchasing) as mentioned above, to perhaps even the usage of public toilets (especially urinals)?!<br><br>Yes, there will indeed be officers who may take advantage of their "priviledges" in certain cicumstances, but it remains a debatable notion to argue that officers parking in the bus interchange are indeed consciously exploitative. Its not like they need to pay for parking. And its not like they cant walk longer. As I have pointed out, if they chose to avoid jostling with the general public in finding a parking lot (and potentially getting even MORE complaints from disgruntled folks!), is that neccesarily expolitative?<br><br>Each localitity have highly different social circumstances, and hence, it is usually not a good idea to compare our relations with the general public with that of other societies. For example, the turnover rate of police officers in Singapore is relatively high. Officers are promoted relatively quickly, shuffled around either by post (which can affect their job scopes) or geographically to other locations, and young Singaporeans are notoriously mobile when it comes to their career choices. In addition, consider how much the SPf relies on volatile manpower souces like NS police and the VSCs. The former, in particular, do not stay for more then 2 years now. Which other police force in the world relies so much on national service officers and volunteers, all of which wears the same uniform completely indistinguisable from each other?<br><br>If some of you still do not know, I myself is a member of the VSC. In order words, I am a reservist with the SAF (on holding list now thou. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ), is a student (and hence a civilian), and yet, also a volunteer policeman vested with policing powers. By my personal experiences of having a hand or leg in all three perspectives concurrently, I have had to see the same events from multiple perspectives at once, and this, I hope, allows me to contribute subtaintiatlly and objectively to this discussion here, without u guys classifying me as "an officer" or "a civilian," and making presumptions on my bias and so on, if any of you did so.</div>
