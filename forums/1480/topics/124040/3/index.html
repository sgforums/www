Mt Vernon Camp, that sentry got dragged into the cab and murdered + revolver stolen.. everything witnessed by a woman staying in the police hostel.<br><br>As for the m16 case, they both got caught.. turned out only one of them was involved in all the murders, the one with the m16 freaked out and all he did was to lock himself in the room with the weapon, the kids and the tuition teacher. I think he got jail sentence, the murderer got death.<br><br>wah yes, crimewatch last time was really eerie.. there was one episode of someone returning home late at night and as she pressed the Door Open button for the lift in the void deck, the door opened and in the lift lay a dead body. I was very young then also, got really spooked.<br><br>Then i remember there was also this unsolved case of an army NSF returning back to camp late at night and since he was late, decided to take a short cut thru some dark and deserted track. He never booked in.. the next day a jogger found his body. Heh, and it didn't help that i saw this episode at an age when i'm still afraid of the dark.<br><br>Then there was this case in which a man who was venturing into some forest to pick rambutans stumbled on a highly decomposed corpse.<br><br>At that time I was always scared to watch crimewatch too, but couldn't resist either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm...there are probably a few more, but not exactly in the same circumstance lah, and if the happened, all were quite long time ago.

That spooked me quite bad, coz at that age, I was a peace loving fella who dont associate cops with blood! So its kinda strange seeing the case being re-enacted on tv.

Interesting nevertheless. Should really suggest that they retelecast the old episodes of crimewatch, there are gems inside the archive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I believe more people will watch them too, compared to some dumb variety show lah.<br><br>Wah, police heritage centre still got KIA list one ah?

He actually also helped police track himself down by leaving his ic with the tuition teacher.<br><br>That NSF take short cut kenna killed case ah.. hmm.. can't remember which year already. Probably late 80s or early 90s lar.. Anyway it was shown under the Unsolved Crimes section.

The female cop killer I didnt see on crime watch. Its in create, which I believe you will noe what it is if you should know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But dont worry lah, this case was also well publicised in the press. Now they keep using this case to remind us to always sit the suspect in a certain position in the car loh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway the cop who died was a veteren. Seriously wonder how a veteran can make this kind of simple mistake. The gal must be damn drop dead chio.<br><br>Police Heritage Centre...you didnt go before right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Well..its at the entrance, and they get an entire hall dedicated to them. One big wall with all their names inscribed, and a computer terminal which lets you check each name, and it tells you the date they died, their service number and rank, and even a short writeup on cause of death. I actually took it all down, so I am damn sure our Mr Lee isnt in the list. Interestingly there is only one female death, and it took place very recently.<br><br>Maybe last time NS guys die no count? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> At least now confirmed got count liao lah.....quite tragically confimed by how those poor NS chaps who die when mata chia slam into something had their names on that wall. Strangely, it is usually the NS guy who dies, and the regular behind the wheel who lives. Probably a case or two appeared on crimewatch? Not sure..<br><br>Mount Vernon camp....haha everytime drive past there, I look see look see as thou can see anything like that. I live quite near to it too lah.<br><br>M16...suddenly what you describing sounds familiar liao. Was it also mentioned anywhere else? True files? True Courage?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway too bad the NSF case solved liao...or it probably gets shown in the final espisode of True Files 4. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I wonder if you remember how he was killed thou, and for what purpose? someone want to steal backpack ah (or was he in cv?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha.. I'm not in the police force, dun think i'll be allowed in to the Heritage Centre leh. If only i can turn back time (to 4 yrs ago) i will probably try applying for some police scholarship. Oh well..<br><br>As for the m16 case, i'm not sure if it was shown anywhere else leh.. But i think it should be in the Police Heritage Centre as well, probably even in some of those local books found in the library documenting the more sensational crimes of the 80s. Cos that one quite sensational then lor.<br><br>Anyway this m16 case i think got somemore to it.. after stealing the rifle and before robbing that Andrew Road house, the killer (not the one who backed out) actually ambushed and killed a couple doing it in the car. Sorta remember that he tied them up and left them to suffocate inside the car boot, next day dumping the bodies in some reservoir (i think).<br><br>Then eventually when the matas tracked him down to his sister's flat (after the Andrew Road killings), he tried to lock himself in the bathroom and hang himself, but of course got thwarted by the cops lar..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Oh the NSF case i dun think they described much. Cos it was shown during the unsolved crimes segment where they dun usually try to re-enact too much, lest the re-enactment is inaccurate then the potential witnesses get misled. Think they only showed a video footage of the location and i just remember it to be very large, dark, unlit field with a path in the middle. Then in the next month's episode they just mentioned that thanks to public information, the case has been solved. Heh, guess that wasn't very helpful was it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
