Wonder there have or not..muaha!<br><br>Seems like the only gunman case they bothered to play back abit during one of the recent episodes was that case of the mata who kana shot thru the heart or something. Quite memorable for me, coz its freaking near my house! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>Hmmm.. got gunman case in recent episodes meh?<br><br>I remember watching 2 cases of matas getting shot before on crimewatch.. One was the Ah Huat episode (the fella shot and killed a patrolling mata but eventually got shot and killed himself by a whole group of matas who ambushed him in a coffeeshop) which was 10+ years ago, the other was more recent but a few years ago liao (about a mata who's gun got snatched away by some guy and after a struggle in front of a rubbish dump, the S&amp;W went off, the mata died and the guy made away with the gun. Eventually SOC was activated and the boys nailed him in some bushes with a burst from one of their mp5s)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Then he was constantly on the run, then dunno why got 2 policemen either patrolling or looking for him, he panicked, shot one of them and escaped. Finally got some lead so some plainclothes POs staked out the coffeeshop he frequents in the morning, and shot him while he was trying to pull out his gun, before he could have his kopi-O.<br><br>The second case was in 1989? Then its probably not the case that i saw.. cos that one i saw should be within the last 10 years one.. I still remember the scene where the SOC was flushing him out in some forested area late at night. They were advancing in 1 horizontal row and apparently that guy was hiding behind the bushes, panicked, fired a shot from his stolen mata revolver which knocked one of the SOC boys flat onto the ground. The others went prone, and one of them managed to nail him with his mp5. That has got to be one of the most exciting episodes in crimewatch so far lor.<br><br>There was another gunman case featured in crimewatch and that could be the 1989 case u were referring to, cos the episode was telecast very long ago liao. Gunman killed a taxi driver and i can't remember who else, finally got surrounded by a whole group of POs in a HDB estate. He then pulled the trigger on his own head.<br><br>Another memorable gunman episode was another super old case in the 80s, in one of the earlier episodes of crimewatch. 2 guys, 1 of them stole an m16 from his army camp, broke in to rob a house. One of them escorted the houseowner to the bank to withdraw money and when they returned, they killed the houseowner and strangled his wife. One of the robbers got very guilty, locked himself in one ot the rooms in the victims' house together with some kids and their tuition teacher and tried shooting himself with the m16. But that stupid bugger apparantly didn't know how to use the m16 so failed. He then gave his IC to the tuition teacher before making his escape.<br><br>Hiya, unfortunately nowadays crimewatch no longer has the drama of the episodes of the past. Nowadays its either white collar crime or some other not very exciting homicide, plus lots of crime prevention advice, wayanging by the police elite units, or traffic police advice..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Waaaahhhhhh..................<br><br>The Ah huat one does sound like the same case I was talking about...so the mata should be the plainclothes detective liao. If it was two cops in uniform patrolling and kana shot like that, it just seems to be like a typical scene from a Hong Kong movie leh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Your second case I am not too sure liao, coz I wasent sure what was the aftermath of the shooting except that the SOC was there trying to arrest him. Maybe I relate what I know about the killing itself and you might recall it better: Basically there was supposed to be two uniformed cops in normal patrol, then approach this suspect of suspects. For some reason I cant remember, end up one of the cops was chasing one suspect. They struggle on the ground, and the suspect manage to grap his gun and shot the cop in the head.<br><br>This happened at Tampines St 11 or something. It seems like the responce was immediate from the SOC leh...was it forested area? Dunno Tampines got forest in that area! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The 1989 case you mention dosent sound like the one above liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> No taxi driver kana lah. It only reminds me of a 1979 case in which a taxi driver and a mata was kidnapped from his post and murdered...it was on true files thou.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The m16 case...tsk tsk tsk. What happen to him in the end? Still on wanted list?<br><br>Yeah lah...nowadays crimewatch is just lidat. I can even remember once I was actually SCARED to watch crimewatch, because there was this episode showing the discovery of human bones hidden under garbage bags, and that spooked me for years!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.. ya, it might just be the Tampines case, anyway i dun think there're any other case of suspect grab mata's gun, struggle, then mata kenna shot.. ok, maybe not really forested but some bushes lar.<br><br>oh yes, I watched the case of the mata and taxi driver kenna killed in 1979 also, on True Files.. that episode telecast quite recently only.. Mt Vernon Camp, that sentry got dragged into the cab and murdered + revolver stolen.. everything witnessed by a woman staying in the police hostel.<br><br>As for the m16 case, they both got caught.. turned out only one of them was involved in all the murders, the one with the m16 freaked out and all he did was to lock himself in the room with the weapon, the kids and the tuition teacher. I think he got jail sentence, the murderer got death.<br><br>wah yes, crimewatch last time was really eerie.. there was one episode of someone returning home late at night and as she pressed the Door Open button for the lift in the void deck, the door opened and in the lift lay a dead body. I was very young then also, got really spooked.<br><br>Then i remember there was also this unsolved case of an army NSF returning back to camp late at night and since he was late, decided to take a short cut thru some dark and deserted track. He never booked in.. the next day a jogger found his body. Heh, and it didn't help that i saw this episode at an age when i'm still afraid of the dark.<br><br>Then there was this case in which a man who was venturing into some forest to pick rambutans stumbled on a highly decomposed corpse.<br><br>At that time I was always scared to watch crimewatch too, but couldn't resist either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
