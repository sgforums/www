              <p>my sisters have been calling the police about the noisy group of malays at the void deck since over 2 years ago.  she even wrote in but nothing good came out of it.</p>
              <p>these students are a nuisance, laughing and making a lot of noise in the middle of the night.  they usually leave before sunrise.</p>
              <p>dont they have to go to school the next morning? dont they even sleep?  i wonder what their parents are doing.  didnt they even notice their children weren't at home throughout the night?</p>
              <p>the police came many times.  we were told there is nothing they can do.  we were told to monitor the situation.  monitor what??? </p>
              <p>why cant the police take down their particulars and tell their parents and/or school?</p>
              <p>isnt a gathering of four considered a riot?</p>
              <p>is there really nothing that the police can do to stop this nonsense?</p>

              <p>How you know they are students? Are they malay or indian? How do they come/leave, bike or car? Do they come every night? how long do they stay?</p>
              <p>a gathering of 5 is illegal gathering. riot is something like alot of people walking around and hurting other people, smashing stuff up.</p>
              <p>they should take down their particulars. when they say they can't do anything, they mean they cannot arrest them for being noisy. they can do something like ask them to leave. </p>

              <p>for motorbike, can take down the license plate, for school uniform, take note of their school.</p>
              <p>you have actually saw them, so they came quite early and stayed til quite late?</p>
              <p>how late do they stay?</p>
              <p>the last question a bit dumb, but the police will ask you just to be sure. are you able to differentiate the malay dialect spoken?</p>
              <p>i can only advice you, but the complaints department will be the one to feedback about this.</p>

              <p>sunset to sunrise takes about... 12 hours, that's really really vague.</p>
              <p>my guess is they come at 9-10pm, stay until 2-3am? cos that also fit in the time zone.</p>
              <p>well, i am fresh out of ideas. how do you think the police can help you on this one?</p>

              <p>so they didn't woke you up with their noise, but is you hear them while you are awake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the police can do 3 things.</p>
              <p>chase people away<br>arrest people<br>take down people's particular </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i would advice is to be tolerant of your neighbour if they disturbs you once in a while. talk to them personally if the problem persists, and finally call the police if they are doing it to frequently.</p>
              <p>so how often do they come? which day of the week or month do they come? if let's say they come every friday after friday prayers, or the end of the month when they get their pay cheque, the NPC will be able to take note and send more frequent patrols on the more trouble prone nights.</p>

              <p>Hi, this can be consider noise pollution if it's happened between 2300hrs to 0700hrs. The police will come and take down their particulars and tell them to leave. Even they are staying in the nearby neighbourhood area. And advice them to maybe go to somewhere else, if they want to continue. Most of the time they will complied.</p>

              Smart, they leave before 11pm, cos that's the official curfew.
              
              are they reallie teenagers? In Britain, got the 'mosquito' box thingy that repels hoodies. Maybe, u can appeal to ur resident's council or even the police to secure the machine at the void-deck. Cos if they are teenagers, confirm they will leave immediately cos cnt tahan the high-pitch irritatin sound. If I'm not wrong, Downtown East at Pasir Ris do that, though it serves two purpose, repel birds by day and lepaks by nite.
              
              Though may backfire if they decide to counter with continuous loud playin of the guitar. Haha.

              <p>my sisters have been calling the police about the noisy group of
              malays at the void deck since over 2 years ago.  she even
              wrote in but nothing good came out of it.</p>
              <p>these students are a nuisance, laughing and making a
              lot of noise in the middle of the night.  they
              usually leave before sunrise.</p>
              <p>dont they have to go to school the next morning? dont they even
              sleep?  i wonder what their parents are doing.  didnt
              they even notice their children weren't at home throughout the
              night?</p>
              <p>the police came many times.  we were told there is
              nothing they can do.  we were told to monitor the
              situation.  monitor what??? </p>
              <p>why cant the police take down their particulars and tell their
              parents and/or school?</p>
              <p>isnt a gathering of four considered a riot?</p>
              <p>is there really nothing that the police can do to stop this
              nonsense?</p>
