              Sharing a true incident that had happened to my friend.
              
              A lady alone awaiting at bus stop listening to music on her iPhone along Robinson rd after work (6.30pm rush hr).
              Little did she know she was targetted by two China men in formal dressing, biz shirt &amp; pants. 
              When her bus came she walk towards it, didn't want to push or rush abroad her waited last in the queue.
              Juz then the 1st China man cut infront of her &amp; pretend to ask for directions from the bus captain. Following closely behind the 2nd China man queue behind her barely touching her bag. The lady was sandwiched in between the two China men, &amp; suddenly she felt a bump from behind.. the music went dead, thinking there was a in-coming call which might have stop the music playback she didn't check her valuables &amp; continue broading the bus. Both China men did not broad the bus &amp; left hastily. Upon seated she realized that her iPhone had been pickpocketed.  She approached the bus captain to enquiry what did the China men ask him about, she was told the China asked weird questions &amp; destination which the bus did not go. Clearly it was planned crime..
              
              Professional Pickpockets &amp; Thieves fm China of high skill levels are at work in cities, towns and neighborhoods both domestically and abroad. Pls warning your family members &amp; loved ones about the potential risks. Don't let down your guard thinking that Singapore is a safe place, densely populated areas are potential risk area of a crime. Stay alert!
              
              How to Avoid Being Pickpocketed
              1. Carry yourself with confidence. Pickpockets are drawn to people who look lost or confused. If you are lost, avoid standing on the street pondering your map. Step inside a business and ask for help.
              
              2. Keep your valuables close to you. Backpacks are some of the easiest targets for pickpockets. Use a front pack, or better yet, a money belt.
              
              3. Trick the trickster. If you are traveling in a city especially plagued by pickpockets, consider carrying an empty wallet in your back pocket. The pickpocket will return home with his supposed booty, none the wiser, while you escape with your goods.
              
              4. Know the tricks of the trade. Distraction is a favorite method of pickpockets. Criminals may work in pairs or even small groups, staging elaborate scenes designed to get your attention. While a crowd gathers to gape at a couple having a raging dispute in the street, an accomplice may be picking the crowd clean.
              
              5. Exercise caution in your compassion. While a child bends your ear about an invented plight, his sister could be helping herself to your wallet. Listen if you must to such stories but keep a free hand on your belongings.
              
              6. Check the travel advisories and warnings if you are traveling abroad. If your destination hosts a large population of thieves, your heightened awareness can help you avoid becoming a victim.
