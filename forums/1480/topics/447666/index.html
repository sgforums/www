              <p>hi, im thinking about trying a career as a senior officer under the singapore police force..<br>but there are certain questions which are hard to find answers to.. hope brothers and sisters here could enlighten me..<br>i graduated from SIM University of London with a 2nd lower class horners...<br>am 26 years old this year, and served army during NS period as a Armoured engineer 3rd sergeant (i took up leadership course during sispec).. throughout my 3 years after ORD i continued to train and maintain a relatively muscular built and silver IPPT..<br>whats are the chances of being selected into the senior officer program?</p>
              <p>2nd question, theres little known about how the senior officer training is gonna be like?<br>my guess is that its kinda like a 9 mths recruit lifestyle? book in book out issues? kena tekan often? cuting botak? with a few oversea training to add in?<br>(personally i do wish that i do not need to relive my life in BMT and SISPEC again though)<br><br>3rd question, i guess a smart phone will not be allowed during trainee phrase but will u be allowed to carry a smart phone after one pass out as a potential inspector?<br><br>thanks for answering my questions in advance<br></p>

              1) Can't tell you much about chances. This is pretty much manpower dept considerations that not much people are privy to.
              
              2) The training is residential. You will be doing PT in the morning, then classroom lessons in law and police procedures in the afternoon and PT/ Police Self Defensive Tactics Lessons in the evening again. It's free and easy after 6pm as the trainers work on a 9 to 5 basis. Book in on Sunday night and Book out on Friday evening. Won't kenna tekan much. It's nothing like the army culture since police officer work in a more civil environment and therefore all the trainers treat the senior police officers with respect. No cutting botak. Overseas training will be a trip to Nepal for about 2 weeks. Climb Mountain. Before that, there should be a trip to OBS.
              
              3) Smartphone is allowed during training phase. HTA allows camera phone and everything. No such restrictions when you pass out as well, otherwise you can imagine the trouble at police stations when members of public carry such phones into the station.

              Small tattoo that are not visible should be ok but don't quote me on this
              
              Police Officers are not allowed to smoke at all. That being said, there are of course a lot of people who do it on the sidelines, so just don't get caught. But it will be tough to find somewhere to do it in HTA.
              
              The pay is your full pay. A 2nd lower should give about 3.2-3.4k

              Hi Chen.leonard
              
              The degree is applicable if it is recognised by the civil service. RMIT should be on the list of recognisable universities, so you should qualify.
