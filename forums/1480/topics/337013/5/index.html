              Interviews are always standard.  Remember to tell of how you want to do the Singapore Pledge thingy and how much you want to do the job, even if its just doing admin.
              
              Pros?  Maybe seeing things which not everyone sees in their normal life. Maybe the uncle doing a cat, the beautiful china nightclub hostresses &amp; the homes of some people.  Where they keep their stuffs and who buys or distribute drugs, vcds, have children and what their children are used for in their industry.
              
              Plenty of cons....like what ChrisBeniot does....whines, complants, insults &amp; there is plenty from people who felt they are innocent and smarter or whichever they believes themself to be.
              
              CNB work can be pretty boring and exciting one time to another.  Within 3 minutes, you can go from sitting quietly in the car to running down some folks...Or in instances, try to grab that stupid kid from the window after the granny opened the gate.
              
              Or you see mothers pinching their baby to make the baby cry as a warning others planning to go into a flat to buy drugs.
              
              or druggies stayng in cheap hotel rooms and errr....generally making a mess of themselves. Maybe after robbing some cars for $$$ to buy those drugs.
              
              CNB work has irregular timing, so if you are planning for degree studies, you have to arrange your time properly. It wont be easy and it takes plenty of discipline to do so.  I rather people takes sabbitical instead of studying while working.

              <p>any officer from the CNB, irrespective of rank, has the right to enter a place and search it, as well as anyone in it, if they have sufficient grounds to believe that any drug-related offences have been committed. without a warrant.</p>
              <p>if you want to see the entire thing you can seek out section 24 (1) [the entire portion is divided into 5 different portions] of the misuse of drugs act, cap 185.</p>
              <p>this effectively renders your argument... ineffective.</p>

              <p>1. the actual events of why CNB is bad is either presented badly or not discussed at all<br>2. the production will be lame.<br>3. the poster will not dare show his face, at most use his voice.<br>4. it will try to be, but won't be funny.</p>

              Chris, even with your production or your script writing.....is totally lame, i hope you do find someone that shares your fantasy to produce such a program for the general public.
              
              It might help to make criminals dies laughing instead of cnb or police officers needing to catch criminals.
