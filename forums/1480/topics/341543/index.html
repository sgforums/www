              <p>Helo!<br>I'm a graduate from a local polytechnic this year and couldn't find any job yet.<br>I've thought of signing on with the Singapore Prison Service and I'm due for a selection assessment this week.</p>
              <p>I would like to know how's the working life of a Prison Officer like? <br>Maybe prison officers like to share their experience?<br>What does a female prison officers do?</p>
              <p>I'm also thinking of continuing my studies to a local university. And as you know, universities' application is open in Feb and results of application is in May.<br>Should I just wait till after I get my U application results?</p>
              <p>By the way, how's the selection assessment like?</p>
              <p>I'm sorry if I asked too many questions.<br>I just don't want to make the wrong choices and regret later.</p>

              <p>I think this concerns money more then making a choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. If you can afford a degree study, then attend the assessment but tell them Prisons no thank you. You want to finish your degree and join as a SO later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you are not selected for your degree class, that gives you a few more months to work at getting into the classes.  You can be working in part time jobs or in some cases, make use of your diploma, even if its for a few months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If it was a matter of generating income to support your Degree Class, then please tell them no thank you.  Because unless you choose to do your degree class maybe two years after your sign on, or you do it part time two years after you signed on.  You are looking at from paycheck to mouth kinda situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either way, both are because you wish to persue further studies.  Not because you wish to join the prisons due to any higher calling.  Then I rather you focus on your priority, which is your degree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont think part time studies is going to be easy.  Not unless you have been working a while and studying part time for the last 3 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then,  I dont know you.  Who knows......you might just be able to juggle those responsibilities.</p>

              first priority is always to get your degree...thereafter, if you want to sign up as prison officer - at least you will be a senior officer - with rank potential at least ASP.
              
              Unless you intend to apply for Prisons Scholorship ....
              
              No point signing on with your diploma, you lugi as you become junior officer which is in a way, a ceiling for promotion.  Moreover, being a female officer, you can only serve in Changi Women's Prison - where in a way, not much institutions for you to move around - unless of course you are posted to HQ.
              
              if you want to kill some time between now and university enrollment, can always take some part-time lessons eg: learning a language or learn driving.
