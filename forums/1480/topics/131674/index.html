If you have a recogonised degree you can apply as a HASE officer why take up a MSO post which pays you so little... Anyway if you though of converting from MSO to HASE its not as easy as being a PO --&gt; SO. As civilian is mostly staff work your work is not as recoginised as a Police Officer. So think twice before you apply as an MSO. An MSO has different grades 1 - 5, Hase if i am not work 1 -11. But so far no one hit 1 for HASE. Anyway good luck dude... =) Any more things you need to clarifiy i will be away for the next few days tho! =) Take care!</div>
