So its nothing to avoid at lease keep your fitness level there la! Find sometime to jog when you are posted out! At lease during off days go jog around your neighbourhood at lease your stamina is maintained!<br><br>As for the other like pull up etc... Its up t you how u'r gonna train! =D<br><br>- Cheers!</div>
