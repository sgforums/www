              <h1 class="clr">One year jail for Singapore cop who attacked maid: judge</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Feb 17, 2009 (AFP) - A vengeful Singaporean police officer
              repeatedly assaulted his Indonesian maid for "innocuous mistakes," a
              judge said in explaining why he sentenced the officer to a year's jail.</p>
              <p>High Court Justice Kan Ting Chiu issued his judgement earlier this month, a copy of which was obtained by AFP on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Lawrence
              Lim Hwang Ngin, who held the rank of police staff sergeant, was found
              guilty and sentenced to a total of 12 months' jail for assaulting Tri
              Utami, 23, five times between January and May 2006, Kan wrote.</p>
              <p>Lim, a decorated police officer, was acquitted of eight other charges including sexual abuse.</p>
              <p>During
              two of the painful assaults, he kicked her abdomen several times, while
              on other occasions hit her in the head, the judge wrote.</p>
              <p>"The
              circumstances leading to each assault were the minor innocuous mistakes
              of a domestic maid, made without any defiance, disrespect or
              dishonesty," the judge wrote.</p>
              <p>He said Lim had disliked Utami
              since he chanced upon her shouting at and shaking his infant daughter
              violently. He wanted to fire the maid but his wife dissuaded him, said
              the judge.</p>
              <p>"The assaults were not spontaneous lapses of
              self-control. They were the vengeful reaction to the maid's continued
              presence in his house," the judge wrote, accusing Lim of abusing his
              position as a policeman.</p>
              <p>He issued his written argument as both
              the prosecution and Lim, a former detective out on bail, appealed the
              sentence, The Straits Times reported Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Advocacy groups say
              about 170,000 migrant women, many from Indonesia and the Philippines,
              work as domestic helpers in Singapore, where cases of employers abusing
              their maids appear often in local media.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower has said that 90 percent of maids are happy working in the city-state.</p>
