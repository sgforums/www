            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I suppose some understanding might just help to lighten the situation here. Why not ask him what his job scope is really like, what his working hours is, and where he usually operates from, if he is comfortable to reveal? It helps alot more for you to grasp his responsibilities and foster understanding and compassion (for both sides, in fact. I suppose he will be glad to know that you care enough to ask), then to ask us who might not know exactly what conditions he is operating in.<br><br>And as far as mobile receptions are concerned, it is indeed true that problems arise, depending also on which operator you are talking about. For example, a distance from the mainland to Pulau Ubin can already result in zero reception. Let alone further out into the seas around Singapore.<br><br>But better yet.....ask him about it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Just my 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But even police officers do have different way of working. Just take an example, I have a friend from XXX NPC, he usually go back from NPC at around 9 plus after work....  as for another friend from YYY NPC, his supervisor actually can have debriefing till at least 10 plus every work shift....  Both are NPCO but due to different supervisor, they work differently....<br><br>As for not having his handphone on during work, can due to alot of reasons. For eg.<br><br>1) Switching on HP might cause interference with equipments<br>2) Supervisor does not allow their "men" to carry hp while working<br>3) Officer does not have the habit of using hp while work, so he switch off<br>4) Some area might needs auto roaming as the reception might be poor<br>5) He might be from STS and hp needs to be off during work<br><br>etc etc.....<br><br>Perhaps, you can ask in nicely why he cant be contacted during work.... or you can actually know more of his colleagues so you can ask them in the future? Or you MIGHT want to get help from forumites whom are from PCG?<br><br>Hope my reply do clear your doubt in some way, do post more question if you are unsure....  But you can at the same time can ask him more if you are not comfortable about his job scpoe as its a form of respect in a relationship....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well all i can say is that, just ask... and understand, learn more about what he's doing... or just notice the pattern of the work hours...<br><br>i work shifts, i'm not in SPF btw. and i won't know my timing until the day before. But there is a certain timing... i won't say mine is that complicated to understand, but i do tell my gf what time i start daily... what time i finish i can't confirm also. I am also recallable too.<br><br>sometimes during work i can't pick up the phone either, i put it to silent and i check it end of work...<br><br>well i guess its up to ur bf whether he wants to let u know more or not.</div>

OSA (plus PGO, PPPO, and all that kind of stuff), and the person I am talking to in the first place loh (as in, in terms of trust, how receptive he/she is to the information given, and what he wants to know it for, etc). Obviously there is no hard and fast rule as to where the line is drawn, and whether one actually wishes to stick more to one or the other of the above two factors is a matter of personal integrity and accountability with regards to his profession, yet knowing that he has to reassure his loved ones and manage his private life at the same time?<br><br>It is as much a struggle for the officer as it is for his/her loved ones, obviously.</div>
