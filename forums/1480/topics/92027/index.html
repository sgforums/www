Haha<br><br>1) As a voulunteer you can choose your "working hours". Hence you can make the necessary arrangements.<br><br>2)The training phase has been increased, the last I heard. Used to be 6 mths trainings, 2 X a week. Now have been increased to 8 mths. There is an allowance for missing trainings. But of course for major things such as tests cannot miss lah.<br><br>3) From what I know, you can choose to serve in PCG as VSC. As for detective work, VSC are not incorporated into detective work. A simple explaination would be that it's not realistic to expect VSC to be able to follow through a case. You have your full time job.<br><br>4)This one I can't answer you for sure. I know you can quit but as for whether a bond is in place, I don't think so but I'm not sure. It is also this reason that during the interview phase they will try to weed out all those that are likely to quit early or drop out during the course.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okok....excellenct attempt, mal, but here is a little bit more info as an add-on from the "real vsc". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>1) For the MAJORITY of cases, and usually if you were posted to an NPC, the workings hours are pretty flexible. For the most liberal NPCs, you merely need to notify your TL/DTL your intentions to appear for duty either for tomorrow or even a few hours later, and you can knock-off at any time you so prefer. However, that is only for the most liberal ones. In the vast majority of cases, like my own, I commence my duties along with the regulars, when the briefing is held. This is usually at 7 am for the morning shift, and 7 pm for the night shift. Thereafter, we usually serve at least 4 hours, and up to 12 hours for the full shift. Of coz if you manage to earn the trust of your TL/DTL, he might let you knock off at anytime you like! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Flexibility with regards to which day you wish to report for duty can be slightly more tricky. In my NPC's case, VSCs are posted to the 4 regular teams, with each one taking turn to serve duty on a 1-2-O-O bases. As far as possible, I am encouraged to follow my team, as ultimately, it is my assigned TL/DTL who will be grading me. But given the constrains usually experienced by VSC officers, they tend to allow us to join other teams.<br><br>With regards to PCG, the flexibilty thing seems more murky. I have not had a chance to catch up with my friends who got posted there, but prior to our graduation, we were told that PCG officers have to serve the full 12 hour shift no matter what, since they cant have the boat coming back to base at our fancy. However, from what I have heard (and is not 100% verified) from current PCG VSC officers, they seem to swear that they could knock off at a time of their convenience in actual fact!<br><br>2) For the exact timings, they tend to fall on Mondays and Thursdays from 1830 to 2230 hours. However, midway through the course when you have to go for range lessons, you might have to come on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays, depending on their arrangement, as usually, they would split the class into two days given logistical constraints.<br><br>Every absentism has to be "explained" by writing in a formal letter, and if valid, will be noted down accordingly. Failure to submit an explination will then render you "absent"...which is in theory a black mark on your records. When we first came in, we were told that we cannot miss more then 3 lessons....INCLUDING absentism with formal reason or MCs. But subsequently, you might soon find out that is really depends on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>I myself missed one of the lessons, which was actually a test date, as I have an examination paper, but no sweat. I simply joined the replacement test. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>3) For your initial posting, NPCs and the PCG will mostly likely be your only option. They used to let fresh coarse graduates enter the Traffic Police etc, but they have now decided that they want us to "gain basic policing experience on the ground" first. Detective work, as per case investigation, is not in the purvey of VSC officers as pointed out by Mal, but from now, it seems like CID itself has actually opened up places for VSCs? Not too sure, but you might want to inquire more on that!<br><br>4) Absolutely no bond of any kind. Jesus...you are volunteering your time and effort without getting paid (well..okok there is a small allowance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ), and they want to bond you for it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Well if you have to quit, you just have to submit a resignation letter, and they usually wont ask too many questions. In fact, you can even rejoin after quitting. Of coz if you didnt bother to submit, went MIA, and was subsequently dismissed, then that is another story!<br><br>Hope I am not over-rambling, but feel free to ask more if you need to lah. I do not mind helping in thei recruitment drive! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I am just a little kaypoh because I scared I will be the odd one out in a class. haha...<br><br>Thanx in advance!</div></blockquote>Haha...here goes....<br><br>1) Oh yes there is of coz a "promotional scheme" of sorts. You can be considered for a promotion after every 3 years. In some cases, you can jump ranks right up to INSP from SGT even....so if you are super zai, you can be an SPO in 7 years!<br><br>Ok lah..so that already tells you the fact that there are SPO VSCs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>2) Yes, lessons at PA (most of the time). Most folks do find it a rush too...and actually, now that there is a wonderous 5 day week thingy and more and more people are going to be forced to knock of later, you might have an adavantage in that. But anywayz....shhhh....but in actual fact hor, they take the time from 1845 lah..hahaha.<br><br>And no worries....there is usually a break midway through, so there should be time for a bite loh.<br><br>3) Towards the end of the course, everyone will be asked to state their choices.....I was given 2 choices. Some land divisions are not to be selected as they have no more vacancies available. Specialist units like TP are also not to be selected....except PCG and Airport Police (which happen to be closed for me too as they are full). Clearly, they want all of us to get a grounding in basic policing first. These selections are then reviewed by the manpower folks and bosses loh...most ppl do get at least one of their choices lah, although they are some who didnt even get any choice.<br><br>Basically, the "better educated" folks tend to be put into land division....so they say. Last time, those below O levels have to go PCG, but now, they are not recruiting them in the first place anyway, so I dunno liao.<br><br>But in summary, you know how the civil service works lah. Some gets their choices, others dont. Nothign is set in stone, and things arent as transparent as we would have liked. But I am not complaining coz I got my 1st choice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>4) Muahahaa.....or you just want to noe if its mainly aunties or sweet damsels in the course? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ok on the more serious side, it sometimes actually depends on which course. For eg, my course seems to have more middle-aged folks, who form about 80% of the cohort. But in the next course, it looks like half of them are in their 20s. Of coz the younger ones do stand out sometimes, but it can be for a good reason! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Erm..do you happen to be in your 20s? I was 23/24 when I joined, and I felt young amongst the guys. There are quite a number of younger gals thou..coz their min age is 18 I think.

I am not to sure what is the expectations in this forums, but I believe, I, like the rest here, are around to share experiences, and learn from each other loh.

Over time, more and more people start to warm up to this form of volunteerism I suppose?<br><br>Maybe 10-20 years down the road, the profiles of the SPOs might start to be rather different!</div>
