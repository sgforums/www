            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Public sector told to shed up to 8,100 jobs </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To use manpower better, agencies are asked to trim staffing by 3% annually over the next 3 years or pay a surcharge<br><br>OVER the next three years, Government agencies must cut their staff by 3 per cent annually - or cough up $10,000 a year for each extra officer.<br><br>The measure, just announced by the Finance Ministry, applies to a pool of about 90,000 public sector officers. It excludes teachers and the Defence Ministry.<br><br>Meant to help ministries and statutory boards use their manpower better, the new framework took effect from July 8 and may lead to the vanishing of some 8,100 jobs, the Business Times (BT) reported yesterday.<br><br>Though not an 'exercise in blindly reducing headcount', the ministry told BT, it will require agencies that do not cut back sufficiently to pay a 'headcount surcharge' of $10,000 a year for each officer above the 3-per-cent limit.<br><br>According to the Finance Ministry, the surcharge would add up to less than 2 per cent of ministries' current expenditure on manpower, even if staff numbers are unchanged after three years.<br><br>Also, the 3-per-cent figure 'is less than the annual average attrition rate - resignations, retirements and other separations - of ministries and statutory boards,' it said.<br><br>In his Budget Debate roundup speech in March, then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said the government was considering a 'headcount tax', to counteract 'some slackening' since a headcount freeze ended in 1996.<br><br>Under the new plan, 'ministry groups - ministry headquarters, their departments and statutory boards assessed as a group' should seek to cut total headcount by 3 per cent each year in Fiscal Years 2004, 2005 and 2006.<br><br>However, numbers should not be cut 'just for the sake of meeting the reduction,' the Finance Ministry noted. The aim is not to 'simply remove current officers and require the remaining officers to work harder'.<br><br>It said: 'The reduction can be by way of productivity improvement, lower recruitment, job redesign, re-prioritisation of functions, streamlining of services, and so on.'<br><br>The Government has previously spoken of a need for measures to curb the rise in civil service staff numbers.<br><br>Total headcount of ministries and statutory boards grew 17.4 per cent from 1996 to 2003 after a headcount freeze by the Finance Ministry was lifted.<br><br>Agencies have been issued guidelines to help them scrutinise their functions and their manpower use. Just how and where to make the adjustments will be left to individual ministries.<br><br>The new move does not affect the beefing-up of the teaching service.<br><br>In his National Day Rally speech last month, Prime Minister Lee said that by 2010, the government hopes to hire 1,000 more teachers for primary schools, 1,400 more for secondary schools and 550 more for junior colleges</span><br><br>WAH... SPF to cut jobs if so since MHA is included? I think only MINDEF and MOE Education Officers are exempted.<br><br></div>

However, if my memory serves me right, recruitment for Senior Officers was stopped for a period of time and was only resumed earlier this year.<br><br>Oh is that a case for positions of Senior Officers throughout MHA? SPF and even Prisons, somehow they do not require anymore Senior OFficers? Yeah.. and I think even HASE too.<br><br>Looks that MHA no longer requires university grads unless you are a scholar?<br></div>

But I guess that is necessary ? The ICA officers that I've experienced recently do not merely go through the passport, they actually do a physical scan on the individual? Make sure that the photo in the passport matches that of the person?<br><br>ICA officers and CISCO officers also check ever single car that passes through? I remember it use to be random check perviously. I guess that may be the main reason of the one hour wait?<br><br>Even the police officers at the customs are seemingly more alert? I actually see them walking around a fair bit instead of only sitting at their post?<br><br>I'm glad to see how MHA officers putting in efforts to make our home a safer place.</div>
