              Hi I am posting this for my cousin sister, She was caught in shop theft. She did it by mistake and made it since her husband will not allow to purchase the cosmetic item. The cost of the whole items are 90SGD. She was left in bail, the police have her bag with them for investogation, in which she carried the items out of the shop. 
              They have asked to come after two week on the day of arrest. When she went they asked to come after two more week. After the second two week she went to meet the IO officer. She could not meet the IO officer. And they said that it is still in Investigation. It have almost 5 weeks now. She is so stressed. Not at all normal. She is crying all the days. Regretting for what she did. And feeling so guilty to see our face.
              
              And the days are extending. She is going still worse. I am trying to convice her. Can any one advice what have to be done. This is her first time time. She is in EP. Should we approach the Lawer. Or Should we go and try to meet the IO officer again. When will they call us? They said that they will update us. Its so stressful. Please help.

              Rednano, on hearing your words it gives a break for us. But the days are keeps on prolonging. So we are so tensed about what will happen. Due to this no one in family is happy. I asked a person, he said. If it is still open for investigation. They will call you to the court. If they call her to court, lot of worries. 1) Will they say Jail punishment . 2) Her future career. We were happy in Singapore. Will this happiness last or will we be asked to return back to country.
              So what we have to do. Should we go to police station and ask the IO officer for forgiveness. Or should we go to Lawer... Please advice.
              
              Right 'Summer hill'. Accepted. Its really a blunder mistake. She has punished herself a lot by crying. And fully in stress. Its a real lesson.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks FireIce for your reply. The case is already at police station. The shop have handed over to police. Will it be possible to settle out of court. If I go and approach the Shop (Giant), will they accept penality? Hope that should be depend upon the shop. Let me make that try as well.</div>

              I am worried to know what will be happening during these investigation days. I studied in a forum that one person after one month asked to come to HQ and informed that the person is charged and to come to court 23. So this info is scaring us.
              
              Rednano,  if you have knowledge on what will be consiquence, how we have to be prepared ourself. Please help. What will be the result. It will be a great relieve if the officer leave her in warning. 
              
              We should never ever go against law. This is a big lesson.
