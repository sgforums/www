            <div class='col-md body'>I'm posting regarding an incident that happened to me last night that shows how our Police Force is becoming badder. Pls share your honest views.<br><br>I was at Serangoon Road for the Deepavali pasar malam with my friend. Then there were cars that were parked at the double yellow line and 2 police officers were issuing tickets. They were police officers not the parking officers nor Traffic Police. So they were standing on the pavement and talking to a lady in the car. Then as there was no place to walk,as on the right the grass was muddy and the had the car, i walked behind them,squeezing my way past. Then i accidentally banged one of them and his papers dropped. I turned around and i said 'Hey very sorry'. Then the police officer just stared at me, he just stared like those gangsters do when they have a problem.<br><br>He gave that look and just stared. Then i said sorry again. He just stared angrily. Then he looked down as his papers had fallen and stared back at me. Me and my friend just stood there. Then he asked 'Why must you bang?' I said 'sorry ah not purposely what, i was walking you can see there's no space and why must i bang you?' Then he continued staring. I was angry as well because this was completely absurd. It was a complete accident. I would had happily picked up the papers for him had he not given that f uck face. I mean accidents happen and i had appologised as well.<br><br>If you bang into a stranger,even they forget the matter when you said sorry. And here was a police officer, showing off his authority and staring at me and trying to intimidate me. Even his officer seemed shock at what was happening.Then i told him again as he was still staring angrily 'Look i already told you i'm sorry, what more you want, you think i wanna bang you for fun is it?' At that point my friend held me and said 'F uck it la,let's go'.<br><br>I mean fine it may be my mistake that i banged accidentally. It was not as if i sent him flying. It was purely accidental. Even strangers tend to smile or walk away. Sigh. Please share your views.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah it's true. I agree. But you are in uniform. I don't think that's the way you should give an example about the Police Force of Singapore. What would tourists think? He may be angry but if that is the way you want to give an impression while on duty, then i'm sorry for thinking that Police Officers must show character while on duty. If that's the case, then i accept that its my fault..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>where's Tigeriffic when you need his wise words?<br><br>well what happened here is a case of human emotions and nothing more.<br><br>yes, police officers can issue you tickets, not just TP. so dun be surprised.<br><br>from what i see, the condition that the paper that dropped was probably quite bad after it fell. this leads to super alot of BAD issues that potentially the policeman was going to face, seeing how our paperwork is a controlled document. furthermore, doing paperwork is really a chore and say u have a stack of documents right, like beforehand you had interviewed people one, you cant possibly go back and look for them just for a re-interview, know what i mean?<br><br>so in that few seconds he just had to release all the frustrations of this happening and maybe all the stresses of being a policeman. add that to the menace of STOMP-ers. you have to understand, all these forms are quite serious, we might even be charged if some of these are ''vandalised''.<br><br>however, im sorry for you being a victim of this. it is really hard to put on the police uniform and pretend like you're someone else who is a saint of some sort. if you think of it like that, you would understand it better.<br><br>to the issue of the above, yes he should have informed the public that he could come down to station instead of demanding.<br><br>hope i got this right tiger!</div>
