No - what i see is just a inconsiderate young man who has himself to blame !!!<br><br>Why you can see police doing their work, you could have at least put more effort to not distrub them and let them do their work.<br><br>Next you bang into people ..... people thing fall down, ... if it is pretty lady you super fast pick it up for her .... so if it is a policeman or old lady .... just whisper sorry and stare only ... How you know the police staring at you ... you staring at them first .... standing there staring and not help pick up the mess you created ... so who started the trouble ... you. !!<br><br>Seem more like you bully the policeman and still want to be a cry baby and complain .... .why next time you go little indian ..... you want policeman to escort you all around so you do not bang into any more police ?</div>
