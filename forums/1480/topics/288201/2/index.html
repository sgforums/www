Projecting the good image of Singapore law enforcer is important. If not,I think all Singapore Police officer can smoke while on duty and visit Geylang pros.Cos they are also human and got their needs too,right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Please share your views.</div></blockquote>I'd agree with VJunkie's assumption, i.e with the area being muddy and all, it's highly possible that the controlled forms were in a physically bad condition after the fall. I think that could be the main reason why he looked less-than-pleased with you. Add dirty unused forms to dirty used ones which need following up on, and what you get is a person who gets possibly irate.<br><br>I wouldn't be too quick to jump the gun though. You have to understand though that what you offer the forumites here is your perspective, and to be fair, perspectives are always subjective.<br><br>For example, to you, he could be staring at you and attempting to intimidate you. But it could also be possible that he was just looking at you the normal way he looks at people. He might, or he might not. My point is, you wouldn't know him well enough to tell. He might be a moody fart, or maybe he just looks like he's got a permanent scowl.<br><br>Likewise your choice of words. 'sorry ah not purposely what, i was walking you can see there's no space and why must i bang you?' and 'Look i already told you i'm sorry, what more you want, you think i wanna bang you for fun is it?' could be your way of explaining yourself, and likewise he could have seen it as your being rude or smth like that, depending on the tone you use. No one else here knows what actually transpired except the four of you and maybe one objective eyewitness, i.e. the lady in the car.<br><br>If you asked me, I'd say that all this is just a misunderstanding, brought about by assumptions. For all you know, he might not think too much of the entire incident, or he might even have forgotten the incident altogether. Don't take it to heart lah. You're only spending unnecessary energy doing so.<br><br>Cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>PS: VJunkie when you passing out?

            <div class='col-md body'>I would had happily picked up the papers for him. In fact when i said sorry i realized the papers had fallen and when i took 1 step forward i saw his reaction was the very screwed up kind, the way he was staring and stuff. Thus i decided not to pick them up. After all, it was not on intention.<br><br>He dropped his papers on the road which was very dry as only the grass on the right hand side was muddy. But well, like i said, he was in uniform and thus that was not wise in my opinion.<br><br>Fine the way i talked may had been rude but i appologised sincerely and nicely at first,but well....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, just treat it as an unfortunate encounter then. No point you expend unnecessary energy recounting the incident right? You'll only tire yourself out. If you deem the fellow to be a bad example in uniform, then that is your perogative. If you'd like, as some forumers have suggested, you can write in to feedback on the person's behaviour.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just remember one very important thing: one bad encounter you experienced doesn't mean the entire Police Force is bad, okay? You do a great injustice to the rest of the Police Force who risk their lives everyday doing what they do.<br><br>In the meantime, relax and enjoy life.

It's their passion that brought them to join, you think they'll throw such attitude while in uniform?<br><br>Regulars, IMHO, have totally no reason for doing so.

I believe that TS's description is a response from which how he had treated a PO.<br><br>If the TS had banged into a normal person standing on the street....is the responses of that person any different then that of the said officer?<br><br>Or its just a matter of uniform envy resulting in TS continued rambling against a PO?</div>
