              <p>promote to sgt in 1 year is nsf.</p>
              <p>for regular cpl, norm is 4 to 6 years.</p>
              <p>There are regulars whose house is walking distance from their NPC. posting is subjected to openings</p>
              <p>Take diploma. pvt degree not all recognized by govt. degree recognized by govt usually needs diploma/A level to enter.</p>

              <p> Hi Vitasoy,</p>
              <p>1st for all, do let me welcome you to the family of SPF.</p>
              <p>do let me enlighten you the following : -</p>
              <p>1) Since you are new, and if you really want to have a better future... isnt it better to ask your fella colleagues? Do you think posting it in the forum will help esp when you dont even know who is the one that is answering you?</p>
              <p>2) Do take note, everything changes including culture, practices and even advices from your so called "lao jiaos". nothing is definite till you see it and experience it yourself. There will be some guides from OC Squads as they are suppose to tell you the different depts and their pros and cons. The rest is up to you.</p>
              <p>3) As for promotion, it will come when its time.... if you work hard enuff, your management will see it and reward you...  no point asking... why even worry about promotion when you are not even confirm in your rank now?</p>
              <p>4) In short, nothing is impossible in SPF. You can get promote fast (I know those who got their SI below 35 yrs), you can get sponsorship etc etc....  if you choose this career, just make sure you like it and enjoy your stay here and stop worrying about things that you dont even know it will ever happen to you anot unless you have tried.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. in case you are wondering, i just another MOP hopping around this forum.</p>
