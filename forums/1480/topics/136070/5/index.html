Actually such cases can be managed in a more professional manner. We too look at the confidence level of the POs. In such scenarios, POs can do screening of the woman's identity with the details provided. Record down the details and move on.<br><br>PO do not simply listen to the instruction from NEA officer. We should know our empowerment. If it is not a seizable offence, then there is no need to bring the woman back to station. That can be sorted out with the NEA officer quite easily. They can issue summon to the woman but that doesn't warrant them to make arrest.<br><br>PO will usually detain the subject based on reasonable grounds. Acertain the situation and detect offence(s) if any. Arrest to be made when offence(s) is detected.<br><br>In the event that the woman's brother and the woman are making a fuss in public, PO should immediately make the detention and ferry back to station. Simply fact - pulic nuisance.<br><br>Just my view.<br><br>Its good to share experience here....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

They have other work to do.<br><br>Try bringing what I said up to your committee.....some already had a earful of my assessment of previous intake graduation ceremonies.  They should then be able to tell you who I really am.<br><br>And tell the Committee Chairman/person.  Keep the speech short sweet &amp; simple and skip all the nagging pleasantaries.
