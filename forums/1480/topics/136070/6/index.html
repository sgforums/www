Any shorter and you risked showing off cellulites &amp; interesting ugly veins.<br><br>For attending any ceremonies, please at least attempt to drop by a hair salon to do up a low bun, especially if your hair is long or touching your collar.<br><br>Please also try to put on some light make up so you dont look totally washed out.  A lipstick and light blusher make a big difference to how alert and smart you can look.<br><br>Luke, do inform your ladies that is a lot of hair salon at chinatown Pearl's Centre that they can go in a group to bun up their hairs before their ceremony.</div>
