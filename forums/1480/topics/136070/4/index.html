I enjoy seeing the way their eyes widen when they ask how long our training period is. I got a better sense of just how "unknown" VSCs are other then by name amongst regular POs for the past month when I volunteered for the IOC as well as NDP duties, and got to know plenty of officers beyond my own NPC. The POs from NPCS with no VSCs are particularly comical, almost according us "rare specie" treatment for the fact that they know so little about us.<br><br>Then again, maybe this ignorance prevails only in my division? Hopefully...haha.<br><br>I was refering to POs encouraging individuals to join the VSC. Of coz I am not expecting them to go round pushing the idea across. But if they happen to know of individuals who appear to suit the "job", but who didnt know that VSCs exist, why not highlight this to them? And if we have SCs who are about to ORD, or regulars thinking of making a career switch, why no open suggestions of the VSC as a possible organisation to join when they move on in life? (I do have these people mentioning to me personally about their intentions or considerations in joining the VSC thou. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)<br><br>In other words, I do find it strange that POs are not doing this most of the time. they are probably the best embassadors for this, and the only time I actually saw a PO "promoting" the VSC was when a PO from Queenstown NPC decided to bring along some VSC flyers for distribution when we had a joint CSSP exhibition with NUC NPSS at NUS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Is there any rule/guideline/SOP/ etc dictating that POs cannot help promote the VSC? If this view prevails, then does it not present a institutional huddle which inhibits the growth of this organisation, a huddle which does not have much reason to be there?<br><br>And I dont see how "mindsets" should be a huddle either. Yes, joining the SPF as a regular or a VSC does mean quite diferent priorities in life, but both have a common objective. As I alluded above, a strong VSC staffed by capable and committed individuals is surely a boon rather then a bane to the SPF in general, provided of coz the institutional structures allow these talents to be utilised in a productive and optimal manner, something I personally think the VSC still has some way to go. But thats besides the point. If a PO knows of someone who is happy with his employment as a non-PO, but who displays potential in policing and national security issues, yet knows little or nothing about VSCs, I just dont see why this PO should subsribe to any "prescribed general interest" in thinking that joining the SPF as a regular for this individual is always the best option for him, and hence push the idea of switching jobs instead of dropping the idea of joining as a VSC instead?<br><br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>That was very nice long in depth stuffs you typed.<br><br>I can only hope your passion for police work does not fizzle out in 2 years time.<br><br>I believed I've already typed on top which could go something like:<br><br>To talk, to be interested is one thing.<br><br>To really commit to volunteer is something else.<br><br>And its not something you may be prepared to understand as yet.  Give yourself some more time in the VSC to understand why some do what they do, why some make it their career to do what they do and why some are not recommended to do so.<br><br>And POs are not aware of what VSCs does in terms of training and recruitment.  They were not provided the experiences nor the training or the know how as its frankly not really their business.<br><br>You however, are living testimony of what a VSC is about.  Keep up the good work of helping to let others knows of the VSC.<br><br>And for the POs, even if they were not aware of what VSC has to go thru.  They only try to recruit those that are worth keeping, and these recruits, are usually Ex-Regulars/PNS/VSC which does not require to go thru the lengthy Basic Training.<br><br>In other words,  if POs recruit, they will request to take in those they can trust to work well.  No anyone from the street that can easily dropped out of the VSC at the slightest difficulties.<br><br>Take your own Orientation/Swearing In ceremony and measure against the actual passing out.  How many of you can say you made it?<br><br>And the VSC training is still less then 1/8 of what normal PO training is about.  We can say we trained for 9 months....but once you minus out the days and the hours......we are more like NPCC of 4 years of Secondary School.</div>

Yes, joining the SPF as a regular or a VSC does mean quite diferent priorities in life, but both have a common objective. As I alluded above, a strong VSC staffed by capable and committed individuals is surely a boon rather then a bane to the SPF in general, provided of coz the institutional structures allow these talents to be utilised in a productive and optimal manner, something I personally think the VSC still has some way to go. But thats besides the point. If a PO knows of someone who is happy with his employment as a non-PO, but who displays potential in policing and national security issues, yet knows little or nothing about VSCs, I just dont see why this PO should subsribe to any "prescribed general interest" in thinking that joining the SPF as a regular for this individual is always the best option for him, and hence push the idea of switching jobs instead of dropping the idea of joining as a VSC instead?<br><br>Why? What wasted opportunity!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>I guess promoting VSC or joining SPF or whatever it is should really be left to the individual - can't just over-generalise and say that POs don't know about the VSC etc. or that more POs should promote the VSC. Some don't even like their jobs - promote VSC / joining SPF??! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>My friend told me that sometimes VSC work seems interesting in part because they can choose what they want to do eg. volunteer for IOC / NDP or special raids / patrols. For regulars whatever function / raid / duty small or big if kena arrow then no choice no choice. So I guess POs have more incentive getting people to join the regular core - more manpower to share the bo pian work.<br><br>Many VSCs are enthusiastic of course, but I think the true test will come when you actually have to do the bo pian work - can you still do it with the same degree of enthusiasm? I think that's the gap which separates VSCs and regulars. Of course some regulars will do the work half-past six and half-heartedly but I think they would still do it - no choice, government can punish, can cut salary etc.<br><br>No matter how many similarities there are in terms of uniform and policing powers the huge difference is that you can't compel volunteers whereas police officers must do certain duties. Certainly some VSCs are very committed, but no need to prove / argue that VSCs are as good as / on par with regulars - just acknowledge that there's a difference. I think the cross-over VSCs who became regulars can attest to that if there are any on this forum.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To add on to the previous post, another reason POs are not so enthu about promoting VSC could be because ultimately it's more acceptable for a regular officer to get injured in the line of duty. Not so acceptable in the eyes of the public for a volunteer to get injured. So some POs might feel that they have to protect the VSCs they patrol with and might deem it an extra liability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chowwaikein:</div><div class="quote_body">So are VSC an asset or liability?</div></blockquote> Depends on the particular person. And depends on what you mean by liability. If Jackie Chan joined VSC (police story!) could be an asset but if he drives police cars like his evo IX then could be a liability <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> (to the govt for all the bald tyres).</div>
