            <div class='col-md body'>Since no one will willingly ask or learn.<br><br>But still, here are information for those that actually does know how to read the forum.<br><br>Always count your cash before your duties and has it witnessed by other officers how much you have.  Especially if you are carrying large wads of it due to your normal work nature or <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> what your wiffey allows you to carry.<br><br>Keep your jewellery &amp; rolexes at home.  If lost, if broken during a struggle. These are not claimable.<br><br>Avoid carrying a fat wallet. Just bring along some cash, your ATM card &amp; a EZ link Card.<br><br>(Cash for makan or drinks should you want to be generous and share your foods; ATM card for when you didnt have enough cash; EZ link card is for when you got lost &amp; wants to take a public transport back to your station.)<br><br>Always keep with you, a spare black pen besides your normal Red &amp; blue/black pen.  And lots of wads of recycle paper/notepads.<br><br>Or like me, if you want to. Buy those blank name cards.  They are extremely useful cos they are colored.<br><br>When times you need to collect the names, NRIC and contact numbers of subjects, you can distribute those, make them write it down and collect them back and fill up the log sheets later.<br><br>On days when you are attending to one case straight after another. It helps tat your cases/details are color coded and you can sort out and filled up the logsheet later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Viciouskitty74, Thks for the info.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hi all,<br><br>let's not let this forum become such a bitter space and become so sour and heaty lah.<br><br>words are words, they can easily be mistaken, let's all be objective, or at least try...what one's had posted may not have been interpreted as what it actually meant, ain't the golden rule suppose to apply, if not sure, ask? simple and politely will be best...  afterall, this is just an Open forum, a space in the Internet, anyone at best is just an element in that space. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In life, am sure everyone will have their own preferences, views and objectives, judging whether it's right or wrong, well, it could be very subjective. If it's not to anyone's liking, everyone could always make clear their stand, and need not try heating up, till anyone think someone had win. IMHO, sometime moving away with minimum damage is best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>no one wake up to do a bad job, so it doesn't matter which organization one serve, I sincerly believe all had a part to play, why linger on who's contributing more or less? why linger on who got more respect or not? a choice is a choice, we chose to be there, and of course we could choose to leave. I would expect no one is in-expandable, if not, how could any organisations survive, should someone decide to throw in the towel and leave, or perhaps become unavailable one day?<br><br>above are just mine view, I do accept human being are different, and there are variances in everyone, please do not read between the lines, every words used are elements that form this posting as a whole, in summary, I wish.... let there be peace.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
