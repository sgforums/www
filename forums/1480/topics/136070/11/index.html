Both my friends failed to get into VSC cos one failed the psychometric test during his interview with the SPF and the other simply failed during the VSC session.

As long you are not releasing the content and context of the test, I believe it is fine. It should not be considered as breached of OSA unless stated otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Yes. It is your right if you are a Certified Dentist, Doctor or holding a PHD.<br><br>Same with Marine or Aviation titles.<br><br>Within the VSC, we have doctors, dentist and even Container Ship Captains.<br><br>Examples: Dr Jimmy Yap (Dentist); Capt Vincent Wee (Sea Captain) &amp; some others.<br><br>However, army rank titles is not transferable to VSC service unless there is special provisions allowed by PHQ.<br><br>And no.

The CDI back then (Koh Beng Geok I think) wanted them to wear their badges and march in the GOH during National Day.
