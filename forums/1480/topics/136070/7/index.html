However, only on that first day we found out that our course is 8 months long and we must make 80% attendance or fail the course.<br><br>I think most people quit after the first day is because of the attendance issue.

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on folks, don't be so bitter lah, after the postings by romancetan on not disclosing stuff this thread is going a bit downhill ... No need to post graphic details about superman cases just to spite him ... After all if you were the family member of the jumper I think you wouldn't want to hear about cats eating the brain. Let's focus on what this thread was about in the first place i..e recruitment into the VSC. Viciouskitty, what times are the trainings for VSCs in the evenings? And which days?</div>
