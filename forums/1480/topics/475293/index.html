              <p>Hi! New here! I need some help here. I am inspired to become a policeman and I had email SPF these question but they did not reply anything...</p>
              <p>I would like to know what is life like in HTA. When i enter HTA as recruit, what are the things or course that trainee have to attend? What are the time span? Also, are there special courses like OCS in the Army? Also, what does it takes to become an CID officer? Or investigating officer? How long do I need to take before I can become one? Lastly, promotion is based on what? Does qualification affects it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you very much for your help and I will really appreciate it!</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">If you got through the recruitment. I assume you are talking about a Junior Officer. If so, you will be enrolled to HTA for a 6 mths trainning. During the the first 3 mths you will be botak. For the next 3mths will be subjected to Course Commanders discretion. I can't disclose much. Though i will say life in HTA is 50% of SAF whatever you think it is. Most of the time you spend in HTA is studying. IPPT is an important factor for your consideration to join HTA. <strong>If you cant pass your iPPT or due to any accident which got yourself injured and unable to carry on with the course you might get terminated</strong>. <strong>To put it simply anytime you turned defective during the 6 months course you might get terminated</strong>.To apply to be a CID officer you need to be an IO first. which takes approximately 3 years. Promotion is based on your contribution, staff appraisal, IPPT and marksmanship. Not sure about qualification :)</p>

              <p>Correct, for the first three months,it is your Basic Training,or BTC in short where you will learn all fundementals of a police officer.You will learn footdrills,revolver shooting,Police Defence Tactics, Police SOC, Physical Training and Basic Laws and Procedures.Your IPPT will be once per month in your BTC,in which you MUST pass at least to proceed to the next phase,Advanced Training or ATC.Here,you will be like a NPCO in training.You will learn what does it takes to be an NPC Officer.Just an advice from me who is inside HTA,life is quite fun provided you do the right things and stay clear from nonsense,or else life will be like hell for you especially as a regular trainee,your conduct,turnout and bearing is supposed to be much better than NS trainees.</p>
