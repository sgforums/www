Kena f***ed by him upside down, left right and centre lol. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But he has his point or rather brain right in the first place, by not clashing head on with the "finder" using a violent method, afterall he was a head shorter and many pounds lighter than the "finder". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Thanks for the advice anyway, Ito_^. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway, this case of LOST hp has been declared as CLOSED!<br><br>So thank you all who had contributed their views and advices on this subject.<br><br>Now lets move on to another interesting case, LOST of Singapore Identity Card.<br><br>One of my working colleagues lost his wallet and hp in a public toilet last Friday.<br><br>After calling up all of his credit card banks to cancelled his cards and starhub to blocked his sim card, he went to his home nearby NPP, wanting to make a police report on his LOST I.C.<br><br>But he was shocked when told that the law has changed, as such there is NO NEED to make a police report if one lost their I.C.<br><br>Instead he was told to make a report on his lost hp, the officer asked my colleague to leave and comes back again with the imei numbers of his hp to make a report.<br><br>Obviously, my colleague was shocked and he was lost for words at that moment, but recovered shortly to asked the officer "what if my I.C. was being misused by the finder to commit wrong doings?"<br><br>The officer did not answer directly to his question and just repeated the earlier statement that the law has been changed, as such there is no need to make a police report for loss of I.C.<br><br>Then my colleague asked "why then you are prepared to make a report for my lost hp but not I.C.?"<br><br>Once again, the officer did not address the question directly and simply said the imei numbers was being asked for record purposes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>What the heck is going on here??? That was my colleague then and mine now question.<br><br>A LOST hp is deemed to be a more important personal article than a I.C.??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For the past few days, my colleague was having sleepless nights and worrying that his I.C. might fall into a wrong person hand.<br><br>Fearful and worrisome so much that my colleague was prepared to tell a lie and make up a story that he was being "robbed" of his wallet and hp, so as he could make a police report in black and white, recording on his loss of I.C. and others possession.<br><br>What the heck is going on here???<br><br>That is the question i am putting forth to everyone who are familiar with the law or the operation of our SPF/NPP in regard to this matter.<br><br>Thank you all in advance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>YH</div>
