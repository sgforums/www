            <div class='col-md body'>Saw this article in "Today" newpaper under the forum section.<br><br>The reader identified himself as VSC. Is this allowed?<br>I mean, I thought soldiers and policemen are not supposed to communicate with the press?<br><br>----<br>TODAY, 7 Apr 2005<br><br><strong>Nabbing a cop's gun not easy </strong><br><br>Police are well-trained in unarmed combat while lanyards secure pistols<br><br>Letter from Lai Seow Hiang<br><br>I refer to the letter, "Armed police officers at food centres raises concerns" by Mr Steve K Ngo (April 5). The writer is appalled by armed police officers queuing up to buy food, citing security, image and disciplinary issues.<br><br>I am a member of the volunteer police constabulary. So, I think I am qualified to speak as a member of the public just like Mr Ngo, but with the added knowledge of how policemen operate.<br><br>Mr Ngo mentioned that he has seen policemen queuing up with other patrons in crowded outlets during peak hours and that was the root of his concern.<br><br>His statement showed that policemen are disciplined enough to queue up to<br>buy food to take back to their station to eat, instead of cutting the queue and expecting to be served first.<br><br>He mentioned that policemen's pistols are not loaded. That is factually wrong.<br><br>He also mentioned that if someone attempted to snatch such a weapon, a potentially dangerous situation could result.<br><br>I am puzzled. Who in the right frame of mind would want to go snatch a policeman's weapon?<br><br>I can tell you that all policemen are trained in unarmed combat as well as how to use the T-baton.<br><br>They have to pass these two modules before they can pass out from the Police Academy. Yearly tests are conducted to ensure that policemen are competent to defend themselves as well as to protect the public at large.<br><br>The pistol is secured by a lanyard to the policeman's belt. So, there is no question of somebody snatching the pistol away.<br><br>Mr Ngo also stated that he has seen officers parking police cars by the roadside or in non-designated parking areas while they are buying food.<br><br>I am quite surprised that he was lucky enough to see such incidents and on many occasions at that.<br><br>I do know that drivers of police vehicles take great pains to park in designated car park lots when buying food.<br><br>Perhaps, he can share with the Police Public Affairs Department the details of where he saw such incidents.<br><br>We should be grateful that Singapore is a relatively safe place to live in today, due to the collective efforts of the Home team and other security agencies.<br><br>Perhaps, Mr Ngo would like to consider contributing from within and apply to serve as a volunteer in the Home team, if he qualifies, instead of expending his energy over issues such as policemen buying food.<br></div>

As an additional safeguard, their revolvers are secured in snatch-resistant holsters.<br><br>As for officers parking their cars by the roadside and non-designated parking areas, our officers are subjected to the same traffic laws as others.<br><br>Unless attending to an urgent case where speed is critical and there is a lack of parking space, officers are required to park their vehicles in proper carpark lots.<br><br>Thus, officers stopping at the food centre for their meals should park at proper carpark lots.<br><br>Our officers are guided by rules and regulations to ensure that their conduct and behaviour in public are appropriate and professional at all times.<br><br>Members of public can contact our Service Improvement Unit at 1800 358 0000 should they see any officer behaving inappropriately or any police vehicle parked indiscriminately while officers are not on official business.<br><br>We will look into the matter and take appropriate action.<br><br>Letter from Tristan Sim<br>Assistant Police Director (Media Relations)<br>Singapore Police Force</div>
