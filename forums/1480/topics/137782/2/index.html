Need to know my facts too... =)</div></blockquote>To add on to luke's comments: The above says that urgent cases should be attended in 15 minutes, but that of coz is only a guideline. When you actually witness a crime in progress, call 999 and tell them specifically that a crime is <strong>in progress</strong>. This is very important, because this will then ensure that your situation will be given top priority.<br><br>The message will be relayed to the resource responsible for your area. Should this vehicle be available, it will be rushing to your location with lights ablazing. If not, the next closest car is activated and so forth. As you would expect, the time taken is dependent on the number of resoures available, the distance of the closest resource, and the road conditions etc. Urgent cases like these are always given priority, and will not be treated lightly.</div>
