              <p>Well, my wait for this position is more then a year. I applied for SPO in May 2012 after I left the military. I was still 3/4 into my university studies, completing in Nov 2012. I passed the SA in June but failed the Dialouge Session in July. I was told that I can reapply in a few months time. </p>
              <p>I tried reapplying in Oct and Dec but was rejected after a few days. I even tried applying for PO but was rejected too. I reapplied for SPO in January 2013 and I  was called up for SA. From then on, I manage to get pass all the stages till Medical Assessment. I just attended the medical assessment and now waiting for their answer. </p>
              <p>The wait for each stage is painful long but I'm still holding on .... I hope to get a postive answer soon and start with the intake ASAP.</p>
              <p>For those of you guys who are still waiting ... press on. </p>

              <p>@haha2006: the medical checkup consists of 3 stages. The first is to measure ur your body statistics like height, weight, blood pressure, urine test and drawing of blood for hiv test. Second u will be interview by the doctor asking u various related or random questions to check for listening or speech defects and some check on breathing and heart beats. Last of all u will do ur chest xray. The entire process took around 1.5hrs for me. But I went during non peak and it's raffles medical for us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@James: really respect ur perserverence and dedication. hopefully we will see each other in the next upcoming intake!</p>

              <p>@Paige, I think you are 1 of the faster 1s that got through (where you are right now) thus far; just a gauge for all those applying and waiting, i applied in January same as Ma'am Paige, response wise, my experience is that i usually waited &gt;2 weeks after a round for them to call/sms/email me, to fix an appointment a few days later, so it could drag up to 1 month between stages: i.e. Apply in jan --&gt; SA in feb --&gt; dialogue in march --&gt; psych in april --&gt; panel in may and now medical in june.</p>
              <p>On that note, i finally got an email ytd for medical appt next week, which i really really am thankful about it. Cos' i went for panel like last month mid-may, so when the ppl like Ma'am Paige who went for panel on 31st may got their notification for medical before me, i literally panicked =/</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, I think they are starting to filter and consolidating the final list of ppl still in the running liao - across batches; so i guess regardless of which period you apply in or which date you went for SA, for example, early jan or early feb, there will come to a point of time whereby all the remaining people (who have yet to be eliminated) are consolidated as list of potentials. uhh so i guess, as long as your status is still shortlisted ar, means still got chance. Have some faith and patience. (blah who am i kidding i freaked out couple of times myself hahahaha) but seriously nothing you can do abt it but wait.</p>
              <p>Hmm Sir Weymas, you batch direct intake only got 10 only ar? wah siao liao lor, like that confirm means 'medical doesn't mean getting in liao'. I mean, according to sgforums, seems like Sir James, Sir Haizz, Sir Gecko, Ma'am Paige, and myself in process of pre/post medical and waiting for the july intake (hopefully). Plus the volume of people queuing for medical checkup during this period and those who finished medical (not identified on sgforums lol), i can only infer and estimate that there's gotta be more than 10 people in limbo waiting for the next intake? wah so if confirm 1 batch intake around 10 ar, that can only suggest more filtering after medical stage oh.my.god =S</p>
              <p>Anyway jiayou ar. to those still waiting, have faith. do your best. oh also wanna salute Sir James for his determination and wanting to join spf. /salute =)</p>
              <p>On a side note, Ma'am Paige, when you submitting your transcript ar? you NUS oso? uhh NUS webby say transcript application locked until next month (even after the 20 working days from results release) due to commencement admin prep duhhhhh.. like that how ar lol</p>

              <p>That s a nice encouragement. In fact my could be considered as fast too. Having done February the SA till 19 June medical.. Think it's somehow like after 2-3 weeks a milestone being met.</p>

              <p>but I believe we will be in the same batch of medical has no issue :) </p>

              <p>@Paige, I think you are 1 of the faster 1s that got through
              (where you are right now) thus far; just a gauge for all those
              applying and waiting, i applied in January same as Ma'am Paige,
              response wise, my experience is that i usually waited &gt;2 weeks
              after a round for them to call/sms/email me, to fix an appointment
              a few days later, so it could drag up to 1 month between stages:
              i.e. Apply in jan --&gt; SA in feb --&gt; dialogue in march --&gt;
              psych in april --&gt; panel in may and now medical in june.</p>
              <p>On that note, i finally got an email ytd for medical appt next
              week, which i really really am thankful about it. Cos' i went for
              panel like last month mid-may, so when the ppl like Ma'am Paige who
              went for panel on 31st may got their notification for medical
              before me, i literally panicked =/</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, I think they are starting to filter and
              consolidating the final list of ppl still in the running liao -
              across batches; so i guess regardless of which period you apply in
              or which date you went for SA, for example, early jan or early feb,
              there will come to a point of time whereby all the remaining people
              (who have yet to be eliminated) are consolidated as list of
              potentials. uhh so i guess, as long as your status is still
              shortlisted ar, means still got chance. Have some faith and
              patience. (blah who am i kidding i freaked out couple of times
              myself hahahaha) but seriously nothing you can do abt it but
              wait.</p>
              <p>Hmm Sir Weymas, you batch direct intake only got 10 only ar? wah
              siao liao lor, like that confirm means 'medical doesn't mean
              getting in liao'. I mean, according to sgforums, seems like Sir
              James, Sir Haizz, Sir Gecko, Ma'am Paige, and myself in process of
              pre/post medical and waiting for the july intake (hopefully). Plus
              the volume of people queuing for medical checkup during this period
              and those who finished medical (not identified on sgforums lol), i
              can only infer and estimate that there's gotta be more than 10
              people in limbo waiting for the next intake? wah so if confirm 1
              batch intake around 10 ar, that can only suggest more filtering
              after medical stage oh.my.god =S</p>
              <p>Anyway jiayou ar. to those still waiting, have faith. do your
              best. oh also wanna salute Sir James for his determination and
              wanting to join spf. /salute =)</p>

              <p>1) u should be C5, since C4 just came in this Monday.</p>
              <p>2) yes u can use camera phones in HTA (doesn't apply to NS men and regular POs)</p>
              <p>3) no dress code, but dress in smart casual at least</p>
              <p>4) as long as its neat and sideburns trimmed, it should b fine</p>
              <p>5) anywhere between 1-3 mths after u come in. Don't worry plenty of PT to help u.</p>
              <p>no prob, I was also from SAF and was equally clueless.</p>

              <p>after staff posting, if i'm not mistaken you get to indicate your preference (though u may not get it, depending on manpower needs) as to where u would like to be posted to. so your working hours will depend on where you eventually end up.</p>
              <p>don't get too hung up on the working hours cos u'll most likely spend more time at work than expected.</p>
