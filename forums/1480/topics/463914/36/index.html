              <p>Would u want to give them a call to find out when is the
              earliest/latest they can give u an answer?</p>
              <p>As you mentioned, it will not be difficult for u to secure a job
              in the private sector, I would think it will be better to check
              with the recruitment to see if theres any forecoming news before u
              make ur next move. It'll be a pity if u are originally suppose to
              be the next in line and u gave up the opportunity. Sometimes its
              not easy to follow ur passion but we've gone thru so much to get to
              this stage..........</p>

              <p>Congrats @rockymaivia! Yeap its C1 2014 - i signed my bond last week. I realized all who came to sign were starting on different dates - between 26th dec to 2nd Jan ... we are all in the same intake :))</p>
              <p>@Muchogusta - I agree with @Rleeps and @rockymaivia. Perhaps you could give recruitment a call or something to find out on updates. The friend I made during one of the interview hasn't gotten his call as well. </p>
              <p>You could keep the application going while you have another job in parallels. That's what I did as well, was doing a permanent PR job - just made sure to let recruitment know that I needed a month's notice and all. Don't let what others say sway your thoughts. Ultimately, its not going to do any good if you're going to get a job and later have a 'perhaps I could have waited' thought at the back of your mind. </p>

              <p>Hope we can identify each other in TRACOM (like our friends from the Dec 16 intake)! cos' that would be awesome - especially since we've built quite a camarederie in this forum being there for each other as we go through the whole application period. </p>

              <p>Hi everyone! Congrats to u all making to C1/14! With that I believe it closes the chapter for 2013. It's really nice seeing the others like jo88,James, garyckl , randomhh and sharkyu. In training. Our squad is very cohesive too. Once you guys are in, can find us for any help. Though we are still learning too, we will help you guys in anyway we can. </p>

              <p>Hey all!</p>
              <p>First up I must congratulate everyone who have made it through the selection :) I must say that this thread has helped me a lot to endure the long waiting period. </p>
              <p>I am curious though, has anyone who is going for the 2nd Jan intake received any information about the coming orientation camp?</p>

              <p>Hi silvernitrate,</p>
              <p>Congrats on being called up for SA. For SA, jus be in long sleeve and pants. It would be suffice. No interview will be conducted that day.</p>
              <p>For transcript and Certificate, its alright if you are unable to furnish at this juncture. Jus inform recruitment when is your convocation or period that you will be receving it.</p>
              <p>PES status, if you are from SAF, call up CMPB to let them know about your issue and seek advice. If you are from SPF, call up your PNS office and ask from them.</p>
              <p>All the best for your SA! dun have to be stress now. Because more stressing moments are at the back when anxiety builds up. Good luck!</p>

              <p>Still waiting for the call! It's been almost 5 weeks since my medical. At some point while waiting, they called me to send documents over and also asked if I needed notice period. Heard that two had been offered for the feb intake! They called them before feb. The intake would be 19feb though. The wait is so ..............  </p>
