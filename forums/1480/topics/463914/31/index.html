              probably open with standard HR questions (who you are, your
              background, where do you see yourself in 5-10years, etc) followed
              by knowledge/opinions on matters related to SPF, crime, even public
              service (the recent "hacking" incidents/threats are potentially
              questions as well!) as well as situational questions. Remember that
              they are seasoned police officers, so do your best and don't try to

              everyone for that!! :)</p>

              on 16th Dec! Will be gg to Vital for signing soon. Hope everyone
              gets the call you've been waiting for soon. Hang in there!! :)</p>

              <p>This is based on my experience. If you are rejected at any stage, you will need to wait for 6 months after your rejection date before you can reapply. </p>
              <p>I have enquired about degree holders joining as JPO however they said that currently SPF don't have such scheme yet.(May have changes, not sure when)</p>
              <p>I think that the education qualification is determined at the selection assessment when applicants are told to bring the orginal certs and transcript for verification. </p>
