              <p>didnt receive any calls. was recruitment following up to a precious call that you made, or they just initiate a call to you to tell you the updates?</p>
              <p>so in two weeks, you would know whether you make it, or in two weeks you would know the details i.e date of the intake?</p>
              <p>good news for you then! </p>

              <p>Hey Haiz2006, </p>
              <p>I guess thats good news ... especially for those who have their panel interview and medical done between april - june(including myself). </p>
              <p>I have tried calling them but they always tell me that its still processing. Good to know that there might be news coming in about 2 weeks time. Yeah .. just as curious as the rest .. how did you get them to call you and who contacted you ?? You can pm us if its ok. </p>

              <p>I think what I did was very much in common to what most of you did..</p>
              <p>I did not call to clarify but went to their roadshow on last weekend to drop my name and explain my case request them to call me. So took them few working days to really call me. Yes they do not want to confirm the offer though they asked those doubtful questions "as if" they are confirm my availability. So it's still the same answer as "under processing" like u guys... It more about 'out of courtesy' to give a call to me for updates.</p>
              <p>but somehow asking my notice period needed proves something I guess... But no confirmation yet. Wait continues </p>

              <p>Received a call from SPF yesterday asking me whether I've attended my convocation and that I needed to go down to submit my cert and transcript today. (but that doesn't mean I'm in the course yet, will receive another call from them regarding confirmation).</p>
              <p>A few hours later, received another call from them telling me that I'm being offered the position of SO. Training will begin 14th October but 9-11th October will be orientation. </p>

              <p>Anyway, with SA in July, AD in August, I finally got invitation to psychologist dialogue next week. I really hope things will get faster as the time goes, and now i am beginning to panick for panel interview 0.0.</p>

              <p>Yup. Just received today. Exactly 2 weeks. So i guess for those who do not receive any news 2 weeks after the interview is safe. </p>
