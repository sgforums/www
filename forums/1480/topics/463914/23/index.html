              <p>Same. I got the call like 5pm earlier. Was expecting a month wait or so. When was your panel may I ask?  But still, the longest wait is gonna be after the medical. </p>
              <p>Mid oct is gonna be C7 if I'm not wrong. C8 and C9 will be in dec tentatively. May change. So you can gauge its about another 2 -3 months of waiting before they finalize up the pple in each intake.</p>

              <p>Hi guys. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing if there are enough DEs: they might make a Nov batch instead of two Dec batch. Called up recruitment today to double check on my status, and hopefully I'll be in the Oct batch, but if not, I was told the other two months.</p>
              <p>For anyone's reference, my case was a bit different. Applied early from overseas in Dec. Was told to attend SA in Jan but couldn't make it, so went for a later date. Then my process timeline was such:</p>
              <p>17 April 2013 Selection Assessment<br>28 May 2013 AD Dialogue<br>19 June 2013 Board Interview<br>Asked to email certs 5th August 2013, Medical 7th August.</p>

              <p>Hey all ^^ I'm glad that many have received good news recently ^^ congrats to all who have succeeded n all the best to the rest who r still in the process ^^ </p>
              <p>@ Muchogusta and  Szee14: looks like I'm in the same stage as u guys ^^ similar to everyone who has ever waited or who r currently waiting for their panel, I'm getting that nervous n anxious feeling too... May I ask, when did u guys have ur clinical interview? If the dates r close, we may get the same date for the panel too... Mine was on 5th Sep... </p>
              <p>@ Whyzee: u mentioned reading up on some SPF matters as a good way of preparing for the panel... Could u give us an example? Like, what r we suppose to know? </p>
              <p>Also, for the rest of the ppl who have already gone through their panel, example Haiz2006, randomhh, dvjesyjomh<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 17px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);   -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><strong> </strong>n the<strong> </strong>rest, Could u give us examples of the types of questions asked? Anything that u can remember will be helpful n much appreciated by the rest of us, myself included of course ^^ for instance, do they still ask the same questions as during the dialouge sessions? Like "why do u want to join SPF?", that sort of typical HR questions? Did they ask any weird or unusual questions? Also, how many ppl will be on the panel? N how many of them will be the ones who actually interview us? </span></p>
              <p>Thanks alot ^^</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think there were about 6 - 7, but usually only 1 person will be asking the questions. Yes there may be the standard HR questions as an opening, but they may throw in other random questions. There is no real point in keeping all the same questions as AD Dialogue because... it would defeat the point of a further assessment. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">It would probably be good to be aware of the recent/current events and issues SPF has been involved in prior to your interview. Also, the direction of the interview probably depends on you as well as them. Interviewers must react too. I hope that helps!</span></p></div>

              <p>Hi Rleeps,</p>
              <p>There are 6-7 pple at the panel interview. 3 will be at commandant lvl. So any of the 3 commanders or all of them can ask you questions. </p>
              <p>read up on recent police issues and matters. Such as policing system. There's a change since last year. Its a good to know knowledge. There are also standard HR questions which they may ask. More commonly will be ques that may require you to suggest your idea or solutions pertaining to an issue that you may identified on your own. So a generic ques posted and the direction of interview will be base on your replies.</p>
              <p>Hope it helps.</p>
              <p>Hi guys! </p>
              <p>Called up recruitment earlier to inform I have recevied my academic transcript and also asked on intake month. the reply i got was there will be intake in either Nov or Dec and its not confirm. Jus wait patiently for their calls. So i suppose the intake dates for C8 and C9 arent cfm too.</p>

              <p>I am being offered SO, many might be envied but dream is a dream.... I have to make a painful decision to reject it... Marriage is next year end, planning will be tough..followed by 1.5 yrs of long working hours, shift work takes place next.. Those stand bys and uncertainties she anticipated, plus with house coming in 2014 end.. Too much things in mind, fiancée unable to support my decision.. With me rejectin it, she has tremendous guilt and if I take it I an putting everything at a risk.. With the bond, u can't run.. I regretted I did not try out earlier but as a mid career change I have to experience outside life first..</p>
              <p>past 6 months of waiting we are both avoiding the discussion while she hoping I can't get it everyday.. Bombshell finally came that I was offered... Haiz, </p>
              <p>With those minimum danger posed to a SO role, there is still an element of danger in pursuit of suspect, stand-bys and recall back during your quality time with family will happen too.. When dream and reality clashes, the reality overwrite the dream move... </p>
              <p>For those who dream to be one.. I wish u all the best and being a policeman or woman, family support is important.. I am willing to sacrifice I might look back in regrets and stick on to my boring job.. But losing the loved one and cause so much tension btw us is just not worth it.. Tell me.. This crossroad comes really at wrong time.. </p>
              <p>Dejected...anyone got second opinion? It's so close yet so far</p>

              <p>Hi haiz, </p>
              <p>I agree family support is really important. She may not support u as she may not know alot about the police force. How about trying out VSC instead? You can throw 2 birds with one stone. 1. U get to experience police life 2.u get to continue your current job. Maybe after seeing how much u enjoy the police work, she might take one step back n let u try out for SO? </p>
