              <p>that's great news. psychologist will take about an hour, but it's non-fail stage so just go speak truthfully and prepare yourself for the board interview.</p>

              <p>well it's only been 2 full working days since ur dialogue.. give it a few more days, i'm sure they'll call u or at least notify u wrt the status of ur application.</p>

              <p>hi, just wondering if there is any females in this thread for apr intake 2013?</p>
              <p>98168 i went for the interview on the same day as u so u'll probably know me as i was the only female there.</p>
              <p>anw just in case any females see this thread, some qns which i had that other females may have:</p>
              <p>is there a need to cut hair(i was very concerned about this as the girls i saw in OPA had boycut, scared the hell out of me for sure)? NO, there is no stated rule, the regulation is (i quote the female officers) tied and fringe out of face. reasonable enough.</p>
              <p>is the physical training tough for females? again, according to the female officers, so far everyone passed it so it should be manageable. </p>
              <p>will there be a case where there's only a female in a squad? (i asked this as i was the only female for interview that day) NO</p>
              <p>i received my psychology interview which is next week, according to my friend from MHA it's a no fail, they just want to test your mental state of mind. </p>
              <p>i'm wondering, does ur cert determine which rank u'll be posted to? or do they take into consideration the training period?</p>
