              <p>Hi James,</p>
              <p>Can understand and feel your agony in this long waiting process. Plus this is your 2nd application with the force. I think good news will come to you eventually. During medical assessment, I asked the staff how long will it take for our medical reports to SPF. She mentioned that its pretty fast. In a matter of 2 to 3 days (With blood test result). So it depends on how fast recruitment act upon it. Rejections will come fast if meducal fail? since you have did your medical some time back and there's no rejection to it. you should be fine. Cant do anything more den just to wait. =) Hang on.</p>

              <p>Hi ndsxo, congrats! Can I just check how long you were waiting

              <p>@james.wlr, have you heard from them? I have called the past two
                  Mondays, the second time I called they were less accommodating in
                  their response, saying that the only thing they can say is that the
                  application is still processing. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I did not study locally, and I am not sure if
                  that is affecting my application, or medical or what

              <p>Yes it has been increased till 60, but it's not mandatory. U can still choose to retire at 55. If u want to work till 60, it is subjected to several conditions such as work performance, health/fitness, and whether the organisation still needs u.</p>
              <p>Also, u can work till 60 but ur SPO INVEST scheme (I.e. retirement fund) stops at 55, and u cannot withdraw it until u reach 60 or choose to retire.</p>

              <p>when i called two+ weeks ago to ask about my status, he just said that i need to go for specialist check-up and that they will call me to tell me details. until now, still nothing.</p>
              <p>i tried to ask him what was wrong, which part of my body needed medical attention, but he still say that he will call me up to tell me details. </p>
              <p>i don't even know what is wrong, and the ironic thing is that it pertains to my own health. go figure. </p>
