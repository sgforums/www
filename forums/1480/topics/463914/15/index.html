              <p>Ahhh alright, I was just afraid that they might forget about my application, especially since I don't see anyone else waiting such a long time for SA.</p>
              <p>Anyway can I just ask what info will you be required to provide during SA? I read that there will be some forms filling and you will need to provide 2 character referees details, but what details exactly will be needed? Also, do you have to provide family/relatives details like their salaries etc?</p>

              <p>Hey Kaching, I sent my reply end-Apr, and was overseas till June. I only got invited to 10 July's SA after that. Try emailling them to tell them of your situation again, at least that's what i did.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">During SA, you will be doing a 3 hour long of  psychometric test, forms filling, physical assessment, verifications of the documents which they will email you wth the invitation to the SA.</span></p>
              <p>I believe that the 2 character referees you mean are the sureties required only in the bond signing part, which will come much later. Family details are required (but not salaries i think), but only need to complete the form by the next round. </p>

              <p>I assume you will graduate in about July? Since it takes about 6-7 months, I would say the best time would be around October, November where it will coincide nicely with your graduation.  </p>

              <p>I think you should pace ur application to meet ur convocation. As wat I understand is that, if u apply too early or still in studies, they will collact ur particulars and put u on hold till you graduate. Priority is given to those who have graduated fully and ready for training. So perhaps u can apply 3-4 months ahead of ur convocation. My 2cents worth. =]</p>

              <p>Hmm, yes whyzee, I heard about the put on hold thing too. but that only applies for people who have applied so much in advance that the entire application process finishes earlier than the person graduates. The entire process takes on average about 6-7 months, so in my opinion, it is better to apply in October/November.</p>
              <p>From what I know, the most recent intakes were on 10th June, 1st July and coming 29th July, so approximately about an intake a month? But I am no expert and I think either weymas or gecko would better be able to answer that.</p>

              <p>as of now it seems like there will be an intake every month. last i heard, there will be up to 9 or 10 intakes this year.. C6 will be coming in on 29th july, so tt means there'll be at least 3 or 4 more intakes for this year. don't quote me on this though.. always expect the unexpected in SPF.</p>

              <p>I shared in several post earlier. This year's SPF Workplan with
              vital org has outline 9 intakes for SPO. C9 is scheduled to be in
              on mid oct. with bulk of rank and file already filled up the
              intakes before, the remaining intakes would have more direct
              candidates. I am foreseeing the entire selection process to end by
              sept. Lets hope we can make it by mid oct and be squadmates
              together. =] hold on guys!</p>

              <p>They called me up and asked me to go for psycho interview on 17th. But i can't make it. So they will call me up next week to reschedule. I doubt if we get called up for psycho interview means we passed the AD dialogue right? </p>

              <p>Hi gaze,</p>
              <p>it's progressive stage. So if u got a call for clinical, den means its a pass from AD Dialouge. From weymas or James, AD dialouge is a Pass/fail stage. I dun think there any point in sending for pyscho if one didn't make it thru dialouge. =] congrats to u and me! I was hoping to get an earlier date for clinical interview.</p>

              <p>There isnt any allowances for SPO. neither does transport claims if u work beyond required hours. Only except transport claims for major deployments or taxi vouchers are issues. Neither will SPO have extra allowances on PH. </p>
              <p>Unless you are in specialist unit. You MIGHT have vocation allowance.</p>

              <p>yep as per whyzee's reply, if you get called up for the psychologist interview it means that you've passed the AD dialogue. u should start preparing for the board interview, since psychologist interview is a no fail stage.</p>

              <p>to put it simply, unless you're doing staff work (even so, it'll be often tt u'll stay past office hours), there isn't a fixed working hour for spf. we're a 24/7 force, so there's no such thing as extra allowance on public holidays. </p>

              <p>no prob.. glad to help.</p>
              <p>1) yes contact lenses can be worn.</p>
              <p>2) yes you can bring dried food such as biscuits and cup noodles. but no cooked food to be brought in, e.g. mcdonalds, kfc etc unless explicit permission is given by superiors.</p>
              <p>3) yes there is a pay difference. for the exact difference, you may have to check with recruitment.</p>
              <p>4) usually booking out on friday is 6pm for senior officer trainees, and book in by 9pm on sunday nights.</p>
              <p>5) 2 to a room, and between two rooms is a shared toilet. so each cluster is 4 people and 1 shared toilet. </p>
