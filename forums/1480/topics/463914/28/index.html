              <p>I think this happens to all positions in the public sector that are supposedly year-round applications, just look at senior officer positions with CNB, SCDF, etc, there is a down period of a couple of weeks to months, so I don't think there's a need to worry, the SPO application should reopen within several weeks or so. Plus, I do believe they have quite a lot of backlog to clear from the applications this year</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you haven done yours, what I can say is that be confident and read up and recent policies and events that is related to SPF and even public service as a whole. They had asked me about my opinion on several stuff, and I think it is important to not try and smoke them... Being long-time police officers, I think they can spot that quite easily and quickly. Then again, all these might be moot because I'm still awaiting the results of the panel :)</span></p>

              <p>I believe that there two more intakes for this year according to the previous posts. During my panel, I was told that the next intake should be in Dec, but there were no mention whether that would be start or end Dec</p>

              <p>Hi JeIn,</p>
              <p>You can check on your status from careers at gov. If it doesnt change, jus wait patiently. Notification for medical comes in both phone cal and emaill from shenton medical and email from vital.</p>
              <p>@qaihonda,</p>
              <p>Since they have asked you for notice period, should be good news. jus hang on!</p>

              <p>I just applied for SPF SO on the 27 of september 2013. Status is still "in process", I guess it is still a long way to go for me. But only recently i checked, there are no more openings posted in career@gov for SPF SO, so I hope I could still make it. </p>
