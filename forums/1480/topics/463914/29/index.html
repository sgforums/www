              <p>Hi LizT and Zorro7,</p>
              <p>Invitation to Selection Assessment will be notfy through <span style="line-height: 1.231;">email. took about a month to get back to me. Personally, I also could not finish the timed segment of psychological assessment. With that said, you have to complete a decent number of questions so they can make validate the test too. </span></p>

              <h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #003366; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Police to revamp service schemes<br> <br></h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">The Singapore Police Force has not been spared the country's labour
              crunch. So, in a bid to better recruit and retain talent, it is
              planning to revamp its service schemes.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">Last Friday, the police called for a tender to merge its current
              Senior Police Officer and Police Officer schemes - better known
              among the men and women in blue as the senior officer and junior
              officer tracks respectively - into one.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">Currently, degree holders are usually recruited into the senior
              officer scheme, while those with at least five GCE O-level passes
              or a Nitec from the Institute of Technical Education come under the
              junior officer scheme.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">Junior officers may later be considered for promotion into the
              senior ranks.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">In an interview with The Sunday Times earlier this year,
              Commissioner of Police Ng Joo Hee admitted that attracting young
              people with the right values and passion for policing has been a
              challenge. It is made tougher because the pool of Singaporeans and
              permanent residents eligible for the job is shrinking, he
              added.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">The police, which had 14,000 officers as of last year, did not
              reveal how many it needs to hire every year.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">But to fill the positions needed for its Community Policing System
              (Cops), which was rolled out last May, the force needs to sign up
              at least 450 new recruits. Cops aims to strengthen Neighbourhood
              Police Centres, making them the front line in the fight against
              crime. The police also said that they had a monthly average
              resignation rate of 0.3 per cent for uniformed officers in the last
              three years.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">The national monthly resignation rate was 2.1 per cent in 2012,
              according to Manpower Ministry statistics.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">Last year in February, the force introduced a $10,000 sign-on bonus
              for diploma holders and increased starting salaries to up to $2,370
              and $4,372 for junior and senior officers respectively.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">Now it is considering doing away with dividing the senior and
              junior officer tracks on the basis of educational qualification,
              since this may no longer be relevant with more people expected to
              have a degree in the future, said the police.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">The new review is about "future-proofing" the police recruitment
              process, a spokesman told The Sunday Times.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">When told that the police were considering combining its two career
              paths, former officers such as Mr Linus Neo lauded the move. He
              believes this could help non-degree holders become senior officers
              faster.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">The 37-year-old diploma holder, who now works as a senior executive
              in the health-care industry for 50 per cent more pay, left the
              force after more than a decade.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">He recalled how his secondary schoolmate, who joined the force with
              a degree, became his supervisor. He also knows of many officers who
              quit to study for a degree before rejoining the force.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">"For junior officers to become senior officers, they would need to
              spend one year as an acting inspector, holding the same junior
              pay.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; line-height: 1.3em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">"After that, they go for a nine-month course and spend another year
              as a probationary inspector. In all, it would take about three
              years to be a full-fledged inspector, which is why many chose to
              study for a degree instead."</p>

              <p>Hi, any idea when this will be implemented? like how about for those who are gonna do their diploma and degree now and plan to sign on soon after their degree, abt 2-3 years from now? will it become a waste to have doing their degree then entering.? Plus would NS life in SPF in NPCO help in anyway?</p>

              <p>Hi, as mentioned by the article, it is still at the tender stage so I doubt there are any information released to the public as of now. What I suggest is that you not worry too much about it because firstly, this tender is aiming to attract more people to join SPF, especially non-degree holders given the improved prospect for a JPO from this.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you are only going to finish your degree 2-3 years from now (I'm assuming), that's still a long ways away. There will definitely be some policy changes affecting perhaps not just SPF but also public service as a whole within this period of time be it minor or major, so just focus on your studies and do well in it. You can worry about the SPF application when you actually start applying for it. Plus, if you choose the right degree programme, it is never going to be a waste as the qualification will stay with you beyond your career in SPF. About NS with SPF, you would have to ask other forum members who are in the same shoes. During the panel interview, they will be interested to find out more about your background and NS is one of the things they'll definitely ask about.</p>
              <p>Anyway, has anyone who attended the panel from 2-3weeks back heard from recruitment yet? Be it rejection or medical? Thanks!</p>

              <p>Well, According to the recuitment officer, if u don't receive any calls/news after a month, means that u've definitely pass the broad interview... U'll just have to be patient n wait for medical... So, even if u didn't receive any rejection mail after 2 wks, as long as it is b4 the time limit of a month, there is still a chance that u'll get rejected in the end... </p>
              <p>Hoho... Its hasnt even been a wk since I attended the board interview n I'm already waiting with my fingers crossed... Well, for now till a month's time, no news means good news guys ^^ </p>

              <p>@Rleeps How did your panel go? They told me I will know the results of the panel in 2-3weeks, then again all the timeline they had given me so far had proven to be rather inaccurate haha! I'm approaching the one month mark soon-ish, can already feel the mould growing on me!</p>

              <p>Hey Muchogusta ^^ Dont worry, i think u'd get the call soon i'm sure ^^</p>
              <p>Well about my interview... I think I did fairly ok... But i guess I didn't give very intelligent answers during the interview... I may have slipped up a bit on one of the questions cos the officer practically stated that I had not answered his question n asked me for my answers again... Lol (though couldn't remember which question it was)... The questions asked of me were quite different from urs though... Still, I'm hoping that I'd manage to scrape through, pass the interview n get that medical appointment ^^</p>
              <p>Also, it seems that recuitment r now actively recuiting guys rather then girls... On the day of my interview, there were at least 2 guys there who had their SA in august n yet, r in the same interview group as I am, who had my SA in June... The girls on the other hand, where from the June/July batch... Hmm... </p>
              <p>Anyway, does anyone know how many board interview sessions r there in a month on average? Just feeling curious about it... Lol</p>
