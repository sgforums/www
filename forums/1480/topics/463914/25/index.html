              <p>Hey all ^^ I'm glad that many have received good news recently
              ^^ congrats to all who have succeeded n all the best to the rest
              who r still in the process ^^ </p>
              <p>@ Muchogusta and  Szee14: looks like I'm in the same stage
              as u guys ^^ similar to everyone who has ever waited or who r
              currently waiting for their panel, I'm getting that nervous n
              anxious feeling too... May I ask, when did u guys have ur clinical
              interview? If the dates r close, we may get the same date for the
              panel too... Mine was on 5th Sep... </p>
              <p>@ Whyzee: u mentioned reading up on some SPF matters as a good
              way of preparing for the panel... Could u give us an example? Like,
              what r we suppose to know? </p>
              <p>Also, for the rest of the ppl who have already gone through
              their panel, example Haiz2006, randomhh, dvjesyjomh<span><strong> </strong>n the rest, Could u give us examples of
              the types of questions asked? Anything that u can remember will be
              helpful n much appreciated by the rest of us, myself included of
              course ^^ for instance, do they still ask the same questions as
              during the dialouge sessions? Like "why do u want to join SPF?",
              that sort of typical HR questions? Did they ask any weird or
              unusual questions? Also, how many ppl will be on the panel? N how
              many of them will be the ones who actually interview
              us? </span></p>
              <p>Thanks alot ^^</p>

              <p>@Rleeps Sorry I missed out yours earlier on! Maybe I can consider myself lucky, the interviewers did not ask very tricky or difficult to handle questions. For my case, they asked for my interest in SO and leadership experience. Whether my family is supportive etc (maybe because I am female?) Relatively manageable questions. I realised different candidates can get very varied questions. It boils down to what you say in the interview which can spark off different questions, or what your past experiences were (eg NS spf - they might want to hear some suggestions that you may have). </p>
              <p>Ultimately, no matter what is asked, being confident and certain of your answers is the key to handling the interview well. As many others have mentioned here, just keep calm, think through your answers before you speak and show them you really have the strong passion to join SPF. I am sure you will do fine. (: All the best for your panel!</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>@Haiz2006 Perhaps I'm not the best to offer suitable opinions
              because I'm not attached and my application is quite some stages
              behind yours...  I understand that you are at quite a dilemma,
              if I were needed to choose between family and SPF, I'll be quite
              dejected as well.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">My parents still
              slightly against me joining the SPF too mainly because they are
              concerned about my safety as well as career future and even though
              they're not saying much now, I know they're secretly hoping that I
              wouldn't get it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But I do think you should
              think over this decision carefully before rejecting SPF. Like you
              said, this a once in a lifetime opportunity, it may or may not come
              again. Policing work is definitely not the common occupation,
              because there is so much more at stake that even the application
              process, which you had personally experienced, is much more
              stringent and long-drawn out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Perhaps then, now is the time
              more than ever to ask yourself the reasons why you want to join SPF
              as an SO. If it is passion, what exactly is this passion about? For
              me, it is  my personal convictions about social justice and
              protecting Singapore against crime and injustices that has kept me
              hanging on to this torturous wait.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You're starting a family soon
              and is planning to have kids... Think about what kind of
              environment do you want them to grow up in and what kind of roles
              do you want to play in that future. Then of course, you have to
              convince yourself and your wife-to-be about your decision, whatever
              it might be. I'm sure you will be able to make the right
              decision.</span></p>
              <p>@Rleeps @randomhh My clinic interview was roughly a month back!
              If the one-month waiting time is consistent, I should be hearing
              about my panel date sometime soon!</p>

              <p>Hi ndsxo, congrats! Can I just check how long you were waiting for? And if your degree is local?</p>
              <p>@james.wlr, have you heard from them? I have called the past two Mondays, the second time I called they were less accommodating in their response, saying that the only thing they can say is that the application is still processing. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I did not study locally, and I am not sure if that is affecting my application, or medical or what not. </span></p>

              <p>In most cases INSP will be promoted to ASP during or after command tour, depending on several things like yearly grading, CEP etc. Do note that for most of uswe have two grades within a rank, I.e. INSP(1) -&gt; INSP(2) -&gt; ASP(1).</p>
