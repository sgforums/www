              <p>There are five:</p>
              <p>1. Self assessment</p>
              <p>2. AD dialogue</p>
              <p>3. Psychologist Interview</p>
              <p>4. Panel Interview</p>
              <p>5. Medical check-up</p>
              <p>When is your SA? There are some tests online that are quite similar to some of the questions you'll be going through. One example is this one: <a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/">http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/</a></p>

              <p>While I have attended SA on 22nd May, I got a missed call from a block number today in the afternoon. Wanna ask if it could be from SPF? Do they use a private number?

              <p>Don't let that force u into a rash decision.. Think carefully abt which career u're more passionate abt and how far u think ur passion's going to take u. Once u sign on the dotted line, it's gg to be ur life for the next few years at least.</p>

              <p>I had my panel interview a week ago and received a call to go
              down for medical checkup on Tuesday. Does anyone know if it means

              <p>Hi Paige, I was in panel interview one week ago.. But they scheduled my medical only on 19 June don't why so long. I remembered in panel interview I told them I hope to get into the August intake.. Since our interview, no rejection straight away aft few days, are we more or less accepted if medical goes well too?</p>
              <p>Paige u are only 23 so young! According to ur nick</p>

              <p>Any idea when the next intake is in? No news so far is worrying and since it's one month since school ended, the pressure to secure a job is increasing. Imagine rejection after a seven months wait. </p>

              <p>Oh my! You have waited for 7 months in the application process? During SA, the guys told us the whole selection process would be between 3-4 months from start to end. I really wan to get in to the force. But the wait is torturous.</p>

              <p>Tmr the new intake will report at HTA, so I suppose the next intake should be July/August. I waited for 6 mths after school ended.. So it was even more torturous for me. Thank God everything worked out fine.</p>
