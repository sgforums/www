              <p>Erm I suggest u make a decision which force to join now because the entire spf process will take quite some time as mentioned by james. I DON think scdf will wait for so long? And the job scope between both forces are quite different.</p>

              <p>Thanks weymas, james and geckoian. My dream is really to be in SPF.</p>
              <p>However, the scdf interviewer told me that there is no glass ceiling in SCDF, most of the top pple are not scholars. but in spf, the glass ceiling is very evident. Assuming I enter with 2nd upper honours, are my chances of climbing high up in future very slim?</p>

              <p>It will be kinda lying to say that such ceiling don exist in spf. But As what I always tell fellow "farmers", don't be too rank conscious and remember that u joined because of passion or at the very least, high percentage is due to passion. And from what I heard, at least in spf, they are less rank conscious than saf and more on experience, so perform well and u will be recognise for your effort. Sounds naive and optimistic but at least I won't be feeling sore and keep complaining throughout my career which can be quite stressful haha. Erm for prospect wise, you can try to aim for their postgraduate scholarship and be a scholar too! If there is a will there's a way haha </p>

              <p>like what geckoian mentioned, instead of focusing on how high u can climb, just focus ur efforts in doing the best that you can and eventually you will be recognized for it. of course, you have to couple it with good networking and good interpersonal relationships. ultimately it all boils down to how passionate you are towards your job; you can be a scholar but if you lose your passion, you won't go far.</p>

              <p>Erm, I don't think I can give u a number. the first round is something u cannot control I guess. The rest are interviews, depends on how confident you are and ur passion. So I guess the percentage is a very individual one. Unless you are looking for the general success rate of the all the applicants, i think the number is quite low. But but but but!! Not because the interviews are hard but more of the suitability of individual. So yea, don be intimidated by the low success rate. If u really have strong passion especially if it's ur dream, just go for it and give ur best. </p>
              <p>I think there are a few SPO threads in sgforums dating back to 2009? Hahaha it's like a documentary of many applicants' torturous waiting process. Just take a look :)</p>

              <p>well u can start increasing the intensity of your physical training cos sometimes you can be quite bogged down with tests and exams and you won't have much time for physical activities. you can also start revising your footdrills and make sure you know at least the basic ones which are crucial for the first few days.</p>
              <p>a typical day would start with a water parade, followed by either breakfast or flag raising depending on whether your first lesson is PT or not. the rest of the day will be either classroom lessons, PT, or other activities which you'll find out more about when u come in.</p>
              <p>don't worry, when you come in, you can look for me and my squad and we'll be more than glad to help you all.</p>

              <p>yes. This thread really helps alot. At least there is an avenue for us to ask around regarding to selection process. Even when weymas is already training in TRACOM, he still check back to give advices. I attended SA on 22nd May and is still waiting for a reply. Maybe can update each other when the call comes. =]</p>

              <p>well u can start increasing the intensity of your physical
              training cos sometimes you can be quite bogged down with tests and
              exams and you won't have much time for physical activities. you can
              also start revising your footdrills and make sure you know at least
              the basic ones which are crucial for the first few days.</p>
              <p>a typical day would start with a water parade, followed by
              either breakfast or flag raising depending on whether your first
              lesson is PT or not. the rest of the day will be either classroom
              lessons, PT, or other activities which you'll find out more about
              when u come in.</p>
              <p>don't worry, when you come in, you can look for me and my squad
              and we'll be more than glad to help you all.</p>

              <p> If I remembered correctly, someone from PHQ will send an email regarding the orientation details. The orientation should be at PHQ for the first half of the day, followed by a visit to a specialist unit for the 2nd half. Same for all 3 days. Ur course manager will meet u on one of the orientation days to brief u abt the first day at HTA (I.e. what to bring etc).</p>

              <p>Yes its a pass/fail stage, but dont worry too much abt it. Its a dialogue to find out more abt u, I.e. why u want to join spf, ur education background etc. For my case it was 2 interviewers to one.</p>

              <p>@Paige, I think you are 1 of the faster 1s that got through
              (where you are right now) thus far; just a gauge for all those
              applying and waiting, i applied in January same as Ma'am Paige,
              response wise, my experience is that i usually waited &gt;2 weeks
              after a round for them to call/sms/email me, to fix an appointment
              a few days later, so it could drag up to 1 month between stages:
              i.e. Apply in jan --&gt; SA in feb --&gt; dialogue in march --&gt;
              psych in april --&gt; panel in may and now medical in june.</p>
              <p>On that note, i finally got an email ytd for medical appt next
              week, which i really really am thankful about it. Cos' i went for
              panel like last month mid-may, so when the ppl like Ma'am Paige who
              went for panel on 31st may got their notification for medical
              before me, i literally panicked =/</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, I think they are starting to filter and
              consolidating the final list of ppl still in the running liao -
              across batches; so i guess regardless of which period you apply in
              or which date you went for SA, for example, early jan or early feb,
              there will come to a point of time whereby all the remaining people
              (who have yet to be eliminated) are consolidated as list of
              potentials. uhh so i guess, as long as your status is still
              shortlisted ar, means still got chance. Have some faith and
              patience. (blah who am i kidding i freaked out couple of times
              myself hahahaha) but seriously nothing you can do abt it but
              wait.</p>
              <p>Hmm Sir Weymas, you batch direct intake only got 10 only ar? wah
              siao liao lor, like that confirm means 'medical doesn't mean
              getting in liao'. I mean, according to sgforums, seems like Sir
              James, Sir Haizz, Sir Gecko, Ma'am Paige, and myself in process of
              pre/post medical and waiting for the july intake (hopefully). Plus
              the volume of people queuing for medical checkup during this period
              and those who finished medical (not identified on sgforums lol), i
              can only infer and estimate that there's gotta be more than 10
              people in limbo waiting for the next intake? wah so if confirm 1
              batch intake around 10 ar, that can only suggest more filtering
              after medical stage oh.my.god =S</p>
              <p>Anyway jiayou ar. to those still waiting, have faith. do your
              best. oh also wanna salute Sir James for his determination and
              wanting to join spf. /salute =)</p>
              <p>On a side note, Ma'am Paige, when you submitting your transcript
              ar? you NUS oso? uhh NUS webby say transcript application locked
              until next month (even after the 20 working days from results
              release) due to commencement admin prep duhhhhh.. like that how ar
