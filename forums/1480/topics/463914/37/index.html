              <p>Hi Ciki, can i check if 64105999 is the number that contacted
              you? Seems more like a SAF number but received 3 short miss calls
              while my network is down and cant call back.</p>

              <p>hey @arcelyn, </p>
              <p>I remembered the no for vital starts with 64 something too. You should definitely call back and ask! May be good news! Same here, my status online has been removed.</p>
              <p> this week should be a crucial week cos the two guys right they needed notice period, 1 month and 1 week. that's might be a reason they received the call before Feb. So hangon to your hp at all times! =D</p>

              <p>Hey arcelyn, i have a few numbers which i received but i can't really remember which is which. But if i am not wrong, they will call to inform you with the number starting with 6636. But i have other numbers starting with 6325 and 6462. I am not sure which is which but if the missed calls you received are similar, i suggest you find their numbers online or email them.</p>

              <p>Thanks Ciki. The numbers i received should be a SAF number. Those SPF calls I received previously are nothing like that too. </p>

              <p>Yeap, i am going for the Feb intake.</p>
              <p>Hmm, i guess if you have not been contacted, chances are you wouldn't make it for the feb intake. For my case, after i was told that i was going for the feb intake, Vital took about 2 days to contact me and signing of the contract was set on a date about 3 weeks after that. </p>
