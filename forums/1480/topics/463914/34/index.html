              <p>Hi Tinkerbot, I think it's been mentioned several times but in essence, just remember that SPOs are supposed to be leaders of police officers, so leadership qualitoes are definitely something they'll be looking out for. As for questions, I'm not sure if there are any specific ones they would ask (aside from the standard HR opening questions). The type of questions asked will largely depend on your background and experiences. Your best bet is probably to learn more about recent events and affairs that are related to/affects SPF, crime, and even public service as a whole. For instance, the recent spree of hacking incidents is definitely an event that is ripe for picking, but do keep an eye out for developments... Otherwise, all the best for your upcoming panel, cheers :)</p>

              Well, I can't say that it is must for candidates to have past leadership roles in order to qualify for the job... Interest n passion for the job is a definite must of course. 
              
              However, the fact remains that u will definitley be asked to describe or talk about any past leadership experiences u had. I had this question asked of me during my dialouge session as well as during clinical... (that's like 2 interviews n they asked the same question) So, it's better to have something to say rather than nothing at all right? Also, remember that as a senior officer, u will eventually have to take on the position of team leader sooner or later... Thus, having had past leadership roles or experiences will definitely reflect better on u during your interviews n the selection process as a whole. However, don't give up hope if u do indeed have no prior leadership experiences. U just have to show them that u r qualified for the job or, sort of hint that even without the past experimeces, u fit the bill as a leader...
              
              Hope this helps ^^ n all the best

              <p>Hi Dolphyl,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are talking about major leadership experience, like major CCA roles or during my NS, I do not have any prior leadership experience. However, you will definitely have some experience in the form of being a leader of a project group or organizing committee of some event (at least for me). These will be useful to talk about, especially if you face difficulties leading them and what steps did you take to overcome them. So don't give up! All the best! Hope this helps!</p>
