U have public holidays and weekends to plan ur wedding. Its all about time management. If u really wan it, u will fork out the time to do it. After training, once u r posted to IO, i think it is still manageable since i think it is office hours. U will have time to have some family time. If not, i think if u ask ur supervisor to give u time to take leave. </p></div>

              <p>@Haiz2006 - I understand ur situation. If i am in ur shoes,i am also at a loss on which is to follow. I was a PO before and I know the job scope quite well. Yes,it involves sacrifices now and then. Yes, the job carry substantial danger but it is not as demanding as what others think it is. SOs are not going to patrol much around the neighbourhood but much of supervisory checks and case assists. </p>
              <p>There also SOs who have a young family with things to settle on their end but they can juggle it well apart from their police duties. 2 days work and 2 days off. It is not bad afterall. If u are really passionate about policing life, I do urge u to think again. Not many SOs are there because of passion but only because of the monies. Like u have mentioned, it is now or never because once u reject it, u might not be able to join again. </p>
              <p>Dun be like me,I wasted much out in the private sector but deep in me, all I want to do is policing. I only realised it now. Fyi, I am also quite a young married couple with a flat of our own now. </p>
              <p>I snap out of my denial finally and have just attended the SA 2 days ago. So do think about it ya :) SPF need more SOs who are passionate about police work just like u. Cheers!!</p>

              <p>I am being offered SO, many might be envied but dream is a
              dream.... I have to make a painful decision to reject it...
              Marriage is next year end, planning will be tough..followed by 1.5
              yrs of long working hours, shift work takes place next.. Those
              stand bys and uncertainties she anticipated, plus with house coming
              in 2014 end.. Too much things in mind, fiancée unable to support my
              decision.. With me rejectin it, she has tremendous guilt and if I
              take it I an putting everything at a risk.. With the bond, u can't
              run.. I regretted I did not try out earlier but as a mid career
              change I have to experience outside life first..</p>
              <p>past 6 months of waiting we are both avoiding the discussion
              while she hoping I can't get it everyday.. Bombshell finally came
              that I was offered... Haiz, </p>
              <p>With those minimum danger posed to a SO role, there is still an
              element of danger in pursuit of suspect, stand-bys and recall back
              during your quality time with family will happen too.. When dream
              and reality clashes, the reality overwrite the dream
              move... </p>
              <p>For those who dream to be one.. I wish u all the best and being
              a policeman or woman, family support is important.. I am willing to
              sacrifice I might look back in regrets and stick on to my boring
              job.. But losing the loved one and cause so much tension btw us is
              just not worth it.. Tell me.. This crossroad comes really at wrong
              time.. </p>
              <p>Dejected...anyone got second opinion? It's so close yet so
              far</p>

              <p>@Haiz2006 Perhaps I'm not the best to offer suitable opinions because I'm not attached and my application is quite some stages behind yours...  I understand that you are at quite a dilemma, if I were needed to choose between family and SPF, I'll be quite dejected as well.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">My parents still slightly against me joining the SPF too mainly because they are concerned about my safety as well as career future and even though they're not saying much now, I know they're secretly hoping that I wouldn't get it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But I do think you should think over this decision carefully before rejecting SPF. Like you said, this a once in a lifetime opportunity, it may or may not come again. Policing work is definitely not the common occupation, because there is so much more at stake that even the application process, which you had personally experienced, is much more stringent and long-drawn out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Perhaps then, now is the time more than ever to ask yourself the reasons why you want to join SPF as an SO. If it is passion, what exactly is this passion about? For me, it is  my personal convictions about social justice and protecting Singapore against crime and injustices that has kept me hanging on to this torturous wait. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You're starting a family soon and is planning to have kids... Think about what kind of environment do you want them to grow up in and what kind of roles do you want to play in that future. Then of course, you have to convince yourself and your wife-to-be about your decision, whatever it might be. I'm sure you will be able to make the right decision.</span></p>
              <p>@Rleeps @randomhh My clinic interview was roughly a month back! If the one-month waiting time is consistent, I should be hearing about my panel date sometime soon!</p>

              <p>It's like right in front of me but perhaps it comes at a wrong time...my Gf apparently cried over it whenever we discussed intensively, I can't bear to break her heart...her confidence of up keeping the marriage came to a virtual standstill and if she can't support or reluctantly accept, it will not make us any better.. Whatever assurance I gave will not be confirmed because we nv know where or when the cases come in are urgent during IO tour.. She will be returning to an empty house, till then staff posting in 3 yrs 9 months time maximum.. She can't seem to accept this fact. She did not sign up for this, but I did which impact her...she just wan a simple life, and its never easy for me just to ignore her pleas and go ahead...</p>
              <p>any ladies can second her thoughts? I wish I have started 2 years ago... I miss the golden period and I am stuck and time is running out..and I thank everybody here for your advice. It's also really because whoever down here has a passion to serve and will surely give it a go... But this crossroad is one hardest junction I ever encountered...</p>
              <p>The police drama and commercial is going to haunt both of us on and off for whatever decision i made or whatsoever...</p>

              <p>haiz2006, i fully concur with what the others are saying. i believe your fiance is not fully supportive because she doesn't really know what the job of an SO entails. yes it's true that you can't run away from long working hours and unexpected callbacks, but this sacrifice you make is for the better good of singapore. </p>
              <p>i'm in my 5th mth of training now, and my first child is due in 8 weeks time. my new house will be coming shortly after i finish training, so i also have to juggle many balls at one go. IO posting will be demanding, but the one good thing about it is that the hours are slightly more flexible, as long as ur work is not slipshod and late.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">however, all these are just our opinions. at the end of the day, it's still your decision and i'm sure no matter what you decide upon, people will respect the decision you've made. all the best haiz2006!</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">same goes for everyone else! for those who are still waiting for news, hang in there! :) </span></p>

              <p>well for one, she's very supportive of my choice to join SPF as it's a very meaningful job. married officers get a 4 hr nights out on wed nights, so along with the weekends we just try to make the best out of it and spend as much time together as possible. the separation on the weekdays helps me cherish the weekends even more so i suppose it's a good thing. </p>
              <p>my wife's a very independent woman; able to juggle work with family. that's why it allows me to carry on with what i do without much worry. in life there is no perfect situation; there always has to be some form of sacrifice to be made.. this is life for you.</p>
              <p>yep she perfectly understands the demands of the job and supports it. :)</p>

                                support or reluctantly accept, it will not make us any better..
                                Whatever assurance I gave will not be confirmed because we nv know
                                where or when the cases come in are urgent during IO tour.. She
                                will be returning to an empty house, till then staff posting in 3
                                yrs 9 months time maximum.. She can't seem to accept this fact. She
                                did not sign up for this, but I did which impact her...she just wan
                                a simple life, and its never easy for me just to ignore her pleas
                                and go ahead...</p>
                                <p>any ladies can second her thoughts? I wish I have started 2
                                years ago... I miss the golden period and I am stuck and time is
                                running out..and I thank everybody here for your advice. It's also
                                really because whoever down here has a passion to serve and will
                                surely give it a go... But this crossroad is one hardest junction I
                                ever encountered...</p>
                                <p>The police drama and commercial is going to haunt both of us on
                                and off for whatever decision i made or whatsoever...</p>

              @Haiz2006 That is indeed quite the dilemma... Maybe you can try convincing her to consider the longer term outcomes of this situation and to look past the short-term effects? Either way, I guess it is as said by weymas, whatever decision you would make in the end, people will respect it! All the best!

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hi Haiz2006,</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I do second what the others has mentioned as above. In fact, being a police officer does required strong and positive family support. The issues/ considerations that you have in mind are not a one off situation. Speaking from  my experiences being in NS SPF (where i do have many interactions with my division regulars [JO and SO] due to my scope of work), JO are even facing a tougher time den SO in terms of posting. Considering the rotation tour for SO is 2 years each from IO to COmmand to Staff posting, JO officers are probably permanently posted to the unit or spend at least 4- 5 years before being posted out. However,</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I do see many officers are able to juggle r/s and marraige life.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>I'll share some reality of work life to help you have a better understanding and know what's install for you when you take up the offer (maybe you would have know some already); </p>
              <p><strong>IO Term</strong></p>
              <p>It is true as what Weymas has mentioned, IO may face long work hours. Unexpected calls may come in during wee hours. These are parts and parcel of police life. Of cos, I dun think you will always be so sway to have subjects relating to your case arrested on your off days. Work hours (When you are not on tour) is flexible as long as your IP cases clearance is not lag back.</p>
              <p><strong>Team Leader Term</strong></p>
              <p>12 hours shift each of Morning, Night, 1st off, 2nd off cycle. In actual, you would probably be working for around 14- 16 hours each. Considering <span style="line-height: 1.231;">reporting earlier to prepare briefings, draw equipments and after stand down from duty, look through returns from your officers, do debriefing with them, attending to morning panel (if you are night shift).</span></p>
              <p>Frontline petrol officers are required to attend in-service training once every month on your 2nd off day. In-service is a form of training to update, recap, prepare officers with knowledge for them to perform their work on the ground.</p>
              <p><strong>Staff posting</strong></p>
              <p>Needless to say. Its Office hours post depending where you are posted to.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal development</strong></p>
              <p>Apart from clearing IPPT and shooting every year, every police officers, regardingless where you are posted to, are required to clock 80 training hours in one financial year. These trainings can be in a form of courses you attend from CSC or conducted internally (Like In-service). Courses date may or may not fall on your off days. Mandatory to clear without fail. </p>
              <p>Passion is one thing. If we can turn our passion for one thing into our career, it would prolly be the best job. For my case, I have spoke to my girlfriend regarding about the time committment that the job requires and she understands that. One way for me to work around my absent at home would be buying our flat near to her parent place. So, she has an avenue to go to.</p>
              <p>Both of you will need to work something out should you choose to accept the offer. I do hope whenever decision you have made subsequently will be better for both you and your fiancee. Should you choose to reject the offer, reject it willingly after considering all issues in a bigger picture. Do not resent your fiancee for your missed opportunity with the force.  </p>
              <p>I wish you the best haiz2006 and congrats again on your offer! Im still waiting for mine. haha.</p>

              <p>i dun think its convenient for me to comment on the flexibility part on IO tour. Becos I dun wan to pre-form an expectation in you first den things turn up different when u are there. Lets jus say each division and each investigation unit may or may not work differently from standard. You'll get what I mean when you're there.</p>
              <p>we should appreciate that each tour is now 12 hrs shift for IO. It used to be straight 24hrs tour. So lesser hours means more tours each month. But adequate rest. =]</p>

              <p>NPC TL - 2 days work 2 days off. But yeah 14 - 16hrs per shift due to deployment, briefing, case reports, other admin stuff. Then there will be the morning panels with the Chief Investigation Officer after the night shift. Courses to attend. </p>
              <p>IO - 12hrs tour and then followed by the norm office hours. Weird timing calls from fellow officers who would give you infos or other substantial intels.</p>
              <p>I missed those moments whereby I followed my TL for morning panels and carry out CRs for a certain case assigned!</p>

              <p>@Haiz2006 I guess you could reassure your gf by letting her know more about what being an SPO entails. Her fears and worries are valid - I am a woman and I believe I would feel the same if I didn't know what my future husband was signing himself up for. A simple reassurance that this is your passion and that you will be safe as well as you will keep her in mind is all she needs. That said on your part, I guess you have to constantly make an effort to keep her in your life - take that effort to call her or to keep her updated - it will make a difference to her knowing she still have space in your life. Remember ultimately its all about time management - as much as our gov can support campaigns for work-life balance - don't expect work-life balance to come to you in a silver platter - you have to grab it and form it for yourself :) Good luck...</p>

              <p>Hi all, I've been following the forum and its been a wonderful help with lots of great info in preparation for my interviews. I've gone thru the board interview and is now hoping to get a slot for a medical appointment.</p>
              <p>Would like to share my board interview experience with those who are going for it (tho i dunno if i pass that stage), my questions evolve around my background and also on implementations that could be useful in detering youths from getting onto the wrong track. I was also asked about my desire to be in the force. My advice is to be truthful and honest in your answers. That will make it easy for you to show your passion as you are speaking from ur heart. The whole interview will be around 15mins.</p>
              <p>I dunno if I will get thru but I hope the above are useful to those going for their board interview. Gdluck peeps!</p>
