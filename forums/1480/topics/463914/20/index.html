Holistic approach as in reputation and awareness especially with the recent cases, you can definitely score points if you input positiveness into the situation.<br><br>Be yourself, be confident and don't stutter. They will be high ranking officers but don't be nervous, be prepared if they don't smile and just take it as a stress test to see your composure.<br><br>Lastly PASSION!! <br><br>Good luck!<br><br>still waiting for updates, cleared all stages and my medical was on 13 june 2013. hope to get in soon</p></div>

              <p>@Gaze: Thanks for replying gaze ^^ as szee14 mentioned if those r the only qns asked during your interview, then it's most likely to test the interviewees... </p>
              <p>@Szee14: well, I guess we'll have no choice other than to wait it out... In my opinion, they most likely have too many candidates to go through... Since most most graduates would be looking for a job around this time... But still, if all goes well, we might hopefully make it in time for the last intake of the year... That'll probably be in November/December... Since the next intake is probably in September/October n there r so many ppl who have cleared their medical n have yet to receive any news...  Let's not forget those that have cleared their clinical n panel interviews... N to think that I'm still waiting for the clinical interview... Just thinking about the long wait makes me wanna shed tears T T</p>

              <p>Hi whyzee, yup. Those were the only questions they asked me. I just pray hard they call me soon. Even if rejected, at least reject early so tt i dont need to wait so long to reapply. Those who got rejected, did ur status change immediately? </p>

              <p>Hey guys, I was wondering... How long does it usually take for someone to get the call for the clinical interview after the dialogue session? It's been more than a month since my dialogue (on to my 5th week) n still... No mails, no calls/sms, nothing at all...</p>
              <p>By the way, does anyone know whats the email address we should send mails to for enquiries about our application process? Cos, I've got a feeling that I better mail them... Just Incase they forgot about my application... Lol... Also, if I send them a mail, what headings should I use? "SPO application enquiries" ? Or something else? </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance ^^</p>

              <p>good luck to all! </p>
              <p>and a month plus from clinical to dialogue seems normal. just check your career@gov if the status changes to unsuccessful. </p>
              <p>you can email the guy who first notified you about your first selection. </p>
