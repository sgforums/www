              <p>Heard that there were not looking for the correct answers (anyway the qns they asked dun have right or wrong answers), instead they want to see how u react to the qns they asked. If u were calm and cool and manages to answer them truthfully, i believe u shud be fine... My panel was 2mths ago and I've received an email from recruitment to send some documents over. Hopefully I have good news soon!!!</p>

              <p>@sands, I used to conduct IPPT for prison officers and I remembered according to them, during their training phrase, there will be a few sessions of retest should anyone fails his/her IPPT. Not sure if that's also the case for SPF but I would believe its going to be somewhat similar... Train up and well to avoid this scenario tho...</p>

              <p>Hey guys, I'm in need of second opinions here. I've frequented this 
              forum since my online application nearly 7months ago and had go through 
              all the stages myself. Right now however, I'm at an important and rather
               cumbersome crossroad. I've been crossing fingers and holding my breath 
              since I completed my medical and while for the most part I had remained 
              hopeful, presently it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so as the
               pressure to secure full-time employment is snowballing. And it really 
              doesn't help that the holiday seasons are apporaching and I have a ton 
              of explaining to do when I meet up with friends and family.</p>
              <p>I'm
               a fresh grad and I'm keenly aware that my parents had spared no 
              expenses in allowing me to pursuit higher education. Right now while 
              they do support my application with SPF, there are concerns from them if
               this lengthy wait will ever come to any fruition. To become a police 
              officer is my aspiration and I don't think there are any other job I 
              would prefer more than this, but I also value the relationship I have 
              with my family so their concerns are not something I can brush off. To 
              note, there are opportunities in other sectors that I will not hate to 
              explore and I'm rather confident of securing a position in those.</p>
              <p>So,
               I have to make the decision relatively soon. It is either that I 
              continue on waiting, seeing that 7months had already been invested 
              anyway but not taking into account that there is probably plenty more 
              waiting to do, or I place this aspiration on hold and explore other 
              employment opportunities that are relevant to my course of study. As 
              with any important choices, this is a difficult decision to make. I only
               wished I have had the foresight to apply much earlier on while I was 
              still in school that this situation wouldn't be an issue at all. What 
              are your thoughts?</p>

              <p>Would u want to give them a call to find out when is the earliest/latest they can give u an answer?</p>
              <p>As you mentioned, it will not be difficult for u to secure a job in the private sector, I would think it will be better to check with the recruitment to see if theres any forecoming news before u make ur next move. It'll be a pity if u are originally suppose to be the next in line and u gave up the opportunity. Sometimes its not easy to follow ur passion but we've gone thru so much to get to this stage..........</p>

              <p>Hey Muchogusta, I think you should hang on and continue waiting too! I totally feel you - the explanation to friends and family - but since you've already invested 7 months, I'm sure good news should be coming to you in the coming 1-2 months (max hopefully). You've come this far, don't give up now!!! Or if not, try getting a temp job while you wait. Something that won't require you to commit for long, at least when you get the call, you can pursue your dream.. (:</p>

              @rockymaivia: congrats rocky! I sent u a pm btw 
                      
              @Muchogusta: I understand where u're coming from Muchogusta... Similarly, i've gone through all of the stages myself n have already invested 6 plus months into this already... Though i have my parent's support in this, I'm getting quite tried of the same questions friends n family often throw at me whenever I c them (have u gotten a full-time job yet?)... My answer has always been the same as always... "I'm still waiting..." 
                          
              Still, I think what's important is what u want to do in life n stick to it... N maybe have a few backup plans just Incase... Since it is obvious that u still really want the SPF job, Maybe instead of withdrawing, u can just keep ur application first n apply for other jobs in the mean time? Then, just pick the first job that ur offered... It really depends on what ur priorities r... Well, at least that's what I would do if I where in ur shoes... Also, just like what rockymaivia suggested earlier on, u should call recuitment up...
                          
              Well, at the end of the day, the decision on what to do next is still entirely up to u... Hope this helps ^^
