              <p>well i think it should be him taking ur squad, since he said he will be taking C6 but we can't confirm it.. heh.</p>
              <p>he's generally quite nice, but i won't say much.. i'll just let you experience it for urself.. haha. but one thing's for sure, he's probably one of the best course managers around.. he'll arrange a tightly packed schedule so that the whole syllabus can be cleared before the leadership phase.</p>
              <p>when u come in, do feel free to look for me and my squad (C3). chronologically we're currently the most senior squad (C7/2012 is currently in nepal), so if u and ur squad have any questions or doubts, look for us and we'll do our best to help u guys. </p>

              <p>thank you, <span style="color: #666666; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Haiz2006, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">for your effort to reply me :D<br><br>its actually my plan all along to do that, to work as an engineer first while waiting for SPF results. <br><br>however now it clashed with the offer i got outside. because i expected things to be a lot slower (like confirm in jan'14)..<br><br>so since spf will be confirming by sept if all goes well according to the recruitment officer, it means i will not be able to fufill the min service period of the outside offer, which means i will have to reject the offer if i want to continue with the SPO application. <br><br>what bogs me down now is im thinking what if i reject this good offer i got and end up i fail the SPO selection then it will be like i sacrifice all my offers and i end up with nothing. <br><br>so now i just want to know how much risk is involve.<br><br>but your reply did help me, by enforcing the reason why i choose to sign on. though sometimes i, if not all applicants, surely wish they will speed up the process a little bit more.. :p<br><br>well, blame myself though for not planning for my career earlier. should have applied for it while i'm still in school.</span></p>

              <p>Ur case can be settled, go for new job and wait for SPF, if result is pass and offer given; delay your entry for training and fulfill the employment of 3 months.. Put yourself in a undergraduate's shoe which will be similar as you ... Let the employer know after 1 month -2 month job don't suit you actually, they will understand and source for new candidate even earlier than you expected..</p>

              offer given. i had already rejected an offer from an SME earlier on
              as i decided to try for this.<br> <br> i have interest in both being an engineer and policeman, as both
              are very noble and respectful profession to me.<br> <br> i know its a bit useless for me to ask as nth is 100% in a
              selection process, but how good a chance is it to get through the
              panel interview? as in usually only 15% make it or 85% make it? or
              50:50..<br> <br> i am a fairly confident speaker and had no problems so far with
              interviews with both MNC and SME.. but i admit i am a little
              jittery during my AD dialougue. *blush* guess i really want this
              path so badly until i became really nervous.</p>

              <p>Well, during my SA I took a peek and saw the number of names on the list, and based off information from this forum (6-10trainees per intake, roughly 9 intake per year, and one SA every 2weeks-1month), the numbers are quite depressing in terms of success rate (i.e. 95% will not be selected for various reasons). Of course, this number is highly inaccurate, because it does not include people who decided to withdraw, higher number of intakes, different number of trainees per intake, different number of applications at different times of the year, and various other reasons. Ultimately, I think the important thing is to know that they will be assessing you as an individual; that is your suitability and fit to being a police officer; and not in comparison to other applicants. Based on this fact itself, I would not trust that estimation that I've made. So like what many others have suggested thus far, just do your best :)</p>
