              <p><strong>How does this work?</strong><br> The NS Training Cycle is a <strong>continuation of your active unit training cycle</strong>.
               As such, you are expected to still be able to apply your military 
              skills and knowledge when you return for your In-Camp Training (ICT).<br> <br> This is a 10-year NS Unit Training Cycle and each stage will last for 3 
              to 4 NS years. The NS Unit Training Cycle is divided into the following 3
               stages:</p>

              <div>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Stage 1: Strengthening Stage</strong><br> This stage focuses on individual and team proficiencies with the aim to 
              maintain Ops Readiness. It is also termed as the ‘IHL years’ as many 
              will be pursuing IHL studies.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Stage 2: Sharpening Stage</strong><br> This stage focuses on unit proficiency culminating at each Unit’s ATEC 
              evaluation, in which the entire unit will be evaluated on its war 
              fighting capabilities.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Stage 3: Sustain Stage</strong><br> In this final stage, it is to continually focus on <strong>Ops Readiness and integrated training</strong>.
               The milestone event will be to phase the NS Unit to Army Operational 
              Reserves and the NSmen to MINDEF Reserves (MR). This is usually 
              commemorated during a <strong>MR Parade/Ceremony</strong> in the presence of the NSmen’s families and employers.<br> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>During each ICT, your Unit Commander will stipulate a set of 
              performance standards to be achieved. You are encouraged therefore, to 
              train yourself up physically and be mentally prepared for the tough 
              training. <br> <br> Note that if you fail to meet the required performance standards, you 
              will be subjected to corrective training. That is, your Unit Commander 
              may decide to serve you additional NS call-up for Make-Up Training 
              (MUT).<br> <br> <strong>What are the Training Institutes?</strong><br> For a more holistic and effective training management for the various 
              arms, the NSmen’s training are now managed by the respective Training 
              Institutes (TIs). You will then report back to your respective TI for 
              your NS training during your ICT:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Armour Training Institute (ATI)</li>
              <li>Army Logistics Training Institute (ALTI)</li>
              <li>Artillery Institute (AI)</li>
              <li>Commando Training Institute (CTI)<br> </li>
              <li>Engineer Training Institute (ETI)<br> </li>
              <li>Infantry Training Institute (ITI)<br> </li>
              <li>Signal Institute (SI)<br> </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>What happens after I completed my NS Training Cycle?</strong><br> Once you have completed your NS training Cycle, you will be posted to 
              the MINDEF Reserve (MR) List and be presented with a Certificate of 
              Appreciation. You may also be given a watch upon the completion of your 
              10 years of ORNS or your ORNS training cycle, whichever is earlier. <br> <br> While in MR, you may still be activated during operational exigencies. 
              As an Officer, you remain liable for NS up to age 50 and 40, if you are 
              an Army Warrant Officers and Specialist (WOSE). Note that you are to 
              disregard your previous unit’s mobilisation codewords as you are no 
              longer required to report for mobilisation activation for your previous 
              units. A new codeword will be assigned to you accordingly should you be 
              mobilised while you are in MR. If you are travelling overseas for 6 
              months or more, you are still required to apply for Exit Permit.<br> <br> <strong>How can I be in contact?</strong><br> You are encouraged to remain your contact with your NS Unit and buddies 
              so that they can be your source of help should you require any queries 
              pertaining to your ORNS matters. <br> <br> Alternatively, you may refer to the followings:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Through your Unit’s Chain of Command</strong> - rifleman contacts 
              Section Commander/Platoon Sergeant &gt; Section Commander/Platoon 
              Sergeant contacts Platoon Commander &gt; Platoon Commander contacts OC,

              <p>As a NSman, you may be called up for various NS activities, 
              one of which is the In-Camp Training (ICT). Every ICT aims to strengthen
               you in a set of specific skill and there may be slight variations in 
              the conduct of the ICT in different formations. <br> <br> <strong>What is the nature of ICT Notification?</strong><br> During the first 6 months after you completed full-time NS, you may be called up for NS activities not more than 4 hours. <br> <br> Thereafter, every NS work year, you may be called up to a maximum of 40 days of Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS). <br> <br> Or in the case where you are called up for more than 40 days in one work
               year, you are required to seek agreement with your employer for this 
              extended service. Both you and your employer will then have to sign an 
              undertaking to indicate acceptance of the arrangement.<br> <br> The duration of your call-up may be as follows:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Low Key (LK) Training and Make-Up Training (MUT)</strong><br> These refer to trainings that are between 2 to 6 days and you will be notified 3 months in advance.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>High Key (HK) Training</strong><br> These trainings are usually 7 days and longer and you will be notified 6 months in advance.<br> </li>
              <li><strong>Call-Up Activities</strong><br> These activities may last 1 day or less and you will be notified 2 months in advance.<br> <br> <strong>What are the types of Call-Up?</strong>
              <ul>
              <li>In-Camp Training (ICT)</li>

              days at 2115 hours. You are required to acknowledge the call-up on NS 
              Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>) or by 
              calling the 6-HINSMEN (6446 7636). Failing to do so after 10 days, a 
              hard copy SAF100 will be sent to your official address via registered 
              mail.<br> <br> Upon receipt of the call-up, you have to inform your employer either via
               a printed copy or forwarding the soft copy of the eSAF100 on NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>) as official documentation as their reference.<br> <br> Sample of the broadcast message:</p>

              <p>You will receive advance notification before every ICT so as 
              to minimise disruption and inconvenience to your work schedules and also
               allow your employer ample time to make necessary arrangements, if 
              needed.<br> <br> Note that if you do not attend your scheduled NS training without 
              official leave, you will be tagged as being “Absent Without Official 
              Leave” (AWOL) from your place of duty. Disciplinary action will be taken
               against you.</p>
              <p><strong>What happens if I am unable to attend ICT?</strong><br> Every NSman’s role is vital for a cohesive training with other NSmen 
              from your unit and it is therefore important that you refresh your 
              skills to ensure smooth operation as a team.  As such, your absence from
               ICT will affect the training and operational readiness of your unit. 
              While MINDEF exercises flexibility in granting deferment, every case 
              will be carefully assessed and weigh against the impact on operational 
              readiness. <br> <br> Having assessed the genuineness and severity of the case submitted, 
              considered the training requirements, your proficiency level, attendance
               records and past performances, the unit commanding officer may grant 
              you a deferment.<br> <br> <strong>What is a deferment and how do I apply?</strong><br> Deferment refers to a postponement of a specific In-Camp Training (ICT).<br> <br> You can login to <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/mydefer/main"><strong>MyDeferment</strong></a> in NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>)
               to apply online. You are responsible for your own deferment application
               and all supporting documents and information by your employers or other
               sources much be attached together with your application.<br> <br> <strong>What are the considerations for deferment application?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>New employment or newly established business<br> </li>
              <li>Marriage and Honeymoon<br> </li>

              <p>To facilitate you and your employer’s understanding of ORNS, a list 
              of commonly used terms has been compiled for your reference. <br> <br> <strong>National Servicemen (NSmen)</strong><br> What was previously known as ‘Reservists’, have since been renamed as 
              National Servicemen (NSmen). These are primarily male Singaporeans and 
              Permanent Residents (PR) who have completed their full-time National 
              Service and transited to the <strong>Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS)</strong> cycle.<br> <br> <strong>Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS)</strong><br> This refers to the NS training phase that NSmen undergo within their NS 
              unit training cycle. NSmen can be called up to perform 40 days of NS 
              every work year.<br> <br> <strong>NS Unit Training Cycle</strong><br> Most NS units follow a training cycle that typically spans 10 years, 
              including at least 7 high-key (HK) training. This is to ensure that NS 
              training is conducted effectively and efficiently.<br> <br> <strong>Training</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>High-Key (HK) Training – refers to NS training of 7 days and longer.</li>
              <li>Low-Key (LK) Training – refers to NS training of less than 7 days.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>National Service (NS) Year</strong><br> This is aligned to the work year, i.e. 1 Apr to 31 March of the 
              following year. During each NS year, the NSman will undergo NS training 
              in accordance to his NS unit’s training tempo and clock either a HK or a
               LK training.<br> <br> <strong>Call-Up</strong><br> This refers to the notification informing the NSman to report for NS 
              activities. E.g. In-Camp training (ICT), briefing, courses, etc.<br> <br> <strong>SAF100</strong><br> This is a legally binding document, which obliges the NSman to report 
              for an NS activity. The NSman is required to acknowledge the SAF100 and 
              inform his employer, if any of the forthcoming NS activity. Failing to 
              comply will subject the NSman to disciplinary action.<br> <br> <strong>Deferment</strong><br> This refers to a request by an NSman to postpone his scheduled call-up to a later date, usually within the same work year.<br> <br> <strong>Disruption</strong><br> This is a request by an NSman to postpone his NS call-up for a period of
               one year or longer, usually for the purpose of overseas studies or 
              postings.<br> <br> <strong>MINDEF Reserve (MR)</strong><br> MINDEF Reserve consists of NSmen who have completed their NS training 
              cycle but have yet to reach the statutory age. They are no longer called
               back for In-Camp Training (ICT) but are still liable for NS.<br> <strong><br> Ex-National Service (Ex-NS)</strong><br> These are NSmen who have reached the statutory age, i.e. 40 for 
              non-officers and 50 for officers and have completed their NS liability</p>

              <p><strong>What is Service Pay?</strong><br> Service Pay is equivalent to the NS allowance, and is dependent on your 
                  rank and the vocation you are holding. This reflects the different 
                  responsibilities each NSman shoulders. If you are holding a combat 
                  vocation, your service pay will include a combat allowance.<br> <br> Service pay will be given to you each day of your NS training including 
                  weekends and public holidays. It will be pro-rated based on the duration
                   of your NS training. A minimum half-day service pay will be credited to
                   you for NS activities of 4 hours or less.<br> <br> While service pay may not be an accurate measure of compensation for 
                  your commitments towards the defence of Singapore, it serves as 
                  recognition of your contribution to NS each day.<br> <br> <strong>How is service pay calculated?</strong></p>

              <p><strong>What is Make-Up Pay (MUP)?</strong><br> MUP is a reimbursement for any civilian income loss you suffered as a 
                  result of having to attend your NS training. Any NSman who is gainfully 
                  employed or self-employed is eligible to claim MUP. Please note that MUP
                   is claimable only if there is an overlap between your civilian working 
                  hours and the NS training. Any loss of income suffered outside the 
                  duration of NS training will not be compensated by MINDEF.<br> <br> NSmen’s attention is drawn to:<br> a.    Regulation 9 of the Enlistment (Loss of Salaries and Wages – Reimbursement) Regulation, 1978: <br> -    Authorised personnel from MINDEF may conduct visits to companies to
                   verify the make-up pay claims. Employers/NSmen are requested to give 
                  access to the required documents related to the claim. <br> <br> b.    Regulation 10(2) of the Enlistment (Loss of Salaries and Wages – Reimbursement) Regulation, 1978:<br> -    If there is any dispute on the decision given on MUP claim, the 
                  NSman must notify MINDEF in writing, stating the grounds of the dispute 
                  and supported by the necessary documentary evidence, not later than 3 
                  weeks from the date on which the decision on the claim is given.<br> <br> c.    Regulation 11 of the Enlistment (Loss of Salaries and Wages – Reimbursement) Regulation, 1978:<br> -    Any person who gives false or misleading information in respect of 
                  MUP claims shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on 
                  conviction to a fine not exceeding S$2,000 or to imprisonment for a term

                  Overpayments may also be recovered from your subsequent MUP claims.<br> <br> Your trade income for provisional payment and the final adjusted amount will be obtained directly from IRAS.<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 2</span>: Average Income Option</strong><br> Your monthly income will be calculated based on your average income earned in the 6 months before the NS training.<br> <br> For example, if you are a doctor or a transport driver, you can claim 
                  replacement fees incurred when you engage a replacement staff to fulfill
                   your duties during your absence.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>What is the deadline for MUP claim submission?</strong><br> All your MUP claims should be submitted 2 weeks prior to your training 
                  commencement to ensure prompt payment. If your claim is submitted after 
                  your NS training, you will only be paid your service pay first. MUP will
                   be paid to you after your claim is approved.<br> <br> Please note that your MUP claim must be submitted within 3 months from 
                  your payment of service pay. All supporting documents can be submitted 
                  later but still within the 3 months from the payment of service pay. 
                  Thereafter, it will not be accepted.<br> <br> <strong>How will I be paid?</strong><br> All payments will be credited into your bank account number provided by 
                  you during your full-time NS or regular service. It is therefore 
                  important for you to ensure that your personal information is updated. 
                  You can update any changes on <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/selfupd/main">eSelf-Update</a> at NS Portal (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>). <br> <br> If your employer is on the DIRECT Schemes and wish to change their bank account, please ensure that they log in to eServices at <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/employers/callup/upd-com-part">NS Portal</a> (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>) to update the company’s particulars.<br> <br> Please note that if there is an overpayment of MUP due to whatever 
                  reason, MINDEF reserves the right to offset the excess quantum from your
                   future NS payments, which may be in the form of service pay.<br> <br> <strong>Payment Queries</strong><br> If you have any queries on payment, you can get assistance from the following:<br> <br> Online: <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/nspay/about">NS Portal</a> (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>)<br> Email: <a href="mailto:contact@ns.sg">contact@ns.sg</a><br> Hotline: 1800-367 6767 (1800-eNSNSNS)<br> Fax: 6373 1464 (For employed claims)<br>         6373 1499 (For self-employed claims)</p>

              <p>Your safety is of utmost importance during your NS training. 
                  All NS activities require adherence to strict safety regulations. As 
                  such, we have specially arranged for you the SAF Group Insurance Scheme.
                   This is underwritten by Aviva Ltd and provides for you 24 hours 
                  worldwide coverage and it is comprehensive and kept at a minimal cost. <br> <br> All NSmen aged 55 and below are eligible to apply. Your dependent male 
                  children are also eligible for coverage from age 14 days to their 18th 
                  year birthday; and female children from age 14 days to 25. Under this 
                  scheme, you and your spouse can continue to enjoy this insurance scheme 
                  up to age 70. This insurance pays for all forms of death (except suicide
                   within one year from the date of commencement of insurance), total and 
                  permanent disablement and permanent partial dismemberment arising from 
                  personal accident.<br> <br> <strong>Details of Scheme</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(A)    Fees and Sum Insured</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Under the SAF Group Insurance Scheme, you 
                  have the option of selecting the sum assured in multiples of $10,000, 
                  from a minimum of $20,000 to a maximum of $600,000. For each insured sum
                   of $10,000, you only have to pay a monthly premium of $1.28 and $1.00 
                  for your dependents.</p>
              <p><strong>(B)    Rebates</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When you participate in this scheme, you 
                  can expect to receive rebates for your annual premiums in a “good year” 
                  (i.e. a year in which claims paid out to policyholders are lesser than 
                  the total premiums received).<br> <br> The rebates paid out in the last 3 policy years averaged at about 34% of
                   total premium paid by policyholders. Based on the revised rate of $1.28
                   and $1.00 for you and your dependents respectively, this in effect 
                  means that policyholders pay a monthly premium of only $0.85 and $0.66 
                  per $10,000 coverage for you and your dependants.</p>
              <p><strong>(C)    Payment Method</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Premiums for the sum insured will be deducted monthly through GIRO.</p>

              <p>This is a MINDEF initiative to recognise our full-time NSF’s 
                  contribution to Singapore’s defence and continued stability. In return, 
                  we offer an online preparatory and refresher courses to them while they 
                  are in service to facilitate from full-time NS to either join the 
                  workforce or further their studies. There are no restrictions to the 
                  number of courses that each NSF can sign up. All e-Prep courses are 
                  priced at an affordable rate, which are significantly lower than the 
                  market rate.<br> <br> <strong>Who is eligible?</strong><br> All NSFs are eligible for e-Prep during their last 12 months of service 
                  and continues to be eligible for this benefit within 1 year after their 
                  ORD. They will be notified by post individually when they are eligible.<br> <br> <strong>Details of e-Prep</strong><br> Every NSF will be allocated $350 worth of credits to subsidise for the 
                  courses that he subscribes.  As a guide, MINDEF will subsidise up to 90%
                   of the course fee, subject to the maximum subsidy given or the credit 
                  balance of the NSF, whichever is higher. For example, for a $100 course,
                   the NSF will pay $10 and MINDEF will bear the remainder $90. Note that 
                  any subsidies that are not consumed within 1 year after the NSF’s ORD 
                  will be forfeited.<br> <br> <strong>Category of Courses</strong><br> There are now 12 participating training providers, which includes local 
                  Institutes of Higher Learning, and e-learning vendors. These vendors 
                  offer more than 1,500 course titles in 3 broad categories:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Academic Courses</strong>:<br> These courses aim to help the NSFs refresh and update their academic 
                  knowledge from previous learning and to facilitate transitions into 
                  further studies. Such courses are usually provided by Institutions of 
                  Higher Learning. Having completed selected courses, NSFs would get a 
                  head start in their educational pursuits after their fulltime service.</li>
              <li><strong>Professional Certification and Technical Courses</strong>:<br> These are predominantly technical courses like, Microsoft Certified 
                  Systems Engineer, which will add value to a non-technical certification 
                  course to enhance the NSF’s employability.</li>
              <li><strong>Enabling Skills (“Soft Soft Skills”) Courses</strong>:<br> These courses aim to provide the NSFs with generic knowledge, skills and
                   attitudes to succeed in the workplace or further studies.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>How to Participate?</strong><br> Participation to this scheme is strictly voluntary. <br> <br> All available e-Prep courses are published on the internet and for 
                  convenience, NSFs can e-learn from the comfort of their own homes or in 
                  their camps as long as there are internet facilities. Military training 
                  and duties will take precedence over the participation in this scheme.<br> <br> NSFs can refer to <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/web/esvcs/mindef/eprep/main">NS Portal</a> (<a href="http://www.ns.sg">www.ns.sg</a>)

                  allocation and balance, records of their past attended courses and the 
                  available range of courses.<br> <br> All course applications can be done online and once the 10% co-payment 
                  is made to the course provider, the NSF will be granted access to the 
                  course material.<br> <br> For assistance or clarifications on this scheme, the NSF can contact:<br> <br> NS Call Centre: 1800-eNSNSNS (1800-3676767)<br> Email: <a href="mailto:contact@ns.sg">contact@ns.sg</a><br> SMS: eNSNS (36767)</p>

                  medical expenses incurred by you that fall within the prevailing 
                  guidelines.</p>
              <p><strong>(B)    Dental Treatment</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">You may only seek urgent dental treatment 
                  at SAF Dental Centres for emergency dental conditions that arise during 
                  your ICT. (E.g. acute toothache, acute gum swelling, etc.)</p>
              <p><strong>(C)    Medical Review – New/Existing Medical Conditions</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is crucial that you update your NS HRCs
                   if you develop a new medical condition or if an existing medical 
                  condition has worsened, which may affect your ICT performance. This is 
                  so that arrangements will be made for you to attend a medical review at 
                  the SAF medical centre to assess your fitness condition for NS.<br> <br> You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span> bring along all your investigation results and 
                  memorandums from your external physician or specialist during your 
                  medical review. You may be given a medical certificate for ICT 
                  deferment, be scheduled for a medical board to downgrade you if your 
                  medical condition is significant, or be referred to a restructured 
                  hospital for further examination depending on the outcome of your 
                  medical review.<br> <br> If your medical condition is deemed suited for ICT participation by the medical officer, you will then be allowed to attend ICT.</p>

              <p><strong>(A)    Service Injuries</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you sustained an injury during your NS 
                  training, it may be considered as attributable to service only when 
                  service is the cause of injury. If you sustained an injury during ICT, 
                  you are required to report immediately to your unit’s Medical Officer 
                  and unit S1. This is so that your unit can arrange to attend to your 
                  injury, and document your injury sustained in your medical docket.<br> <br> Before MINDEF determines that an injury is attributable to service, you 
                  are responsible for bearing all medical expenses. Treatment for your 
                  injury must be sought at government or restructured hospitals at your 
                  eligible ward and referred to by a government or SAF Medical Officer.<br> <br> In the case of permanent disablement due to service injury, a medical 
                  board will be convened. Eligibility for disability compensation will be 
                  based on the degree of residual permanent disability as endorsed by the 
                  SAF Medical Board.<br> <br> If your service injury requires continuous medical or hospitalisation 
                  leave beyond your ICT period, you are eligible for a stepped-down 
                  compensation as a form of ex-gratia payment. Compensation will be based 
                  on your civilian pay or an equivalent regular serviceman’s pay 
                  (whichever is higher) if you do not receive any income from your 
                  employers. This ex-gratia payment is compensation for your loss of 
                  income during this period. Payment will cease when you are no longer on 
                  medical/hospitalisation leave or when disability compensation is paid, 
                  whichever is earlier.</p>
              <p><strong>(B)    Non-Service Injuries</strong></p>
              <p>i.    <strong>Satisfactory Completion of NS Training</strong><br> If you are given medical leave for non-service injuries but are able to 
                  complete your NS training satisfactorily, your medical leave will be 
                  considered as part of NS training. You will be eligible for service pay 
                  and MUP for the completed NS training duration, inclusive of all periods
                   of medical leave.<br> <br> ii.    <strong>Disruption from NS Training</strong><br> If you are given medical leave for non-service injuries and your unit 
                  has disrupted you from NS training, you are eligible for service pay and
                   MUP till the end of your medical leave or original NS training, 
                  whichever is earlier. The payment of service pay and MUP from the date 
                  of disruption is made on an ex-gratia basis and is restricted to the 
                  first medical certificate you submit.<br> <br> iii.    <strong>Deferment from NS Training</strong><br> If you report sick on the first day of NS training and are granted 
                  deferment on the same day, you will not be eligible for service pay and 
                  MUP for any period of medical leave. You will, however, be eligible for 
                  service pay and MUP for the time spent at the unit to seek consultation 
                  with your unit’s Medical Officer or to get your medical certificate 
                  endorsed.</p>
