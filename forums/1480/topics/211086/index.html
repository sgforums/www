Therefore it is alright to apply again for him as there is no such thing as a record where one who failed before will be 'blacklisted'?

Thanks for your warm welcome. it will be better to welcome me if i really got into VSC. ^.^ actually no any division prefered. possibly if i get in i will be posted to NPC right? Do i have the right to choose? or they decide? If i can choose, i hope to be posted to West area since i am living in the west. But why do you say that its not good to be posted to the area near my house?<br></div>
