              <p>so u saying waste $ send pple go medical which they very unlikely to fail and then fail them later when the interview results are out ? makes no sense.</p>
              <p>think they making the process faster by giving those who they wanna confirm the medical form. if you want someone, u know right after the interview one...no need wait so long. the wait is due to admin work.</p>

              <p>Those that got the medical straight away are clear cut cases. That mean if they don't screw up interview, they will get the job. I think that is minority</p>
              <p>The rest are not so clear cut, and they will probably have to take more time to decide on which person to sign. These should be the majority.</p>

              <p>yah lor, dis kind of thing no fixed rule lah...if ur group alot of people suitable then 80% passing rate oso not surprising.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dependent on the capability and potential of the guy/gal one. Now supply &gt; demand, the panel interviewers will be more choosy...its only natural.</p>

              <p>hi.. Did anyone went for the panel interview today (28 april
                      2009) for the senior police officer position? Did anyone receive
                      the medical letter after the interview? Did anyone receive it? Coz
                      I only fill up some forms after the interview. Does this mean I am
                      rejected for the position? Coz from what i had read in the forum,
                      someone mentioned that they received the medical letter 
                      immediately after the interview.. So now i am a bit worried.. Had
                      gone through so many rounds of interviews...By the way,I asked one
                      of the recruit officer regarding the application status. He
                      told me that SPF will get back to us within a week. Is this true?
                      Did they mention the same thing to you too?</p>
              <p> I went for the panel interview on 28/04/09, no medical letter too :( .
                  i was told that Mr Johnny will get back to us within 1-2 weeks.</p>

              <p><br>No, cos i was attending orientation.</p>
              <p>Wrt those claims that 'medical letters' were issued immediately after the panel, personally, it strikes me as a very strange thing to do, cos approval has to be sought from mha before an offer can be made.</p>
              <p>Like Belmont mentioned, no news = good news.</p>
              <p>An additional point i would like to make, take whatever claims in this forum with a pinch of salt, you never know if there are any trolls or quarks out there.</p>

For info, I had actually called up the officer (using the no. displayed in the sms for enquire) and check on this matter. His reply was that those who received the medical forms are deem to hav cleared the board of panel. Appointment will now only depends on the medical results.</p>
