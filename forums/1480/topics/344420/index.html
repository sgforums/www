              <p>Hi guys, I have just received a sms from SPF today regarding my application for SPO, I was called up for a selection on the 22nd Jan 09 and I have some questions wondering if you guys can help me.</p>
              <p>1. What is the selection test about?</p>
              <p>2. Except my certs and documents, anything else that I need to bring?</p>
              <p>3. What is the average waiting time for selection result?</p>
              <p>4. I've heard that there are 2 interviews, so if I pass the first selection, what are the chances for me to pass the second? Because at the same time I have went for a teaching interview and I'm afraid if I pass my teaching interview, I would be asked to sign contract with MOE and which means I wont be able to join the SPF.</p>
              <p>5. What is the recruitment ratio of SPO compared to PO? I've heard that the chances of getting recruited are very slim, is it so?</p>
              <p>6. As I'm a lady, what is the recruitment ratio of police women compared to policemen? Are women at a disadvantage?</p>
              <p>Thanks alot!</p>

              <p> 1) the test will determine how you deal with things in life, attitude, common sense etc etc....   dont worry on how to do it..... just answer what you think its right...</p>
              <p>2) certs are the stuff to determind your pay.....  so nothing much you can bring on that....</p>
              <p>as for 3) to 6)</p>
              <p>there is no answer to that..... everthing depands on the situation.....   if you are the first one... of cos...  interview will be fast?  if you are in the middle... then will depands on how those people in front of you perform?</p>
              <p>there is no such thing as if pass 1st stage, % of going to second stage....  as long as you cant fulfill the requirement... you can be out.... even if you are already undergoing training...  there are no quotas/ratio for SPF.....  so still the same ans....  do your best...  this is not a job where standard interview questions will have standard answers.....  so when you are applying for both MOE and SPF... you have to decide your own future....  which one you will want to be with.....</p>

              <p>To hisoka: Hmm if I got accepted by MOE ill start as a contract teacher very soon, just got my notification thru sms for a dialogue session next tues. So maybe I should just tell them frankly that if I were to be selected, I will join after my contract teaching which ends in Jun. =/ Cant afford to turn any job opportunities down now due to the current economy situation, dun wanna stay at hm everyday and feel like a fei ren =( However, being a police woman will always be my true passion.</p>
              <p>Thanks anyway</p>
