              <p>no lah, AFAIK the result very fast one. Cos blood test is on the spot know result, urine test takes awhile in the lab to get the readings. So all in all, if Raffles Medical never drag too long. The report can be out 2 days after the check-up. Then pass to vital.org then to SPF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>JO alot of people, so is mass-intake...even if selected they will also arrange a date for them to all come in and have some ceremony ? Not so sure.</p>

                  Honors. Is it an engineering degree? Cuz which course you took

              <p>Chances for promotion to SPO exist, true. But they are few and far between, and do not come around 2-3 years later. Heck, even one's first promotion will not come around 2-3 years. Not generally, anyway.</p>
              <p>Anyway, for what it's worth, the chance to convert from PO to SPO will only come after an average of 10-12 years. Yes, it is that long. And even then, conversion is not a certainty.</p>
              <p>This is why people will always ask you to get your degree first and come to SPF, so you can start off as an SPO [if approved] straight.</p>

              <p>in 2001 i personally saw one such instance...by then they say the management limiting the number of JOs-&gt;SOs liao..</p>

              <p><br>You cant go wrong with smart casual.</p>
              <p>a) Try covered shoes, from sneakers to loafers to your leather shoes &amp; heels.  Ladies to avoid sandals, cos you are not going to a market. </p>
              <p>Preferably one you wear socks with and when you take them off, they wont stink to high heaven and kill off people around you. (If it does, you should apply to be a assasin instead.)</p>
              <p>b) Socks. preferably without holes at the toes.  And ladies.....fishnet stockings with short shorts are kinda frowned upon.  You are not expected to perform pole dancing, so kinda leave that outfit at home please.</p>
              <p>c) Long Jeans or denim dress/skirt is okay, just make sure its not torn at places and preferably a dark colour.</p>
              <p>d) Wear a collar shirt aka a polo shirt at the very least. For females, a blouse, a polo shirt or a outfit that looks presentable to your b/f's parents.</p>
              <p>4) Some cologne or at least a deodarant will be nice. (Look to (a) for my reasonings.</p>
              <p>5) Some grooming will be nice too. Clean tidy looking hair &amp; face.  Females please do have some colours on your cheeks and your lips.  NOT 3 LAYER ICI PAINT!</p>
              <p>6) Bring your original documents plus some photocopies to give to the officers. Maybe bring along a A4 plastic folder hold your originals certs and so on and to keep out the rain.</p>
              <p>7) Did they mention you need to bring along a PT kit to change into?  If not, then forget number 7.</p>

              <p>hi, i went for the selection assessment on 8th April which involve doing alot of tests in the morning and return to fill in tons of forms after lunch. There were around 20+ people present for the selection assessment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They sms me on 9th April evening asking me to go for dialogue session on 14th April.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now there only left 6 people for the diaglogue which i guess many was either being screened out, or allocated to another dialogue session.The session was divided into 2 parts, 1st part is some physical examination, whereby you need to do some stretching. 2nd part of the day was the dialogue session. 2 interviewers were present, one was the assistant director of manpower, the other was from manpower but position unknown. The diaglogue beginning with them asking me some questions just like what a normal interview would be. Mine last for like 10+mins. I mentioned something about my Community involvement in RC and they was quite interested with that and keep asking me questions like what was my role in RC, what was my Position, and what i usually do in RC. I replied by saying i am the assistant treasurer, i involve in setting up mother's day celebration, breeze walker activities, block and floor party etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was wondering when would they give me a reply? Whats was the chance of me being successful ? I know that they say will give me a reply between 1 - 2 weeks, but would it be like a next day reply through sms just like what happened after my selection assessment?</p>
