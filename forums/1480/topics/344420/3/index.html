              <p>Hi guys, I have just received a sms from SPF today regarding my
              application for SPO, I was called up for a selection on the 22nd
              Jan 09 and I have some questions wondering if you guys can help
              me.</p>
              <p>1. What is the selection test about?</p>
              <p>2. Except my certs and documents, anything else that I need to
              bring?</p>
              <p>3. What is the average waiting time for selection result?</p>
              <p>4. I've heard that there are 2 interviews, so if I pass the
              first selection, what are the chances for me to pass the second?
              Because at the same time I have went for a teaching interview and
              I'm afraid if I pass my teaching interview, I would be asked to
              sign contract with MOE and which means I wont be able to join the
              SPF.</p>
              <p>5. What is the recruitment ratio of SPO compared to PO? I've
              heard that the chances of getting recruited are very slim, is it
              so?</p>
              <p>6. As I'm a lady, what is the recruitment ratio of police women
              compared to policemen? Are women at a disadvantage?</p>
              <p>Thanks alot!</p>

              <p>i think, if it is a tiger *touch wood*, the resource will still have to engage it if at scene. shoot / tase it if a threat to life is imminent. if not, just giving the tiger space, cordoning off the area and managing public order for that location will do.</p>
              <p>anyway, my point is, if resource has been despatched and is at scene, they will still have to manage and resume once the incident is done. even if it is a matter best handled by external agencies, the police still have to pick it up once the call has been made. external agencies will always wait and / or come into the picture only after the end of the incident.</p>
