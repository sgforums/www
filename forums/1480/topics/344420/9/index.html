              <p>Yawnzz, going to zzz for the next 3 days. Before that, thought juz summarise the entire application process for future blur chaps.</p>
              <p>1) Application can be via adverts, online or career fairs;</p>
              <p>2) You will be asked to submit hard copies of your educational certs, certificate of service etc etc after your application if not already done so.</p>
              <p>3) If you are invited for a Psychometric test, congrats, you have made it to the 1st hurdle. Contrary to popular belief, it is POSSIBLE NOT to be called up for the test, meaning, you do not meet some requirements.</p>
              <p>4) Be prepared to spend at least a day for the test, cos your educational certs etc will be verified on that day as well. If you claim that you have a 1st class honors / Masters / Phd etc from Cambridge University and on that day, they find that you actually have your tertiary education from Cambodia Bridge Uni, then you are OUT. Similarly, if you claim you are 1.8 m tall or above 55kg BUT only if you are wearing platform shoes or carrying your full pack, then .... out you go.</p>
              <p>5) The next hurdle is the Dialogue session with manpower officials. This is a 1st cut interview to determine your interest, motivation in joining the force. Your hand / foot coordination, tatoos check etc will be conducted if not done so.</p>
              <p>6) If you make it pass the dialogue, you will be invited for a 1 to 1 session with a psychologist. Be prepared for a half day session with him / her. The psychologist will generated a VERY DETAILED REPORT following your session for the panel interview. It is NOT POSSIBLE to fail this. But if the psychologist determines that you are a fatalist person with sadist tendencies, then ...</p>
              <p>7) The final stage - the panel interview. This interview is meant to determine your aspirations, potential and whether you will actually fit the job. BE YOURSELF. The panellist are senior officials who CAN tell if you are paraphasing official lines. YOU ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION. It is OK to agree to disagree. They want a leader, not a yes-man.</p>
              <p>8) If you clear the panel interview, you will be asked to go for a medical checkup, and assuming you pass your checkup, to sign the bond with 2 sureties.</p>
              <p>9) If you have made it this far. C u in HTA!!!</p>
              <p>NOTE: NO NEWS = GOOD NEWS. Dont badger the poor manpower officials every 10 mins.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Went for my panel interview on 20th of apr and got my medical checkup form on the same day. Went for my medical checkup on 23rd  apr but up till now there is still no reply from them. Anyone from the same panel interview as me or later who have got the letter to sign contract already? Really worried.</p>

              <p>ahgang,</p>
              <p>I think so long if they qns about your tattoo, just explain truthfully. I don't think there is any bias against those who have tattoo on them, esp for your case is hidden nicely at the back so long you have your top on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best!</p>

              <p>Hi Glenn07 and Wind0518,</p>
              <p>Called police recruit just now. Apparently they process in batches. As in for those who are in the same day for the panel interview (the one before medical checkup), they belong to the same batch. So they will only process when they received all the medical reports who are from the same interview time as yours. Check with both of you, when did you all go for the panel interview? Mine is on the 20th of apr.</p>
