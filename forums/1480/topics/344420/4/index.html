              <p>Hi, I just went for my medical yesterday. I declared that I have childhood asthma which I have already recovered fully from and I asked the doctor if this will hinder the chance of me getting into the police force, she couldn't give me a definite ans but after examination she certified me as fully fit for the job, however, on the paper itself she wrote childhood asthma, last attack at 7 years old, recovered, active in sports and able to do NAPFA. I consider myself as fully fit and active in sports (soccer), I do not
              even use inhaler ever since the last attack and have no problem running 4km during every soccer
              training. May I know if the force will accept me as I had asthma when I was young? Anyone got rejected during medical cuz he/she had asthma background? Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi No9,</p>
              <p>I believed i met the minimum requirement with my distance-learning pass degree from a recognised oversea uni...with avg D grade.</p>
              <p>but perhaps they prefer those with local degree, with hons bah.</p>
              <p>With my avg degree... most prob im on their waiting list.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Envisage, it is okay if its PO, you can start as PO first, then if you perform well, there is always a chance for promotion to SPO around 2-3 years later. The reason for maybe putting you on a waiting list is perhaps the degree you have does not come with Honors. Is it an engineering degree? Cuz which course you took could also be related.</p>
              <p>Anyway, wish you good luck! When going for interview, prepare all your stuff, try to sell yourself not only in academic. If you are some leader in any organization or internationally recognized organization, you should put them in CV and also try to mention it in interview. Eg. sports leader/captain, some society president, SAF Sergeant/Officer, received some awards or been a volunteer in charity etc. These will show that you have leadership, initiative, public service attitude, etc. And think about situations in school or work when you need to multi-task and team work. Lastly, try to get powerful people to act as your referees.</p>
              <p>And, try to meet up those in the forum that has already gone for the interview, e.g. Anshinkan, etc and obtain advice from them.</p>
              <p>Wish you all the best!</p>

              <p><br>Hi Cyan, you should be proactive and call them up or email to check with them. Do not be passive in finding work. :)</p>
              <p>You might like to ask Anshin about the numbers to call? Call up the medical checkup side to see if reports are sent.</p>
