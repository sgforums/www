This is for regular duties minus extra duties... then different NPC will have +-1 hour for breifing and de-briefing.. or depends if you have alot of work and have to work extra hours<br><br>Ans 2: hmmm... for leave is one shift is 1.5 days and one tour is 3 days.. if you take one tour off you actually earn 6 days leave so if you take 2 tours off which is 6 days leave you get 12 days...so if you need a long holiday take a 9 days vacation leave... you will get 18 days off...leave application now is done thru a computer system which i think is quite sucky...<br><br>Ans 3: PNS or those never complete MTE must apply for an exit permit and put up a leaving state form... If complete MTE already then infd your TL about it and give him a leaving state form then you can go overseas already.</div>
