              <p>Are you sure? Just went for and came back from another round of reservist lately. I can tell you, that's definitely not what I felt with the npc I was attached with. I am not saying all police officers are saints. That is definitely not the case. But to say they simply dun bother or only care to harass harmless old folks gambling at voiddecks is surely untrue, if the team I was attached with recently is anything to go by.</p>
              <p>Anyway, public gambling is an offence in the first place. Mostly they just chase away or stop the ppl from doing so. If it ended up in arrests, then the ppl doing it probably went overboard.</p>

              <p>This is nuisance, call, there is a law about it. It is the truth that he has not done anything yet, he is only guilty of nuisance call.</p>
              <p>Here's what you should do:</p>
              <p>contact your service provider about this nuisance call. even if the number is not displayed, the telco provider will still be able to trace the call, if he call alot of times.</p>
              <p>the telco will send warning letter to the offender. If he persist, the telco will inform the police, and they will have the evidence to back it up.</p>

              <p>The police officer who handled your case is probably a newbie, and did not advice you properly. It is indeed true that the police can't do much in that case, but he did not direct you to the proper action to take.</p>

              <p><br>Its a civil suit if you are willing to persue this matter.  But most it can do is cut off his ability to register a line for handphone.</p>
              <p>Since you already got underworld friends to settle the issue instead of goign for it legally, why gripe now?  Makes you sound superior?</p>
