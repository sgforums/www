              <p>if a 93 year old woman commits murder, should we just let her go?</p>
              <p>Or we should let her go because she is your grandmother, and it is a bother to bail her out?</p>
              <p>The police will do their job. you think 93 year old is above the law,  go change the law. if the law says 93 year old is above the law, confirm police won't touch her.</p>

              <p>Look, murder is another thing altogether. I'm talking about A and you're talking about B. Why bring in a whole different analogy by stating one of the most heinous crime, when the little offence I've mentioned doesn't even hurt or harm anyone at all?</p>
              <p> Of course, murder cannot be condone, regardless of the age, status and gender of the murderer. But pls, the level and seriousness of crime or offence should equate to the level of punishment being met out.</p>
              <p>Oh yes. Nobody and definitely not me would say an elderly is above the law. Nobody is and I certainly did not imply that. Please use your goddamn brain. You're simply ridiculous. The things you said seriously sounds absurd.</p>
              <p>Moreover, your lack of compassion speaks volume of your stinking character. (:</p>

              <p>On 18 March 2004, three armed fugitives escaped from Johor, Malaysia after committing armed robbery, and fled by a motorised sampan to Pulau Tekong. Over 700 personnel from the police and the SAF were activated, with the first fugitive captured by the Gurkha officers within 34 hours from the commencement of the search operation. The second fugitive was arrested by the Police Coast Guard's Special Task Squadron officers, while the last man was again caught by the GC six hours after the second arrest</p>

              <p>yes. I know it's an offence and yes, i know it warrants an arrest. But look and compare the magnitude and seriousness of the crime to let's say, murder or robbery + assault. On a scale of one to ten - gambling probably would be ranked 1 or 2 (it causes no harm to others), and murder with a 9,10, robbery + assault maybe an 8 or 9.</p>
              <p>And as I said, that mofo PO could simply give a warning, but he arrested a whole bunch of elderly, sent 'em to the police station, made them stay in that f*ckin' cold and empty lockup for 6, 7 f*ckin' hours (evening/night), giving them only some cheapo expired bread and packet drink, so what the f*ck do you think this is?</p>
              <p>Of course, I won't be so mean or malicious as to curse his own mom/grandma to be dead or whatsoever. Plus, it is not making a sweeping statement, or having a brush to paint them all.</p>
              <p>There were other few occasions when my grandma got robbed in the lift lobby, and my aunt got robbed at knife-point, and till now after 10 over years, they're still unable to catch the robbers. Of course, this case has been over for so long, obviously do you think the police would give a flying f*ck?</p>

              <p>I used to be like you... complain complain and complain about police... say police no good this and that...</p>
              <p>Then I become SC and kena put in their boots... I never ever sit on coffee shop b4 ever... Infact, PO rarely seen sitting on coffee shop... I'll tell you why people say police slack on coffee shop...</p>
              <p>1 NPC got more than 30 pairs of officers on patrol... 1 pair take a break for 10 mins each time and they rotate among each other who takes a break... but MOP see PO take a break whole day coz they see PO at coffee shop whole day when infact those are different officers taking a break at coffee shop for only less than 10 mins...</p>
              <p>Another thing... if ther are no murders commited during at the time, so PO let other crimes be committed while waiting for murder to happen...? No right...</p>
              <p>Also for gambling... most PO many times just chase away casual gamblers... but if kena reported more than 10 times still want to chase away izzit??? And maybe the arrest was connected to more serious network that we don't know...</p>
              <p>For robbery, PO are not gods who can magically appear when someone shouted help... They try their best depending on traffic condition and location... Most 999 calls are not very detailed... People report robbery at vicinity of Jalan Besar... you try to find someone kena robbed like that... Furthermore, people call 999 like 5mins later... 2 mins people can run how far already... Please, when making 999 calls, be precise, accurate and early... Plus you can also blame those prank calls to 999 which take up the line, 150,000 pranks calls last year... imagine the amount of resources wasted...</p>
              <p>That's why PO are encouraged to do foot patrol to step up police presence... but do foot patrol people complain PO nothing to do walk around only or Singapore becoming Police State... zzz WTH does MOP want??? Do patrol complain, don't do patrol also complain...</p>

              <p> dear trendz,</p>
              <p>i
                  have to say that i feel for you. My own  family members were arrested
                  before and i understand how you feels....  you do have your point
                  there....   but wait....  gambling is not serious? or did i get your
                  words wrong, please pardon me if i did...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"greed
                  is the root of the cause" - gambling can results in alot of things that
                  a gambler cant imagine unless they realise that its wrong and choose to
                  stop..... saw the ad on TV where this "father" told his daughter that
                  "its going to be the last time?" he wants her to break her piggy bank
                  and let him have a "comeback" so he will stop it once and for all... 
                  who suffers? end of the day, the family members will suffer...</p>
              <p>of
                  cos i have to admit, old folks gamble to past time...  but does they
                  need to involve with money? its a bad example to youths and will lead
                  them thinking that gambling is nothing wrong... I also noticed that
                  there is a raising trend of singaporean playing mahjong.... issit becos
                  we are being expose to more gambling environment ( i.e. movies, games,
                  old folks playing at void deck ) or we simply doesnt know that gambling
                  is bad for one?</p>
              <p>we are citizens of singapore and we have to
                  obey our own country law... if no one enforce it, then there will be no
                  law and order.... "look around us" as what stated by one of the
                  forumites, we are indeed better then other country around us...  but of
                  cos, there is still room for improvement.... remember, "low crime
                  doesnt mean no crime"... hey i like this banner of all i have seen by
                  the SPF....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps police can do their part
                  better in your "grandma being robbed" case.... I have to agree...  only
                  recently I saw those signs stating of the crime happen at the location
                  and appeal for witnesses...  how i wish such ideas have came up long
                  ago... at least its kinda "enable public awareness" and also for those
                  who always "claimed" that they wanted to help but does not know the
                  right number to call to.... I do hope there will be witnesses to stand
                  up for your grandma case or maybe police can find important leads to
                  the case so your grandma or you can get the reply after 10 years~  =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i
                  remember my kampong days, where everyone is so close and friendly... 
                  we would dare to leave our door open and not worrying of anything being
                  stolen.... what happen now? our neighbours unit are either not in (busy
                  working and substaining s'pore standard of living) or choose to enjoy
                  in their own cosy home (where all windows and doors are closed).....
                  unless the same "generation" happens to be staying at the same level
                  (kids studying pri, sec etc or all young parents or all old folks etc
                  etc) or else its like everyone is living in their own world....  where
                  is all the friendliness we use to have, i really miss it.... even WiFi
                  also have to steal.... where have all our "willingly to share" and
                  "looking for each other's back" attitude gone to?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well....
                  i understand you have lost faith in them just like some of our
                  citizens....  but wait... MSK? did my english fail me or i get the
                  wrong facts?  MSK is an error committed by ISD and to my own knowledge,
                  police is assisting in investigation as stated in news.... did MSK
                  escape from a police establishment? can anyone correct me on this? 
                  well....  i have seen alot nowadays....  MHA staffs are being deployed
                  everywhere.... i see SCDF officers at customs!!!!  oh my god...   i
                  believe when MSK escape, police did quite a good and fast job to narrow
                  down and search for him... thou there is still no news of him.... you
                  should have come to my work place man....   for the first few days, i
                  got so fed up sending my niece to school and to be stuck in a slow
                  moving traffic due to the intensive search.... well....  maybe there
                  might be dark clouds casting over MHA now.... i do hope they can think
                  and work fast to win back public confident.... i admit my confident did
                  rocked abit...   but after some observation, i believe i still have
                  faith in them to provide security to our country....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lastly,
                  i do hope they can sit down at coffeeshop for coffee you know... so i
                  can ask them questions rather then always trying hard to catch them
                  while they are in their police vehicle patrolling.... i do think their
                  pay is pathetic as i ask my friend in there and got a surprise of what
                  kind of pay they are getting compare to me..... perhaps something
                  should be done....  as what have claimed by another forumite that the
                  turnover rate there is high....  someone have to do their paper
                  work!!!!  and let them patrol our streets more efficiently.....</p>

              <p>Mas Selamat escaped from Whitley Road, from Internal Security Department's custody. take note they are a fellow organization under the ministry of home affairs.</p>
              <p>Take not that ICA is also not under police. saying either of these department is the police is as wrong as saying civil defence (also listed above) is the police.</p>
              <p>Also note the new Casino Regulatory Authority. Singapore government takes gambling seriously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Robbery is a serious offence. those people get caned, and locked up for up to 20 years. so it has a serious punishment, as it fits the crime. so what is the punishment for public gambling? 6 or 7 hours in lock up for minor offence fair enough? And what kind of lock up you want? it is possible to implement nice lock ups, but than people will make noise why use so much taxpayer money.</p>
              <p>Should doing drugs be ranked 1 or 2, because it causes no
                                      harm to others? they are addictive like gambling, and both can involve large amount of money, and both have negative impact on society. Guess what the penalty is for carrying heroin?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you take breaks during your rest time at work? do you need to eat? guess what, the police has 12 hour shifts, and they need to rest and eat too. big surprise there, huh? But since people complain, the police cannot even rest and eat at hawker centres any more. all must take away, and when it's their turn to rest, have to hide one corner, or else some STOMP guy will take picture and say police always slacking. nice going there people. So what's the next step, cancel break and meals for on duty PO? guess why people quit the police.force.</p>

              <p>yes. I know it's an offence and yes, i know it warrants an
              arrest. But look and compare the magnitude and seriousness of the
              crime to let's say, murder or robbery + assault. On a scale of one
              to ten - gambling probably would be ranked 1 or 2 (it causes no
              harm to others), and murder with a 9,10, robbery + assault maybe an
              8 or 9.</p>
              <p>And as I said, that mofo PO could simply give a warning, but he
              arrested a whole bunch of elderly, sent 'em to the police station,
              made them stay in that f*ckin' cold and empty lockup for 6, 7
              f*ckin' hours (evening/night), giving them only some cheapo expired
              bread and packet drink, so what the f*ck do you think this is?</p>
              <p>Of course, I won't be so mean or malicious as to curse his own
              mom/grandma to be dead or whatsoever. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Plus, it is not making a
              sweeping statement, or having a brush to paint them all.</span></span></span></p>
              <p>There were other few occasions when my grandma got robbed in the
              lift lobby, and my aunt got robbed at knife-point, and till now
              after 10 over years, they're still unable to catch the robbers. Of
              course, this case has been over for so long, obviously do you think
              the police would give a flying f*ck?</p>
              <p>And yeah, probably these cases are too minor to be put up in the
              media, only then would the police seriously look into it i
              guess.</p>
              <p>You would think I have anti-police sentiments, but I've lost
              faith in them. Fancy commiting a grave error in letting a
              f*ckin' Muslim SOB terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari escape and
              now he's on the run, nowhere to be found.  </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zou si mi lj? Don't gimme the crap that the police are so
              f*ckin' great! Most of them would be sitting in the coffeeshop
              sipping their economical coffee, slacking their time away. Then
              when they're not on patrol (or rather show off their pathetic
              rank), they would be back at the station doing wretched menial
              paperwork like a no-lifer with a pitiable salary. WOW!</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Your assuming is kinda a bit on the overblown side.</p>
              <p>Home Team?  So what if you are actually a Home Team? Thats about as convincing about your reason to serve as a guy who cant find a job anywhere but in the civil service.</p>
              <p>It also showed your lack of work ethics regards to the work you are currently suppose to be doing.</p>
              <p>You have also continued to show your childishness about your teenage troubles despite the fact that you are a 'Home Team' member.</p>
              <p>And you still display that teenager angst now as a 'Home Team' member?</p>
              <p>Grow up lah, civil suits?  Anyone can do it for free, its those naive ones that believes that it takes a lot of money.  You obviously are ignorant enough to keep harping on those issues which you didnt know what to do when you were younger.</p>
              <p>And underworld people, please lor, I ride, drink kopi, watch movies with about 4 of them nice old folks for 4 years already.  What is underworld when you dont have money or things you can exchange from them?</p>
              <p>And if my uncle have not passed away, a phone call to him and he will be dispatching any 2 members of his group to break any fellas legs I wanted.  It only will cost me $200/-.</p>
