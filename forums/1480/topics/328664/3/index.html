              <p>Are you sure? Just went for and came back from another round of reservist lately. I can tell you, that's definitely not what I felt with the npc I was attached with. I am not saying all police officers are saints. That is definitely not the case. But to say they simply dun bother or only care to harass harmless old folks gambling at voiddecks is surely untrue, if the team I was attached with recently is anything to go by.</p>
              <p>Anyway, public gambling is an offence in the first place. Mostly they just chase away or stop the ppl from doing so. If it ended up in arrests, then the ppl doing it probably went overboard.</p>

              <p>Everyone is entitled to their opinions but defacing posters and makeing groundless accusations issnt going to help anyone change their opinion of the police. Instead it just hows how childish and immature you can be due to your baisness. It seems you have an anti-spf stance. Perhaps you would like to share your past experience with them?</p>
