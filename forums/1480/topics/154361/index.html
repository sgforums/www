            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah agreed. I think there is really nothing much the cops can do about it. Firstly, he has committed no crime, he only just phrased a lewd question to the individual in question. Of course, if you friend really wants to take matters to the extreme, she can sue him for outraging of modesty and even defamation, but it's a far shot though, especially when it happended online where one's identity is ambiguious.<br><br>Anyway, as most of the guys have pointed out, majority of the guys in chat rooms, some way on another, have motives of a perversed nature. So, if your friend is against this sort of harassment, she should stop patronizing such chats.</div>
