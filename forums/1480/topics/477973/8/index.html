                  Hello @Sahsah i received an email to go for the SA on the 19th Feb, and i am a female too :) 
              
                  Btw, may i know if females get to enter the STAR unit under SOC? Am really interested in hostage rescue, but can't seem to find any info on females applying for it elsewhere...
              
                  Would greatly appreciate it if anyone can advise on this! 
              
              
              From what I know, so far theres no girls no the STAR team. the STAR Team in police force is like Commandos in Army, I think no girls are allowed so far.

              Hi all aspiring SPOs, 
              
              Been following this thread since I applied in 2012 while I was in my final year in uni. Yup that's right, 2012. Here's my experience so far:
              
              I applied sometime in 2012, went through the stages up to the board interview, where I guess I didn't do well and I got the rejection email 2 weeks later. That was sometime in August, if I'm not wrong. I didn't want to give up so I kept sending applications and kept getting rejected, until I got an email to tell me to go for the SA in April 2013. So here's what I went through for my second application: 
              
              23 April 2013 - SA
              13 June - Dialogue, but deferred due to overseas
              1 July - Dialogue
              2 August - Board Interview
              30 August - Medical
              
              From the medical till now, they've been calling me once in a while to ask if I'm still working and how long a notice period I need (I need a month) and to submit documents. Most recently, on 28 Feb, I got a call saying that my medical was too long ago and I have to go for a second medical, and that the clinic will contact me, which they haven't. I emailed the recruitment officer, who told me he'll check and get back to me. So I guess the chances of me getting into the next intake in May are really slim. I just hope the next intake won't be too far away and I'll finally get good news. 
              
              I skipped certain aspects of the application process as this is my second time. For the SA, I was told to come early in the morning like everyone else but after my attendance was taken, I was told that I didn't have to take the psychometric test and to come back in the afternoon. I also skipped the psychologist interview and went straight to the board interview stage a few weeks after the dialogue session. So @fullspeed, I hope I answered your question regarding reapplication after getting rejected. 
              
              So for all those still waiting like me, hang in there. If anybody has been waiting longer than me, please share k? All the best to everybody and to those who got their calls, congrats!

              <p><br>has it been more than 6 months since you applied? it's probably clear off because it passed the 6 months' mark.</p>
