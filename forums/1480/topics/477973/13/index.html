              Received the call of acceptance 2 days ago. The next intake is 27th July, orientation 23-25th. Really thankful for the offer and happy. Just want to share that for those who are going through the process, keep going and be optimistic. :)
              
              I was really feeling pathetic after my panel, as they did not ask me any current affairs questions, and only basic hr questions. I was out of the panel room in 10min, while ppl ahead took a good 20min each. Waited for a good 3 mths since medical. 
              
              Anyone care to share their exp for training? Is it physically strenuous? We require stay in etc. thanks a lot.

              <p>I received a call from recruitment asking for notice period. He told me next intake will be 29 july. However, I need to serve 1 month notice and my wife is schedule to give birth in late august so I ask when will be the next intake after july. He mentioned october.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;">I asked if I can join the oct batch due to notice period and my wife expecting delivery.

              <p>Hi Keni6528, congrats on the upcoming birth of your new baby!</p>
              <p>I have read about some candidates' medical test results expiring in the forum before, so it could be true. I don't think there's a problem with deferring to the next intake, since you most likely won't make it in time for the 29 July intake with your notice period anyway (not to mention the speed at which the recruitment works...)<br>I think there are no reasons for the selection outcome to be affected either, but if you need to retake the medical test.. I wonder how long you might have to wait again.. Did you contact recruitment again to confirm?</p>
              <p>Congrats to eesin for getting the call too! I PMed you!</p>
