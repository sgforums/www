              For panel interview.. just be confident of yourself and show them you are well prepared (besides current affairs, try to find out what kind of scenarios police officers should and shouldn't deal with, one of my friends kenna becos she didnt read up on this and gave the wrong ans..)
              
              No matter how absurd you think your response is and how stern-looking the interviewers are, just be sure of yourself and stay calm! 
              
              also, they are not going to repeat qns they asked during AD dialogue (at least not in my case). they will ask deeper qns abt the SPF force, so try to be honest in your opinion :)
              
              anyone else still waiting for the call after medical checkup?

              <p>Hi Sahsah!</p>
              <p>The AD dialogue consists of questions like asking for your strengths and weaknesses, asking how you would handle conflict between yourself and a more experienced junior officer, whether your parents are supportive of your decision to apply for SPF SO and if you have applied for any other jobs.</p>
              <p>IMO you can't really prepare for AD, just answer confidently (:</p>

              Hi All, 
                      
              I am not sure how much it has changed since the time I went for my interview but I guess most of the aspects mgmt is looking out for are:
                      
              Composure, ability to relate and converse well on your thinking as well as keen interest.
                      
              The usual qns include:
              Tell me more about yourself 
              Why are you interested in SPF 
              What can SPF improve on
                      
              Do some ground work to know about the force before going to the final interview. I know it is a daunting task to speak up in front of many senior officers but we are also very keen to get to know you better.
                      
              As for psychometric test and interview with phychologists, be honest and tell them who you reallt are. Don't give cock and bull stories or answers on who you think you are cos your answers will not be congruent. 
                      
              All the best and good luck!
