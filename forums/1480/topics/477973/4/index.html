              <p>Its kinda difficult to work during the waiting period previously due to uncertainty of time frame. Managed to do some temp position for first two months after graduation and haven been doing much since. </p>
              <p>But looking back, its better to apply while you are in your last semester if you are sure of applying for SPO.</p>
              <p>Lets keep our hopes high! Don't be dejected! Have faith! Up to next wednesday still within the one week before time frame. </p>

              up.</p>
              <p>@arcelyn: I feel you.. It has been 10 months since I first
              applied and I have not even go for medical (if I passed interview)
              yet. Arghhh.</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>I was just wondering if most applicants here were from SAF or SPF? Were you guys Officers back in your National Service stint?</p>
              <p>Also, are most if you local graduates? Do they place any extra emphasis on local graduates as compared to overseas graduates?</p>
              <p>I'm currently waiting for my NS to end in the Army and will probably be studying overseas after that. If they do place more emphasis on local graduates, I will probably study in SMU instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please advice! And good luck to all of your applications! </p>

              <p>Ahh I see.. I chose a contract-based job so I won't have to be too committed to the job, and also to gain working experience while waiting for results. I can probably wait as long as it takes but of cos I hope won't have to wait long..</p>
              <p>I guess waiting is also part of the test, so yup, don't give up just yet!</p>

              <p>I do hope so too but I believe I have at least 1-2 weeks to wait, judging from others' time lines.. :S I can only hope to enter the Jun intake now (or maybe Apr, if any) since I also need one month notice period haha. Did they say what you need to bring for orientation? Wee it's hard to believe isn't it? After a superrrr long wait and all of a sudden you are going to enter a "new life" and meet new friends! So envious! :D</p>

              <p>hello! best to read up on recent crimes, maybe in the last 2 months? take note of the actions spf took and your stand abt the situation. what could be improved but bear in mind nt to shoot spf down entirely either.. and maybe think of how crimes like that can be prevented etc. hope it helps! </p>
