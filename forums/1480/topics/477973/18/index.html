So I thought maybe I'll just share my timeline. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I applied in May and had my psych appointment in early Oct. Am currently waiting for my panel interview. I'm looking at another 2-3 months of waiting. Really hope to be able to articulate my interest in joining the police force during the panel. Good luck to the rest who are applying too! (:</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>having went through all the rounds before but only to withdraw because I was offered another job...my advice is that you must be mentally prepared to wait as long as 9-10 months (assuming they decided to offer you). This is definitely stressful especially for those are are going to graduate. Because the question would be: are you willing to hold on and wait if you just graduate? <br>SPF is aware of this actually. They do try their best to speed up everything. however they do not have enough resource. it was mentioned in my dialogue session e.g. not enough psychologist to interview all candidates who are queuing. that's why spf also encourage all to take up any offered part time/contract jobs for those are really keen. </p></div>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Was taking a look around to find out what's the typical process like and found out that everyone's generally going through the same procedure (and the extremely long wait), so I decided to share the details of my applicaton so far.</p>
              <p>26 April<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Application received by SPF (email notification from careers.gov.sg)</p>
              <p>28 May<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>SPO Selection Assessment (Round 1)</p>
              <p>10 June<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Dialogue with Assistant Director Manpower - Recruitment (HR interview, Round 2)</p>
              <p>21 July<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Psychologist Interview (Round 3, "No fail stage", was initially scheduled for an earlier date but was overseas)</p>
              <p>31 July<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>SPO Board Interview (Panel interview, Round 4)</p>
              <p>14 Aug<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Submission and Verification of Graduation Certificate from NTU (Convocation was in early AUG 2014, this was self-arranged with the recruitment division personnel as they requested us to inform them once we received our graduation certificate)</p>
              <p>3 Sept<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Medical Examination (Round 5)</p>
              <p>15 Oct<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Submitted updated documents - 15 mths CPF transaction history, updates PES status (got a call couple of days earlier to do so)</p>
              <p>20 Nov<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Called SPF recruitment division to check status of application. Was informed that my application is still "In Process". Requested for more specific details but was told that they are unable to disclose this information.</p>
              <p>I actually also applied for SCDF senior officer and was shortlisted to go for their medical check up (passed the panel interview), but I decided to pull myself out of the SCDF application and wait for SPF instead. Heard that there's an intake in Dec but I doubt I'll be getting into that intake. Got this info from a guy I met during my Board Interview. He got into the Dec intake.</p>
              <p>Hope this information is useful. Cheers! =)</p>

              <p>Hey, according to my friend, the intake is starting 20+ Dec and he's starting attachment 20+ Nov (some time soon. One of these days). Since we have not gotten any call from SPF, I highly doubt we'll be going in for this intake. :/</p>

              <p>I applied last year, but had a number of delays because of my current work commitments... resulting in a really long interview process. I had my panel last month and received a rejection letter about three weeks after.</p>
