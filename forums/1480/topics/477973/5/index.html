              <p>Hello there, everything you need should be mentioned in the email already - certs, photos, shirt &amp; shorts (there will be a tattoo/posture check in the later part)..etc. For things not mentioned, they will point out to you and ask you to bring the next session if you are shortlisted. For me they were my bank acct number, photocopy+original bank book &amp; school leaving certificates. Also bring some cash for lunch during the break since it's a full day session. Oh and bring umbrella if your SA is at the Old Police Academy in case it rains. It rained super heavily that day and I got drenched in my WHITE shirt because there are no shelters all the way till the bus stop and I have no umbrellas. Grr.</p>
              <p>Irrc, there will be some questions in the questionnaire asking about things like your relationship with your family members, why you want to join SPF etc. so better to come prepared with some short answers in mind.</p>
              <p>That's all I can think of now. Good luck!</p>

              @0ZH0: Thanks! when was your panel interview?
              
              @chiefmn: Grats! I did hear about people failing because they didnt meet certain criteria,  but I would think the chances are pretty low (I hope).. But yea, I don't want to get too excited either, never know what will happen.. All the best to all of us!
