THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br><br></div></blockquote>Hey there... about two years ago, I was in the exact same shoes as you are now. Well, at least the graduation, haven't-done-NS-yet, haven't-taken-NAPFA and graduated-from-SP bit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>With regards to your application, it varies, depending on how fast they process your application. If it is processed slightly late, you could be joining SPF after your 3-month BMT.<br><br>If it is processed even later, then the interview and whatnots will be arranged sometime during your NS life. DOn't worry. If it falls under the latter, just sepak to your OC or equivalent supervisor, and they'll let you have time off to sort out the SPF details. No worries mate. All you need now is time. Although it could be long, but it will be resolved.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>BUT... there is also a possibility of them processing your appilcation quickly, and as a result you will receive a letter from MINDEF if that happens. The letter will state that you will be "exempted from National Service on one condition: that you remain as a regular in the Singapore Police Force". If you get this letter, then it really means that you've secured a place in the SPF.<br><br>You've already cleared your 2 interviews. Have you gone for the SPF medical checkup yet? Once they've sent you there, and you're issued with a clean bill of health, then you're already in. It takes about 2-3 weeks for the results of the checkup to get back to you though.<br><br>But if you ask me, I think you'll be coming in soon, without having to go to the army. My reason for thinking that is that you've already cleared your interviews.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Regular intakes don't have prep courses. You will all be enlisting on the same day, regardless of your NAPFA results. Depending on your intake, there could be a few women in your squad, or you could be like me: a squad full of young boys and every instructor mistook us for NS boys.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Your squad will have people who ave completed their NS too. You might even get CNB trainees.<br><br>And there will also be some people who will decide at the aslt miniute that they don't want to join. So on the bond signing day, you will see people who will not appear even after their names are called upteen times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And there might also be some who resign midway through the training.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>But I digress lah. Anyway, to answer your questions:<br><br>POBC standard is 6 months: 3 months basic stuff, and another 3 months of NPCO training. But depending on logistical and admin matters, it could stretch to 7, 8 months (beware: it almost always does stretch). There are also those who sign on directly for Police k-9 unit and Police Coast Guard. The PCG people will do 3 months before moving out, while the k-9ers will be with you until you complete training.<br><br>Training is subjective I suppose, but I believe you will enjoy it. It will prove to be interesting. And what the recruitment guy said is true: if you've cleared your interviews, then the checkup is almost like a mere formality. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But your uncle is wrong about going to CID though. Usually NPCOs get stuck for more than 5,6 years before they can leave. And CID people usually come from Land Division Investigation Branches. They usually have to serve for many years in Land Division Investigation Branches before CID even considers them. This one, though, applies to Junior Officers lah.<br><br>for senior officers, it's different. They have to move around within the force quite regularly, especially the scholars.<br><br>Anything you'd like to know, feel free to ask me man. I'd be more than glad to help with your queries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

It took me about 3 weeks of waiting. Haha..<br><br>Anyway, to focus on your questions,<br><br>yes, they will send the results to your  mailing address. And about the timing of your entry, it could be anytime actually. So long as they find enough people to make one batch.<br><br>Your checkup will be on june 18?<br><br>If so... yeap, i think you'll be entering in about july earliest, if not september.<br><br>If all goes well, the intakes come in every month actually. But sometimes it isn't so. usually, though, they come in january, march, june, july, september, december. Usually lah.<br><br>When you get your final results and whatnot, and there're questions you'd like to ask, can always ask me again.<br><br>All the best and good luck mate.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys!<br><br>I was awakened this morning by a call from an officer at police recruitment.<br><br>"Hello is this xxxx? Yeah i was wondering if you were coming to today's bond signing?"<br><br>"Huh when? I wasn't informed????" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>"Oh but we mailed you about it, and its this morning."<br><br>OMG! :X<br><br>It turned out that they mailed me a letter at my old address, and its quite strange because i NEVER received my police letters there, from first interview to panel interview to medical were all mailed to my new address.<br><br>So i have missed out on this month's intake AGAIN. In addition, i have to re-fax him a copy of my nric, which i did before months ago coz he say he misplaced it.<br><br>Pfft. One more month of nothingness. And i think its like so scary to suddenly EH GO BOND SIGNING today, then 5 days later go camp in all of a sudden.</div>
