              <p>While it's good to hear DPM Teo talked at the Parliament recently about Singapore labour force, I wonder when DPM Teo is ready to talk about how his ministry going to improve the police's competency.  It's better and wiser for him to talk now then wait till 2016, cuz by then it won't be us talking about it or questioning.  It will be the opposition party leading this topic. </p>

              <p class="first">The police officer who handled the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/businessmen-charged-drunken-cabby-fight-044314363.html">Suntec City brawl incident in 2010</a> has been charged with neglect of duty. <br><br>Second Minister for Home Affairs, and Trade and Industry <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/businessmen-charged-drunken-cabby-fight-044314363.html">S Iswaran</a> said the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+Police+Force&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Singapore Police Force</a> (SPF) has completed its internal inquiry, and charged the investigation
               officer who handled the case with negligence. A letter of warning has 
              also been issued to his supervisor, S Iswaran informed the House during 
              Tuesday's Parliament.<br><br>“I would also point out that the lapse was 
              due to the error of an individual rather than to any systematic 
              shortcomings,” S Iswaran said, answering Member of Parliament (MP) <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Tin+Pei+Ling&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Tin Pei Ling</a>’s question for an update on the police inquiry.<br><br>This
               is after two of the three expatriates -- options brokers New Zealander 
              Robert Stephen Dahlberg and Briton Robert James Springall – absconded 
              while on bail after they were charged with assault in July 2010. A third
               man, Australian business development manager Nathan Robert Miller, 35, 
              pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three weeks’ jail in February this 
              year.<br><br>The trio were allegedly drunk when they attacked two taxi 
              drivers and two taxi passengers and hijacked and crashed a taxi in April
               2010, reported <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120309-332419.html">AsiaOn</a>e.
               Dahlberg allegedly caused hurt to businessman Laurence Wong Seong and 
              shoved Paul Louis Liew Kai Ming against a pillar, who sustained a 
              forehead gash and a broken nose. Miller had also allegedly punched cabby
               Tay Gek Heng in the face during the incident.<br><br>While Miller served time, his friends Dahlberg, 34, and Springall, 25, were allowed to leave Singapore after they were charged.<br><br>Dahlberg
               was out on bail for S$25,000 last July when he went on trips to London 
              and Hong Kong and did not return. Springall, travelled back to the 
              United Kingdom between August and September on a bail of $12,000.  After
               returning from his trip, Springall failed to surrender his passport to 
              the authorities and flew out of Singapore in December 2011 and 
              absconded.<br><br><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/minister-teo-explain-handling-suntec-city-assault-case-092142868.html">Both men jumped bail</a> and warrants of arrest have been issued to the police’s overseas counterparts and the Interpol.<br><br>In
               light of the incident, MP David Ong asked during Parliament whether the
               Penal Code and other criminal legislation are sufficiently adequate to 
              protect Singaporeans from offences and crimes committed by foreigners 
              against them.<br><br>In response, S Iswaran said that all accused 
              persons and victims are treated equally under Singapore law, whether 
              they are Singaporeans or foreigners.<br><br>“When setting bail 
              conditions, the police and the courts take a variety of factors into 
              account to assess the flight risk of the accused. These include the 
              gravity of the offence, the extent of the accused person’s roots in 
              Singapore and whether the person have attempted to abscond previously,” S
               Iswaran said.<br><br>Iswaran also explained that when a person 
              absconds, the bail is forfeited and the police will arrest the wanted 
              person if he is still in Singapore. In the event that the accused person
               flees overseas, the police may issue an <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Interpol+Red+Notice&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Interpol Red Notice</a>.<br><br>Police
               forces in the Interpol member states will then help to locate and 
              arrest the accused person and may extradite the person back to 
              Singapore.<br><br>Tin also asked if further the impounding of passports 
              should be made a standard operating procedure in cases as it "would 
              ensure that when the courts need them or when judgment is made, they are
               in Singapore to receive the judgment".</p>
              <p>Responding to Tin, Iswaran
               said, "This is really a decision that we should leave to the courts and
               not make it mandatory, because there are so many considerations here. 
              The nature of the crime, the gravity of the impact, the nature of the 
              individuals' own ties to Singapore."</p>
              <p>"And I think most importantly
               and fundamentally, we have to strike that balance between his or her 
              right to freedom to move before he or she is judged or found to be 
              guilty," he added.</p>
