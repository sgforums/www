              Please, there is more than once he spoke his support for China.    If you are not aware of it, go google.     The very fact he is giving so much money from taxpayers for scholarship to China Chinese speaks of his strong support for China.     There are many PRCs working in govt related companies.

              Even before the shifting of powers he is already pledging his strong support to China.    There was a lot of losses in the business in the suzhou projects, he kept mum about it.      Spent that much of money to support China.   These are money from Singaporeans.

              <p>By ethnic, I mean he is from minority group. So naturally his support base is small. So he has to use autocratic means to stay in power. If Singapore is really a democracy, any hokkien leader can really win over more votes.</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>By Andrew Loh</strong></p>
              <p>The Singapore Police Force (SPF) keeps Singapore safe. That is its 
              job. But what happens if Singaporeans themselves start losing faith and 
              trust in the force? In recent times, several cases have dented 
              Singaporeans' confidence in the men in blue.</p>
              <p>The most famous case was of terrorist suspect Mas Selamat Kastari who
               escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre in 2007. More recently, 
              Romanian diplomat Silviu Ionescu was allowed to leave Singapore even as 
              his case was being investigated by the police.</p>
              <p>Ionescu, the highest-ranking diplomat at the Romanian embassy in 
              Singapore at the time of the incident, was reported to have hit three 
              men with his car in the early hours of December 2009. The incident 
              resulted in the death of Malaysian Tong Kok Wai.</p>
              <p>Ionescu has since been charged in Romania for the incident. The case is still ongoing.<br> Closer to home, the police's apparent lackadaisical attitude towards some cases have also raised questions about its competence.</p>
              <p>The Suntec City assault incident involving three foreign men is now 
              making the rounds on the Internet after The New Paper reported the 
              assault in 2011, followed by online portals later on.</p>
              <p>What frustrates and disappoints the public, particularly, are two things:</p>
              <p>1.    The police's silence, even to the victims of the assault, in providing updates on the case.</p>
              <p>2.    The police's seeming disinterest in pursuing the case so that 
              justice is meted out swiftly, and the victims can have closure to the 
              matter. It took more than a year before the assailants were charged in 
              court, and it has been 22 months since the night of the assault.<br> The Suntec City attack was a vicious one carried out by three foreigners
               — New Zealander Robert Stephen Dahlberg, Australian Nathan Robert 
              Miller and Briton Robert James Springall — in the evening of April 2010.</p>
              <p>So far, only Miller has been brought to justice, with a three weeks 
              sentence in jail. Dahlberg, rather inexplicably, was allowed to leave 
              Singapore in July last year, just about a month after he was charged in 
              court.</p>
              <p>Springall too was apparently allowed to leave Singapore in September last year.</p>
              <p>Both men have since absconded, leaving the victims of the attack finding the whole process incredulous.</p>
              <p><strong>Disbelief and anger</strong></p>
              <p>Online reactions too express disbelief and anger at how the two expats could be allowed to leave Singapore so easily.</p>
              <p>This is not a case of pickpocketing or littering or something more 
              innocuous. This is a case of a viciously violent assault on three 
              do-gooders whose only intent that night was to come to the aid of a cab 
              driver who was being punched, threatened and harassed by the reportedly 
              drunk men close to midnight.</p>
              <p>The three good Samaritans, which were really what they were, put their lives on the line, as it turned out, to help a <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/businessmen-charged-drunken-cabby-fight-044314363.html">57-year old cabby</a> who pleaded with them to help. A passerby who chipped in to assist that
               night was also threatened by the assailants that he would be killed if 
              he did not get out of their way while they were escaping from the scene.
               It was a threat which had already been effectively carried out on one 
              of those they had attacked just minutes earlier that night.</p>
              <p>To members of the public, it is clear-cut case of assault and causing
               grievous hurt. One of the do-gooders had his head slammed by one of the
               assailants into the sharp edge of one of the pillars at the building at
               Suntec. Blood poured from the wound on his head. He fell to the floor —
               only to have the assailant then repeatedly and mercilessly kick him on 
              the head, rendering him unconscious.</p>
              <p>It is more than fortunate that he was not killed.</p>
              <p>Yet, speaking to the two victims, the police seemed disinterested in 
              lending any urgency to pursuing the matter, even though the victims had 
              provided the police with all information to help in the case, and 
              offered themselves in assistance.</p>
              <p>It took more than a year before the case finally went to the courts.</p>
              <p>And even after this, two of the three men have been allowed to escape.</p>
              <p>The authorities cannot fault the public, and especially the victims 
              themselves, if the charge of incompetency is levelled at the police. One
               might even say the police officers involved in the case are inept, lazy
               and a disgrace to the rest of their colleagues in the force who are 
              doing good work.</p>
              <p>This is a case which should evoke a personal response from the 
              Minister for Home Affairs. This is a matter of public interest. The 
              victims have been trying to obtain information from the police but have 
              been met with a wall of silence.</p>
              <p>The Minister for Home Affairs should now take a personal interest in 
              this case and account to the public the behaviour, the performance (or 
              lack thereof), and the apparent disinterest and incompetence of those 
              under his charge.</p>
              <p>He should also explain to the public and the victims what his 
              ministry now plans to do with regards to the two assailants who have 
              fled our country.</p>

I was living in Singapore and reported a robbery. I knew the guy, a Singaporean, and gave police his name. They didn't even want to take a report, but I demanded that they do. They did, but never managed to find the guy. I saw him myself some weeks later hanging out in a club. I think they want to keep crime stats down.</p></div>
