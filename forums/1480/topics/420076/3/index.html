              <p>Dont think it means much other then you have been shortlisted for the position and you will have a chance to go for the interview rounds. i believe if not selected will be from in process to unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>If successful for each round (except for last round, not sure), if not wrong is still shortlisted i guess.</p>

              <p>lol. After the psychometric test and filling up of forms, they gave us a 1 hour break for lunch, den after lunch, back for more form filling, essay writing, taking of height and weight, physical assessment, etc. It ended at abt 4 plus pm for me that time :)</p>

              <p>my selection assessment to dialogue took one month, it could be faster for you. As long as you dun receive any rejection email or anything, should be fine. :)</p>

              Not too sure. Cos mine was only changed to shortlisted after first round. These stuffs are done by humans, so i guess is up to them to update.
              
              Btw, have u passed your medical? Or?
