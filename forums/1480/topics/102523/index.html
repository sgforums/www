            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share my opinions.<br><br>Most commandos are directly selected  even before they have held a M-16 or more recently SAR 21 ( Not too sure if they have changed all M16 to SAR21 yet or not, old man liao lah... so not sure what SAF is going through now). Of course once selected doesn't mean that you will become one. But in my opinion, Commandos are not exactly specialised units. The real elite and specialised one is the SOF. A better comparision would be between STAR and SOF, although I don't see why should we compare as to which one is better, both are different and unique in their own rights. For these 2 units, you must be a regular , not NSF, haved served in the force for a min period, before you can qualify for selection.<br><br>Anyway on a more general tone, in the SAF you have some 350,000 "trained" soldiers ( including old reservists like me) that chiong here and there, but at the end of the day, you are still training. You do not really see real ops. We can't really afford that too.<br><br>For the SPF, every single day itself is operation, even off duty. When you see a snatch thief off-duty, you are very much required and obliged to tend to it. In SAF, other than live firing exercises, you fire blanks or maybe even universal rounds most of the times. In SPF, once you are on the roads, you have to carry live rounds and you better do. You won't know what's going to happen next.<br><br>In any case, I don't think it's quite possible to compare the two forces because of the different types of operations.<br><br>In my opinion, if you really wanna compare, although I don't see the point  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  maybe you can compare the Military Police and SPF lah. Afterall their job scopes are much more similar.</div>

Yeah sure, they keep showing you nice stuff in your face, but do you really get to realise your choices 100%? Not really. They still have manpower constraints to consider, and they are not obliged to give you the vocation you choose.<br><br>The same thing in the SPF. You may indicate your choices, but where you go to is still dependent on manpower requirements. But I do get a general sence that those who indicate preferences for certain units while in training tend to be the first to be considered for posting there when an opening is available...although this can take many months or even years after having served in an originally-posted unit!</div>
