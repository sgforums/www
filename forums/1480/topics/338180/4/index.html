              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I live in a family consisting my father, bro n sis. I
              have SERIOUS financial dispute with my family. My girlfriend
              lives with me in my room, cohabit.  I am a business man doing
              food and beverages, earning $70k a year.</p>
              <p>In Oct 2008, i was accused by my father, bro n sis for
              threatening my father with knife, burning rags on floor. 3 of them
              called the police and the police came to my house knocking on my
              room door....i opened my room door and police just accused me of
              burning rags, verbal threatened. Though the police saw burned rags
              on floor, they could not find any evidence against me..... so my
              sis instigated my father accused me of being insane  coz he
              could not find a motive... my father accused me of being insane
              told the police to bring me to Institute of Mental Health (IMH ,
              Woodbridge hospital) to  check up. I heard the sergeant called
              the Investigation officer saying i looked normal and my gf covered
              up for me. It seem my GF as my alibi when i was in the room was
              deem as not valid by police.  My Gf testified that i was in
              the room the whole morning at 7am as she was in the room with me.
              Police told me and my gf that check will take whole day n after
              that i will be brought home safely, but at nite we realised the
              police lied to us.</p>
              <p>I was handcuffed for the first time of my life, i was in custody
              and taken by police car. That was the first time i was  in
              police custody n i was really taken aback coz police
              handcuffed me n damn tight and i feel the fu_k pain at my
              shoulders....police ordered me cannot use my hp to call at all coz
              i under custody....</p>
              <p>Police brought me to Changi general hospital for blood test for
              drugs, test show i did not take drugs. ...in the first place,
              i have never taken drugs in my whole life </p>
              <p>Then i told the officer in police car that i wanted to call
              lawyer and family members but was all denied n police
              just said i was in custody.  </p>
              <p>I was brought to IHM for the first time of my life . The doctor,
              based on the false accusation of my sis n father, order to lock
               me up for 3 days at IMH</p>
              <p>i was forced to sign admission forms because i was handcuffed n
              could not call of i do not sign the admission forms, police were
              there.</p>
              <p>After i was warded , i called my father n my father went to IMH
              to talk to the doctor and doctor finally agreed to let me go coz
              they said they had been forced by the police</p>
              <p>Then i was released from IHM at 9pm, i went with my father and
              girlfriend to bedok police station . My father confessed that
              he falsely accused me but at first the IO said he closed the case
              already, so no need to confess.</p>
              <p>Then the IO pulled my father to one side in a room and told
              he that he would be jailed if he confess and no need to confess
              since IO already closed the case.</p>
              <p>The police just wrote a brief 1 sentence statement for my father
              confession n refuse to write further....  </p>
              <p>I manage to get a statutory declaration from my father
              confessing that he falsely accused me n set me up......</p>
              <p>i dare not re-open the case because it may not be in my favour.
              ...my father love my sis much more than love me, he would twist his
              words to say that he was instigated by me.... i am also
              afraid police just do whatever they like and give a one-sided
              story</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>from your story so far, has the police given only one side of the story, lock you up in a cold room, or beat you up?</p>
              <p>they helped your case by: <br>showing you are cooperative when working with the police,<br>proving you are not taking drugs by conducting the test,<br>proving you are not insane by going to IMH.</p>
              <p>now instead of your words against his word that kind of situation, they have proved that the accusations is false.</p>
              <p>the police would rather not go in dept into family matters, son fight father in court is ugly... but if you want to go ahead... than you better find another place to stay, which shouldn't be a problem with your 70k per annum salary. but if you don't want to go ahead, the police has kindly left that option open for you.</p>

              <p>All things can be reported, but your version against police version, chances are police version will be more believable, especially with judges.</p>
              <p>Because certain knda of cases has certain powers, like detaining you more then 48 hours and so on.  Or breaking into you house with a battering ram by CNB.</p>
              <p>Or if you were actually guilty of one crime and made to confess to others, there is certain rules allowing interogations.</p>
              <p>But then, its understood, if you are involved in cases that included women and children, the jail and its 'services' is where you will be duly 'rewarded'.</p>
              <p>A officers are 'reported' at any one time or another.  One who never received any 'reports' are ones that was never on patrol or even talking to people.</p>

              <p>yes, of course you can report it. an investigation will be opened and the officer will become the defendant instead.</p>
              <p>but making allegations such as these are also a common tactic. hence, if the allegations against the officer made were found to be untrue, and only made in an attempt to stall investigations, then the accused will be hit doubly hard.</p>
