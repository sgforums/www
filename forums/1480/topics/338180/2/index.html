              <p>Hey guys, no need to dispute over the matter.</p>
              <p>TS is just a kid who obviously does not have a good occupation. Why would anyone ,who cares abt his family welfare, go up to Police and do such nonsense? Aren't there better things to learn to upgrade ourselves in times like this?</p>
              <p>Given the situation in Spore, who will be thinking of such things? We should be thinking abt making our jobs secure and bring the bread and butter home. If you wanna go to the Police, might as well ask them if they are recruiting ppl, or maybe any cilivian post to offer.</p>
