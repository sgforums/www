              <p>Some of the other boys also alleged that they had been roughed up. During his trial, <strong>Shiu testified that police hit him with a bat to force him into confessing.</strong> There were claims too that one of the Malaysian boys suffered a ruptured eardrum. The U.S. Embassy took up Fay's alleged abuse with Singapore authorities. After an internal police investigation and a medical examination of Fay, says the Home Affairs Ministry, no evidence of physical coercion was found. Shiu's allegations were similarly denied. The Malaysian's case is still under investigation. Sources say his parents have refrained from pursuing the complaint.</p>

              <p>Fay accuse the police of abusing him? the kid from USA? the country that demand such high standards of human rights?</p>
              <p>I dare say he is a liar. his words against the police force, you can choose to believe Fay to be innocent, but i don't think so. just like i don't think OJ is innocent.</p>
              <p>nice article of police officer abusing the law resulting in the sentence being void. the police doesn't condone this type of stuff.</p>

              Fay, 1995.
              
              My 2006 year to USA, met a old man outside a children's cym where my nephew was going to.
              
              That angmo man was at the gym because of his grandchild.
              
              At first, when that angmo man sees me, my sister and the 2 kids, he tot we are from Taiwan, cos we speak fairly decent english.
              
              He has a taiwan 2nd wife. And I correctly tells him that he is using taiwan mandarin to speak to us.
              
              We chatted a while and tells him we are from Singapore. He believed it immediately cos my head is bald and no way in taiwan will girls shaved off their hair, even for charity.
              
              He was in Singapore for a few years, having experienced the Michael Fay issue.  He was the one to boast to us that he knows Singapore because of Michael Fay.
              
              His comment then was:  He shouldnt be pardoned any canning.  That boy should have received more canning.
              
              Apparently, after Fay retured to USA, he got into enough trouble that even the US people felt that he is rubbish that cannot be deposed off.

              <p>exactly. if don't want to confess, then claim trial lor. the accused can exercise his right to a trial. just inform the investigator, who will fill up the charge sheet accordingly. then they will all have an appointment with the judge.</p>
              <p>if the accused is beaten up, he can lodge a report. it will definitely be investigated into. why go through all the trouble to beat an accused into a confession? dirty one's hands unnecessarily. go to court lor. better what. let the judge decide.</p>

              <p>I live in a family consisting my father, bro n sis. I have SERIOUS financial dispute with my family. My girlfriend lives with me in my room, cohabit.  I am a business man doing food and beverages, earning $70k a year.</p>
              <p>In Oct 2008, i was accused by my father, bro n sis for threatening my father with knife, burning rags on floor. 3 of them called the police and the police came to my house knocking on my room door....i opened my room door and police just accused me of burning rags, verbal threatened. Though the police saw burned rags on floor, they could not find any evidence against me..... so my sis instigated my father accused me of being insane  coz he could not find a motive... my father accused me of being insane told the police to bring me to Institute of Mental Health (IMH , Woodbridge hospital) to  check up. I heard the sergeant called the Investigation officer saying i looked normal and my gf covered up for me. It seem my GF as my alibi when i was in the room was deem as not valid by police.  My Gf testified that i was in the room the whole morning at 7am as she was in the room with me. Police told me and my gf that check will take whole day n after that i will be brought home safely, but at nite we realised the police lied to us.</p>
              <p>I was handcuffed for the first time of my life, i was in custody and taken by police car. That was the first time i was  in police custody n i was really taken aback coz police handcuffed me n damn tight and i feel the fu_k pain at my shoulders....police ordered me cannot use my hp to call at all coz i under custody....</p>
              <p>Police brought me to Changi general hospital for blood test for drugs, test show i did not take drugs. ...in the first place, i have never taken drugs in my whole life </p>
              <p>Then i told the officer in police car that i wanted to call lawyer and family members but was all denied n police just said i was in custody.  </p>
              <p>I was brought to IHM for the first time of my life . The doctor, based on the false accusation of my sis n father, order to lock  me up for 3 days at IMH</p>
              <p>i was forced to sign admission forms because i was handcuffed n could not call of i do not sign the admission forms, police were there.</p>
              <p>After i was warded , i called my father n my father went to IMH to talk to the doctor and doctor finally agreed to let me go coz they said they had been forced by the police</p>
              <p>Then i was released from IHM at 9pm, i went with my father and girlfriend to bedok police station . My father confessed that he falsely accused me but at first the IO said he closed the case already, so no need to confess.</p>
              <p>Then the IO pulled my father to one side in a room and told he that he would be jailed if he confess and no need to confess since IO already closed the case.</p>
              <p>The police just wrote a brief 1 sentence statement for my father confession n refuse to write further....  </p>
              <p>I manage to get a statutory declaration from my father confessing that he falsely accused me n set me up......</p>
              <p>i dare not re-open the case because it may not be in my favour. ...my father love my sis much more than love me, he would twist his words to say that he was instigated by me.... i am also afraid police just do whatever they like and give a one-sided story</p>

              <p>you are telling the story from your eyes and what you think happened instead of what other parties sees it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are a businessman, earning 70k a year. Living with your parents with your g/f living with you does not sound like you are as independant a person as you are trying to suggest you are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Threats with knives and burning rags, and then subsequently receiving a statutary declaration of the person that accuse you means you can persue the case against your father.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly, I didnt see anything wrong with what the police has done.  More of what your father, sister and whoever else has done. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you cannot condemn your family members, are you suggesting that police on the whole should be blamed for your family financial disputes?</p>
