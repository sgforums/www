BMT = basic military training. military is army mah, which is why i thought you wrote this in the wrong forum initially.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> for what it's worth, police basic training [for SCs and Regular NPCO trainees] is POBC [police officer basic course].<br><br>but anyway, you can try anyway to apply for a career in the army. i believe that if you're selected, they will take you when you're halfway through your NS, and will then seek to serve out the remaining NS liability as a regular in the SAF.<br><br>it's the same as you serving your ns is the SAF/SCDF, but want to apply to be a regular in the SPF. just the reverse. but all that is dependent on MINDEF approving your application lah.<br><br>all the best, should you apply.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
