              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p><br>Have been lurking here for a while but now I've got a question to ask. I'm currently serving my National Service in the SAF and I'm going to ORD in November next year. However, as I understand that VSC entry can take a while, I'm keen to try and apply early and speed it up, so that I can commence (assuming they accept me) in the first intake after my ORD.</p>
              <p>The reason for this is that I'm going to university (NUS) in 2011 and I'm hoping to do the VSC training as much as possible before I head to university, though the 9 month duration will mean that probably 2-3 months will be done while I'm in uni.</p>
              <p>So is there anyone I can contact? I'm hoping to somewhat go for all the medical tests and psychological tests earlier and confirm my entry into an intake after I ORD, sort of the way unis reserve places for people serving NS.</p>
              <p>Is that possible? Please advise, thanks a lot!</p>

              <p><br>1) You have to complete your national service.</p>
              <p>2) Dependant on where you are serving your National Service now.  Then its possible to expediate your entry.</p>
              <p>3) Timing for the training is dependant on how fast you can be processed, and how fast can Training Command allocate your training schedules.</p>

              <p>I understand that I have to complete my NS liabilities first, so I'm prepared to wait till my ORD. However, my concern is as to whether I can get all the checkups and all settled, so that I don't have to end up waiting months in limbo after my ORD and sort of waste time that could be spent serving in the VSC.</p>
              <p>I'm currrently serving in the Chemical, Biological and Radiological Defence Group doing CBRD work, which means that I do interact a lot with SPF and all during security operations. Does it really make a difference? o.O</p>

              <p>Their rules are very regitmental.</p>
              <p>Unless, you have someone really higher up, that has a lot of influence with the SPF to recommend you to skip all the necessary application, tests, medical examinations and interview process.</p>

              <p><br>On paper, it starts at 6.30pm.</p>
              <p>But with everyone more of less working and rushing here and there for classes or just getting stucked at traffic jams.</p>
              <p>You should still be very respectful and apologetic if you get to class before 7pm.  Instructors made their timing for that and make sure they are there to start your classes, so you can't exactly be excused.</p>

              <p>Hi <a href="../../../users/259106">Lanyingjie</a>,</p>
              <p>Dun know if you are still following the thread. maybe i would like to share with you my experience.</p>
              <p>I just ORDed this feb 2009. indeed, VSC do held recruitment booth in army camp. I signed up for VSC in one of army camps too.</p>
              <p>i believe when u are going to ord, SAF will conduct a e-prep roadshow to introduce their soldiers about the e-prep and together will it will be a recruitment and career fair to allow those going to ORD and  might wan to enter the work force to find their future employer there. and agency will be involve. SCDF,SPF, DSTA, and maybe some foreign uni. if you wan to study private uni.</p>
              <p>i think you can submit your application maybe 2 months before you ord or maybe submit during the roadshow. cus they will still have to hold and wait till u ord then they will call u up for the first psyhometric test.</p>
              <p>I went for my psychometric test about 2 weeks before i ORD. then after i ORD then i receive letter for first interview. so i think you can only go through your interview after you ord. from what i know, there is no shortcut like do all the check first while in SAF and go to VSC right after you ord.</p>
              <p>So after my first interview, i go for medical check up in march. then i receive my first training date on Aug. so you really have to wait. my whole process from application to first training is about 8 months.</p>
              <p>I do understand your excitement cus that time i also thought thing can be done that way. =)</p>
              <p>Anyway, i'm also in NUS (science) Year 1 also. planning to complete my VSC during my first year so that i can serve longer till retirement. haha. think this will be the maximun period of service for singaporean guy. from army 21 yrs old to retirement 55 yrs old.</p>
              <p>I think we are also quite similar in situation, i am also from combat engineers. haha. if you do need any help or wan to ask more you can email me at klmw_kevin@hotmail.com maybe i can share with u my experience. especially on how to mangae schoolwork and VSC together. it is not easy but can be done.</p>
