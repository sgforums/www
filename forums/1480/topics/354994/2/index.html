              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I disagree.</p>
              <p>For the first robbery example, you are right in saying all will be charged for robbery, but not necessarily same punishment. Depends on the role played.  (Reason why in a murder case, all will be hanged is because of mandatory death sentence for murder)</p>
              <p>For the scenario provided of a group of ppl including the shopkeeper beating  the shoplifter to death, they will never be charged with murder.  Prima facie, it is a murder case. But, there are defences available to <strong>all </strong>of those involved in the killing.</p>
              <p>s300  <em>Exception 2.</em>—Culpable homicide is <strong>not</strong> murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law, and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence, <strong>without premeditation and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence</strong>.</p>
              <p>They will not be charged with murder unless one or more in the group is using the opportunity to exact revenge. Even then, only that particular person or few persons wil lbe charged with murder cos the yshare a common intention to kill. It is unlikely that in the absence of evidence to show that those involved was exacting revenge for personal grudge, the courts will impute an intention to kill as their common intention.</p>
              <p>And definitely the shopkeeper and the member of the public does have a right to private defence.</p>
              <p><strong>Right of private defence of the body and of property<br>97.</strong> Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend —</p>
              <dl>
              <p> </p>
              (a) his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body;</dl><dl>
              <p> </p>
              (b) the property, whether movable or immovable, <strong>of himself or of any other person,</strong> against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.</dl>
              <p><strong>Acts against which there is no right of private defence<br>99.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(3) There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong>Do note that if the Police is around, the shopkeeper is not allowed to beat the shoplifter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Definitely the shopkeeper is legally entitled to detain a shoplifter in the course of defending his property. As to the use of  force to restrain the shoplifter, it all depends on whether the use of force was reasonable and whether more force was used than necessary. If reasonable force, not an offence at all. </p>
              <p> <strong>Nothing done in private defence is an offence<br>96.</strong> Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence</p>

              <p>And definitely the shopkeeper and the member of the public does

              <p><br> It is highly unlikely (in fact almost impossible) for the
              shopkeeper and the members of public who beat the shoplifter to
              death to be charged with murder. As i said, so long as none of them
              took the opportunity to pursue a personal grudge, and it was done
              in the exercise of private defence, a murder charge can be ruled
              out.  </p>

              <p>The law is not stupid, and is based on scenarios. You twist the story until like that, of course won't convict of murder. You want twist, i also can.</p>
              <p>Shoplifter got caught, surrounded by people. They start beating him, breaking every bone in his body, using metal rods and fire extinguisher, and dies. Police come, they all get charged for murder. The people argue that they just want to hurt him a bit. The judge sees the thief's multilated body, and convict them all.</p>
