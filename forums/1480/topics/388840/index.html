              "I called the police again and reported the incident and the exchange,
              A guy from Jurong HQ called me to say the IO in charge will contact us.
              I waited up the whole night for someone to come or call me - Nothing."
              
              I came across this blog about how loan sharks managed to repeatedly harass a family after the government announced tougher measures against loan sharks in the Straits Times. The police, it seems, were 'helpless' to do anything. Even something as simple as returning a phone call to the victim seemed to cause them great difficulties.
              
              So what are our police doing? Too busy guarding Chee Soon Juan in Changi?
              
              We know the police are not complacent! There's a few incidents I can remember...
              
              1) They had more than a dozen armed police officers standing sentry all night long over CSJ when he was doing that peaceful protest at Hong Lim.... 
              
              2) They deployed CID officers (I saw 3-4 in a picture taken by eyewitness), had a couple of police vans and dozen odd officers just to stop one small group of peaceful protesters. And those matas turned up within a minute of the TBT group setting off from Parliament House.
              
              3) During the filming of One Nation, some officers from MDA turned up to confiscate the film WITHOUT anyone notifying them. Sixth sense? And when they needed backup, CID officers turned up within minutes.
              
              4) The matas deployed 2 big 'ang chias' just to catch some otakus playing with their action figures in a park...
              
              So if they are not complacent, they must have misplaced their priorities! 
              
              The blog of the harassed victim is here: http://sassyjan.com/blog/?p=2155
              
              If Ms. Tan wishes for prompt police response and attention to the case, maybe she could erm... tell the I.O in charge that the 'loan sharks' look like CSJ and SDP members. Then she will surely have a team of high ranking police officers stationed round her flat 24/7... And the culprits harressing her would be caught in no time at all!

              <p>i think the priorities are switching to catch prostitues in geylang la.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the police force has indeed been sleeping the past few years ignoring various calls to clean up joochiat and geylang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe after Mas selamat incident, minister of home team under great pressure so use geylang and joochiat as operation knife to show his performance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>singapore police need us neitizens and newspaper to tell them where the crime are in singapore. i think our policeman and woman stay in pulau ubin and not know going on around us. we need to remind them of loansharks, prostitues.</p>
