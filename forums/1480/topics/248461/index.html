            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Two Police Coast Guard (PCG) officers had been killed and an unknown number of illegal immigrants gone missing after the boats which the PCG officers and the illegal immigrants were in respectively collided at the sea off Tuas last night. The two PCG officers killed in the line of duty are Station Inspector Mohd Khalid Bin Muhamad and Staff Sergeant Heah Khim Han. Their bodies were retrieved this morning at about 8.15am after an intensive search and rescue operation involving the PCG, naval divers, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, as well as the Royal Malaysia Police (Marine Police) throughout the night. Two other fellow crew mates on board the same PCG boat had been rescued. Three illegal immigrants had also been rescued, together with the recovery of a body of a fourth illegal immigrant.<br><br>Two PCG boats, manned by four officers each, were performing ambush duties in Singapore Territorial Waters (STW) off Tuas on 13 Apr 07. At about 9.30 pm, a speed boat with about six persons on board illegally intruded into STW. The two PCG boats gave chase. In the course of the pursuit, there was a collision between one of the PCG boats and the intruding vessel. As a result, one of the PCG boats as well as the speed boat capsized. The remaining PCG boat immediately summoned for assistance and proceeded to conduct search and rescue.<br><br>Two of the PCG officers from the capsized PCG boat were rescued from the sea. They suffered minor injuries. The remaining two officers went missing. Their bodies were recovered this morning at about 8.15am. Three persons on the intruding vessel had also been rescued and the body of one of them was recovered.<br><br>The two PCG officers killed in the incident are Station Inspector (SI) Mohd Khalid Bin Muhamad and Staff Sergeant Heah Khim Han. SI Mohd Khalid Bin Muhamad joined the SPF in 1986 and S/Sgt Heah Khim Han joined the SPF in 2001.<br><br>Investigations are in progress and the search operation for the remaining missing persons is still ongoing.<br><br>The Commissioner of Police, Mr Khoo Boon Hui, is saddened by the death of the two officers, "I am deeply saddened by the loss of our two dedicated officers who had sacrificed their lives for the security of Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>the sampan you are refering to is no ordinary one you see while canoeing, it's actually a speed boat.....and those illegals are not stupid either, they keep improving also, that is why they used the speed boat. The PCG know this and they also try to keep up by getting the PX and keep it's performance secret. police work are dangerous, being human criminal mind are unpredictable, one moment they smile at you the next moment they stab you at the back.</div>
