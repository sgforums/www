              <p>Yesterday, after i had bought a pack of cigarette i walked past behind my block towards my bus stop. Suddenly, a black plain car stopped by and a man approached me.</p>
              <p>He asks if Im a local, so i said yes. I thought he was just a passerby asking for directions around that area. Then he showed me his warrant card, confirmed a police officer. The second man did the same thing. The third guy just looked on.</p>
              <p>Then one of them asked me where Im going, i said Im meeting a friend. He checked my bag. My bag only contains the cigarette I bought, my umbrella, my bills and a restaurant vouchers. The other one asked for my IC. I gave it to him, then he talked to someone on the phone, screening me I guess. After that they returned me my IC &amp; they said I can go as they are doing some checks around that area. I asked them if I had done anything wrong. So one of them said no, otherwise I would have been taken away.</p>
              <p>This leave me wondering why a plain clothes officers checked on me. I wouldnt be too worried if its a uniformed ones in police patrol car. Im not sure if they thought Im a underage buying cigarettes but Im 30 years old.</p>

              <p>I also ever kena checked before. But in my mind, I dont feel inconvenienced at all. In fact I like it. Because this are the things that help to keep crime low. They are not rude, and once confirmed Okay, they are actually quite courteous.</p>
              <p>But dont be an ass, and ask them what operation they doing, why they check this area. Just thank you and walk away.</p>
