              <p>From what I heard from friends, during the interview you will have 2 choices to select right? But if I choose TP, do you know the percentage of getting is how much? Another thing i heard is during BMT at HTA try to get close to the OC?</p>
              <p>I've submitted my application on 31st March, still no news yet sain!!</p>

              <p>i went for the selection assessment on that day. but i saw got 3 choices leh, not 2. got neighbourhood police post, traffic police and lastly k-9 units. erm it is based on availability and suitability that i had heard from the recruitment officer.</p>
              <p>maybe you can ask some of your doubt during your interview. or maybe you can talk to your interviewer about why you wanted to join traffic police, then perhaps you got more chances to get TP instead of other police units. :)</p>

              <p>Hi sk1, thanks for your reply=)</p>
              <p>Out of 3 choices they will ask you to choose 2 right? Your selection assessment is it know as Panel Interview? btw are you a regular or NS police?</p>
              <p>I thought normally during the interview they will ask you why did you choose Traffic Police blah blah...  I'm still waiting for them to get back to me leh.. Any hotline i can call to check my application status?</p>

              <p>erm. they ask me to choose one out of the three choices.</p>
              <p>selection assessment is not panel interview. but my assessment session included verification of documents, physical assesment, english proficiency test and lastly psychometric test. every policer officer (included NS police) must pass this test one and it should be around 1 or 2 hours plus ba. the email they send me it didn't stated about any interview, but only that day they told me it is included and cause me very nervous abt it, i am glad that i had already done with my interview.</p>
              <p>i am not regular or NS police. just graduated from poly. don't worry, they surely will get back to you soon. cos i also apply it during late march, then after 3 weeks plus then they sent me an email for selection assessment and my interview. now waiting for my letter to arrive to my doorstep to see whether i make through the interview or not. how about you? also graduate from poly?</p>

              <p>ok a heads up.</p>
              <p>u can choose tp during the interviewing stage b4 u enter HTA.</p>
              <p>2nd way is during ur 6 months in HTA,u will have TP visit thus u will be able to decide for urself and put TP as first choice before u pass out when manpower comes down.</p>
              <p>The chance of getting TP is there once u select tp during interviewing stage</p>
              <p>however if u pick coast guard,u have no way to change to tp because u will leave at the end of 3 months to pcg camp.</p>
              <p>girls have higher chance to enter PCG/TP . guys...not so.</p>
              <p>even if u pick NPCO during the interview, u still have choices when the manpower comes down,just lower chance.</p>
              <p>anything can happen in SPF, u will hardy get ur desire posting seriously.</p>
              <p>70% of my squadmates did not get their first choice. there were people who didn't even get all their 3 choices and got dump into random land division.</p>
              <p>And yes : " Another thing i heard is during
                                      BMT at HTA try to get close to the OC? "</p>
              <p>sorry not true. Your OC is the last person you can count on to help you with posting. Please do not believe whatever he say about having the power to do this do that because i know for a fact that they are just trainer and any "recommendation" they made weighs nothing. At least thats for my OC.</p>

              <p>by the way, are you male or female? and how old are you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>cos you had said that you just graduated from ITE right. do you still want to further your studies like at least a diploma? it could be better lah. to survive in singapore, you could be better if you have a diploma cert. it also include a rank higher and salary will be also abit more.</p>
              <p>i also went to ITE after my 'N' level and after that poly. after much thought, i decide to realise my dream now (it had been already 6 years that i wanted to be a PO) plus there isn't any degree that i wanted to study now.</p>
              <p>if you want to further your studies, maybe you can apply for scholarship. but i believe that your ITE grades must be excellence and or already set a place for yourself in poly, can be a apply ba. you can always check their SPF website or called them :)</p>
              <p>if you still want to be PO now, yeah can. but you need to think carefully.</p>

              <p>don't worry about the questions.................they're not interested in the answers anyway, they're just going through the motions...........</p>
              <p>say there's 50 people going for the job and there's 20 vacancies, they'll simply take the 20 best educated ones that physically can qualify.</p>

              <p>interview is nt going thr motions, they r very experienced officers,5 min chat they can see whether u r jus joining to siam ns,join becos cannot find job,or sincere to serve the country.</p>
              <p>screw up ur interview and they might invite u for a 2nd,or 3rd...worse...none and get rejection letter.</p>

              <p>i agree with what <a href="/users/218753">vitasoys</a> had said previously.</p>
              <p>-security clearance (e.g. is your background 'clean' or not)</p>
              <p>-education (it is not depend on your education, don't worry. who said ITE student won't be good to be a police officer. eg. a person who have degree holder, don't mean he/she will surely get in. if they get in, but no interest in SPF then too bad for them. they surely will suffer. all we want to join SPF, because we got passion or interests right!)</p>
              <p>-interview (positive thinking; be more confidence for yourself; tell them your answer whatever you think of - there isn't right or wrong answer, try to relax and don't be nervous cos they will somehow notice it one) yeah, during the interview surely got 1 is psychologist and 2 will be very senior officer with alot of strips on their rank shoulder.</p>
              <p>be prepare what you want to said during the interview as they will ask you about your personal background like your family, your hobbies, your friends, your interests. because they want to know more about you within the interview (approx. 20mins), whether are you suitable to join SPF or not!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>:<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/218753">vitasoys</a>. screw up the interview, then they invite for the 2nd, 3rd interview one meh. so good? i nv heard before sia.</p>

              <p>why the hurry to make yourself public enemy no. 1 ?</p>
              <p>--&gt; everyone have their own passion or dreams, which is to be a police officer one day. yes, we will be become public enemy because we bring them to jail/fined but isn't it is our job to do this. to keep the nation safe and peaceful, right? for example, a drink-drunk driver knock over a person, end up the person in a critical condition. if you are their family or friends, what will you feel? if i am a traffic officer, i could might prevent the incident from happening.</p>
              <p>in addition, i don't know where are you from? from SPF? it make me very curious about it. because your answer (plus in other post too) don't seem you know about it well and it might could demoralise others.</p>
              <p>it is what i think, don't be too sensitive ah! cheers :)</p>
