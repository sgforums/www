That they have almost similar uniforms with the SPF gives us wider sence of presence "for free". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> People see them in banks and such, and think we are everywhere. They used to take the public bus to commute from their HQ to the banks and such, so people also tot matas can be on buses. And they see Cisco guards putting money into your ATMS....thinking they are SPF folks too, and are unlikely to think of attacking them (at least not so in recent years).<br><br>But the cons are also increasinly obvious thanks to hightened security concerns, and a more "demanding" public lah.
