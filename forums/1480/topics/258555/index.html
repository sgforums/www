            <div class='col-md body'>we dun have the power. thats it. its not our fault. chapter 323 is there for a reason, its to differentiate whether the case is serious enough for police to take action. therefore to prevent people from taking advantage of chapter 323, a magistrate report is needed for police to take further actions.<br><br>the lockups will be full if police were to have power to arrest people who committed/or are thought to have committed an offence under chapter 323.</div>
