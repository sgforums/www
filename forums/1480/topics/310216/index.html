              <p>It been now reported that the police who shot dead the man at mrt have a stun gun with him at that time.</p>
              <p>When reporter question why the police did not use the stun gun instead - which was mean for the purpose = "No Comments" !!!<br><br>Does anyone know what the cost of each set of stun gun !!! Why the police force buy so many of them and issue them to officers and they will not use it !!! </p>
              <p>If they did not trust it enough to use it = it is of no use !!! If it cannot be use fast in a emergency -- = it is of no use !!!</p>
              <p>Isn't that a clear case of wasting public funds on so many stuns guns ... which is off no use, but maybe to shoot white elephants that maybe hiding at police headquarters !!!</p>

              <p>I am not trying to make them look bad !!! Since they are the one who go around telling everyone how much they spend on technology ... keep showing off the stun gun ... and keep telling public that it is mean to use for this type of situation .... !!! In the end , a gun and cheap bullet does the job and seen to be the prefer choice ..... should not the police give better explaination than = "no comments" !!!</p>
              <p>Give them a break , who is giving tax payer a break on something that only shoot white elephants !!!</p>

              <p>As far as i know, only Team leaders or certain appointed officers carry tazers. The rest dont. I dont see the two officers carrying tazers in the picture provided by the media.</p>
              <p>Secondly, Tazers can also kill. However, tazers can also affect people and things around you. If you touch a person who has been tazered, you will be shocked as well. The shock can be enough to KO some people. In fact, 5 person can hold onto a tazered person and all five will be shocked at the same time. Remember it is electrical current.You can find some of the videos online.</p>
              <p>Certainly not a good idea to use it in an underground station with many people around the accused. The accused could have brushed against the people around him in an attempt to escape with the current still running though him or touch some equipment and cause a fire or malfunction. Or worst, the accused who had just been tazered lunges for you(remember he is less than 3 m away). So, both you and the accused will be shocked and you could be the one dead because you develop complications due to the shock. If the accused is still wary, he might even steal your revolver.</p>
              <p>Not a good idea to use Tazer under the circumstances.</p>

              <p>Stun gun might be used for strong  and aggressive criminal who resist arrest, armed criminals are far too dangerous. Ok I search from wikipedia on Taser stun gun it says "Tasers were introduced as a less-than-lethal weapon to be used by police to subdue fleeing, belligerent, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>potentially dangerous</strong></span> subjects, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>often when a lethal weapon would have otherwise been used</strong></span>." <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>potentially dangerous</strong></span> means haven't pose any danger yet but the aggressor is already posing a thread the last sentense means <span style="color: #0000ff;">usually<strong> police might have use their revolver or pistol to shot down criminals who are trying to escape or might pose danger to the public</strong>. </span><span style="color: #000000;">In a real dangerous situation, firing a shit to the threat should be the correct thing to do.</span></p>
              <p>Tax payer don't pay to police force to lose a police officer/son or daughter but rather to discharge their duty responsibly to ensure the safety of public and officers on duty. Just be reminded that police, civil defence and soldiers are serving their NS only and its best that no one has to die while doing service for the country.</p>
              <p>I personally felt that these tasers are worthy investments, imagine criminals made their escape because police can't fire their revolver at crowd but they might be more confident to fire their taser in such situation.</p>

              <p>I wish to state that in order for taser to work, the two needle need to be on the person. If u miss one, it wont work.</p>
              <p>So in case of people using knife and charging at you, which weapon would u choose?</p>
              <p>firearm= confidence in shooting the person (aim where, hit where)</p>
              <p>Taser= take chance, if miss one of the needle, then the police officer would be injured or even death</p>
              <p>so people, think in this way</p>
              <p>its easy for other ppl to comment, have u put yourself in the position in the police officer who had shoot.</p>
              <p>What is running inside his mind? do u know??</p>

              <p>Agree.  Those stun gun purchases is useless.  Much like some of the police technology equipments that was purchased and they are now where???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg. The electric stand on it scooter thingy.  The PDAs &amp; what else?</p>

              <p>The TS was not anti police.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS actually pointed out a major flaw in the purchases of equipments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS probably does not realise that whatever the POs on the ground are carrying on the belt are not their choice equipments.</p>

              <p>POs are not batman or spiderman that can choose their defensive weapons.</p>
