            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MANGKOK GUIDE TO SPF ENLISTMENT</strong><br><br>Thought since I had some time to kill before going to sleep I'd write this for all the people who are going to enlist in SPF for NS, now and in the future.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Things to bring/wear on enlistment:</span></strong><br><br>- Wear a decent shirt &amp; jeans for oath taking<br>- A pair of running shoes*<br>- 10 days worth of underwear and clothing suitable for PT (including socks)*<br>- Extra jeans in case your No.3/Walk-out attire is issued late<br>- Singlets (At least 3)*<br>- Qualification certificates<br>- Pen &amp; paper<br>- SHAVER, DEODERANT* &amp; other toiletries<br>- A basket that you can hang for your toiletries (very important)<br>- $30 worth of $1 coins (for laundry &amp; drinks)*<br>- A COMBINATION lock*<br>- Kiwi &amp; lint-free cloth*<br>- 8 hangers at least (if you like being neat, if not 6 will do)<br>- Plastic bags for storing your used clothes (there will be a lot)<br>- A torch light*<br>- An extra battery<br>- Some snacks if you want*<br>- An iron* (the OB room has, but a lot of demand once you are issued your uniforms.)<br>- Ear plugs*<br><br>* indicates this is not mentioned in the enlistment letter.<br><br>_You will not be issued any items for a few days, inclusive of running shoes. If you don't wear running shoes you'll be doing PT in whatever you brought, which is not fun at all. Following the initial issues you will find that you will need to change several of your items, and be without them for some time._<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information</span></strong><br><br>Surrender all your cigarettes, lighters and chargers. You will be confined if caught. This is not just a threat, it is true. One of my bunkmates is sleeping in HTA on his own right now. Do not worry you will get them back at the end of your _10 DAY CONFINEMENT_<br><br>Confinement is for 10 days irregardless of whether you are in prep course or fit squad. There is no such thing as waiting for the fit squad before confinement.<br><br>There are partitions in the shower room. You will not be seeing any wild birds.<br><br>Every bunk holds 10 men. Do not bring an over-sized bag on enlistment day because you will be issued an SPF bag. You do not want to try stuffing two large bags into your cupboard, because the FIs will expect you to do that.<br><br>The FIs in HTA are mostly not unreasonable people. If you keng they will know. At the same time, if you are genuinely ill/injured, they will _most certainly understand._ My personal suggestion is you do not try to keng, or you will be marked and confined if found to be on light duty too many times.<br><br>Shave everyday or you will definitely die a horrible death.<br><br>The laundry rooms in all coys are generally heavily used at night. If you want to do your laundry at night, get your clothes and dump it on a washing machine. Make sure you wait for the person whose clothes are being washed to collect his or yours willl be dumped on the floor. Alternatively you can wake up at 5 am and do your laundry - my personal recommendation. The machines take $1 coins, as do the drink vending machines.<br><br>DO NOT WALK OUT OF YOUR COY WITHOUT PERMISSION. If a roll call is done and you are absent, you can be charged for AWOL. This is NOT a light charge.<br><br>You will be punished as a squad. Do not think you can get away with being selfish. You will be punished even if you have done nothing wrong. It is your responsibility to make sure your squad mates do nothing against the rules.<br><br>There is a certain way to iron your uniform. The FIs will tell you this but you do not want to be the squad to wait for this to happen. Make sure there are ZERO creases on your shirt or trousers. The lines must be VERY visible. For your trousers make sure the line ends somewhere at the groin area, on both the front and rear.<br><br>Choose your bed carefully. Always choose the bed in the middle. Never choose the bed at the end of the bunk because all the dust will collect there. Do not choose a bed near the door because when people go to toilet you will wake up. The bed in the middle is the best because you will always have two fans blowing at you.<br><br>Choose your squad IC very, very carefully. If you get an incapable squad IC, be prepared to hear the following very often:<br><br>"WHY YOUR SEDIA SOUND LIKE BIRD SHIT!?"<br>"WHOLE LOT OF YOU TO YOUR RIGHT ON YOUR PALMS DOWN!!"<br>"TOO SLOW! ON YOUR FEET UP! TO THE LEFT ON YOUR PALMS DOWN!"<br>"WHEN I SAY DOWN YOU GO DOWN WHEN I SAY UP YOU COME UP UNDERSTAND MANGKOK???"<br><br>For the unintiated, "to the left/right on your palms down" means push up position 45 degrees in the specified direction.<br><br>I suggest you cut your hair before enlistment. Make sure you cut it extremely short. If you let the barber cut your hair, your hair will stick to your skin and you will feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable before you get to take a bath/wash your hair in the evening.<br><br>CAMERA PHONES ARE ALLOWED IN HTA. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ANOTHER PHONE BEFORE ENLISTMENT.<br><br>There is a recreation room in every coy. Use it.<br><br>Bring an alarm clock, you will need it.<br><br>Coming from a mangkok himself, I hope this guide helps all the future mangkoks enlisting in SPF. If any of you feel like adding to it, go ahead and do so. I should say this is all the information I wish I knew when I enlisted but didn't. All this will make your 10 day confinement and subsequent first few weeks a much more enjoyable time I believe. Cheers!</div>

I got good tips on how to iron your uniform.<br><br>Of course there should be no creases on any part of your uniform.<br><br>There should be an iron line on sides of the sleeves running down from the back of the shoulder lapel to the end of the sleeve.<br>The collars should stand hor, mark my words on this. Flat collars are for female officers wearing blouses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>And since trainee SCs got no rank epaulettes, the shoulder lapel should be as flat as possible.<br><br>For your trousers, the iron lines on the front should start from the insides of the front two belt loops, all the way to the end of the trousers.<br>For the back, the iron lines should start from the end of the trousers and merge in a V shape between the back two belt loops. no need for the iron lines to touch each other<br><br>and don't be stupid and use starch. if you use starch, you're going to feel very itchy during training and your uniform will change colour.</div>
