I have been playing soccer with my friends in the neighbourhood basketball court near my school. On tuesday, 2 policemen came and we were afraid that they will ask us to move off because its a basketball court. However, they took our particulars and left without telling us why.<br><br>Today, we were playing soccer at the basketball court again. And once again, 2 policemen came and took down our particulars and left without telling us why.<br><br>They did not stop us playing and told us that no one complained when we asked.

The officers only asked for our particulars. They did not asked for theirs. No, its not that we cannot play there.
