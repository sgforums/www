It uses a laser beam to help aim.<br><br>Haha... I like you thought of what if the bank officer doesn't understand Hokkien. Well, I guess if you go into a bank, masked and carry a revolver like thing, I think you don't have to understand Hokkien to know that it's a robbery? Haha... This reminds me of a Mr Kiasu Cartoon Strip some time back.<br><br>The scene is at a bank, whereby all the customers were queueing up for their turn to be served by the counter officer. This bank robber to a counter and pointed a revolver. The bank officer and the customers at the queue were all horrified. However, Mr Kiasu picked up those barricades or dividers that you see in banks that form the lines where people queue up ( what's that call huh) and whack the robber.<br><br>However, his intention was not so much to save the day, except being Mr Kiasu, he hates it when the bank robber jumped the queue?

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like most members of the public arent aware of the Taurus weapon in use yet....the media makes the laser beam sound like such a big deal! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Anyway, i stepped into class today, and the first thing my mates brought up is this episode asking me for my verdict. Kaoz....just shows how they like to think matas, even semi matas, are supposedly omni-present or something. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Was reading another forum that he could get into trouble if the 2 shot was deemed to be unnecessary and only one shot was required. He could be charged with using excessive force.<br><br>Any comments on this? </div></blockquote>Wah if he really gets charged for that next time police personnel won't dare to use their weapon liao.. I mean at that split second how would he have the time to decide when, whether and how many rounds to fire such that his decision would be consistent with that of his superiors reviewing the case? At that instant he's probably damn nervous too..<br><br>btw does this new Taurus revolver have to cocked after each shot? If it is automatic then isn't it even easier to accidentally squeeze off an extra round in a fit of nervousness before you can ascertain that the guy has collapsed and isn't a threat anymore?<br></div>
