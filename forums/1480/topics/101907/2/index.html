            <div class='col-md body'>It really pains me to see cops who are doing their duties honourably end up getting killed because they can't protect themselves when attack.In fact,those high-ups should all be charged with destroying government property,as by right,the SPF employs the patrolmen and when attacked,they are restricted by the so called rules which have to go through someone who isn't on the ground and realise the threat level.Being there and receiving news from there are 2 entirely different things.<br><br>Thus,if they have some brains left,patrolmen should always be allowed to take action as they deem fit and radio HQ to let them know what he is doing.And not subject his approval to the approval to someone who is unseen.I would rather have to write dozens of reports on why I draw my gun and get demoted or kicked outta the force,then end up dead lying in a gutter as I did not draw my weapon when confronted with some badguy weilding a broken beer bottle.<br><br>Feel free to share your comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For someone who is sort of stradling both sides of the debate, I can see why the seat warmers prefer to impose controls over the use of offensive weapons. Like it or not, the fact is the probability of firearm abuse is there. The recruitment process and the enlistment of hundreds of PNS chaps isnt exactly foolproof. Secondly, public opinion in Singapore has traditionally been very anti-violence, and they dont give a damn about circumstance. So long that blood is shed, there will be noises made, and our Singapore Police <strong>Service</strong> wannabe is highly sensitive towards public opinion, or else it will lose its award mah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>This debate rages in just about any developed society anyway. Like over in the US, whereby even if firearms are rampant in society, intense questioning do occur whenever it is used by officers.<br><br>Still, having experienced ground patrol, and as I mentioned earlier, facing a chopper welding and mentally unstable fellow just 5 metres away from me in a very enclosed space, the over-riding concerns over the avoidance of using violence as far as the situation allows is honestly getting a tad too close to being a fatalistic positionality to take. I didnt even realise how close I was to severe injury or death on at least 2 occasions in that 30 mins, until the whole situation was long over.</div>
