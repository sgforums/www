            <div class='col-md body'>If I were you ... I'd concentrate on the basic exercises to pass IPPT. No point working out your biceps if you're not able to do pull ups (which is mostly your back)<br><br>So ...<br><br>1) run, to make sure you get at least a silver, a gold would definitely be better. Clock mileage by doing 30 min runs every other day - try to improve on your distance at each attempt. In between days - do some interval training. Hard but short sessions.<br><br>2) Sit ups or abs exercises of any sort to ensure that your sit ups are in the 5 pt range; and<br><br>3) pulls ups. Training for pull ups is EASY ... just pull as many as you can before every meal and I gurantee that in 1 months' time, you should easily pull 12 (if you cannot do that already)<br>Another way to train for pull ups is to do what I do - pull 30 a day The way to do this? Pull as many as possible. Rest for a bit, then pull. Then rest. Then pull till you reach your goal of 30 (or whatever it is depending on your fitness level). It shouldn't take you more than 30 mins.<br><br>4) If you have a problem with standing broad jumps - do tuck jumps and duck walks.... and keep practicing. It's all in the technique.<br><br>5) Shuttle runs? Open up. Take long strides and try to run in straight lines ... and dash through the finish line ... worry about stopping only after you pass it; a lot of people make the mistake of slowing down before reaching the finish line.<br><br>Work out 6 days a week and watch your diet. Eat 5 to 6 small meals a day. Keep the fat low and sugar out. Sleep well and drink plenty water.<br><br>You keep that up religiously ... I <strong>gurantee</strong> you a gold award in 1 month (assuming you're not a totally overweight slob)</div>

It works for me.<br><br>I don't know about regular police training, but if it anything like the army, then I wouldn't worry about the push ups, if you're worried about slowing down your squad, then it's the <strong>running part</strong> that you have to work on. I cannot imagine a situation where the squad gets <span style="font-style: italic;">slowed down</span> because you cannot do push ups fast enough.<br><br>So when you going in?<br><br>I don't believe in those off the rack pull up bars that one installs in the door frame ... way too low for any good. When I renovated my place, I had a proper bar screwed in to the ceiling in my room. It'll probably be better if you looked around for proper pull up bars ... parks, fitness corners, schools, fitness clubs etc</div>
