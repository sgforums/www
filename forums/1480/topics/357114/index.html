              <p>actually no lah. SIO [Senior Investigation Officer] is a vocation, and not determined by rank actually. If you are a senior officer, you will attain this qualification by the time your first-ever posting [which will be in any Land Division's Investigation Branch] ends. But this vocation is applicable to junior officers too. So long as you have been sent for the course, irrespective of your rank, you will be a qualified SIO.</p>
              <p>Likewise for Team Leaders. The second posting for Senior Officers, they will either be Inspectors or Assistant Superintendents of Police [ASPs]. If junior officers are holding this post, then the established rank will be Station Inspector [SI] and above.</p>
              <p>For commanders in Land Divisions, they will usually be Superintendents [minimum]. Some will get their promotions while in this post, so they will be Deputy Assistant Commisioners of Police [DAC].</p>
              <p>For Commanding Officers of the various NPCs, most are usually DSPs, but there are the younger ones who might be holding this post with a rank of ASP [usually scholars]. Operations Officers are usually a minimum of ASP.</p>

              <p>Both JOs and SOs in the Singapore Police Force are involved as IOs in investigations branch.

              <p>About your question on posts at an NPP, I think you might be referring to NPC [neighbourhood police centres] instead. This is because NPPs come under charge of an NPC. Only one person mans the NPP for that one day. It is part of the duty, just like patrols and such. SO posts in an NPC are either Commanding Officer or Operations Officer.</p>

              <p>on the ground, when attending to incidents, any Police Officer [SC, SC/Cpl, SC/Sgt, Sgt, etc] can record a statement. It is just that once a person has been placed under arrest and brought back to divisional headquarters, the arrested person's statement can only be recorded by the Investigator.</p>
              <p>It is for this reason that IOs need to be of rank Sgt and above. There is a slight difference in the statements of accused persons and any other person, but I cannot disclose here. OSA.</p>

              <p>on the ground, when attending to incidents, any Police Officer
              [SC, SC/Cpl, SC/Sgt, Sgt, etc] can record a statement. It is just
              that once a person has been placed under arrest and brought back to
              divisional headquarters, the arrested person's statement can only
              be recorded by the Investigator.</p>
              <p>It is for this reason that IOs need to be of rank Sgt and above.
              There is a slight difference in the statements of accused persons
              and any other person, but I cannot disclose here. OSA.</p>
