              <p><br>Yeah i get what you mean. Its just that the process is rather tedious and I will need to get quite a few days off from work if I am to reapply when I am working to attend the selection. This wont rest well with the current employers.</p>
              <p>Hope the best for us. Will let you know when I get any letters, maybe in two weeks time. *pray hard*</p>
