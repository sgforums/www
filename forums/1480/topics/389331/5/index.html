              <p><span style="color: #666699;">hi nms, the dialogue session is with the AD of manpower. it's basically more of a chit-chat session, finding out more about you and why you wanna do this. I think for mine, the lady spoke more than me, haha, she was very friendly and spoke a lot about what to expect if we get selected. :) so don't worry too much about it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #666699;">btw, i've heard that the board interview has about 10 interviewers in the room?! is that true?? what kinda questions do they usually ask? thanks! :)</span></p>

              <p>for me there were abt 6-8 interviewers. 3-4 will interview you, the rest will either observe, take notes or do some admin stuff i think. sometimes a psychologist may be present i heard.</p>
              <p>they asked the usual why you wanna join etc again. then they asked some situational qns, unique to ur backgrd i believe, coz the qns they asked me was different frm what they asked the rest. they include, 'how will u react if ....', 'what will do if..', 'what other wknesses..' something like that. i guess it is more to know you more esp in a social setting probably.</p>
              <p>the board interview is the most impt round, so all the best! dont worry too much, if u have the passion, u should be able to answer well. good luck! :)</p>

              <p>Hi all.. i am new here, I started my first selection on the 10th of Feb and went thru all the interviews, is there anyone who went for the SPO medical on the 8th of june?</p>
              <p>I see this name Ms Mahani very often, she seems to be very resourceful in information on the enlistment date. May i have her number? Cause i had called Mr johnny couples of time and he told me the earliest intake for me is early Sept. whereas i just realise that espl09 n the rest are going to HTA in july..</p>
              <p>As for the salary, i called Mr johnny and he told me that the sign on bonus has been removed, instead there will be a pay raise for us.. does anione have any idea how much a 3rd class honours will get according to the new scheme? anyone who have signed the training deed after 1st of june 2010?</p>

              <p>Hello Vickewl, there's no worries if u didn't complete the qns during the pyschometric tests, the important thing is to answer well, not to rush thru the qns.</p>
              <p>as for documents, it's not a prob, if u go on the next round u can bring the docs down, i think they should have given u contact info too to mail over photocopies or fax the documents over.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm currently 17, but I'm planning for my future path and I'm interested to join the SPF as a SPO.</p>
              <p>As a female, I'm most concern about the welfare of female officers... It's quite a sensitive issue to SOME. (lol) Supposing you have period, will they still ask you to do vigorous training ? (Any female officers or soon-to-be female officers (in-trianing) around? pls PM me...) There's still quite a few questions.. but i think it's quite weird to post here because its regarding female stuffs. (lol).</p>
              <p>Back to the thread, I suppose female SPO-in-training would have to pass the IPPT test as well... OH YES, SPOs-in-training will have to learn swimming right?! If you've got a Gold for swimming, will they still expect you to learn it? In addition, learning First Aid is compulsory , supposing I've got my adult first aid certificate (St John Ambulance Brigade)... will they still expect you to learn the basic first aid?</p>
              <p>Sorry for asking so many weird questions... I'm just keen to know more about these (minor stuffs to some of you) as I think that I should have no difficulty for the physical training because i'm from track and i do run regularly and go gym from time-to-time...</p>
              <p>Sorry for taking so much of your time... (Female officers/ soon-to-be female officers (in-training), please PM ME. need your help to clarify some doubts.)</p>
              <p><br>Thank You.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rgds,</p>
