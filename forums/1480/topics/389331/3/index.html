              <div class="quote_from">Hi pple,</div>
              <p><strong>to Kurol-Kaze:</strong> </p>
              <p>for each squad of 18 - 25, there are roughly one trainee fresh from SIM. Most of the squad is made up of rank and file, NUS and NTU grads. Overseas grads are also in the minority. But not to worry, its easy to gel up inside when we train together. The recruitment side don't really look at which uni you come from. As long as you are proficient in the various application stages, they will accept you. They just want people with the right mindset.</p>
              <p>when you are inside, everyone is equal. (not to say scholars i guess, hah)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>to Vic Lee:</strong></p>
              <p>Applicants do not need to pass IPPT in the application stage. Don't worry about the physical  side as there are physical trainings in the course.</p>
              <p>Although passing IPPT is not a criteria for trainees to pass out from the course, I seriously think trainees should at least get a pass inside as it is part of the baseline/KPI for your assessment. The training inside will toughen you up. If you have difficulties passing, just have the right attitude and be persistent when it comes to training.</p>
              <p>The physical stage in the application is just to take your height and weight, test your psychomotor skills such as basic marching and bending of your joints. Unlikely that you will fail this stage unless you cant march well.</p>
              <p><br><strong>to Rigaku:</strong></p>
              <p>for a grad with 3rd class honours, your salary will roughly be $3,150 if I am not wrong. You can also refer to <a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/so_salary.htm#top">http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/so_salary.htm#top</a>  as the salary scale is very transparent. Whether you have driving license or not will not affect your pay, it will merely increase your bond amount. Don't have to worry about unless you intend to break bond.</p>
              <p>There won't be a pay raise when you pass out but upon completing your 1st year of service, there will be an increase of ~ $216.</p>
              <p>From my knowledge, I don't think you will get extra allowance if you work as an IO or in the division. However, if you join specialized units such as SecCom and SOC, there will be additional allowances depending on your capabilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope I cleared some doubts you guys have.</p>

              <p>1 - Gov job for gov student / spf prefer local ivy grads.</p>

              <p>I seriously doubt they are biased against SIM grads. In fact, there are a couple of ASPs from SIM. NTU probably has 1 or 2 per squad as well. if SPF ask you to go NPP for selection, you already passed the first hurdle so I dun think they will deny you just because you are from SIM.</p>
              <p>There are 8 squads from last year and 1 from this year so far</p>

              <p>erm. by the way, after i had done with my interview, so i just waited for the letter to see whether i pass the interview or not right? then after that will be medical check up and sign bond right?</p>

              <p>heya all, im new here.</p>
              <p>I wanna ask if any of u know of an (extra) interview after medical check up? @Kyze have you heard of such a thing? I asked one of my friends who is already an SO and she said she never heard of it.</p>
              <p>I applied in dec last year. everything went smooth, process was quite fast actually. i went for the final board interview sometime in Feb, probably with some of you guys, then received a letter for medical check up for some time in March.</p>
              <p>a week after the check up, i received a call from spf asking about some of my relative working in a foreign embassy (which i have earlier declared), in order to process my application. i kinda assume that my check up n all were ok.</p>
              <p>then abt 2wks later they called me up for another rd of interview, which i went last week. it was an hr long, and they said it was a 'clarification interview'. here they checked every single aspect of my life. which i found quite weird but i went ahead anyway. is this normal?</p>
              <p>I asked when i can find out whether my application is successful, and he said 'pretty soon'. it's now 4-5 months since i first applied and im getting jittery. i already left my prev work, and had rejected ica offer after i received the medical check up coz i heard chances of getting in after getting the medical letter is quite high. now with the extra interview, im not too sure. is it possible to get rejected after the medical, and the xtra interview that i had?</p>

              <p>there hasnt been any intake for direct entry since nov 09? i heard there is an intake every month, isnt there? hmm. read it somewhere in some forums.</p>
              <p>generally those who make it after the medical check up will receive letter right? not call or sms or email? who has received the enlistment letter pls update! :) all the best ppl!</p>

              <p><br>Yup Kitana, only got one other intake of PO on the graduate program (junior officers who got a degree and converting to senior officers) in Mar this year...</p>
              <p>the forums are probably refering to PO intake, which is quite regular cos the cohort is much bigger...</p>
              <p>If i didn't remember wrongly, that time I got a call. cos already recieve the letter stating that accepted into SPF together with the medical letter...</p>

              <p>heya all, im new here.</p>
              <p>I wanna ask if any of u know of an (extra) interview after medical check up? @Kyze have you heard of such a thing? I asked one of my friends who is already an SO and she said she never heard of it.</p>
              <p>I applied in dec last year. everything went smooth, process was quite fast actually. i went for the final board interview sometime in Feb, probably with some of you guys, then received a letter for medical check up for some time in March.</p>
              <p>a week after the check up, i received a call from spf asking about some of my relative working in a foreign embassy (which i have earlier declared), in order to process my application. i kinda assume that my check up n all were ok.</p>
              <p>then abt 2wks later they called me up for another rd of interview, which i went last week. it was an hr long, and they said it was a 'clarification interview'. here they checked every single aspect of my life. which i found quite weird but i went ahead anyway. is this normal?</p>
              <p>I asked when i can find out whether my application is successful, and he said 'pretty soon'. it's now 4-5 months since i first applied and im getting jittery. i already left my prev work, and had rejected ica offer after i received the medical check up coz i heard chances of getting in after getting the medical letter is quite high. now with the extra interview, im not too sure. is it possible to get rejected after the medical, and the xtra interview that i had?</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>For direct entry to SPO, I think SPF has reinstalled the floodgate as they have massive intake last year. The next SPO batch will be coming in next month when the PO are promoted to PI.</p>
              <p>I have never heard of the extra interview before. It may be for some sensitive issues due to your background. Like what Tunge said, maybe there isnt any new incoming batch for direct entry so they are taking their time to confirm you.</p>

              <p> It used to be 158 in for female as minimum. Now, since they took it off, should be no more height requirement.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my overall waiting time through the processes, from application at career.gov, is about 4 months. So, really have to be patient. If want, take up part time job first bah.. I chose to wait initially cause i don't if they will suddenly ask me to get in.</p>
