              <p>1) Everyone got the civilian rights to demand to see a police warrant card. If you see them in uniform and you wanna guai lan them, go ahead and ask for the police warrant card. They MUST show you. </p>
              <p>2,3,4) Most likely its just a routine screening la. You never do anything wrong no need to scare.</p>

              <p>1) When police officers pay a home visit to you doorstep, are we allow to ask and take down the particular of those officers? e.g their name and police numbers?</p>
              <p>Ans: Why do you want their particulars? But if you want them to prove their identity,you may demand for their Warant Card, but if they are in uniform then there is no need to ask for their Warrant Card as the uniform is enough to prove their identity.</p>
              <p>2) Does the police officers have to stake clearly the purpose of the visit?</p>
              <p>Ans: Yes.</p>

              <p>Ans: Because the officer is executing his or her operational duties,and such information is strictly confidential so they cannot disclose but members of public are supposed to disclose anything which the officer requires to know.</p>
              <p>4) what are the reasons behind for the police officers to ask for our identity card and take down all our particulars for everyone present in the house?</p>
              <p>Ans:  The officers are to record the particulars of those present in the house as part of the records.</p>
              <p>5) Do we have to the rights to refuse them for taking down our particular cause it make me feel like a criminal for doing something wrong.</p>
              <p>Ans: Well, if you did nothing wrong, then no harm giving your particulars to the officers and when the officers are conducting a spot check on you, you may not give your NRIC but you are to tell your particulars to them as the officers may actually arrest you for refusing to furbish your particulars if you do not give them your particulars.</p>
