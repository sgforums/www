              <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
              <p>I am new in this forum and I have been reading almost all threads under this SPF forum. And I thank all for this, as I find it is very informative.</p>
              <p>I have applied for PO, gone thru selection assessment, panel interview and medical check was on 1June. If all goes well, I am going to sign the bond on 15th and reporting at HTA on 17th June.</p>
              <p>I have some questions and I hope someone can enlighten me.</p>
              <p>I have read in some threads, that there are some cases that people still receive rejection letter at this stage? Why is that so? I am worried that will happen to me. I am so excited bout starting training soon and so tempted to get my things ready but really worried bout the 'surprise' rejection thingy.</p>
              <p>I have prior working experience, bout 8years in the mid management level in the retail merchandising industry. Is there a chance that I will get a higher salary than what is stated on SPF website? Besides, is there a chance for me to move to SPO position if I complete a degree within my first 2 years in SPF? (I am joining as a dip holder)</p>
              <p>Thanks all for clearing my doubts. Cheers :)</p>

              <p><br>- No higher salary. Its the papers that counts.</p>
              <p>- Nowadays becoming a SPO is like a hassle, you need to join in the LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG queue. Rather you quit and join as SPO better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Haha thanks :) Posted to 'E' Tanglin Division atm =)</p>
              <p>Yes they have vegeterian food at Mess,all u have to do is go to the front counter tell those staff,write the book and they will give u the food in a green plate with a green cup,u have to go to the side to fill up the drinks yourself tho,but bare with it,HTA mess food isnt good,u wont like it,especially the vegetables..i once spotted a worm in the soup,so check &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p>Basically,u lights out at 2230 sharp and wake up at 0530,theres waterparade at 0600,a FI (field instructor) will come and conduct it,after that if u got PT you can go back to ur bunk and take a lil rest until 0620,ur squad will jog to the parade square for the flag raising.</p>
              <p>Flag raising should end ard 0730 and the FI will come take ur squad,go for jog and etc,the toughness of ur daily PT depends on ur FI(every squad will be assign to a FI),how relax or how cocky he can be,theres quite a lot of assholes FI in HTA that cant wait to showoff their power,but base on what i see in HTA,regular always dont get scolding and way,way more relaxing,trust me =) they wont make you run like a dog until u die or etc etc lol. Anyways after PT finish at 0830 u go for ur breakfast,20mins for you to eat. Then u jog with ur squad back to ur bunk,change to Full-U,go for law class until ard 11.30am or 12++ depend on ur OC,OC is those oldbird regular aka so called teacher lol,every squad will have their own OC also,they'r ur 'Angel' in HTA,will stand up for u and etc etc,and FI are the 'devil' :) you will see that once u been there for weeks xD at 12++ go for lunch,ard 12.20pm u go for ur afternoon break,freetime in bunk until 2pm i think,then go for law again -_-" until 4.30-5,ur FI will come take u for drills or PT again,depend on what they wan or whats on ur timetable,until 6.20pm,go for dinner,after dinner u can go back to ur bunk and relax till lightsoff. BUT! there are times where some retards go smoke and etc kana caught,u will spend the night doing PT at ur coy ground sweating like mad by some FIs. Anyways i can give u some advice/tips,Ippt for female not realli important,BUT,when u pass out and wanna grow in ranks u gotto PASS ur IPPT. Regular life in HTA is relaxing,so u wont expect kana fuck by FI like Us lol =)</p>
              <p>Oh and,every week will have 1 or 2 PDT(Police Defensive tatics) and swimming class,base on what i went thru,its damn lame,swimming 1hr= 55min PT,5min go into water and out u go,finish :) PDT will be fking tiring and u will get damn dirty and sweaty,the PDT Mat is extremely dirty..PDT u will learn if i'm correct..err,130 stances? Theres also PSOC,Police Standard Obsticle Course test after a 1st and 2nd tryout,u will wear fake rubber gun,T-baton etc etc of the same weight and run a series of LAME obsticle course -.-" but u will be damn sweaty and tiried as if u jus finished 2.4km after that xD</p>
              <p>A few test in the 3rd month.take note and rmb how to say the drills,quite alot lol,u will have to SHOUT at the test.</p>
              <p>Law***(70% and below=Fail),Shooting***(pass/2nd/1st/marksman),Drill,3rd/4th IPPT*(fail 1 station=Fail),PDT(fail 3 stance = Fail),Swimming(swim 50m),PSOC(5min and above=Fail)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anything more you wanna ask feel free ;)</p>

              <p>Hi QC Pak: Thanks for reminding about the coins. Hmm.....looks like I gotta wait till I complete the bond period before I can further my studies. Does completing the police studies lead to promotion to SPO position? or just higher in rank?</p>
              <p>Hi FuMo: WOW....thanks for the great details man. Err....what's water parade? Everything else sounds really fun and exciting....I can't wait le..But the passing of exam part as mentioned sounds kinda challenging....hope it's not difficult.</p>
              <p>Hey, if food in the mess sucks, are we allowed to bring our own food like snacks, cereal or powdered drink (milo)?</p>
              <p>LOL....I feel like I have lots to ask but can't remember everything now :p</p>

              <p>Basically,u lights out at 2230 sharp and wake up at 0530,theres waterparade at 0600,a FI (field instructor) will come and conduct it,after that if u got PT you can go back to ur bunk and take a lil rest until 0620,ur squad will jog to the parade square for the flag raising.</p>
              <p>Flag raising should end ard 0730 and the FI will come take ur squad,go for jog and etc,the toughness of ur daily PT depends on ur FI(every squad will be assign to a FI),how relax or how cocky he can be,theres quite a lot of assholes FI in HTA that cant wait to showoff their power,but base on what i see in HTA,regular always dont get scolding and way,way more relaxing,trust me =) they wont make you run like a dog until u die or etc etc lol. Anyways after PT finish at 0830 u go for ur breakfast,20mins for you to eat. Then u jog with ur squad back to ur bunk,change to Full-U,go for law class until ard 11.30am or 12++ depend on ur OC,OC is those oldbird regular aka so called teacher lol,every squad will have their own OC also,they'r ur 'Angel' in HTA,will stand up for u and etc etc,and FI are the 'devil' :) you will see that once u been there for weeks xD at 12++ go for lunch,ard 12.20pm u go for ur afternoon break,freetime in bunk until 2pm i think,then go for law again -_-" until 4.30-5,ur FI will come take u for drills or PT again,depend on what they wan or whats on ur timetable,until 6.20pm,go for dinner,after dinner u can go back to ur bunk and relax till lightsoff. BUT! there are times where some retards go smoke and etc kana caught,u will spend the night doing PT at ur coy ground sweating like mad by some FIs. Anyways i can give u some advice/tips,Ippt for female not realli important,BUT,when u pass out and wanna grow in ranks u gotto PASS ur IPPT. Regular life in HTA is relaxing,so u wont expect kana fuck by FI like Us lol =)</p>
              <p>Oh and,every week will have 1 or 2 PDT(Police Defensive tatics) and swimming class,base on what i went thru,its damn lame,swimming 1hr= 55min PT,5min go into water and out u go,finish :) PDT will be fking tiring and u will get damn dirty and sweaty,the PDT Mat is extremely dirty..PDT u will learn if i'm correct..err,130 stances? Theres also PSOC,Police Standard Obsticle Course test after a 1st and 2nd tryout,u will wear fake rubber gun,T-baton etc etc of the same weight and run a series of LAME obsticle course -.-" but u will be damn sweaty and tiried as if u jus finished 2.4km after that xD</p>
              <p>A few test in the 3rd month.take note and rmb how to say the drills,quite alot lol,u will have to SHOUT at the test.</p>
              <p>Law***(70% and below=Fail),Shooting***(pass/2nd/1st/marksman),Drill,3rd/4th IPPT*(fail 1 station=Fail),PDT(fail 3 stance = Fail),Swimming(swim 50m),PSOC(5min and above=Fail)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anything more you wanna ask feel free ;)</p>
