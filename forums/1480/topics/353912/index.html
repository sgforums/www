              <p>Was in a bit of an ordeal yesterday. My buddy was caught shoplifting in a local supermarket, and was referred to the police, where he said he was interviewed by the IO aka investigations officer, he is green, first time offender. I asked why he did it, he couldn't explain,' it was the urge at that moment ', or so i was told. I was the one who went over to bail him out yesterday. He has to report in 2 weeks time. Does anyone know what's that for?</p>
              <p>He also added that he asked his IO in the room whether will he be charged, his IO said ' Unlikely, but no promise ' Im seeking a few answers at the moment.</p>
              <p>If he doesn't get charged, does that mean that his record is still clean? as in for a criminal declaration form, he can still say that there are no records whatsoever right?</p>

              <p>No charge. Report back cause some guy have to do background check to see if this guy got any other "hidden" problem before. If really no "hidden" problem, and the IO deem the crime to be minor, than a "hidden" report will be made, no official charge will be brought up.</p>
              <p>If there is a "hidden" report already, than confirm get charge.</p>
              <p>The criminal record forms will not ask if you have any records. It will ask if you have been charged and convicted in a court of law of singapore or foreign country before. answer accordingly.</p>

              <p>Theres a higher chance he would be fine if this is his first criminal offence. Its not just shoplifting thats taken into account but i guess any other sort of crime. If hes not careful and behaves himself, the next time it happens, he'll likely be charged for sure.</p>

              <p>Reporting in two weeks time... further information can be obtained from the bail bond. Since you are his bailor, you will have a copy of the bail bond. Check and look through it to see the reporting time and location [usually a division HQ, unless it is court bail by which you will have to report to the Sub Courts], and then report accordingly with your friend.</p>
              <p>Essentially, bail is used so that offenders / arrested people can be 'free' temporarily while the Police conduct their investigations. As a person can only be detained for a maximum of 48 hours from the time of their arrest, if you did not post bail for your friend he would have been sent to Queenstown Remand Prison instead. When you report with your friend next week, the IO will conduct further investigations.</p>
              <p>It is of paramount importance that your friend does not 'jump bail', and that you report together with him at the stated time and location. This is because if your friend jumps bail, you will have to pay the amount stated on the bail bond, and your friend will be a person wanted for arrest. Not a good thing.</p>
              <p>About your enquiries:</p>
              <p>Even if your friend is charged, if he is not convicted of the crime, or any crime, for that matter, there will be NO criminal record. This means that if he is given an official warning by the Police [i.e. no charge, but with a duplicate of the official warning slip issued to him], or any other course of action that does not end up with him being convicted, he will end up with no criminal record. Criminal records only apply to convictions, after the case has been concluded.</p>
              <p>The outcome of the case depends on more than just the IO's recommendations though. The case will have to go through the Attorney-General's Chambers [AGC], as well as the Head of Investigation for the Police. That is why the IO said, "no promises", because it is not entirely up to him to decide.</p>
              <p>further information on Police procedures can be obtained from:</p>
              <p>http://spf.gov.sg/epc/procedures/index.htm</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>
              <p>PS: "Green" does not necessarily mean first time offender. It could also be that your friend was underaged at the time of his previous offences, if there were any.</p>
              <p>Also, don't mean to be judgemental, but if this is not the first time your friend has pulled a stunt like this, I'd advise you to knock some sense into his skull, seeing as to he is your friend. It wouldn't be good for him to throw away his [currently-as-of-now] clean record for something as silly as shoplifting.</p>

              <p>Also, don't mean to be judgemental, but if this is not the first
              time your friend has pulled a stunt like this, I'd advise you to
              knock some sense into his skull, seeing as to he is your friend. It
              wouldn't be good for him to throw away his [currently-as-of-now]
              clean record for something as silly as shoplifting.</p>

              <p>I hope that your friend will be let off with an official warning. But after the warning, should he be arrested for any other offence, he will no longer be warned and such, straightaway charged in a court of law.</p>
              <p>What 93guy said is possible too. But since your friend is 20, not likely to kena GP [guidance programme] lah. Police record will have, but no criminal record. Will still be 'green' if kena GP.</p>
              <p>I think, and I hope, that your friend gets let off with a warning.</p>
