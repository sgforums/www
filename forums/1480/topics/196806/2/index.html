In the first place, we don't want to be there ... you know.<br><br>Have a heart... I am a police reservist too. Though I don't look up to most of the young officers, but I serve with them. Sometimes they relax, for the benefit of reservist.. and maybe they are all reservist. What do you expect, when you work normal hours and on leisure, they are on shift. You expect professional attitude all the time.<br><br>BTW, they serve more than 14-16 hours unofficially... trust me. When they are on off days, they have always have some wayang program and training.  After a while anyone would be depress..<br><br>To normal folks, you can never distinguish a regular from a NSF or reservist. For reservist, only upon further observation, would you be able to distinguish them.. you find them usually more sloppy. But personally I know alot of Young regulars just as sloppy or worst.<br><br>For me, I always declare to the world that I am a reservist (when I'm doing something unpolice expected) , and you can actually see the member of public, the facial expression relaxed and a knowing understanding nod and smile.. forgiven - carry on doing whatever you're doing   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Go take a piss and cool down.</div>

During the meal break, I had nowhere to hide and the food suppied are soggy KFC. I and my partner simply went into a posh restaurant opposite Raffles in full uniform, sat on a table and had our meals... what's wrong.

Espcially when there are more Key Installations around and deployments like IMF, the whole country are actually being put to test for their readiness.....<br><br>as for the eating issues....  well... nothing is wrong....   no black and white stating that its wrong too....   but SPF is looking forward to be a world class police force which means, Professionalism is taken into account too....<br><br>Well, there are always good and bad eggs around....   just make sure that you serve with your heart and who is there to complain?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
