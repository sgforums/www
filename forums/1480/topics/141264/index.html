Niven, head of the <span style="color: red;">Gurkha</span> Contingent in Singapore.<br><br><strong>The <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas'</span> main strength is their impartiality in the multiracial city-state of four million people. </strong><br><br>"In the local context, impartiality is one of their unique attributes," Niven said.<br><br>"Not being influenced by the local scene is part of their concept in Singapore. They just don't get emotionally involved in anything they may get caught up in."<br><br>It is the absence of political or religious roots in Singapore that has granted the soldiers a reputation of utmost objectivity -- key to success in Singapore which is inhabited by ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian communities.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ON A KNIFE EDGE </strong></span><br><br>The <span style="color: red;">Gurkha </span>Contingent was officially created in Singapore in 1949 from ex-British Army <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas</span>.<br><br>The city state has expanded the Contingent in the past few years, according to a source with knowledge of the <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas</span>, but the events of September 11 could result in further increases.<br><br>"Before, you just never saw them on the streets (of Singapore)," said the source, who did not want to be identified. "But the government is pushing them more into the public domain, which is a very interesting phenomenon."<br><br>The recent arrests of Islamic militants suspected of plotting bomb attacks have cast a shadow over the security-conscious island republic.<br><br>"We are a police force and we respond to what our republic requires of us in times of peace or in time of tension in the world," Niven said.<br><br>"We are unique here in the sense that our <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas</span> are police officers... While a soldier is perhaps out there to kill people, <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas</span> here are essentially present to maintain the peace, and protect people and property."<br><br>Yet, a <span style="color: red;">Gurkha </span>cop is still a <span style="color: red;">Gurkha</span>. According to legend, once his kukri dagger has been drawn in battle, it must "taste blood". If it has not, its master has to cut himself before returning it to its sheath.<br><br>Descended from the Rajputs tribes of North India,<span style="color: red;"> Gurkhas </span>conquered the small Nepali region of Gorkha after being forced out from India in the early 16th century. Settling down in their new home, they called themselves <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas</span>.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A CITY IN A CITY </span></strong><br><br>From there, <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas</span> have travelled widely, serving the British empire in many parts of Asia but particularly Singapore and Hong Kong.<br><br>The <span style="color: red;">Gurkha </span>Cantonment in Singapore is like another world, with its own shops, schools and playgrounds.<br><br>"This is a small township, and I am like a mayor," Niven said.<br><br>Stationed in Singapore on a temporary mission, the <span style="color: red;">Gurkhas</span> do not sink deep roots into the city's soil. They are not allowed to.<br><br>The principle of impartiality forbids them to marry Singaporean women.<br><br>Most end up returning home to their villages in the hills where most people grow rice and wheat.<br><br>So far, only two or three of them have broken the tradition and chosen to stay in Singapore instead of returning to Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries and torn by a six-year-old Maoist rebellion that has claimed some 3500 lives.<br><br>Niven said they are mainly recruited from the Hindu and Buddhist villages and begin their careers at the age of 18 to 22.<br><br>Their headquarter and camps are located in Mount Vernon Road.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
