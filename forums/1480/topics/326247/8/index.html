              <p>I read in the forum that  VSC  can report on &amp; off duty as they like.  But I am not sure how is it possible as I believed SPF must have their own work schedule.  
              
              I understand the following schedule.  For SOC(V), troops on standy duty are on 12 hour shift so how can a VSC from PTT just report off &amp; on as he like?  Even those in NPC or patrol teams has their own fixed schdule before they moved to their sectors.  Maybe VSC in those staff department can have more flexiblity but I believed those serving in line units need to confine to the routine.
              
              In the case of VSC, I believed there should already be a plan to accomodate VSC as most VSC can only serve after office hours.
              
              Anyway, does anyone knows why certain people are still rejected for VSC despite physically fit, academic qualified?

              <p>1.There is a fixed schedule for VSCs to report in or out.  Either you follow the Regular's hours.  Or you join the special groups that caters to VSC's hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Even staff officers have a schedule.  Some has some flexibility because of the nature of their staff work.  From co-ordinating with the regulars on staff work schedule to doing adhoc hours to complete a job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. I have limitation to answering that.  Please write in to VSCHQ regards to the reasons.</p>

              <p><br>I seriously do not have the qualification to answer you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. No,thats the official time,but Instructors are humans too.  They also prefer to let you off abit earlier then 11pm.  They also need to go home to their wives, girlfriends &amp; kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. No. You dont need to know swimming or driving to join VSC. It might be good if you pick up some of those skills on your own. POs tend to always find themselves in situations that is not expected.  (Think how some POs in police cars was rammed into a canal can liao.)</p>

              I went for the VSC Psyo test last Saturday.  Goodnes, they are really professional &amp; polite.  It has been 10 years since I last applied in SPF.
              
              I remeber when I applied for PO in 1998 in the OLD PA that time.  The interviewers are really horrible.  They shouted at us (Applicants) and barked us around.  The FI  f*** us around during the urine test.
              
              I was not selected as I screwed up the interview (my fault).  My 2 female classmates were selected later but turned down coz they get frigten from the interview.

                  Hi viciouskitty74,
                  
                  Thanks for your reply.  Be it just for show or real, I am impressed during the VSC briefing last Sat as it really portrays the professionalism &amp; commitment of the force.
              
               I always like police work or uniform group since young.  Have been in NPCC for secondary but did not shortlisted for SPO Interview after my Law degree several years ago.  Just MR from Commando after 6 reservist..
                  
                  Anyway, I really hope to contribute to VSC even I start off as a coporal. Looking forward to the interview if shortlisted...

              <p><br>Errr.....you arent technically forcibly posted to any division.</p>
              <p>You should have a selection of divisions to go to.  If they have space.</p>
              <p>Chances are, there is need of officers for almost everywhere.  Though specialised units may have the requirements that you serve at a land division before you transfer over to join them.</p>
              <p>The idea is that, if you done regular police work, specialised division work should be even chicken feat.</p>
              <p>Specialised divisions:</p>
              <p>Airport, CNB, TRACOM, VSCHQ, PMU, TP &amp; PCG.</p>
              <p>Though PCG is known to take in freshly graduated from TRACOM VSCs due to their work scope.  PCG also have on the duty training so they can absorb in fresh VSC in the sense that their work is different from normal land division.</p>
              <p>Since you suggested that you are working in law industry at the moment, then you should consider choosing a division near your office.  Makes for easier commute.  That should likely be the 'A' or the 'E' divisions.</p>

              <p><br>In that case,  'G' &amp; 'AP' is totally near your place.</p>
              <p>Sea Allowance?  Last I know.  Dont have.</p>
              <p>Training will depend on what kinda training, conducted by who.  For the VSCs, they always try to arrange weekday evening in service training and some weekends.</p>
              <p>But generally, on the job training should suffice.  Unless you want to do more specialised work for the PCG, then can consider taking some months off to take the gruelling regulars conducted training.</p>
