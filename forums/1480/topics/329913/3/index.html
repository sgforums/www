              <p>On top of Police assistance required cases - cat stuck on tree,

              <p>you guys can argue on forever and it still wont be resolved. why? it all boils down to the lack of understanding! so i say learn the ways of both the saf and the spf then perhaps by then everyone will have a clearer perspective of both. and hopefully there wont be a need for this "debate" to go on...</p>
              <p>no one can deny the contributions made by the saf and spf to the safety and security of sg. the escape of MSK was not a competition btw the saf and the spf to see who could catch him first or who slogged harder, rather it was a joint effort by both organisations to protect our country. by saying that the infantrymen doing all the work and the POs slacking issnt exactly fair. if you do remember, SOC troopers did go knocking on door to door at foreign worker's domitary and gurkhas(and SOC too?) did join in the search in forested areas.</p>

              <p>Well, I didn't say that you explicitly said that police have it easier mate. In fact, I wasn't even trying to say what you were saying. To be honest, I was just trying to clarify certain matters about your earlier posts lah, which I had quoted. In addition to that, I just giving a slight insight to what the Police have to attend to in the course of their everyday duties.</p>
              <p>On a side note, there are a lot of things attached to Police involvement [in terms of everyday incidents]. It's just that with dwindling manpower, those left behind are feeling the strain.</p>
              <p>And even if you don't do sai kang that the SPF do, I'm sure that there will be other types of sai kang for your sergeant to 'arrow' you to do. Sai kang has always been, and will always be, a part of any uniformed organization, no?</p>
              <p>And if you'd like to join, you can always apply. Acceptance is subject to manpower department lor. Sometimes one's record might not be as serious as one might think...</p>
              <p>But anyway, back to the topic at hand [or specifically, your question].</p>
              <p>Gurkhas are part of the SPF. However, their training is all done separately, and is more of a military nature actually. If you were on Pulau Tekong during your BMT stint, you might see them from time to time, training.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Gurkhas are placed in State institutions where people are held in protective custody i.e. ISD detention centre, Prisons, DRCs, etc.</p>
              <p>PS: Anyone with more intimate knowledge of such places, do correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>But generally, the Gurkhas are stationed at such places to help keep watch over the people held in custody. So they help out a number of different agencies actually.</p>

              <p>Frankly, I am not against spf running the NDP, it wouldnt be any different of how the arm forces is running the NDP. its just a change of management.</p>
              <p>Arm forces are still required to work under the SPF personnels in this way.  It will be the same. And those spf personnels previously working in the NDP might be then promoted to a more recognised position when the arm orces personnels have to report to the spf.</p>

              <p>Haha... the pleasure's always mine mate. If you asked me, I'll say that the SPF is the most misunderstood entity in the whole of Singapore. I just hope that nobody takes anything for granted. After all, to summarize each department's role, I'd say that:</p>
              <p>The SAF protects the nation from external threats [would-be intruders, etc]</p>
              <p>The SCDF saves lives and properties</p>
              <p>The SPF protects the nation from... itself. ;)</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's just my interpretation. </p>
              <p>We all have a part to play in keeping our nation safe. Let's just not take one another for granted.</p>
              <p>Cheers to you as well. =)</p>

              <p>Kit's right. Some people have dual appointments in both the SPF and SAF. Sometimes they get seconded around to a vast multitude of agencies, not just the uniformed ones.</p>
              <p>But if you asked me... I'd say leave the NDP planning to the armed forces lah. Why? To me, it's a very simple matter of proportion. The SAF are the largest organization in the country. They are also the number one priority in Singapore [as compared to other departments]. With what they have, it's only right that they should take the lead for an occasions like this.</p>
              <p>The SPF will do what it has always done: look after public order and domestic legal situations. Or situations with such attachments. Which is why it is the one leading  events like IMF lah, IOC meeting lah, APEC, IISS and a variety of related summits, etc.</p>
