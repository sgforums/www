              <p>thank you army for cleaning all the mess that SPF made. which is
              alot? give some examples of that. but no thank you, army personnel

              <p>Some examples? You want to take the kucing kurap drink driving of SAF soldiers and compare with how SPF lost a terrorist and mobilise how many thousands of army soldiers to co-ordinate with the police side? Or how i see one whole chain gang of our boys in blue cluster-farking at Changi Exhibition Centre playing PSP during OVL while the bloody infantrymen have to play hide and seek in the jungles during heavy rain and yet have to maintain cover and tactical silence?</p>

              <p>Why is there a need to compare the two organizations? Basically, it can be summarized as such:</p>
              <p>The SAF is a much larger organization than the SPF. Hence, more manpower.</p>
              <p>Also worth noting is the difference in proportion: SAF has more NSFs than regulars, while the opposite is the case in SPF.</p>
              <p>Both organizations have different functions.</p>
              <p>Different types of fatigue abound while carrying out duties, for both departments: Army is obviously much more physically tiring, while doing frontline duty for the SPF is mentally tiring.</p>
              <p>Two different organizations. Different responsibilities [specifically, not as a whole], and differences in environment.</p>
              <p>Why the need to compare?</p>
              <p>Just be respectful and give respect where it is due.</p>
              <p>To both sides.</p>
              <p>And for what it is worth, the Police did not lose the terrorist. The ISD did. They operate outside the SPF. And the SPF got roped in, together with the SAF to assist in the search.</p>
              <p>Your understanding would be very much appreciated.</p>
