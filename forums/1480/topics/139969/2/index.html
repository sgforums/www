Not that the media finds it always news worthy too anyway. If people here are concerned about the "why" questions, then you might as well wait for the case to be brought to the courts, a process which will take months. Either you have to stake out the court rooms waiting for the results, or pray that the press bothers to publish it. If not, then please do show some basic respect for the privacy of the perished and his family. I do find some of the demands for information in this thread in bad taste.</div>
