              <p>Well, most of the inmates are adults and have the minds of their own.</p>
              <p>Doing time is a way in punishing them for the breach they had made in law. Hoping that they will reform is an ideal and bonus.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure with the female inmates as I had only interacted with the male inmates before.</p>
              <p>Don't try to go in and brain wash them, it will only take less than 2 seconds for them to block you mentally.</p>
              <p>Treat them with respect and dignity.</p>
              <p>Treat them as a follow individual.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, there are valuable lessons and experience to be learned from them too.</p>

              <p>You see, we are individuals, we are suppose to think for the better for ourselves. Of course there will be rehabilitation programmes while they are doing time but ultimately it's their own choice for the path they choose to move on in life.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's right for us to treat them as unfeeling subjects and try to brainwash them.</p>
              <p>I used to work part time in this company where all its perm staff (besides the managers) were ex-convicts. Some of them went back old ways, some trying hard to be alone (so as not to fall back old paths) and as much as they were honest to me with their pasts, never did they once coerce me or any other part timers to join their acts.</p>
              <p>Even if they did, it's up to us to say yes or no.</p>
              <p>It's all about choices that we choose to take in life.</p>
