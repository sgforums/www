              <p>Just last evening, picked up a pouch containing a wallet outside Cold Storage at Eastwood, thus decided to hand it over to the police.</p>
              <p>At the police station, the officer made my family members and i wait for 40 minutes, making us look like some fools while she typed out the report.</p>
              <p>Can u imagine the frustration? I'm here doing a good deed by handing over the wallet with everything intact and i'm forced to wait like an idiot while she took her time to type out the report. I saw the report and it can easily be typed out in under 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>Even my dad who was waiting outside in the car stormed in the station after 30 minutes of waiting and made a fuss about it.</p>
              <p>Tell you just how efficient singapore's police force is eh? i'm NEVER going to the policestation ever again if i were to pick up another lost wallet. Heck, i would have just taken the money (quite a substantial sum) and handed the wallet over to the shopowners there if it weren't for the fact that my parents were around.</p>

              <p>To answer your questions;</p>
              <p>The report lodging itself took 40 minutes.</p>
              <p>Items in wallet includes $196 in cash, 3 vouchers, 1 big sweep ticket, 3 credit cards, cashcard, driving license, SAF card, Krisflyer card, 2 petrol cards.</p>

              <p>10 minutes cannot lah. Somemore all got serial number.</p>
              <p>Its a computer system now where you fill in spaces, not handwritten. Takes for the system to recognise your entry, ask you some details as the system is stupid and ask for a lot of details, takes time to save before you can continue to next page.</p>
              <p>I lodge Police report B4 recently when my car was scratched. I saw the officer do the report and I can see the screen. The officer type very fast and it is only less than 6 lines. The system prompt a lot of questions. Takes 20 minutes to complete and print out.</p>
              <p>Maybe next time go to some smaller centre or post, say I found this, put there and leave quickly. Someone found my card holder and hand over to a NPC. The person just drop and go off before the officer can ask him more, so I didn't know where he found my card holder wth my cards inside.</p>

              <p>I prefer returning the items to the person myself.  Save the hassle.  Was young and naive one time.  Found a wallet belonging to a junior student in my school with at least $300 cash at the MRt platform.  Went and give the wallet to the mrt control station w/o leaving any names of details.</p>
              <p>When I checked with my sister, her classmate received the wallet back but all the cash was gone.</p>
              <p>Even when in uniform, receiving a wallet is easy, just jot down the persons name and contact number and roughly list the items so the person knows whats in the wallet and can verify the items after being returned to the ownere of that lost property.</p>

              <p>Just last evening, picked up a pouch containing a wallet outside Cold Storage at Eastwood, thus decided to hand it over to the police.</p>
              <p>At the police station, the officer made my family members and i wait for 40 minutes, making us look like some fools while she typed out the report.</p>
              <p>Can u imagine the frustration? I'm here doing a good deed by handing over the wallet with everything intact and i'm forced to wait like an idiot while she took her time to type out the report. I saw the report and it can easily be typed out in under 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>Even my dad who was waiting outside in the car stormed in the station after 30 minutes of waiting and made a fuss about it.</p>
              <p>Tell you just how efficient singapore's police force is eh? i'm NEVER going to the policestation ever again if i were to pick up another lost wallet. Heck, i would have just taken the money (quite a substantial sum) and handed the wallet over to the shopowners there if it weren't for the fact that my parents were around.</p>

              <p>10 minutes cannot lah. Somemore all got serial number.</p>
              <p>Its a computer system now where you fill in spaces, not handwritten. Takes for the system to recognise your entry, ask you some details as the system is stupid and ask for a lot of details, takes time to save before you can continue to next page.</p>
              <p>I lodge Police report B4 recently when my car was scratched. I saw the officer do the report and I can see the screen. The officer type very fast and it is only less than 6 lines. The system prompt a lot of questions. Takes 20 minutes to complete and print out.</p>
              <p>Maybe next time go to some smaller centre or post, say I found this, put there and leave quickly. Someone found my card holder and hand over to a NPC. The person just drop and go off before the officer can ask him more, so I didn't know where he found my card holder wth my cards inside.</p>
