              <p>A former policeman and two other officers from the Force were charged with corruption in court today.</p>
              <p>35-year old Ong Thiam Hock used to be a Senior Staff Sergeant attached to the Compliant Management Unit.</p>
              <p>It oversees the management of licensees for public entertainment, liquor and massage establishments.</p>
              <p>Ong, who faces 12 charges in all, was arrested yesterday.</p>
              <p>His lawyer, Thong Chee Kun, says Ong recently left the police force.</p>
              <p>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau or CPIB says, it received
              information that the operator of an illegal massage parlour had
              allegedly paid bribes to police officers in exchange for tip-offs on
              impending raids.</p>
              <p>Zhong Xianqin, who's a China-national from Tian Zi massage parlour
              at Block 445 Clementi Avenue 3 is also believed to have offered free
              sexual services to them.</p>
              <p>Ong had allegedly received such services from her between late May and early July last year.</p>
              <p>He's also believed to have received a total of $7,000 cash from her in exchange for the tip-offs, at around the same time.</p>
              <p>Ong will reappear in court for a pre-trial conference on the 19th of March.</p>
              <p>The other two officers charged today have been interdicted.</p>
              <p>One of them, 49-year old Aziz Osman faces 11 corruption charges in all.</p>
              <p>Aziz is a Station Inspector attached to the Traffic Police Department.</p>
              <p>Among others, the leader of a patrol team had allegedly instructed
              five of his subordinates to provide unauthorised mobile escort for the
              wedding ceremony of one John Hooi Tuck Sung in May 2004.</p>
              <p>It's believed Aziz told the men to make false entries in their patrol log sheets after performing the escort.</p>
              <p>Forty-eight year old Hashim Kamari, who's a Senior Station Inspector, was also charged with corruption today.</p>
              <p>He's a Project Management Officer attached to the Automotive
              Engineering and Management Division of the Police Logistics Department.</p>
              <p>Hashim is believed to have corruptly accepted a discount of about
              $80 from one Lim Sun Kwang when he purchased a tyre made by its
              manufacturer, Metzeler.</p>
              <p>In exchange for the discount, Hashim had allegedly recommended that
              his department purchase Metzeler tyres from a local supplier of
              motorcycle accessories, JR Private Limited.</p>
              <p>If Hashim is convicted of this offence, he could be fined up to $100,000, jailed a maximum of five years or both.</p>
              <p>Hashim and Aziz will reappear in court for their pre-trial conferences on the 12th of March.</p>
