But i believe you had your message send to everyone here.<br><br>Its definately a sad day if what you said came true and i believe that will not be the case. Gone were the days where employee from the Public Service that are autoritive like the old days. If i am not wrong there is a PSO setup under the PMO for employees to understand the change of culture in the Public service.<br><br>Well, definately i do agree that everyone have their rights to remain silent or refuse to be check on upon(as of the main concern of this thread). I also believe by not having any burden to oneself is = to make life difficult for the govt. There is always a feedback unit for everyone to raise any concern. And as what they have stated on one of their para(in the PS21 website),<br><br>"Singaporeans are now better educated and more informed. They have a stronger desire to be involved in what is happening around them. They are demanding greater discursive space, and a culture which encourages them to express themselves freely, make mistakes, voice diverse views and experiment."<br><br>Which i believe the public services itself are aware that they are handling a different kind of public nowadays.<br><br>So, i have to agree with MCSquare that, by giving orally to the officers the name and address is sufficient. And of course that the officers can further escertain it by seeing any id shown(if neccessary). If not, its just a mere consensual conversation between the officers and the public(which one can choose to reject). And do please ask for the reasons for the checks, rather then to question the powers and the rights of officers conducting it. Unless the reasons given is not appropriate, then the public can raise their suspicion.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

But tough measures were needed in those days when triads roamed more freely. Fighting fire with fire was the only way to beat them. We don't have such triads any more, and they've managed to keep crime low.<br><br>We're probably the safest city in the world ... in fact, I think we are. I can't think of any other country safer than Singapore. I can't think of any other country where I'd feel safe walking in the streets in the middle of the night.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">That's why it's called Public Service. Somewhere along the line, some figures of authority decided to play God and twist it to ensure the people make the Govt's life better. </div></blockquote>Ever since they embarked on community policing, they've become more open to questions from the public. They have adapted to the changing times. But old habits die hard and people like qazplm still think they live in the old cowboy town days. His ignorance is by no means a reflection on our police, who I believe are more professional than quite a lot of other police forces. (Any episode of COPS, will give you ample instances of screw ups made by the US cops)<br><br>I don't deny that our cops have powers to do ID checks, the inability of some of these posters at identifying these powers does not mean that -<br><br>a) our cops have a blanket power to conduct checks any time they want to, or that;<br>b) the cops have NO power at all, and that they're just a bunch of govt servants who make it a habit to abuse authority. (which is what you believe may be the case here)<br><br>Their inability to point out the relevant powers just means that ... they're unable to identify these powers. I just hope these posters are not serving cops. (If they are, I'd seriously advise them to check up on their law ... I'm sure they have books and manuals on these powers)<br><br>I seriously don't think the govt has twisted or abused any law. Actually, all one has to do is compare this govt to any govt overseas, and at least one thing becomes clear - this govt solves problems. They seem to be able to do the right thing even if it may hurt them in the polls - that takes balls. I have seen many govts take the more popular road rather than the more appropriate road.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm not degrading anyone here in particular, just trying to raise some awareness amongst fellow Singaporeans who always think they must not make life hard for the government and actually burden themselves unnecessarily. </div></blockquote>I think mutual cooperation is required here. As far as this case goes, citizens should cooperate with the cops and the cops must conduct themselves professionally. And professionally means knowing their powers and not abusing them.</div>
