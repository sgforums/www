In the first place, if police officers are not empowered, then why  will they wanna check you for?  fun? </div></blockquote>Am I being offensive? No, asking whether they have the right to check is not being offensive.<br><br>Your answer shows that you do not see the issue very well.<br><br>You assume that <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> cops check for ID means they are empowered to. That's a wrong assumption. It is the other way around - they can only check <strong>if</strong> they are empowered.<br><br>... and contrary to what you believe, they <strong>are not</strong> empowered to conduct checks without valid legal powers. They are <strong>not allowed</strong> to ask for ID when they conduct 'random' and 'routine' checks. 'Routine' checks are just chats and I may ignore them if I choose to.<br><br>I do not deny that they do have legal powers to conduct ID checks on certain instances ... and that's precisely what is being questioned and discussed here ... i.e. what/when are they allowed to conduct checks and what are the legal responses that the public can give.<br><br><strong>If you are indeed a cop, you make a very lousy one and I am guessing that if you are indeed a cop, you're at most a Sgt, and I'm afraid, not a good Sgt at that.</strong><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by qazplm:<br><strong>There will definately be A REASON for them to check and how can i tell you which section? omg....

They need to do their job.<br><br>I think the most important step is getting them to explain their reasons for checking my ID.
