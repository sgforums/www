              <p>my stand is to leave it.</p>
              <p>It is just a warning letter, as part of the administration process. Leave it and leave the girl alone.</p>
              <p>The fact is that it is reflect on the her handphone that you have sexually harassed her. It does not matter whether it is a joke or not. The evidence is there, written in Black and White on the hp. And there is no evidence on your side to prove that it is for fun or joke. </p>
              <p>Whatever you say, whatever you do, it is just to make things worse so LEAVE IT. </p>
              <p>I think you have crossed the line and you should send her an official letter of apology. </p>

              <p>you're getting off with almost nothing. The warning is really nothing. Just check with the police officer to find out more about what the warning means and the consequences</p>

              <p>As far as I know, a letter of warning is just that - a warning. It is by no means a conviction in a court of law, and as such it should not bear any consequence for future employment.</p>
              <p>However, it may be taken into account should you commit a similar action in the future either against that woman, or any other woman for that matter, and get charged in the process.</p>
              <p>All I have to say is to just shut up and lay low and to be grateful that you were not dragged to court. If you draft an appeal letter, for all you know the Attorney-General's Chambers may just change its mind and file charges against you.</p>

              <p>I believe, a retainer of $2k should garantee you the time of such so called lawyer to draft you such a letter, to the lady that you offended, and to the police officers and to the AGC in this matter.</p>

              <p>1) Claims by accused</p>
              <p>I know this girl for 6 months, we enter a quarrel and there was once i send her an SMS, whether she is interested in going to the hotel to have sex with me just to irritate her. as she previously insulted me.</p>
              <p>at the point of sending that sms, I was never with her physically nor have I went up to her place to harass her before. It was an one time SMS.</p>
              <p>I have no previous record and I feel remorse.</p>
              <p>2) Classification</p>
              <p>13A. —(1) Any person who in a public place or in a private place, with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress to another person —<br>(a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or<br>(b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting,<br>thereby causing that person or any other person harassment, alarm or distress, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.</p>
              <p>(2) It is a defence for the accused to prove —<br>(a) that he was inside a dwelling-house and had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation displayed, by him would be heard or seen by a person outside that dwelling-house or any other dwelling-house; or<br>(b) that his conduct was reasonable.</p>
              <p>3) My interpretation</p>
              <p>The claims that both parties were in a quarrel (appeal 1) and the victim previously insulted you (appeal 5) do not come under any of the general exceptions for Penal Code, nor exists any special exceptions for section 13A of the Misc Offences Act. Hence, they only serves as a mitigating factor (together with appeal 6) and not complete defence.</p>
              <p>(i) Mens Rea: intent to cause harrassment (threaten/disturb/annoy), alarm or distress (suffer)</p>
              <p>Even if the victim did not take your SMS seriously nor felt threatened/disturbed/alarmed/suffered, the act still falls under the purview of this section if she was annoyed by the message. You surely knew that such lewd message can cause annoyance to a reasonable person, and intention can be infered if there was knowledge that an act will likely result in a particular effect.</p>
              <p>(ii) Actus Rea: displays any writing which is abusive or insulting, thereby causing that person harassment</p>
              <p>The word “writing” includes any mode of representing or reproducing words, figures, drawings or symbols in a visible form.</p>
              <p>The act still falls under the "harrassment" keyword (appeal 2, 3). Whether your SMS amounts to "abusive or insulting words" is a question of facts, which the judge will provide interpretation based on the facts and evidence presented.</p>
              <p>(iii) Defence: inside a dwelling-house and had no reason to believe that the writing displayed by him would be seen by a person outside that dwelling-house</p>
              <p>It is obvious that you believed that the SMS would be seen by the victim outside the place of commission. Based on your reasoning (appeal 4), it appears that you misinterpreted this provision.</p>
              <p>(iv) Defence: that his conduct was reasonable</p>
              <p>This provision is a question of facts. It is the onus of the accused to present evidence to proof reasonability, which is rather difficult even to attain a required balance of probability.</p>
              <p>4) My advice</p>
              <p>This offence is non-seizable. Hence, the victim had lodged a magistrate report to seek proceedings. If the victim took all the troubles of this lengthy process, she was obviously substantially annoyed with your act.</p>
              <p>The AG gave you a warning instead of proceeding with a charge, and there is no appeal procedure nor conviction records for this. You may refuse to accept the warning in writing to the AGC, and the AG may respond by pressing charge or simply file for reference.</p>
              <p>In summary, you may have committed an offence due to presence of both mens rea and actus rea, subjected to the question of facts. It is up to you to weigh your possible courses of actions with this information.</p>

                              So now imagine this complain was successfully filed and you receive a warning for intentional harassment just because you directed a message at me on the public forum(worst than personal messages)
                              
                              How would you feel? Doesn't feel good right and don't you feel is too much but the law is the law?

              <p> There are also some others that say nasty thing to me here, but do I go file complain against all of them? I understand you guys are just giving your comments or whatsoever justification. Like I say both her and me is having an quarrel and in quarrels the kind of words being exchange are usually nasty. </p>
              <p>About what she did... well All I can say is I spend a lot of time and effort and tolerating her nonsense while we are friends, that lead me to say such a thing.

              For example one day Brother A flare up at Brother B at the kitchen table because ate too loud, of course brother B feel unfair but there it could be because this morning Brother B was hugging on to the toilet too long and Brother A was late for an appointment. 
              
              In scenario we can see that both party at fault and hard to justify who is right and wrong.

              <p>Firstly I am not saying I am very rich, clearly in that particular message. </p>
              <p>I clearly defending her that she is not a person that wants money out of this incident. If she ask for money, I would have gone to the police for threats. </p>
              <div class="quote_body" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8em; clear: left; padding: 0px;">
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">But I refuse to say that out because I feel is revengeful, so I aid if she wants money I won't have a problem but it seems you have taken it another way. I apologies for that. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I am very sincere with my apology, at this moment I am trying to write a nice Christmas Greeting for her.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">But I can't conceal my feeling that I am upset with the entire situation that I felt was slightly blown out of proportion. Would you guys say is alright to feel angry but at the end of the day we have to be reasonable and understand our actions and make the right decision and admit we are wrong.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I am merely trying to seek help for drafting this appeal letter, hoping to have my warning withdrawn not by discrediting her or saying I am right but with reasoning that maybe this issue could be made smaller and I have paid my price. </p>

              <p>And you have expressed a few times, that you were provoked into sending that sms to suggest that she should have sex with you.</p>
              <p>I guess I should now point out.  That if she or the court demanded that you give her money including a apology for what you sms-sed her for.</p>
              <p>You have no grounds to accuse her of threats.</p>

              <p>If she actually does that and is successful, I would have no choice but to pay.</p>
              <p>and I was replying to someone's message that all she want was money, that person didn't say it was via Civil means.</p>

              &lt;p&gt;2 mistakes u made here...&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;first, guys are always at disadvantage as the law sides the
              ladies more...&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;second, fancy getting involved with china women, you are simply
              courting death..&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;All she wants is $$$, jus give her some...&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/blockquote&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
              <p>This will be my last reply to you, because I feel like I am being drawn into a fight with you and your comments are noted. Thank you once again.</p>
