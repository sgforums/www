              <p>Being given a warning by the police and school, that 'ah beng' still can be so proud about it. He didn't even take it seriously at all!! And came to threaten the innocent boy saying that he will beat him up again!!</p>
              <p>Why the school and police keep wanting to close up this case!! Is there someone big behind that 'ah beng'?!!!</p>
              <p>I really don't understand it.</p>
              <p>I think if it is some minister or big rank people's son or daughter got beaten up, then the police and school will seriously investigate the whole matter right?!! Is it because then the news reporter will be reporting it, and it will show like the police and school are doing a good job!! And that Helps the police force and schools to do some pubilicity for them huh!!!</p>

              <p>the police and school just want to close the case - as what you want them to do ? beat up the other kids !!! They don't care ... they just want to get out it fast ... for your case just turn it into a legal one - get a lawyer to pursue the matter - which you can legal sue the other party for damages - let them pay for the medical and legal fee. That the only way to pain the other side nowaday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the incident happen in school - i would include the school in the court case - as they have to bear responsibilies .</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm suspecting if the 'ah beng' is one of the teacher's children not. Maybe thats why they want to close this case quickly.</p>

              <p>The school can still say that they will not get invovle on this matter as we have already reported to the police. WTF!! They juz let the 'ah beng' off that easily!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The innocent boy have gone through so much on the operation n loss of money as the hospital bill is so expensive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And wat does he have return?!! not even a 'sorry' are being said to him. and still can come to him the second time to threaten for it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The police and school juz treat this case like as if it is some three years old kids fighting. how can this be a small case when the nose are crooked and the eyes got swollen and the jaw got moved off a side!! the innocent boy got injuried to so jia let and the 'ah beng' was not even being injured in any way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, the innocent boy and the 'ah beng' are not even related or know each another at all. Don't know why, nowadays kids like to find problem. Are they juz to free?!!</p>

              <p>I think to be fair to our SPF and other organistation, those who say the force are not efficient pls really show the proof out. this is very unfair to those police officer who sacrifies their time to investigate in serious murder cases. and those officer working even while on public holiday to keep our country safe to live in.</p>
              <p> If u say our SPF is doing nothing. U go to other country and walk in the middle of the night ,see u will get rob or not?  but singapore? the chances of being rob is very very little. So if our officer didnt do their work how can our crime rate going lower and lower every year? yes u might say our law are stricts, so little pple dare to commit. But who are the one who enforce it? The Police Officer rite? Plss some cases the police need the have the court order so they can investigate into it. . not they like or dont like. Im not trying to argue but I think we all should give every organisation some respect when speaking bad about them. in a forum everyone is looking. If u got the proof show it. if not I think is not nice to say anthing bad about a person or an organisation rite?</p>

              hmmm on a side note, does anyone have any idea how the police handles online hacking cases? o.O
              
              from what i know from a friend, she spends quite a lot of money on a game, and her account got hacked. regardless of whether it's her responsibility or not, she approached the police to get a hold of the hacker's ip address. the company hosting the game told her that every customer's ip logs are confidential, only someone with some kind of authority could get hold of the ip address. however, the police told her that without the ip address, they could not help her out. 
              
              =(  just a penny for my thoughts.

              The story has more emotions than facts.  SPF do not work the way u describe.  I believed the sentence or punishment is decided by a group of officers and the decisions will be reviewed again internally by a higher group of officers....certainly not by a low rank police officer.  
              
              If the victim think that the punishment is unfair, I belived there are proper channels to address the grievence...not by making a scene in the police station of course..
              
              Based on your story, the boy is injured quite severly but the police seems to be doing nothing.  This is untypical of SPF and totally illogical.  I have been through police cases a couple of times &amp; I know SPF do not operate in this manner.

              <p>To skythewood: so are you trying to say that the boy are beaten up for being unlucky?????? they dun know each other at all!</p>
              <p>The thing is that the police did do their job by giving a warning letter to the 'ah beng' but so wat?? that 'ah beng' can still come to the boy on the second time and threaten him that he will beat him up again. <strong>wat happen if there is a third time? when there is a second time there will sure have a third, forth or even fifth time. will he be home safely? will he be beaten to death? do u noe how serious he was being beaten??</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Imagine your nose are crooked, jaws are moved aside, tooth broke, blood in your eyes and the whole eye got swollen.</strong></p>
              <p>that 'ah beng' is veri well known in sch for his 'beng', he can smoke n fight in sch, and yet the teacher n principle didnt even do anything to him at all!!! <strong>that is not his first time beating up a student in sch!</strong></p>
              <p>To lawenforcer: those police officer who sacrifies their time to investigate in serious murder cases. Of course they sacrifies their time to investiagate serious murder cases, THAT IS BECAUSE THE WHOLE SINGAPORE ARE LOOKING AT IT. that help them to do publicity that they dun take the citizen money for nothing, they really work very hard to investigate it. That is because its a murder case. someone have died. - that is my point of view.</p>
              <p>- To skythewood: The police didnt get involved until the boy's parents report it to the police. the fight was in sch, and yet the sch princple, teachers didnt even know.</p>
              <p>- To suffocate: The police only send him a warning letter. The school didnt do anything or any punishment to the'ah beng' at all.</p>
              <p>- To Singmarine: the boy is injured quite severly but the police seems to be doing nothing. Yes they did one thing - sending him a warning letter. But what is the use of it when he treat that warning letter like a piece of rubbish.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">wat if one day, you guys were walking on the road and got beaten up for no reason, and have to be hospitalized for 4 - 5days.(after that still can to go back to the hospital 5 to 6 time checking), at the meantime you reported to the police. when the police finished the investigation, they come back to you by telling you that, we, police have given a warning letter to the guy who beat you up. The case are closed. No appealing are allowed.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">i ask you guys, how will u feel on it? when not even a sorry are said or compensation are done to you.</span></strong></p>
              <p>one more question to ask, got beaten up and was hospitalized, is it considered as a small case?</p>
              <p>if beating up ppl only get a warning letter, then lets all go n beat up all the ppl on the raod. since its only a warning letter being given, no jail or fines are given, am i right to say that?!!</p>

              <p>Engage a lawyer.. Sad to say, money works in sg. If some lawyer son kena whack up side down. U will know what happen liao..</p>
              <p>Actually, u are correct in some case. Police works on serious case. But when comes to petty crime, they simply don't care.</p>
              <p>Look at the loanshark case. It was only look after and action taken after so many complaints and cases file regarding loanshark harassment that police decide to take serious action to deal with them.</p>
              <p>And u are correct in postin in forum. Internet now is the way and power to make peopl stand up and take a look at some cases.</p>
              <p>If u don't mind. U can provide more details regarding the cases and ah beng who terror the student. Just a stupid thread regarding mum complain abt smelly NSF on bus can make it so big. Why not for yr case? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
