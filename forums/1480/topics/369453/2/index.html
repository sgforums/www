              <p>Singapore police don't seems to be working efficiency enough. They don't really helps people to check on their cases. All they know is to give warning and that it. Case are closed.!!! what is that man!!</p>
              <p><strong>Are they being paid for closing cases?!!!</strong></p>
              <p>An innocent boy got beaten up for no reason and <strong>got sent to the hospital for x ray, operation, stitches.</strong> Making a police report for that, the ans from the police are that - we <strong>police have given a warning to the person and case are closed. no more appealing are allowed.</strong></p>
              <p>The innocent boy and family didn't even get to hear a <strong>'sorry'</strong> from the other party(ah beng), or to do something about it, the police can say that the case are being closed.</p>
              <p><strong>Is that innocent boy being beaten up for being UNLUCKY?!!</strong></p>
              <p>The police didn't even really did their wrk by looking /taking at the edvience that was being told.</p>
              <p>The school didn't even pay much attention on it or can be say as they heck care at all. The principle can even treat it like as if it is a very small matter. - <strong>how small can this matter be when the boy is being sent to hospital for operation!!!</strong></p>
              <p>Being given a warning by the police and school, that 'ah beng' still can be so proud about it. He didn't even take it seriously at all!! And came to threaten the innocent boy saying that he will beat him up again!!</p>
              <p>Why the school and police keep wanting to close up this case!! Is there someone big behind that 'ah beng'?!!!</p>
              <p>I really don't understand it.</p>
              <p>I think if it is some minister or big rank people's son or daughter got beaten up, then the police and school will seriously investigate the whole matter right?!! Is it because then the news reporter will be reporting it, and it will show like the police and school are doing a good job!! And that Helps the police force and schools to do some pubilicity for them huh!!!</p>

              <p>Apparantly nobody ever mentioned a word about being unlucky other than u leh. Dun tok so much cock la, u might as well allege that police beat up and humiliate the "innocent unlucky" person during the interview oso la, since everything u say juz require your emotional claims without backing proof.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us know the official charge the incident was classified under, and if possible, evidence (letter?) of the final outcome. Without them, how we tell if the police have taken the proper actions that is within their powers?</p>

              <p>To skythewood: so are you trying to say that the boy are beaten
              up for being unlucky?????? they dun know each other at all!</p>
              <p><strong>The thing is that the police did do their job by giving a
              warning letter to the 'ah beng' but so wat?? that 'ah beng' can
              still come to the boy on the second time and threaten him that he
              will beat him up again. </strong><strong>wat happen if there is a third
              time? when there is a second time there will sure have a third,
              forth or even fifth time. will he be home safely? will he be
              beaten to death? do u noe how serious he was being
              beaten??</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Imagine your nose are crooked, jaws are moved aside,
              tooth broke, blood in your eyes and the whole eye got
              swollen.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This
              is why for cases in which physical injuries have been inflicted upon
              the victim, he will be asked to seek medical treatment from any medical
              establishement. The investigator in-charge will then liaise with the
              said establishment to fully ascertain the full extent of the injuries
              of the victim.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">About the warning letter...
              well, if the Beng decides to ignore the letter and commit another
              offence, then he really is being stupid isn't he? Warnings work only
              once, during which his name would have already been registered in the
              legal database. See my elaboration on the nature of this warning further down the line.</span></p>
              <p>that 'ah beng' is veri well known in sch for his 'beng', he can
              smoke n fight in sch, and yet the teacher n principle didnt
              even do anything to him at all!!! <strong>that is not his
              first time beating up a student in sch!</strong></p>
              <p>To lawenforcer: those police officer who sacrifies their time to
              investigate in serious murder cases. Of course they sacrifies their
              time to investiagate serious murder cases, THAT IS BECAUSE THE
              WHOLE SINGAPORE ARE LOOKING AT IT. that help them to do publicity
              that they dun take the citizen money for nothing, they really work
              very hard to investigate it. That is because its a murder case.
              someone have died. - that is my point of view.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again, "dun take the citizen money for nothing?" Come on lah. EVERYONE in Singapore pays tax. Including the Police.</span></p>
              <p>- To skythewood: The police didnt get involved until the boy's
              parents report it to the police. the fight was in
              sch, and yet the sch princple, teachers didnt even know.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I
              would like to ask: if nobody reported the incident to the Police, then
              how on earth would you expect the Police to know of the incident?</span></p>
              <p>- To suffocate: The police only send him a warning letter. The
              school didnt do anything or any punishment to the'ah
              beng' at all.</p>
              <p>- To Singmarine: the boy is injured quite severly but the police
              seems to be doing nothing. Yes they did one thing - sending him a
              warning letter. But what is the use of it when he treat that
              warning letter like a piece of rubbish.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Police's warning letter is not your informal,
              verbal kind of warning. It is a Warning in lieu of Prosecution. This
              means that Prosecution is a possible outcome. Two very different things
              altogether, as opposed to the "warning- and-case-closed" situation you seem to imply.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">wat if one day, you guys
              were walking on the road and got beaten up for no reason, and have
              to be hospitalized for 4 - 5days.(after that still can to go back
              to the hospital 5 to 6 time checking), at the meantime you
              reported to the police. when the police finished the investigation,
              they come back to you by telling you that, we, police have given a
              warning letter to the guy who beat you up. The case
              are closed. No appealing are allowed.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">i ask you guys, how will u
              feel on it? when not even a sorry are said or compensation are done
              to you.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What
              is the classification of the case? Also, what did the correspondence
              letter from the Police say EXACTLY? Because the Police do not use the
              words,</span> "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The case
              are closed. No appealing are allowed</span></strong>" <span style="color: #0000ff;">or anything to that effect in their correspondences with anyone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Atrocious grammar notwithstanding, it is not how things are done.</span></p>
              <p>one more question to ask, got beaten up and was hospitalized, is
              it considered as a small case?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For
              your info, quite a number of hospitalizations are Police cases. Not
              just assault or accident cases. When medical attention is needed, lives
              are obviously at stake. So what do you think?</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Small case?</span></p>
              <p>if beating up ppl only get a warning letter, then lets all go n
              beat up all the ppl on the raod. since its only a warning letter
              being given, no jail or fines are given, am i right to say
              that?!!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are so hell-bent on going to "beat up all the ppl on the raod. since its only a warning letter
              being given, no jail or fines are given" as you have so clearly stated, then you are most welcome to try.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When you experience the legal "adventure" that you will go through for yourself, you can tell us all of your first-hand experience then.</span></p>
