              <p>NSF traning 3 months is basic, than another 3 months for vocation, total will be 6 months, if they are going to be patroling police officers... For those 3 months one, they are going to just do admin and non patroling stuff...</p>
              <p>take higher diploma, than degree in 3 years? that is very fast... and very confident.</p>
              <p>promotion is 4 to 6 years. pay increment is slow, as of all government jobs.</p>

              <p>i will attempt to answer your questions in parts, like how you have presented them.</p>
              <p>1. as answered by sky, the first three months is the basic training. regular trainees will usually be trained to perform frontline policing duties, hence the second three months aims to address that. Unless you are applying to go in Police Coast Guard or Dog Unit directly. In these instances, you will be sent out to the aforementioned places after the first three months.</p>
              <p>2. yearly increment is dependent on your rank. not very much. really. promotion rate is dependent on a variety of factors, e.g. on your performance, how much "extra" work you do, etc. Retention bonus will come in once you have hit five years of service [excluding your NS]. the payouts will come with a bond [obligatory service period] though. these retention bonuses are applicable for junior officers [uniformed services] in the ministry of home affairs.</p>
              <p>NOTE: the retention bonus are different from the service payouts one will get in certain years. the payouts do not come with bonds.</p>
              <p>3. the part-time studies will be at temasek polytechnic. diploma / advanced dip in management and police studies. the courses will be sponsored, but subject to approval.</p>
              <p>feel free to apply anytime you want to. application to join the singapore police force as a junior officer is open to all, all year round.</p>
              <p>pros and cons? quite a fair bit to mention...</p>

              <p>i will tell you of what i know, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
              <p>training period will be stay-in. you will walk out on friday evening, and walk back in on sunday evening. since you have been through army training, i think you should do okay for this period lah.</p>
              <p>towards the end of your training period, they will ask you to indicate where you would like to be posted. when i was training, we were given three choices. if it is still status quo, then you can put SOC as your first choice. however, where you get posted to will all depend on manpower demands, and, if you are applying to go to specialist units, interview sessions and whatnot.</p>
              <p>what your friends says is true: all specialist units like PCG, SOC, etc will offer you allowance. but you will only earn those allowances once you pass those courses that you have been sent for.</p>
              <p>And yes, once you have passed those courses, it would mean that you become an asset to your unit. But transferring out is the same everywhere actually: it all depends on manpower constraints, and whether or not your heads of departments want to help you.</p>
              <p>about the promotion bit, well, there are two schools of thought. one school says that promotion in land division is faster because everyone in specialist units do the same thing, while another school says that specialist units promote faster because there are lesser people there and they want to push up as many people as they possibly can.</p>
              <p>personally, i think you can only do your best, and hope for God to do the rest.</p>
              <p>hope this helps, mate.</p>
