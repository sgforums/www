              <p>Im a part timer at a retail outlet and i somehow misplaced my handphone on the counter i was working at and went for lunch. When i realised my handphone was missing, I went back to my counter and asked this aunty if she saw my handphone, she said she did not. I then further asked her to lend me her handphone so that i could call my hand phone in case someone else found it. She started acting suspicious and tried to act as if she was using it. It was only when i requested with the store manager to see the CCTV footage did she suddenly said she found my handphone.<br><br>Its clear that she wanted to steal my handphone but when i made a police report the officer said that maybe the staff there were trying to play a prank on me and said that further more she returned my handphone so he asked me "on what grounds" would i file a police report on.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I'm seriously puzzled as does that mean that i can take someone's handphone and return it only when im caught?<br><br>Bear in mind that theres a CCTV just above my counter but i did not view it.</span></p>

              <p>keep your handphone will you...because you misplaced (not robbed or pickpocketed) your phone.</p>
              <p>like in mrt, i saw a $50 note, I can pick it up and it will never be a crime.</p>
              <p>The biggest amount i every pick up from the floor was $100, seperated in 2 $50 dollars note. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>and just in case anybody get me wrong, I will always try to return the money/valuables i found. </p>
