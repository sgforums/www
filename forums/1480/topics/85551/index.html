Agreements involved an offer made by one party and acceptance by the other and with consideration (involving benefit &amp; detriment)<br><br>For a breach of agreement case to occur, the same must occur of either express and/or implied terms, or terms imposed by statute such as in your case the the Sales of Goods Act.<br><br>If the deal that you were going to make does not fall expressly or implicitly into the scope of the Sales of Goods Act, it is difiicult to take legal action based on 'Breach of Agreement' since you can't establish whther there was any agreement in the 1st place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the fact that u ordered 10 sets....means that it is not a consumer sales as u be selling to others for profit. thus....under non consumer sales. u cannot report cases. like aulf mentioned u need evidence of the purchase.<br><br></div>

Sometimes it can also be shown by way of behaviour or action of the intending parties. The question is only how you can substantiate them ... which of course in writing and black &amp; white wld be the easiest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Is there a written agreement?<br>YES = Breach of Trust aka C.B.T.<br>NO  = Cheating.<br><br>2. Whichever the ACT is, make sure you have the other party's particulars,<br>date of transactions, stipulated cash amount &amp; stipulated number of goods<br>units before stepping into the police station. Otherwise, they'll tell you go<br>find out the details first.<br><br>3. Alternatively, you can seek a lawyer and head to Small Claims Tribunal and<br>fight it out in there. Provided you can get the other party to go along.<br><br>4. Irrationally, you may also get a few of us friends and beat the living<br>daylights out of his brains. (NOT ADVISABLE)<br><br>That's all I have. Good luck.</div>

Its true that breach of agreement is a civil suit....  but by telling the member of public that there is nothing we can do, does reflect a very bad image on us....<br><br>civil suit usually required a official report(NP 299) and to be forwarded to the lawyer(you decide to engage) for further actions....   there is a Investigator name on the top left or below left hand side of the report which is the in charge case...<br><br>some division will be SIO as in charge and some AIO.... so we shall not commit ourselves here regarding which AIO/IO/SIO will be the in charge case..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
