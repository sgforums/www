              <p>Hi all<br><br>I has always been extremely eager to be part of SPF, in particular a Senior Police Officer. I think i wont mention about my passion and all; just know im "ON" for a job in SPF.<br><br>Initially i was aiming for MHA's Uniformed Services Scholarship - the Local Merit Award (Police). My CCA was rather good as i was vice-capt for Track Team &amp; a vice president for a particular large-scale school event.<br><br>I had much confidence that i might get the scholarship at first.. UNTIL i took the A levels this year. I have sat for most of my papers and i doubt i can get many distinctions. I think i can really "kiss-gdbye" to my scholarship dream.<br><br>One of my seniors got awarded LMS(Police) got he scored Distinctions for almost all his A level and AO level subs. And to be frank, i wont get such grades... so i doubt i'll get the scholarship.<br><br>Many people mentioned about NEVER NEVER SIGN ON unless you're a scholar, or really no education and need money for the family. <br><br>So, here i am now, dejected about the Alevels experience as I could not start my career earlier. I'm really yearning to join SPF asap, but unfortunately, SPO have to be graduates after university.. which is so long to go!</p>
              <p>But Im wondering if its still advisible to sign on after i grad from Uni w/o scholarship?<br><br>Will prospects really be <em>that </em>bad?!<br><br><br><em>Many thanks and Appreciation!</em></p>

              <p>when you compare to your senior, it will seem bad. compare to normal sign on senior officer, should be ok. just keep in mind you will never be commissioner of police(the highest post) if you are not a scholar.</p>
              <p>but some of the scholar break bond and leave, others serve finish the bond and go to a job that pays better, so you will still have your chance to climb the ranks if you perform well.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yes, i dont mind not being high up in the management level like CP or what.<br><br>But the problem i hear nowaways is SPF is recruiting very little Senior Officers nowadays. I might not even be selected even i graduate from Uni.<br><br>This is a so annoying. SAF offers much more scholarships and have less stringent intake of Officers unlike SPF. They are like always welcoming more pple to sign as regular and doesnt seem to have problem of too much officers.<br><br>So i guess those who managed to become Senior Officers in SPF are extremely lucky!</p></div>

              <p>Yes, i have already prepared documents for the online scholarship application but i've yet to submit.<br><br><br><strong>eagle :</strong> the rate for those awarded LMS is very low.. like 4 or 5 per year. so really have to be the top creme de la creme and they are usually HCI, RJ students. So its really very tough for me to get. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"><br><br>But if they compromise and let me go for the interview, i definitely believe that i will convince the panel. But then again, it wont happen.<br><br>So here i am, being realistic, seeking advice whether shld i still sign w/o scholarship after my uni.<br><br>Thanks for the replies tho!</p>

              <p>Ah, this response of yours sort of consoled me.<br><br>But than again, if there isnt much difference btwn scholars and normal senior officers, then why the prestige and all. Then there're wouldn't be the saying of the "farmer" and a "scholar". So i reckon there <em>is </em>significant difference; probably in terms of rate of promotion, opportunities and recognisition - afterall it is a govt job.<br><br>But well, regardless of what, i think im still going to pursue this dream!</p>

              <p><br>Well......actually....VSC officers can choose their job scopes.  Most of course prefers the ground work rather then the administration.  And so Administration is filled up with people that actually does admin and field work.</p>
              <p>In VSC, there is no such thing as a officer doing admin, dont know anything about ground work. </p>
              <p>And some of us, like me for instance, ends up doing more admin because I am older, injured, sick or simply indisposed for ground work.</p>
