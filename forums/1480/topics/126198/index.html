I admit that if you are the only one trying to help, it's a bit of embarrassment for some ppl, especially if you let the guy get away or something, ppl will said you act smart. but that should not hinder you decisions to do the things that you think are right, neither is the possibility of getting injured. I'm not telling you to fight with someone with a gun, but at least do something right? If everybody plays a part, this world will be a nicer place to live in.<br><br></div>

Once you call the police, its the police responsibility already. Not yours. So the Police should be cricticised for failing to respond quickly. The moment the guy became violent, I called the police immediately. The police should be down within 5 minutes.<br></div>
