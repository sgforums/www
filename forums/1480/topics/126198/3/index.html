            <div class='col-md body'>I have a question for huaiwei.<br><br>For example a population and land area of a particular estate is big, I as the public presume that SPF should have more resources of PO and Fast Response Cars (FRC). Right? If the estate is small, there should be a standard average of PO and FRC.<br><br>Your example quoting Sengkang. Sengkang is now so big area, that is why they have just built Sengkang NPC next to Compass Point. Thus, there should be a minimum number of PO and FRC.<br><br>For nowadays, NPCs are open from 1200 - 2000. The police say that in this case, more PO can patrol. But I don't see any differences.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can I correct a bit of your reply.<br><br>SCDF Ambulances are despatched from the nearest fire post/ fire station and seldom from hospital. Unless the ambulance is on the way back to their station and suddenly there is a ER call but no ambulance is available from the station.<br><br>We do understand that the traffic may sometimes be heavy but you see, SCDF introduce Fire Bikes &amp; Paramedics Bikes. That means they can get to the scene before the arrvial of others. Why can't SPF introduce this service also.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by huaiwei:</div><div class="quote_body">And POs are never on "standby" when there is no case....sleeping in the station waiting for someone to call 999. POs are expected to be patrolling somewhere at anytime, and when a call comes, it means rushing from where ever he may be to the point in qn. I have had situations in which we had to rush from Barley rd area to Sengkang...because their resources all busy. Even if you break all traffic lights, and you dash at over 100km/hr, I am pretty sure it requires more than 5 mins?</div></blockquote></div>
