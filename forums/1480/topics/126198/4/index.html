I called 999 and they came in 10 minutes. Very fast. But imgaine 3 cars of officers surrounding one intruder? I use the word surrounding and that's true.<br><br>All these shows how SPF is so efficient.<br><br></div></blockquote>Ic. Police late, people complain. Too many police, people complain too.<br><br>I do wonder if there is an assumption that all these matas trying to catch snake are not helping someone else being chased by a chopper-welding man?<br><br>If you think its not logical, yeah. Thats coz it dosent happen. If you have 3 cars of cops catching snake, it means they are too free. But does that mean they are free the whole day?<br><br>And meanwhile, you seem to assume the police can predict a case before they reach. Everything is often dependent purely on the message by the caller...ie, yourself. When you call police and say..."got SNAKE!". How they noe if its a 10cm snake of a fully-grown python? When there is a lack of info, of coz they will send as many ppl as they can. If too many come..what to do right? Go away later loh.<br><br>In addition, not every cop noes how to catch snake, for your info. Cops learn how to catch people, not snakes, unless they go for course. Sometimes the first police officers arriving at scene have to call backup coz they cant catch, or they dont have the equipment in their car to do so.<br><br>If you think this is inefficient, please write to the press demanding the government to reverse their budget cut on the MHA yeah? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually my point is real simple. The SPF seems to be inefficient. It took 25 minutes to reach the scene of crime. Ambulance takes lesser than that. My point is, why cant the police come earlier or at least at the same time with the amnulance?? The police is needed to impose order at the scene of crime as soon as possible. Not come when the entire incident is over and the victim or assailiant is no where to be found. Im not talking about whether police or ambulance should come first. Im talking about, public order should be restore as soon as possible.<br></div>

The thing like I said,when a fight breaks out, it is the wish of the public for order to be imposed as soon as possible. The efficiency Im talking about here refers to how fast the SPF is able to impose the order as soon as possible. I consider 25 minutes to be very long and Inefficient.<br><br>The ambulance even turn up faster but whats the use of it? Are the medics able to provide medical assistance when order isnt imposed at the scene of crime? Can the medic attend to the victim if the assaliant is standing nearby with a dangerous object in hand?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay guys, it's a no end to all these. So just make a summary:<br><br>It really depends on the resources available at the time of incident. The police can be free now but may not be free after 5 minutes. Any cases can happen anytime of the day. Maybe at 12 noon, there is not a single case. But at 1230, there are more than 5 cases at different locations. So, all these cannot be predicated.<br><br>Of course, at the time of incident such as robbery, theft, etc, the victim wishes the police to reach asap. But we really got to think of constraints. There may be traffic congestion, some motorists does not give way. Location of scene not given clearly (informant say is along Hougang Street 21, and no further details given), the police have to search for the whole stretch of the road.<br><br>For ambulance &amp; fire engine, they only cover medical and fire-fighting and resuce incidents, so they can reach faster and with more resources. For police, they do almost all other things, direct traffic during blackout of traffic lights, accident, neighbours quarrelling, etc etc etc.<br><br>So for all out there, 999 or 995, do not abuse it so that the authorities can attend to the emergency cases asap.</div>

The ambulance pronounced the man dead and were off again in 5 minutes. The police had to stay there to settle the stuff for about 2 hours ++.
