However in all place where ranks play a part, this does not work. if upper management ask u to do something, u dont, u already had commited a offence. So therefore this type of communication does not work. I really would like the upper management to understand the suitation, we try to talk to them personally, however they just dont wish to have shit on them ,and they choose to ignore us. and most JOs give up talking to SOs when they had tried many times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting that its a VSC who brings up this issue, although I am not exactly surprised by that either. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I have seen my fair share of similar situations, and yes, the comments made here are hardly earthshaking too.<br><br>I often wonder if its more an issue of individual personality or the organisation. Communication obviously isnt always subversion, nor does it have to be an interrogation. That said, communication isnt exactly merely a this and that column in the ST forums page either.<br><br>Get what I am trying to say?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It keeps our mind thinking though! Sometimes we tend to be afraid of our bosses (SO).<br>- Afraid that we might say wrong things.<br>- Maybe afriad that we may get aimed, etc.<br><br>To me when i was a trainee some of the SO's really hold their heads so high up esp the 'Direct entry SOs' so perhaps thats when they problem starts.
