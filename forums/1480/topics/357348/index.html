              <p>white T-shirt can't have logo. exept police logo.</p>
              <p>i didn't know there is cutting for white shirt.... just a normal white shirt? should be indoor, if there is physical lessons like running or swimming, got the appropriate things to wear.</p>
              <p>I think HP charger means HP charger. What ever way you charge it.</p>
              <p>I think you will be issued stuff when you go in, so you won't need too much stuff. Let's wait for more experienced people to guide you bah...</p>

              <p>The white shirt required is actually for your walk-out. No need to buy expensive shirts: just head on down to beach road and tell them that you want a white shirt for Police and they will know. Can cost as low as a few bucks. You will be using this only for the duration of your training.</p>
              <p>Your white t-shirt is actually for you to wear while in camp. Singlets will do just fine, as they can also be worn within both your uniform and walk-out attire. Other t-shirts are more for your own usage, as training will be conducted in polo tees [will be issued to you].</p>
              <p>Slacks... for ladies will be track pants lor. 'Cause from what I can see, police officer trainess [female] will be in track pants. If guys, shorts will do. Two should suffice, but if you want to bring more, then by all means lor. Minimum of two. I'd recommend about three though.</p>
              <p>Battery-operated chargers should be alright. But just verify with them once againa lor, just in case. If calling through proves to be hard, maybe you can try an email?</p>
              <p>About the bags, actually I would recommend just bringing one bag. Because once your training begins, you will be issued with a big bag.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps...</p>
