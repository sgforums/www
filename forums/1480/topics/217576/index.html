            <div class='col-md body'>Dont say i am childish.. but just trying to help some innocent young gamers to ask.. In many online games (mmorpg).. they are always Hackers or Scammers appearing trying to CHEAT people's "Money"&lt;-- Why do i say money where ppl will think that gaming shouldnt need and invlove any money other then paying bill for electric use for computer and internet access bill.? haha.. Nowadays those kids(should be learned from adults) are very clever.. They Buy/Sell their items/game account to other people using real life money SGD. Game Hackers.. What they do is to hack people items/account to sell others for money.. Now they earned alot.. But they do not have authority to do so.. So i think it is illegal. At least it is a CHEAT case.. I do understand that police only handle hacking cases like huge money/ companies involved cases, but do they think of game hacking cases.. after all it is illegal too.. But till now, i didnt heard of cases where game hackers are get caught by Police and charged in court or what.  Game hacking is getting very very common nowadays.. even alot of warning was given to them, they are still many this kind of cases.. I know Police have alot of other important cases to handle.. But... Mmhz.. police can still try their best if can to handle this problems.. We cant just let small little kids getting cheated, or even small little kids becoming small hacker and when grow up, becoming a Real Big Professional Hacker! haha..<br><br>Actually just wanna ask, if it is really illegal and will police take action on that little kind of hackers.. ?<br><br>From what i heard, Hackers can earn few thousands in few weeks/months just by selling gaming items to other people. They can really earn unlimited amount of money if they can.. This is really unfair.. Like this, i would rather be game hacker since it is so easy to earn money and not easy to get caught.. haha joking joking.. If you spend times to read some gaming forums, they are really many victims and hackers around.. but i had never heard 1 of them getting caught. If the police does handle those cases, i am really glad and happy for those victims, at least the hackers has gotten their retribution and will nv make the same mistake again. Anyway.. i am one of the victims last time too.. but i didnt lose much la.. just a little fed up and pity for the rest too.. Some lost $100+ or even $1000+ worth of items.. Hacker can simply get $100+ by just spending 5-10min... really very unfair.. People work so hard 1 month and get $1000+ of salary. Hacker only spend 10min.. lol</div>
