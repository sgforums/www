              <p>Any kind soul out there to advice on this?</p>
              <p>My sister, S, have been harassed by her ex-bf, TL, for the pass 1 year. Ever since she suggested break-up 1 year ago, TL have been calling her numerous time each day, pleading on patching up the relationship back again and stuff. My sister refused as she is very determine to leave him. At first we thought TL was high on emotion and things will cool down after sometime, but things just got worst.</p>
              <p>9months ago, my sis got a new job after finishing her degree. He from no where, manage to know my sister work place and details like who her immediate superior and boss is, and start calling her work place everyday. Luckily the receptionist was a nice person and TL never manage to get through S or any of her collegues. Meanwhile, TL continue to spam her personal and work email everyday, some of which contain threatening phrase like "if you dont contact me, I will contact your boss everyday. Im sure you wont want Mr XXX to know much of our stories."</p>
              <p>S decides to put an end to these nonsense acts, she called TL 1day and clarify the whole situation clearly. It didnt help, and all these stupid nonsenses continue until my sis decided to leave her job, and also changed her hp nbr. A month later, she got a new job, but nightmare starts again 2nd mth into her new job.</p>
              <p>Not sure how, but TL manage to get her new hp nbr and starts to spam her with calls using unkown nbr. He even sms her saying its no use, there is nothing that can be done. We decide to lodge a police report with all the emails and sms he sent. But police say there is nothing much can be done at that moment because he is not in Singapore. (He is not a local) I mean, with all this harassment, nothing can be done to him?</p>
              <p>Recently, he mange to get hold of her work place details and number again, and start calling her collegue 1 by 1 everyday. Is there any kind soul out there to advice on this? If her collegues are willing to lodge a police report on him harassing, will it help?</p>

              <p>There must be something that allows the guy to know where your sister is working at, so you need to know how he knows. The next time she change jobs, she must not tell anyone and she must not post online or anywhere.</p>
              <p>It's best she change her SingPass and other passwords and reformat her computer. Her computer may contain trojan horse which allows others to track her passwords and activities on the computer. I recommend changing all the passwords after reformating the computer because things like SingPass allows people to access information for example CPF contributions from company, hence immediately I know where you working at.</p>
              <p>Then of course the next thing I would do to such lowlife is that if they want to play with me, good I will play with them. I will make their life fucking miserable but I won't list here how because want to play with low people must use low tactics.</p>

              <p><br>I agree that there must be a channel where TL know where to get information... Maybe from Blog??? FB??? It is even possible to get information via mutual friends, mutual friends' blog,fb etc... It is also even possible to sometime get rare find via search engine with google, yahoo etc...</p>
              <p>Either that or TL has sucessfully engaged the csi team from edmw <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also believe in contacting the police of the country TL is living in... No idea whether it does solve the problem but worth a try...</p>

              <p>Facebook book is a source of information - so stop updating them. Even you don't update your activities, but it does let the guy know who her friends are - there will alway be someone who will spilt the beans.  Also stop updating new friends there - as new friend = new colleagues !!!</p>
              <p>Stop using Gmail, yahoo or hotmail  - change the password !!!</p>
              <p>Singpass - and other that can let him check - Cpf account or bank account will give information on new company.</p>
              <p>It be good to format the whole PC and change all the password.  Even when emailing never talk about the new work, or send email to your work email address and same never send from your work email to your personal mailbox or anyone.</p>
              <p>Totally do not tell any one where she works - even best friend.</p>
              <p>Stay away from chat rooms.</p>
              <p>Also do not inform your former school where you work.</p>
              <p>If have phonecall or email to ask for survey or you win any price - don't fill up the information.</p>
              <p>Also website or webaccounts that ask for detail - like mobile , email - don't fill in.</p>
              <p>When all these still failed . There is a high chance your sister have been physically stalked.</p>

              <p>Wow, what a determined guy. When my 2nd ex-gf broke off with me because I complained to a stranger online behind her back, I pestered her for about 6 months before starting to ease of for another 1 month...</p>
              <p>I called her on the hp hundred over times per day, but she just refused to pick up. I went to her house to be chased away by her mum. Why did I do these? Because I regretted my deeds and wanted to be forgiven, and do not understand why girls can be so hard hearted. I thought by showing my determination to make up for it, she will be moved. But in actual fact, I am being a nuisance and made her detest me more. It also shows immaturity on expressing love.</p>
              <p>The will of a determined guy who has nothing more to lose can be very strong! I feel sorry for the girl. She gotten herself a super leech. Lesson to be learnt here? Before starting a relationship, better think thrice. In mild cases, just get headache like this for a year or two. To the extreme, it could result in death (murder by an entranged man/woman).</p>

              <p>It shows that you felt entitled to be with her cos you were in the right, she dumped you over a small matter. But relationships are not about right and wrong.</p>
