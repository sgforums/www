Unless you are talking about person with disciplinary problems and with criminal records being choosen, then that is something important to be brought up to the management...   do consult you direct supervisor/by proper channel if you came across cases like this~   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
