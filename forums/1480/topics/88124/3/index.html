I might not be entirely correct, so its open for discussion.<br><br><a href="http://policeforce.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=88114" rel="nofollow">http://policeforce.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=88114</a><br><br>Err....I am not trying to make this sound like an excuse, but due to set procedures, when you call in for help, even if it was an emergency via 999, the message will be sent to the nearest "eeyor eeyor car." Depending on how far that car is from your said location, the traffic conditions on the roads, the number of mobiles put on the roads to serve your locality, and even the number of cases which they happen to be attending to at that time, it is difficult to guarantee that the car will reach you as soon as you expect them to.<br><br>So why not just get someone out of the NPP/NPC itself? Well the thing is that the officers manning the counters are not expected to "abandon post" and leave the counter empty (it is not uncommon for an NPP to have only one officer manning it), unless perhaps you rush into a station and ask for help, and the officer decides it is within reasonable grounds to respond (like a murder attempt). But two things to point out here. First, it is not advisable for officers to go alone outside counter duties, let alone responding to an emergency. Second, the ""eeyor eeyor car", or shall I call them them by their official name: Fast Response Car (FRC), dont just ferry officers. They also have with them all sorts of documents and equipment, which are usually neccesary to carry out their duties without hinderence.<br><br>I noe it sounds illogical for so much redtape lah, but what to do. Civil service is like that one mah. But then again, while we hear lots of complaints about officers arriving late, how many of you would actually bother to commend those who did arrive on time, since it is kinda expected from us? Hence, do the lack of commendation result in giving people the impression that the SPF cant respond quickly enough most of the time?<br><br>Just my 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>And when anxiety sets in, the time that one waits for an officer to arrive seems to be longer than usual? This is human nature.<br><br>The "eeyor eeyor" car arrives, the officer rushes to attend to the incident ASAP. And imagine if the officer has to deal complains  him bein late when in fact he isn't.
