              <p>when was your SA? from what Ive read the rejection normally takes a few days to a week. I did not finish the first section ( 60 questions) of the timed test but made it to the next stage. VRT, is it timed? also from what i read ti dosent really matter if u finish it. its how u answer the questions. :)</p>

              <p>Hey @hello121,</p>
              <p>Yeap.i rmb I din finish abt 20 plus questions but I still shaded answers for them..at least there's a chance of getting a few marks. I did finish all the other sections. </p>
              <p>Like what @helvetica said, they won't just reject cuz u din finish the paper.your medical also plays an impt part and so will your answers about yourself. Some ppl could have finished it but most of the answers would have been incorrect. So u'd rather get all right for what u have answered and not finish the paper then get most wrong and finish it. </p>
              <p>Yes the waiting game has begun. Good luck :) </p>
              <p>BTW u graduated or in your last semester ?</p>

              <p>With regards to the VRT test, think about it this way: as a Senior Police Officer you may have to make a really tough decision in a non-clandestine operation, yet for some reasons you weren't able to decide what is the best course of actions to handle the situation. In such a scenario, would you want to make a random decision and hope that it is a right call or would you want to take a step back and seek advice (from your partner/experienced officers/your boss) for directions?</p>
              <p>There would never be a correct answer for the situation as mentioned above. The scenario is somewhat similar to your VRT conundrum of 'to shade or not to shade' but at the end of the day, the fact is that their 'desired response' for the VRT segment would always be a mystery to the applicants :p</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">On a side note, anything could have been done better on hindsight </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">but what matters is that you have completed the test in the best possible way that you could have, on that day :) Therefore, don't fret about it. Like what Singaporeans always says: ' Aiyah what will come will come lah!! Whatever lor!!!" So... CHEERS &amp; ALL THE BEST TO YOU!!!! Y(^o^)Y  </span></p>

              <p>Hello there, in regards to your post; where do you see yourself few years down the road? If SPF is what you are aiming for, no harm waiting a little longer, though I understand the wait is really daunting. I'm currently at my psychologist interview and it took me 5months since my application date. The treacherous wait may, or may not be worth it. If you really have your mind set to SPF, I suggest you take up a part time job where it's feasible for you to leave when the right time comes. After all that's been said, decision still lies on you. :) </p>
              <p>Hope this helps to ease your mind a lil'. :D</p>

              <p>Don't mention at all :) I could totally fathom your situation
              now babe. :/ it took them around 1.5months till the email came,
              scheduling me for dialogue. Subsequently, 2 weeks later I
               received a call to go for psychologist interview. </p>
              <p>I'm sure your time will come soon too, all the best babe!

              <p>@whoop: try to take up some leadership related job like camp instructor/facilitator. then during the interview can share with the panel abt ur experience. ultimately, being a SO is to lead a team, making decisions. if u have friends already in the force, can ask them to share with u their experience too. </p>

              <p>Geez, thank you babe :) there's no harm trying to apply for I can't be too certain if his English grades are taken into consideration (possibility it will) given the fact that his highest qualifications is a degree as of now. It also depends if the recruitment officer would llike to give him a chance to prove himself. But in anyways, if he did make it through, there's an essay that he have to write up which I'm sure u went through that yourself. That essay writing will also indirectly look into his command of English language and how well he can literate :)</p>
              <p>But ultimately, he does have a degree which fits one of the criteria. No harm giving it a shot :) </p>
