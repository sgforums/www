              <p>well, if you look from another angle, this might mean that only sch result is stopping you from being offered a position. they could have stopped your application if they found something else, which till now they have not. so maybe go ahead and pass your exams, guarantee your graudation and you get the job...

              <p>anw, anyone who applied for spo also applied for CNB?</p>
              <p>i am wondering whether they share application materials or information. i.e. declarations, essays, whatever you said in the interview</p>
              <p>my concern is that if they do, not doing well in either one might affect my chances of the other, be it CNB or SPF.</p>

              <p>I did applied for CNB too, but got rejected straightaway without any interviews. Not sure what is their selection criteria. But at least the comfort for me is that SPF has taken me through the whole process. Now is waiting for the "Final Call".</p>

              <p> Hi everyone. I was previously a junior police officer. During my 5 years bond with SPF, I had obtained a Business Management (Finance) degree in RMIT University. Subsequently, I had left the force last year to seek new challenges and learn more about private corporations. However, I had found it unsuitable for my lifestyle and would like to return to SPF where I am more familiar with and also have more time spent with my family. I would like to ask a few questions. </p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Firstly, is it possible for me to sign on as a senior police officer with my degree instead of returning back as a junior officer?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Secondly, if I return back as a junior police officer will I be drawing my last drawn pay or a revised pay?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Thirdly, if I return back as a junior police officer will I be getting the lump sum of money, amounting to $20,000 from the 2 years bond that I was supposed to take up in my 5th year?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Lastly, I would appreciate if I can hear your suggestions on the pros and cons of both options, 1) return back as Junior Officer or 2) sign on as senior police officer. Hope you guys can help me with it although I know most of you do not have experiences like mine.</div>

              <p>Hi ed291114</p>
              <p>Since you have a degree with you now, you are definitely qualify to apply for the senior police officer position.</p>
              <p>However,  I believe that you won't be able return as junior police officer as you are over-qualify to do so. In regards to your lump sum of money you refer to, it would be better if you can consult the manpower.</p>
              <p>Therefore, as mentioned, if you were to return back as Junior police offcer, it might impossible due to your current qualifications. Another alternative you can seek might be consulting your previous Commanding officer or your colleagues.</p>
              <p>And lastly, with your current education, you can try to apply for the senior police officer position now, as alot of us in this forum (including me), are waiting for <strong>at least 6 months or so </strong>to get the whole application process to get through, so meanwhile, you might want to use this time to think about clearly, and try working at the private corporations for this period of time to gain corporate experience, or you might even want to try working as a Auxilary Police/Private Investigators who required a specific skillsets in the police force. </p>
              <p>Since you have set your mind, my advise would be GO FOR IT AND FIGHT FOR IT!!! PS for the long post.</p>

              <p>Hey Howen,</p>
              <p>Thanks for getting back to me. Yup, I thought it through over the few days and felt it would be a better choice for me to apply for SPO as there are more prospects. I will be sending my resume this week. I wish you all the best if you are applying for the post. Once again, thank you! :)</p>
