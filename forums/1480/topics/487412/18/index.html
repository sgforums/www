              <p>Hi there, signed up to seek information from this group. I have
              attended the dialouge interview on 23 July but I think I didn't do
              well. I have recived an email asking me for my full body photo
              anyone has any clue if that means there will be a chance to
              progress? :)</p>

              <p>Hi! They didn't ask me to send any full body photo, but I believe that if they are asking you for more informations instead of rejecting you, they are considering you. So there is definitely chance to progress! All the best! (: </p>

              <p>it is so nice to hear so many good news here! *envy* because i had my first rejection from spf last dec and tried again this year, but still, i am rejected again at the SA stage. so i emailed to ask for reason as it is no point of me to keep trying and repeat the same mistake and get rejected. and the reply was " cannot reveal". so i am so lost, sad and dissapointed. i think i will stop for awhile and try to look for my first job first as i am a fresh grad and see later whether do i have luck for the third round. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">but honestly, is it any tips? because i still dont know where the flaw is.... any kind souls care to enlighten me? many many thanks in advance! </span></p>

              <p>@Mindthegap, I'm thinking that they would be compulsory to attend, rather than a good-to-have, cos we might be required to hit the ground when we eventually report for training, don't think we would have the luxury to go around the place sightseeing (LOL). Not sure about this, maybe the seniors could advise on this point. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>on a slightly unrelated note, did anyone here also try applying to cnb (senior officer) Because I applied to spf, ica, and scdf and was shortlisted for the first round of all three but cnb rejected my application straight away. curious why, because I meet the requirements stated. is it because cnb isn't really a uniform group and hence they're more exclusive? I only have a pass degree.</p></div>

Also, they wanted me to start attachment on 10 August, but because I already have travel plans from 13-23 August, so they offered to let me start attachment on 25 August. Hope you get the call soon!

              hi guys, i'm currently an undergrad at NUS and i was thinking of signing on with the SPF. 
              
              is it possible for me to sign on at this juncture (just commenced year 2 of studies), or do i have to wait until i graduate then apply for the SPO post?

              <p>For psychology interview, I was asked about,</p>
              <p>1. how I handle stress</p>
              <p>2. family and education background</p>
              <p>3. difficult decision I have made and how I handled it</p>
              <p>4. leadership experiences</p>
              <p>5. clarify some of the answers and inputs to the first selection assessment</p>
              <p>This psychology interview will not filter candidates but will be used in the subsequent panel interview.</p>
              <p>Hope the above helps and all the best! </p>

              <p>@rRaymond Thanks for the info! seems like 1,3 and 4 was similar to the questions asked on the 2nd interview. So it means personnel who went through the psychology interview will be bound for the the final panel interview?</p>
              <p>Will be looking forward to this upcoming interview..haha..</p>
