              <p>That's great. Congrats. So happy for you since you have been waiting for quite awhile. Goodness, my patience is slowly eating me from the inside. By the way, can I check with you all, is your application in career@gov still have the shortlisted thing. From the forum, it seems like those who have their application done beyond 6 months have the shortlisted thing missing. Mine is still there though (my application has been slightly more than 6 months now).</p>

              <p>@Zainasaid You can try to look at the previous year thread. They talked about this. I didnt received any request for full body photo. Not sure what is it for.</p>
              <p>@Kunduno Hey, firstly all the best to your upcoming interview. From my experience, they can asked you ANY questions. So, be prepared for that. Try to prepare yourself for any questions by discerning your strengths, motivation and weaknesses. It would be important for you to understand yourself before you reply them. There's no shortcut to this. Also, read up on the current affairs of SPF like its challenges, and what are the future prospect in terms of technological and the current crimes eg. low robberies, but high crimes involving online scams, and this pattern suggest internet is a big driving factor (try to go beyond those observation and point out the underlying factor and what could be done to tackle these issues) My two cents of opinion.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In general, I would recommend you break down your interview preparation in two parts, yourself (strengths, weakness, motivation) and your understanding about SPF (challenges, technological advances and etc). I hope my experiences might aid you in your preparation. FYI, many people left the force for better career opportunity or for better pay and SPF is aware of that. </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Most important, you must show that you are very passionate about this career.</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> Show them that you know what you are signning up for and not for the sake of just getting a job. All the best :)</span></p>
              <p>It feels like a freaking long wait since medical. Days felt like month. Patience game so strong. Jiayou everyone!</p>

              <p>@chawi Thanks for the tips! I hate strength and weakness questions but well i guess it is a 10 year series for interviewer. Yup, I was preparing for shangari-la and the hospital incident but well i think i i need to prep more! Cyber-crime is another hot topic although i think there is a department set up for that as well. Anyway, thanks so much for your tips! </p>
              <p>You went for medical check up as well waiting for contract signing? Ya, it is a long wait. from May till now :(</p>
              <p>@zainasaid I have been requested for full body photo as well. I have googled in the thread and it was said it was require of those that are either slim or a little obese to see how they will look like to citizens and see how they will percieve of that person. </p>
              <p>@freestyler605 SA is those MCQ questions? my first interview was around June (2 weeks after applying) 2nd interview 2 weeks after, psychology interview (1 month) and panel interview (1 month) after. Well, i do think no news means good news though. They usually takes 2 to 4 weeks. However, you could drop their personnel to check your status. The reply rather fast with enquires though. Good luck!</p>

              <p>@Kunduno Hey! <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I do agree with what Chawi said, they really can ask you ANY questions :) for me, they asked me what was my proudest moment in life~ and luckily I have got one which is very recent, and I just shared how I really feel about that moment.. and also, do know your current affairs! Not just locally, but also the region :) my session was relatively short compared to those in front of me though, not sure if it is because I was the second last in queue and it was past 12pm already haha.</span></p>
              <p>@freestyler605 I went for my SA on 29 Jul, got an initial schedule for the Dialogue Session for 27 Aug but had to change it due to current work commitments, and they rescheduled me to 1 Oct :) probably you can drop the officer-in-charge an email or call to ask? </p>
              <p>Good luck &amp; all the best!</p>
              <p>Hope it helps~</p>

              <p>@kunduno Yea totally agree, sigh I think 2016 probably</p>
              <p>@Mindthegap I totally feel you, whatsmore, going through the whole waiting process longer than me. </p>
              <p>I have sent in a few emails to the recruitment side to enquire on my status, but everytime, its the same old reply. I noticed the offer call's pattern for this year and last year based on the thread. Most of the applicants from last year got their offer pretty fast (est probably 3-4 months) but many applicant from this year waited for more than these period which factors could be due to the F1 and GE2015. I think quite a high chance many people would have to wait at least 5 months or more. Worse still, the rejection call could come in any time during this period instead of the 2 weeks post-medical or board interview period. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Really hope to get into the Novmber intake. Sigh.</span></p>
