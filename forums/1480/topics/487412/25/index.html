              <p>Hi, I have applied as a Junior Police Officer about two days back at the career@gov.sg website. </p>
              <p>I have searched for the latest forum topic with regard to JPO application but there is none so far. </p>
              <p>My question: I am currently a civil servant in the medical line for 2 years but I have been in the medical line since I was 19 and now I am 24, I was wondering has anyone transferred service from one organization to another. Eg. From SPS to SPF? If so, what is the procedure like? </p>
              <p>You guys might be wondering why I want to transfer service to SPF. Like I mentioned before, I have been doing it for 5 years already from being a nurse to now serving in the medical line. I love the job most definitely. I am passionate about my career in the organization. But I want to experience something different and challenge myself out of my comfort zone of being in the medical line. I have seen so many things and attended to so many cases throughout my trainee life and also as a regular. That is why I want to have a change of career and experience life as a police officer. </p>
              <p>Any advices would be gladly appreciated. </p>

              <p>@hello0605 I think the most up to date forum discussion on JPO is JPO 2014 forum. Not sure whether are there any discussion on your question but as far as I know, if you are talking about from one org to another under home team, it could be done. To most people, its like changing uniform but in actual fact, your roles and responsibilities also changes and even your appointment. I heard that some people does that but the catch is that, if you do this, you cannot undo and you have to stick to what you have changed.</p>
              <p>The redeploment to another org is not as simple as you think, and it requires an extensive amount of approval. So think carefully whether making a switch to home team service is worthwhile because its not just about exceeding challenges everytime. As a PO, the job scope could get routinal and monotonous after awhile and exceeding challenges might not be an antidote everytime because of the complexity of the things PO do and in extreme case, it could be overwhelming. I think it would be more important to have a keen interest in policing but I do not want to scrutinise your passion in becoming PO as everyone is different and hold different motivation and interest towards pursuing a career in SPF.</p>
              <p>All the best in your application!</p>

              <p>I think I just screwed up the panel. There's not much reaction from their faces. But when I checked with the other candidates, they actually maintained straight face throughout. So I don't know what's the outcome. No mention of medical during panel tho. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kate, I think a month from application? But depends on how many applicants during the period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who received the call, congratulations. I hope I will be successful.  Now I have to wait like mindthegap.  "Cross fingers"</p>

              <p>Hey guys.</p>
              <p>Congrats on getting in! I just received an email stating that my application is unsuccessful. After almost 6 months of waiting.... So sad was hoping for it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best you all!</p>

              <p>@justadam Thank you! Don't worry about the straight face. I had it too during my panel because I don't think I answered the last question well. I believe that as long as your replies reflect your understanding towards the topic and exude your passion in joining them, it should be fine. Medical call will drop in soon and the waiting game will commence after that! <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">All the best to you! </span></p>
              <p>@zainasaid I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you can resubmit another application if you are still interested to be a SPO. Don't lose hope!</p>
