              <p>Hey everyone I'm facing a dilemma here.</p>
              <p>I'm a 2015 local uni grad but only applied for SPO in mid october. Realistically speaking, I guess the earliest intake for me would only be in Jun/July 2016 right? (assuming I pass all interviews). The wait would be too long and nothing is certain for sure. There are currently 2 options for me now</p>
              <p>1) Find some other full time jobs first and only apply for SPF as a mid career. That would be prob after 2-3 years since my industry is mostly contract based. If perm job easier to terminate but that is hardly the case for my line of work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Find a temp/part-time job and proceed with any subsequent SPO interviews.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm hoping that I could make it for the early 2016 (Jan-Mar) intake but that is wishful thinking. Doubt anyone here actually manage to secure an intake 3-4 months after their date of application.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should have really applied earlier man :(</p>

              <p>Hi abcandxyz,</p>
              <p>The Panel interview is like any other interview, with about 5-7 members in the panel.</p>
              <p>Questions are pretty basic but depending on your response there could be "sub-questions" and also scenario based questions.</p>
              <p>Its tough to get a read from the Panel's reaction, some will make eye-contact and nod or acknowledge while others may just have a poker-face. Just try to stay calm and be honest with your response.</p>
              <p>Examples:</p>
              <p>- tell me about yourself, why do you want to join the SPF, how much do you know about the SPF</p>
              <p>- strengths and weaknesses, challenges you or SPF may face, examples of scenarios where you showcased leadership qualities</p>
              <p>If you read up earlier posts you should be able to find some more information on Panel interviews..hope this helps..</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Good Luck...Cheers !!! </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>@mindthegap I think the medical expires after 6 months, so it should still work if they offer you by end of this month. Don't sian lah, I believe the wait is ending for you! Prepare for HTA! Anyone else who has completed medical and is waiting for offer?</p>

              <p>@Vin^K your board interview was during May right? Have you submitted all documents? For example degree certificate if you're a fresh grad. Anyway they might call to verify your notice period soon Cuz there's an intake in mid-dec. All the best!</p>
              <p>@maur as long as you can justify your career switch then it shouldn't be a problem. I would think it's better than continuing to work at somewhere you feel out of place. Besides, low 30s is still quite young! Good luck!</p>

              <p>@Exvinix Congrats! The clinical interview is the most relaxing selection round but also the longest. It was more like casual chit-chatting than an interview, mine was almost 2 hours long. They will repeat some or most questions from AD, and also ask you to elaborate your input during SA. For example, the essay you did and/or the most difficult decision you made recently. For most part of the interview, the officer is interested to get to know you better so there really isn't much you could prepare. Just be honest with the answers and let them know who you are. The officer will ask general questions about your family, education, work experience (if any) and how you cope with stress. I was also informed that they usually will not filter candidates in the clinical interview, so don't be too nervous about it. Hope this helps! :)</p>

              <p>@jckl Yea i think my board interview was around the May/June period, it's been awhile..</p>
              <p>Yup i've submitted all documents and also received the call verifying my current employment status and notice period..</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">@Evinix Yea the clinical interview is pretty much a chit-chat session with the psychologist. Just to get to know you better. It's not a pass/fail stage but I believe the information you provide will be shared to the panel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Good Luck to all applicants !!!</span></p>

              <p>@Mindthegap Haha..yea it is quite a wait..guess they are pooling the various groups to create the respective intakes..</p>
              <p>I believe there were a few guys/gals (fresh grads) who did the Panel interview at the same time as myself but they have already gotten the offer call; think it was for the Oct/Nov batch..</p>
              <p>So I guess they have their reasons for holding the applications for extended durations.. </p>

              <p>I failed my first attempt in February also at the AD dialogue Stage.</p>
              <p>This is my second attempt and I cleared my AD dialogue on 9 Nov 2015. Based on my experience, during the AD interview, they are really focusing on why are you interested in joining the police force ?</p>
              <p>The questions that were posed to me during the session.</p>
              <p><br>1) Tell me about yourself</p>
              <p>2) Why you wanna join the Police Force</p>
              <p>3) How can SPF improve</p>
              <p>4) What is your Leadership Style</p>
              <p>5) Sub question based on my work experience - they ask me how I manage a large pool of security officers at work.</p>
              <p>Whole session lasted less than 15 min. Hope this helps</p>
