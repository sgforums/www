            <div class='col-md body'><p>I know this question has been asked over and over again. I search through the answer mostly the advise is give honest answer in the interview.  But what is the interviewer answer they really want? some say, u might be surprise how they choose? I have a few friends who really wan to become a police officer but. they didnt pass the interview, and some join the police force juz because they dont know wad they wan to work as. and they got in. I already submitted my Application online. now awaiting for the reply. previously My national service is in SPF.  the reason why until now then I join is because I juz got my NTC-2. Really hope to join the regulars and do something meaningful and challenging. So hope some regulars in here can share some tips for the interview. will really appreaciate that. Thanks in advance</p></div>

              <p>Actually, during the interview just show and answer with confident will do... Your education level results will also play some part of it... If possible try upgrade before sign on... You had the advance as your NS was with SPF so i think this can be consider experience and they are in need of manpower due to the resign rate...</p>
              <p>High chance of getting in... Good luck...</p>

              <p>There are some dreamers who really really want to become police officers. These are usually weeded out during the interview.</p>
              <p>When they call you up for the interview, it only means you met the qualifying requirements.</p>
              <p>During the interview they assess you. This is where you show yourself.</p>
              <p>You must be well groomed for the interview.</p>
              <p>Your entry into the interview room is crucial. Your confidence shown in those first few seconds will carry a lot of marks. The rest of the interview will be routine for the interviewers, you only need to answer carefully and intelligently. Saying things like your previous employer sucks, (even if it is true) is not good for you. Say they don't provide what you are looking for, i.e advancement in life.</p>
              <p>What do you think of rapist? Don't say you hate them. Say the crime is terrible, and that society needs to be protected against them. Think first, don't answer straight from the cuff.</p>

              <p>As for the interview part , u need to be well prepare 1st.</p>
              <p>Talk with confident and try to know more abt the policing work and shift hours.</p>
              <p>When u are speaking to the interviewer , maintain eye contact and try not to pause ur speech.<br>Cox I did got nervous during the interview and pause my speech during the start of the interview.</p>
              <p>1 of the interviewer actually gave me chance and told me not to pause during the speech.</p>
              <p>And throughout the whole interview process , I tried to talk as much as I could and not pausing my speech.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And since u only hab ntc2 cert , be prepare for question like "are u intending to further ur studies?"</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>well, basically just be sincere. tell them what you know about the job [if you have friends in the spf you could ask them more], what you expect from the job, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since you have already completed NS in the spf, you could talk about that too.</p>

              <p>haha. no worries mate, that was the last one. if you get the letter making an appointment for the checkup, then you have one foot into the spf already. the test shouldn't be too far away from your interview date, but you might need to wait quite a bit for the results though. haha.</p>
              <p>here's wishing you all the best mate. i can only hope you have no regrets should you be accepted. haha. =p</p>

              <p>I see. no lah. from what I know, just one panel interview. you start off with the preliminary assessment, followed by panel interview, and then the medical checkup.</p>
              <p>I solely and sincerely affirm that everything I say be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Well, to the best of my knowledge anyway. Haha.</p>
              <p>I'm glad you feel that you won't regret. It's going to be a testing time though, from putting up with stuff during your training, to putting up with stuff when you're out on the streets [should you end up being an NPCO].</p>
