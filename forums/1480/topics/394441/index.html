              <p>My friend in now under the police investigation for the incident which is insult to modesty but is an accident...I know he is the honest and super hardworking friend who been push himself to the limit/overwork during this period and make a mistake to take one matter into his own hand when it is not his job scope.</p>
              <p>Here, at his workplace at 5:50pm something, he found 2 boys abuse water in male toilet, and he want to report them to security guard for misused of water and when he demand the boy to turn off water, neither of them comply. Here a mistake is that it not his job scope to turn off the water, but he decided to take this matter into his own hand and because it was late, while nobody else around, and not to get himself wet, he made illogical decision to undress himself, fully, so that he can safely turn off, the water which was actually spreading at the door at full blast. He also note that he was sick, so doesn't want to make himself worse in condition. He assumed the cleaner have left and he is an earth lover, of course.</p>
              <p>As he fully undress, and about to go into the male toilet from outside, a lady came in and was shock to see him, therefore she report to the police straight away, but worse is that the 2 boys is missing, she didn't saw them and she don't believe that he was trying to be helpful. Howeve, they know each other and other colleagues never believe that my friend would indecently expose to her as he is someone whom everyone can trust, even when the new boss announced it to everyone. No one believe.</p>
              <p>In this scenario, I want to know will my friend go to court and jail if the police don't believe his story and may NOT find any albi? Will it affect his future employment?</p>
              <p>Will the good testimonials from his colleague include the ex-boss be help in the court?</p>
              <p>I so worry because he is my buddy and my leader of our advertisement project.</p>

              <p>It seem, they haven't found the boys but the officer still not convience why my friend need to be totally undress, he recently aware it is against the law and will get fine but there are indeed loophole, I afraid there is no alibi to prove if not capture in CCTV. Will this push to the court case? There are indeed deadlock issue but told me that this will drag for a few more weeks, my friend already feel very weary and ill. It was his darkest moment, he cannot support himself and his parent without a stable job now.</p>
              <p>He was not able to make a clear decision during that incident because he too tried, it look very funny to most but it was indeed has happen, the case is not in his favour but I very upset to see him so deject over this big issue.</p>

              <p>1) Since there was a lot of water splashing around, did the lady saw it? Did anyone saw the water splashing out?</p>
              <p>2) 5.50pm is not that late. Tell me what kind of location the toilet was at for your friend to assume the cleaners has left. Bear in mind the location is where children can enter, a public place. </p>
              <p>3) Why didn't he undress inside the toilet? Did he have no chance to remain dry if he enters the toilet?</p>
              <p>4) Apart from a pipe burst, explain to me how the kids configure the toilet to spray water at the entrance such that no one can avoid getting wet when going in. Did they tie the hose down using tape and aim it at the entrance?</p>

              <p>So far your friend have not been served charge yet, right? Most likely he will kena for appearing nude in public under Sec 27A Cap 184 Micellaneous Offences Act.</p>
              <p>The best thing he can do is to engage to a good lawyer to plea for leniency or come out with another superb story lah. If he going to claim trial with the same bodoh storyline, I think the bloody magistrate is going to F&amp;$K him upside down.</p>
