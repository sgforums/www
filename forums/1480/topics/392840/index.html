              <p>This i am not really sure, if you've fufill the requirements i doubt they will reject you. Usually letter or calls will be sent if you're rejected. At the moment, you didn't hear anything meaning you're quite safe.</p>
              <p>For my case, i went last yr 17 dec interview with Board interview, 18 Jan 10 final Board Interview than late feb 10 medical test. Suppose 15 March bond signing than 17 March intake. But according to the officer both dates are postpone to further notice. T.T</p>
              <p>So i believes they are assessing yours than get in touch with you and high chance we will fall to the same intake, since you left only bond signing and intake dates to be given.</p>
              <p>We need to wait for them to contact that's all. Alternatively, you may contact them to check. But usually their answers very short and sweet, "we are still  in processing your application". =P</p>

              <p>Hi guys...</p>
              <p>I signed my bond on 01/03/10, the next day, they called me to say my intake got postponed, supposed to be on 03/03/10. There was an intake on 09/03/10, could have gone in then, but they called and said postponed again. O_O</p>
              <p>They kept saying "my documents are still pending". O_O</p>
              <p>Now, there's another intake on 17/03/10 but I have yet to get any notification from them.</p>
              <p>I don't know when I can get in for my intake. ._.</p>

              <p>I can only tell u that it consist of both IQ and EQ components. Its not very difficult, just answer them accordingly to what you think its right. For the EQ side, theres no right or wrong answers. There are also questions that analyse your personality. So, yea, try your best. Alot of tricky questions though, but thats what it meant to be.. haha</p>

              <p>It depends on which position you applied for, for junior police officer, you will go through a interview with 3 senior officers(one of them should be from the psychology department). They will ask simple and direct questions, so don't need to worry much, just speak through your heart(and speak smart. Dont say anything that will pull down your chance).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the physical assessment, they will take your height and weight, and wants you to take off your shirt and pants to ensure that you have no tattoos on your body. After that, simple body stretching exercises and marching. Thats all i think.</p>
