              <p>Looking at the posting of TS.</p>
              <p>It is very obvious.</p>
              <p>That TS friend has no case against the police.</p>
              <p>And its very obvious.  TS friend is in deeper trouble then TS led the whole lot of us here to believe.</p>
              <p>And on another matter.  TS finally shows that he got no credibility in police investigations, his friends story, or even his own story.</p>
              <p>We are so lucky to be reading here, what a lot of so called 'heroes of the public' thinks and acted on their 'IQ'.</p>
              <p>Police initialled or AGC initialed my backside........TS obviously live in  a imaginery world.</p>

              <p>1) to check the case classification, all he has to do is ask the IO. The IO has nothing to gain by lying to your friend. And if your friend doesn't believe the In-Charge case of the case classification, then tough: there will be nothing left to talk about really. It's like not believing your butcher when he says that the meat he sells you is real meat.</p>
              <p>2) What I mentioned was then if your friend has been called down to assist in investigations, that means proceedings are already underway. What I would like for you to understand that in cases where offences are disclosed and the identity of perpetrators have been established, the Police will be working together with AGC on how to best proceed with the case. This means that the AGC already know that such a case, involving such people, exists. They have been alerted when the case file is opened, and they will similarly be alerted when investigations have been concluded. The Police will make recommendations; it is up to AGC for the final say.</p>
              <p>3) Points three and four only apply if it is indeed a Magistrate's Complaint. But even then, the Magistrate can use his or her discretion to intervene and decide.</p>
              <p>If it is a formal Police-initiated investigation, then the entire matter, by now, is out of the hands of the victim, and most certainly your friend's.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>A lot? How many instances can you cite? Have you actually gone down to perform your own research? Or is it merely hearsay? But I digress.</p>
              <p>If there are instances of alleged abuse, then feel free to report accordingly. If found guilty they will be dealt with accordingly both with internal measures, as well as with the law. Usually both. There are, and will always be bad apples. Everywhere. For any organization, any line of work. These will be dealt with accordingly and thrown off the cart.</p>

              <p>1 policeman went drinking with his friend. When his friend is

              his authority by arresting his friend and say want to charge him
              for making a public nuisance.</p>

              <p><br>Oh.....so you mean, since the policeman went drinking with his friend.  His friend scold and wake up the whole wide world.......is not making a public nuisance of himself lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That only because policeman is a friend and do no action against a person that creates a public nuisance to the world.........is not abusing the police power lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
