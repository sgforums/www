              <p>In essence, TS, I summarize for you:</p>
              <p>who has the final say on the proceedings will depend on two things:</p>
              <p>1) nature and classification of the offence disclosed, and</p>
              <p>2) the type of investigation currently being conducted.</p>
              <p>If it is a Magistrate's Complaint that is being lodged, then the final decision will lie with the complainant .</p>
              <p>If it is a formal Police-initiated investigation, then good luck to your friend. Because in such cases, final decision will lie with AGC.</p>
              <p>But even for Magistrate's Complaints, the Magistrate can use his / her discretion to intervene if he / she deems it necessary.</p>
              <p>And for what it is worth, have you ever heard of this saying when it concerns legal matters?</p>

              <p>The police claims that it is a police-initiated investigation. My friend even call AGC up to check if there is a complain against him.</p>
              <p>AGC says there is no record of any complains against him. Most likely the policeman is lieing to try to scare my friend.</p>

              <p>Ya it is related.</p>
              <p>Actually that person was my friend not me.</p>
              <p>1. Not possible. Because the police can find out the place which the phone line was registered. There is cctv camera at that shop so they can go and check it and see my friend face on that day buying the hi card so they will know he is lieing.</p>
              <p>2. From the way the IO questioned my friend, it is obvious that the IO wants to get him into trouble and not to help him to drop the case. I did not mention what the policeman says in that previous thread which justifies that he was trying to get my friend into trouble..</p>

              <p>1) Did you make a police report you lost your nric?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Tell me about yourself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reasoning 1) IO was trying to give chance to TS, by suggesting
              that TS lost his NRIC and someone used his NRIC to register a phone
              line to send out those SMSes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) IO was trying to establish how 'stupid when bored' the TS is.
              To justify helping to drop the investigation since its such a 'bo
              liao case'.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>another reason to ask if he had lodged the report before, is that if the TS were to say no when the answer is in fact "yes", then it would have affected his credibility as an informant, and as a person.</p>

              <p>yup true. because everything that goes on in that room is bound by the Official Secrets Act. If TS' friend is found to be in possession of the recording, or if he were to broadcast it or let unauthorized people listen to it, then an offence under this act would have already been disclosed.</p>

              <p>that's where you are wrong mate. If your friend has been called to assist in investigations, that means a report has already been filed and proceedings are already underway. And all of such investigations will involve liaison between the Police and the AGC. The only explanation could be that the file itself is still with the Police, to be reverted to AGC when requested.</p>
              <p>And the only difference in Magistrate's Complaints and Police-Initiated investigations is the nature of the commencement of the investigation. Such investigations will only commence if an offence has already been disclosed. So your theory that the person might not be scared if it is a Magistrate's Complaint is totally wrong, because at the end of the day, if your friend is found guilty of any offence, he will be punished accordingly.</p>

              <p>if your friends says no and is found out to be lying, then it kind of tells you how cooperative or reliable he is, isn't he? which would then inevitably affect his credibility, not to mention that of his testimony. giving false information happens when your friend signs the statement, and upon further investigation, it is established that your friend had lied in the statement. then an offence under sec 182 of the penal code would have been disclosed.</p>

              <p>1. How is he suppose to check the classification of the report. Cos he don't believe the policeman.</p>
              <p>2. What I am saying is that tiggerific say that it is a AGC case that is why the police ask my friend down for investigation.</p>
              <p>I am saying that police ask him down for investigation doesn't mean that it is AGC case as even for Magistrate case the police will still ask him down for investigation</p>
              <p>3. That is if the victim wants to bring the case to the magistrate court. if not than it will just be liasion between police and victim.</p>
              <p>4 That means if the victim and police decide not to pursue the case, they can don't inform AGC and there is no need to go to court</p>
