              <p>I have a guy friend who always use his hp to sms girls(most of them he don't know them) and ask them for sex.</p>
              <p>He will say something like "Hi. Want to have sex. I am willing to pay"</p>
              <p>If these girls reports to the police and the number is registered under his name, is this considered as sexual harrassement and can he go to jail?</p>

              <p><br>Its up to him to argue that his intention is not true to his actions. ie the sending of sms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise, its obvious your friends actions is directly linked to his intentions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And his intentions was to ask for sex from random girls which in turns in outraging their modesty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in this event, he insuniated that the females are functioning as prostitutes, by telling the girls he can pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you say leh.  If this blow big, you want to help him pay his fines and sit in jail for him?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This TS is very zai....he always help out stupid policemen in their investigations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So of course his friends might have think he really know a lot of things mah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI, AGC represents the public interest.  If one more female were to show up and lodge a police statement regards to that friend's sms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then AGC can take up to persue actively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if they decide that one girl report only, small matter, just fine the friend can liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if the girl is still not satisfied that this is enough punishment.  Can go ahead and blow it bigger and the AGC will have to go thru this again and fine/jail the friend lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not assume that just because you think AGC says not the girl make decision, you think its safe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly, the decision maker is the complainant and the judge.</p>
