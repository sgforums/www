              <h1>Stink bombs, sticky nets and foam... the new 'less lethal' weapons being tested by police</h1>
              <p>Police could soon be issued with stink bombs to disperse rioters
              and hi-tech glue guns designed to trap fleeing criminals, according to
              a Home Office report.<br> <br> Government scientists are testing a
              range of exotic new 'less lethal technologies' to help frontline police
              officers tackle offenders without using firearms. <br> <br> Gadgets
              undergoing trials include 'sticky nets' which can entangle crooks while
              deliver a powerful electric shock, and low-powered lasers which cause
              severe pain when fired at an offender's skin, but without serious
              injury.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Causing
              a stink: Police officers could be armed with a number of non-lethal
              devices such as stink bombs and pepper ball firing guns</p>
              <p><br>Controversial
              deaths such as the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes - who was
              mistaken for a suicide bomber by Scotland Yard firearms officers - has
              left the Home Office anxious to explore new non-lethal technologies
              which could offer ways of stopping suspects in their tracks. <br><br>Police
              are already issued with batons, Taser electric stun guns and CS spray,
              while firearms officers can fire plastic bullets, but none are seen as
              an effective way to tackle a potential suicide bomber, and there are
              lingering concerns over the possible health effects of Tasers and CS
              spray on some suspects. <br><br>A report from the Home Office
              Scientific Development Branch reveals the variety of technologies which
              have been tested, including powerful 'malodorants' - or stink bombs -
              chemical compounds so foul-smelling that rioters will gag and be forced
              to run away.<br><br>The report notes that malodorants are 'unlikely to prevent a determined assailant' but could be effective for crowd control.<br><br>'Immobiliser
              glue' is another option, with special guns firing 'extremely tacky
              material' up to 30 ft and leaving a suspect helplessly stuck.<br><br>The
              foam, which can stick to any surface it meets, poses a serious risk of
              suffocation if it comes into contact with the mouth however.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Power adhesives: One of the types of glue gun that the Home Office is looking at</p>
              <p>Scientists have also studied 'sticky nets', again fired from special
              guns, which tangle around a suspect and can be coated with sticky
              irritant chemicals, or even an electrical stun device. <br><br>One of
              the most promising technologies is a low powered laser or 'directed
              energy weapons', which can be aimed at an offender's skin, burning the
              outer layers and leaving them in agony, but with no permanent damage.<br><br>The
              report claims such lasers are one of the 'most likely' devices to
              control violent offenders, but are currently took expensive. <br><br>The
              Association of Chief Police Officers said the futuristic gadgets 'could
              in the future provide a capability for UK police,' but some
              rank-and-file officers were unconvinced.</p>
              <p>One officer serving with
              Sussex Police said: 'I'd feel more like Batman than a police officer,
              and I'd probably have more special devices than he did on his utility
              belt.<br><br>'It sounds like they have just gone down to the joke shop to get their ideas. What about sneezing powder or itching powder?'</p>
              <p>Another
              officer described it as 'like Buckaroo' - the family game in which
              players stack lassos, rifles, hats and other items on a mule until it
              gets overloaded and bucks the whole lot off.</p>
              <p>The female
              firearms officer, who didn't want to be named, said: 'Where on earth do
              they get their ideas from? Have they not got enough less-lethal options
              already?</p>
              <p>'They had CS spray and then they wanted us to work
              with pepper spray. They have Tasers and baton rounds and it will get to
              the stage when we are going to be like Buckaroo.'</p>
              <p>A firearms
              instructor sergeant from a Midlands force said the training needed to
              ensure officers were competent in the use of all the gadgets was 'too
              much'.</p>
              <p>He said: 'If you give people every conceivable weapon
              and tactical option there is, then the training need is so great they
              are never actually going to be on the street.'</p>
