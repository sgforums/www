On (3), doubt so, no one is given the the right to harm any other if no danger precedes..<br><br>And (5) heh, if that's the case the number of arrest cases will surely rocket skyhigh since a true martial arts exponent would be able to wield his body alone as a weapon..<br><br>Just my 2 cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
