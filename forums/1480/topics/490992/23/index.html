              <p>Well said. Age is nothing but just a number haha. Anyway I got ask recruitment team and they mention there is no age cap for joining spf. </p>
              <p>What I gathered from here so far is most people have to wait nearly 6mths before they are finally offered the role! That is a freaking long wait omg. </p>
              <p>I really got to submit my application soon. </p>

              <p>Hi @gavintan138 and @Shilin,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will be going for my panel on 6 dec. A little nervous about it cause from what i read, there are people who got rejected at this round despite going through the various stages. What were both of your experiences like at this stage? did they ask alot of situational questions? I'm hoping to be able to be in for the first intake for 2017.</p>

              <p>1 more week and my 6 months wait since my last rejection date will come to an end.</p>
              <p>This should be my 2nd and last application as at 28 yr old, I do not think I have a lot more 6 months to wait.</p>
              <p>I was rejected on 31 May this year, 4 days after my birthday (what a splendid birthday gift) after my Dialogue Session.</p>
              <p>I remember in my Dialogue, the questions asked were, "tell me more about yourselves", "what are the things you know about SPF", "why do I want to change a different career after being in my current job for so long". We were then into the subject of terrorism, and I was caught off guard when the question was: "what are your point of view regarding Minister K Shamugan's speech recently?". It was something that I never watch or read. Then came the 2nd off guard question, "What do you know about SGSecure?". At that time SGSecure was only just launched, and I did not took notice of that. I almost thought it was a mobile application, or something to prevent hackers at that time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Of course I was honest and I did not smoke. Then they asked about my point of views on terrorism. </p>
              <p>I guess I got rejected because I did very badly for my interview. Is not that I did not go unprepared, but I focused on other kind of news, e.g. Benjamin Lim's case, etc.</p>
              <p>How about we try to share any recent current affairs here (especially news on crimes, SPF protocols, speeches made by our ministers, etc) so that if we miss on certain news, we can still be updated here?</p>
              <p>Just a suggestion. Haha.</p>
              <p>Finally, wish all applicants the best in their applications! </p>

It could be in first week of July and in that case, I can't apply in this round already as the dateline for the application is 31 Dec 2016...</p>

              <p>Thanks for info, would give them a call soon, but pretty sure that i would get a template reply from the recruitment hotline. "Oh, all applications go through a very stringent process etc." Don't think its pes status though. Was previously a combat solider in SAF. </p>
              <p>Really turned down many opportunities and offers just for this job. Can't believe they just glanced through my application like this.I've graduated during July, havent commited to a real full time job due to this. Perhaps 3rd times the charm but the wait and being jobless is really killing me.</p>

              <p>Thanks @noel.91, I just dropped them an email to appeal. No point calling the hotline to check since I think all the replies would be the same.</p>
              <p>@DCCS, I think there is a 6 month wait in between after rejection. If it is just the SA part which you haven't reached, you might want to take a look at your resume again to see if it can be improved. Uncommon for them to reject at the SA stage unless there are specific reasons for example, color vision problem etc. You might want to take up a job first cos the wait is going to be very long. If there are offers given to you, can consider to take it first. Can always quit later cos the wait will be at least a year long.</p>

              <p>Thanks all for the replies.Emotionally, Just feels kinda hard to "move on" cos indirectly i'll be mentally giving up on my dream by very likely ending up in a desk job.</p>
              <p>But that being said,The logical me would still get myself to apply for other jobs 1st and get some relevant experience. Like "anyhoow" says, I don't really have alot more 6 months to spare too..I'm somewhat in my mid twenties alr, fresh out of uni and broke af. Work experience and cca records aren't as colourful as ppl my age, my parents nagging aint helping much either.</p>
              <p>Last i heard from some insiders is that their quota has been reached thats why they rejected quickly. Whether its true or not, i'll just have to lie to myself that thats the case for the time being to feel better. Yeah I know its hard getting in, i don't give in easily but what irks me is that im not even given a chance to prove myself. </p>

              <p>Food for thought for some of us here...</p>
              <p>I started thinking to myself: If I am rejected again for the 2nd time, should I go for Direct-Entry Sergeant instead? The chances of getting in that position should be much higher right? If I am truly interested in becoming a policeman, why not start from sergeant and slowly work upwards to inspector since now they combined the track anyway.</p>
              <p>Any comments guys? What are the chances of a uni graduate (a respectable local one) in getting into direct entry sergeant?</p>

Asking on behalf, my friend has 2 previous shop theft records. 1st she was let off with a warning in 2006. 2nd time in 2010 she was fined ard 1k plus. She got caught again recently. She offered to settle but the shop still wanted to pursue the case. She has to meet the IO on 17 Jan 2017. She is unemployed since May 2016 and was unsuccessful in getting jobs. She stole because she was desperate to feed her 7yr old daughter. Husband was also retrenched in March and was unsuccessful in getting jobs. Any advice is deeply appreciated. Serious ones please thank you.</span></p></div>
