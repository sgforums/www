              <p>Hi everyone, for mid career change, are the chances of getting
                  into spf senior officer role equal as those who sign on before
                  their NS or those that sign on straight after they graduate from
                  uni? Early 30s here and still doing my Ict and clearing my ippt. So
                  fitness wise I think I am still good lol</p>
              <p>By the way, anyone here did a mid career change to spf and
                  successfully join the force?</p>
              </div>

              <p>Yes its equal. </p>
              <p>My friend (First class honours) who is born in 1985 just went in HTA and the formula they use to calculate for mid careers is different, where he got an increment from his last drawn. I am born 1987 and awaiting my offer letter :) Hope SPF can match mine too! Only thing different is my friend is from a stat board and I am from the Finance Industry (Pte sector).</p>

              <p>I understand that this thread are for those who applied for
              Senior police officer. However, I would like to ask if anyone knows
              if senior and junior police officers go through the same training
              intake or a different one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also I had been waiting ever since my medical on 22aug :( those
              who emailed them how did y'all went about in your email? Should I
              just enquire on my application or did y'all ask other questions
              too. </p>

              <p>Nopes, different training. the courses are different. DES - Direct Entry Sergeants focuses more on POBC - Police Officer Basic Course and GRF - Ground Response Force modules while for DEI, there are more elements of Command / Investigation modules.</p>
              <p>DEI 9 months training consists of:</p>
              <p>(POBC)</p>
              <p>(NPC GRF)</p>

              <p>It went ok i guess? Interviewers looks tired and bored. Probably cos I was the last few for the batch that day.</p>
              <p>Psychometric test was different from the one i did 4 years ago. Instead of shading, now it is all computerised. No more IQ style questions like patterns/numbers. Now is more of situational on how you choose to handle/logical questions from reading passages. Have to write and elaborate on your past experiences as well. Like what was stressful, your best and worst qualities etc. The whole thing was so draining i slept from 6pm when i got home until this morning. 100+ mcq as well as 15 or so questions you need to elaborate on. Yesterday i received an email on full body pic. Felt so demoralised cos of overweight issue? Am kind of chubby but definitely not obese. Fingers crossed that they are lenient if not i might be rejected just based on that. Sighhh. Ill lose weight if they give me the green light to next round. XD</p>
              <p>If you noticed my timeline, it was 3 months from online application to first round then another 1 month+ to second round. It has been Oct until now and I'm only on round 2 so I can only can ask you to be patient and hang on there. :)</p>

              <p>If you noticed my timeline, it was 3 months from online

              <p>Hello Everyone! Thank you so much for the insights regarding DEI, would never thought I came across this thread.</p>
              <p>I do have a question and have been looking for answers everywhere but I never found one. I  got injured last year playing football resulting in torn ACL (knee ligament). Doctor suggested op but he said that  if I were to be careful, my knee can recover by itself. Recently my knee is getting stronger and I have been exercising regularly, it's going back to normal.</p>
              <p>Question: What are the chances of me getting rejected bu SPF because they can track down the record of me consulting my knee in Hospital, even though i did not go for operation? Will they reject me because they will know that I had torn my ACL? Is there anyone out there with past injuries but have successfully entered SPF? Please help me...</p>
