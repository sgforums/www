              upon course commencement we will be allowed to apply for leave
              (~2 weeks) for reasons like marriage, pre-booked travel plans?
              Currently at SA stage and looking at the average waiting time it
              should be Aug or Sep 2016 to commence training if successful...
              What if already got pre-booked plans for travel in Oct and planning
              to get married next year ah? </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p>You need to inform the manpower officer of your trip beforehand. But most likely, they wont allow you to go on trips after course commerce as you may miss out many important things. If your marriage is after your course, i think should be okay, as you are already deployed.</p>

              <p>No. How they reject is unknown. Local University students have also been rejected immediately upon applying online. Since you've managed to even get through to the first stage SA, just keep calm and do your best. Don't worry about the lower chance of getting offer.</p>
