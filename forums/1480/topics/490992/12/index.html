              <p>Yup, it is quite awkard. Actually i am starting to get cold feet
              to be honest. Wonder if there is any active officers that can share

              <p>I'm currently applying for SPO like you guys. But I did my national service &amp; am currently a VSC with the police force. I share with you abit now. <br><br>Truth be told. Firstly you must ask yourself why are you joining SPF. If ur reasons are iron bowl, $$ or because it's fun. You may not like the atmosphere once you're inside.<br><br>The work life balance isn't great... based on working hours, public holidays and weekends aren't for you since you work shift duties... sometimes when you've taken leave, you can even be called back if there is insufficient manpower or operational duties (SEA games, F1 duty etc etc).<br><br>Being a Police officer, you're in law enforcement. You're going to have to make difficult and tough decisions that members of public will dislike, and you may be hated, shouted at for it. In your entire career, members of public will lodge a complain at you at least 5 times and more while you are doing your duty (Eg. telling them smoking under covered areas is not allowed)<br><br>Government organizations, and SPF especially is a uniformed organization. So there are rules and regulations to follow (Red tape). So, if you dislike bureucracy.. you may find that SPF is quite "slow and inefficient", but this is the culture here to ensure that everything is done by the book (Public scrutiny).</p>
              <p>Oh yes.. please take note movies/ Tv SHOWS and CLIF should NOT be the reasons you want to join.</p>
              <p>So ultimately I think... you must have a good reason you want to join. And that reason will be the thing that pulls you through. Also your family/friends should be supportive that your work schedule is so hectic and any family/friends plan may be cancelled last minute due to work.<br><br>Can't say much here bro. open forum.. you can always ask me in private Whatsapp and I'll answer as best as I can. sorry for the late reply yo. Ytd i was busy</p>

              <p>Hey, definitely not. During the SA, I would only require to attend the first half of the session and exempted from the psychometric test. I also do not require to attend the psychologist interview.</p>
              <p>Just to note, act fast after the 6 months re-application period, if you are you know that this is the path that you want to be in, and don't waste anytime.</p>

              <p>Hey bro. Sorry... not many of us will know if they accept this or not. But they may not be willing to take the risk of hiring you because of all the medical issues that may happen during the line of duty. After all, is there a police officer that has never gotten injured on duty before?</p>

              <p>let's not assume how SPF does their selection. The best way for @Wong Jie Yi to know the answer is to ask HR directly. </p>

I did read up some forums about what PES status t-minors get but not sure if SPF has the same requirements as SAF, and I believe varies for each individual as well. <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But I guess I'll just give it a shot!</span></p></div>
