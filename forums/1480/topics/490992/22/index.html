Den that's all for the day. I will be having an interview on the 4th Nov Friday, just received the SMS, it was pretty quick man.</p></div>

              <p>Hi doraemon,</p>
              <p>The clinical is to understand more of your background, some of the leadership experiences that you have, how do you cope with stress and challenges. Some personal questions would also be asked. They would also asked you to elaborate more on some inputs u wrote during the SA. </p>

              <p>i think it's the same routine; verification of documents, pyschometric test then physical assessment. Then during the physical assessment the person told us after this we all would be having our interview. But they call out our numbers then there's 2 groups going for interview. im not sure bout the rest of the ppl in the hall though. &gt;.&lt;</p>

              <p>Hi to the both of you.. As you may not know, this is a senior police officer intake post (direct entry-inspector), hence the interview process is very different from JPO(direct entry-sergeant). Most of the post that you read here is for SPO which include 5 stages, </p>
              <p>1) Selection Assessment</p>
              <p>2) Dialogue Session</p>
              <p>3) Clincial Interview</p>
              <p>4) Board Interview</p>
              <p>5) Medical</p>
              <p>All this may take up to 6 months or more to process. I believe for JPO's selection process is shorter than SPO, thus you may not need to wait for 6 months to know your result. Again you may want to find a post that is related to your direct entry-sergeant which will be more beneficial to you guys. They will have more knowledges and comments to advise you. </p>
              <p>For the rest who are actually applying for SPO, some advises from me are really show them why u choose police as a career, from what i know they are short of JPO than SPO.</p>
              <p>When i went for SA there are at least 40 applicants, at Dialogue we are left with 20, lastly at board interview (clincial interview is one to one, so i do not know the number of people left) only 7 of us left. I know most of them at board interview because we see each other since SA, so the cut off rate is very high. What the few of us have in common is we are all doing part time job and waiting to get into SO. </p>
              <p>All the best to those who are still applying as a SO!! will try to come online and answer some of your question if i can.. Cheers!!</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, for mid career change, are the chances of getting into spf senior officer role equal as those who sign on before their NS or those that sign on straight after they graduate from uni? Early 30s here and still doing my Ict and clearing my ippt. So fitness wise I think I am still good lol</p>
              <p>By the way, anyone here did a mid career change to spf and successfully join the force?</p>

              <p>Yes, i saw some of the mid career change people at dialogue session. Most of them are in their early 30s too. I am sure SPF will not filter u out just because you are above 30. However, i did not see them during panel interview. So i guess it's really depends on individual. How you answers the questions is really much more important than your age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI, i think SPF maximum age to join SO is 35. So just apply and go for it. </p>
