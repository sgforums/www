              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I get the same feeling as you from time to time but do remember this... in actual reality most jobs out there require serious hours put in especially for younger people like us.

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Do remember that it is actually really hard out there to get a good paying job like SPF. I keep reminding myself that it definitely has better career prospects and pay system compared to what I experienced in my first two and a half year career right after my grad. A non profit driven company will also be easier to work in as we wont be quantified by sales figures. So and so forth... we all have our experiences that make this switch a strong reason.</span></p>

              <p>Hey @jacobtjh! Oh man, same boat huh? Thanks for the positive reply. (:</p>
              <p>I'm strangely not disappointed, maybe it hasn't kicked in yet hahah. I might consider trying out again in the future, but for the moment, I'm gonna go back into searching for other prospects first. There are other places too after all, other than SPF (unless you really really have always dreamt of being a police officer and that is the only career you can imagine for yourself.)</p>
              <p>Are you planning on reapplying again?</p>

              <p>@DennisL is right , out in the market it is very difficult to get a Job which pays you pretty well , good benefits , prospect , development and most importantly Job Security .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My Sister was in BP Oil and Gas Company drawing a high salary of about 8 k , and the bonus is fantastic. However, due to the current falling oil price, her entire department was shut down and she was asked to leave , currently she is unemployed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you look at other industry, many of the jobs are going to be replaced by automation and more people are going to lose their rice bowl. To make thing worst, more FT are coming in to fight for those position in the market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I served my NS with the SPF and I could say that the work itself is really meaningful and along the way you get to learn and see a lot of things which normal people won't get to. There's also better Teamwork in the force compared to private corporation where everyone is trying to step on each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After Graduation , I worked 2 years in the largest security firm in SG in the area of Organizational Development and then move on to my current job in a Hospital as a security executive (currently 4th month at work) . None of these work experience really gives me the kind of motivation and satisfaction to be at work.</p>
              <p>like what they say " More than a Job " . #Truestory lol</p>

              <p>This is right, companies who are profit driven can be really tough to work in despite being in the same security industry because of the different targets and KPIs. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I applied before concurrently with my Police application , got shortlisted but decided to go for SPF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The recruitment process for Senior Prison Officer is very fast about 1 month you will know the result , Total only 3 stages , each stage about 1-2 weeks apart</p>
              <p>1 Selection Assesstion + AD Dialogue Session (Half a day )</p>
              <p>2 Panel Interview</p>
              <p>3 Medical</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my understanding, Senior Prison Officer do not need to work night shift , probably only once in a while to do some duty officer role. The working hours are from 7am - 3pm (Morning ) and 12pm - 8 pm (Afternoon)</p>
              <p>Just an alternative for those for didn't made it for SPF.</p>

              <p>29 feb - psychologist interview</p>
              <p>currently waiting for notice about the panel interview. </p>
              <p>Anybody else the same? And also what kind of questions do they ask at the panel interview? Where do we find out about the policies the spf has rolled out previously?</p>

              <p>For me, in the dialogue session they asked me if i know the recent policies and programmes that the spf has implemented (name a few), discuss if they were useful and fairly implemented.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>For the panel interview, apart from the typical questions. They asked me what I felt the spf could do better. I guess it is something you need to think about before entering the room. It really can go anyway. As for policies, my interview did not go into extreme detail just basic things like what are the challenges they may face or what exactly I think the police force do... I was pretty forthcoming from the start that I am not someone who follows the policing industry extremely closely. So what I know is restricted to what the spf publishes in the media. :) I hope this helps!</p></div>

              <p>For the panel it really depends on what is written on your resume.</p>
              <p>For example , I worked served 2 years in the Police Force for NS, 2 years in CISCO doing training development and 4 months in hospital doing security ops.</p>
              <p>The question i encountered were</p>
              <p>1) What do you feel about the merger of Security Industry Regulatory Department (My NS vocation department) with the Licencing Department to form Police Licencing &amp; Regulatory Department.</p>
              <p>2) Can you describe what is the current security landscape globally and locally.</p>
              <p>3) What are some of these challenges caused by the evolving security landscape</p>
              <p>4) How can you resolve those challenges</p>
              <p>5) How can SPF recruits more talented people other than monetary aspect.</p>
              <p>6) How real is terrorism threat in Singapore</p>
              <p>7) How forgiving will the members of Public be if there is an attack .</p>
              <p>8) How would you handle a difficult boss which is very incompetent and you men are all suffering</p>
              <p>9) Do you think is fair for you to join your current company knowing that you have a pending application with SPF </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so from all these it really depends</p>

              <p>Those for failed , you may want to consider this</p>
              <p>http://careers.pageuppeople.com/688/cwlive/en/job/494562/senior-prison-officer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I applied before concurrently with my Police application , got
              shortlisted but decided to go for SPF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The recruitment process for Senior Prison Officer is very fast
              about 1 month you will know the result , Total only 3 stages , each
              stage about 1-2 weeks apart</p>
              <p>1 Selection Assesstion + AD Dialogue Session (Half a day )</p>
              <p>2 Panel Interview</p>
              <p>3 Medical</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my understanding, Senior Prison Officer do not need to work
              night shift , probably only once in a while to do some duty officer
              role. The working hours are from 7am - 3pm (Morning ) and 12pm - 8
              pm (Afternoon)</p>
              <p>Just an alternative for those for didn't made it for SPF.</p>
