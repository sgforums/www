              <p>KF, Don't worry too much about SA. MCQ questions basically contains questions on situations and how you react to them. After which will be some questions regarding yourselves and family.</p>
              <p>Essay questions come at random. Its a open ended question and you will try to fill in what you can. I think the main thing is that they want to test you on your basic English. Seen on this forum too that sometimes during your dialogue session or Panel interview, they may ask questions from the content of your essay. However, for the essay, just write what you can think of. Don't spend too much time thinking of a correct answer.</p>
              <p>Physical assessment very simple only. Just some simple "exercised" and check if you have any deforms here and there.</p>
              <p>After passing the test, the next thing will be dialogue session. Where 2 interviewers will interview you.</p>

              <p>Thanks all for the replies.Emotionally, Just feels kinda hard to
              "move on" cos indirectly i'll be mentally giving up on my dream by
              very likely ending up in a desk job.</p>
              <p>But that being said,The logical me would still get myself to
              apply for other jobs 1st and get some relevant experience. Like
              "anyhoow" says, I don't really have alot more 6 months to spare
              too..I'm somewhat in my mid twenties alr, fresh out of uni and
              broke af. Work experience and cca records aren't as colourful as
              ppl my age, my parents nagging aint helping much either.</p>
              <p>Last i heard from some insiders is that their quota has been
              reached thats why they rejected quickly. Whether its true or not,
              i'll just have to lie to myself that thats the case for the time
              being to feel better. Yeah I know its hard getting in, i don't give
              in easily but what irks me is that im not even given a chance to
              prove myself. </p>

              <p>I suggest that you look for a job first. Perhaps gain some experience or maybe part time jobs. Try out some volunteering events which enable you to lead a team. These leadership experiences can be put into your Resume. </p>

              <p>Just wondering though,</p>
              <p>Currently pursuing psychology in unisim part time. What is the pay scale like for SPO? Is it dependent on the degree classification? Because on their website, they only mentioned about the range for the different ranks like Inspector and ASP. </p>
              <p>How to know if rank is going to be inspector or ASP? Is it based on honours classifications also? I saw on CNB website that their first class and 2nd upper starting pay is 3.7k though with ASP rank.</p>
              <p>Also, from SPO can choose preferred department? Because I'm highly interested in K9. </p>

              <p>It seems that the structure has changed. Mine was indeed half day, ended about 12pm. I remember last time was psychometric+physical assessment then next round is dialogue. Currently is english essay+physical assessment, next round will be the psychometric+dialogue. English essay questions are at random, different sets of questions are given out. Will update again on my progress..</p>

              <p>Hi guys, may I know if they will consider previous PES status in their selection?</p>
              <p>I was graded PES AL1 during NS, but because of hyperthyroidism, I got downgraded to PES E9L9 for one year. Awaiting PES reassessment in two weeks. Hopefully I can get upgraded to at least a B. </p>
              <p>So for now, I can't even apply yet :(</p>

              <p>Just wondering though,</p>
              <p>Currently pursuing psychology in unisim part time. What is the
              pay scale like for SPO? Is it dependent on the degree
              classification? Because on their website, they only mentioned about
              the range for the different ranks like Inspector and ASP. </p>
              <p>How to know if rank is going to be inspector or ASP? Is it based
              on honours classifications also? I saw on CNB website that their
              first class and 2nd upper starting pay is 3.7k though with ASP
              rank.</p>
              <p>Also, from SPO can choose preferred department? Because I'm
              highly interested in K9. </p>

              <p>you cant choose your department.. First few years up to TL posting its pretty dependent on manpower requirement.</p>

              <p>I will be going for my panel on 6 dec. A little nervous about it
              cause from what i read, there are people who got rejected at this
              round despite going through the various stages. What were both of
              your experiences like at this stage? did they ask alot of
              situational questions? I'm hoping to be able to be in for the first
              intake for 2017.</p>
