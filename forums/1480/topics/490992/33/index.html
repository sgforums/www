              <p>Hey everyone .. been reading the whole thread, and it's been super helpful in providing info on the recruitment process so far. </p>
              <p>I am currently a final-year undergraduate at a local uni, but graduating next year in Aug. </p>
              <p>Just wanna seek opinions from y'all on whether i should start my application soon due to the super long wait time. I'm hesitating because I don't know if it is necessary to graduate first before applying, and whether it will affect my chances if I apply now while still an undergrad. Hope to get some insights from some kind souls man! Will really appreciate it!</p>

              <p>Hi @AD93 - the entire process takes about 6-8 months. You could try applying in late Nov / Dec but the major interview dates might fall on periods when you’re having school/exams. You can postpone them but it will delay the process by a lot (I delayed my SA in April and the next slot I got was in august). You are allowed to give a tentative GPA that you think you will get and then update them with the actual GPA later on when you do graduate. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@maur - I attended the AD recently and they informed us that the starting pay starts from the very first training day (no training allowance etc, just flat out starting pay). With regards to what exactly the pay is, I’m not sure hahah. Still waiting for AD results *cross fingers*</p>

              <p>I too read that in the May period AD’s th AD dialogue component was cancelled (removed from the selection process). However, I just attended the AD (stage 2) on the 19th of September 2017 and there was an AD component. We went through some briefings and uniform measurement then we had the AD which was an interview with two people (one from manpower and the assistant director) after which there is a break for lunch followed by the psychometric test. Entire took from 830-5pm</p>

              <p>Hi @AJ130707, thanks so much for your insights man! I think you're right, seems like there may be clashes with my school's academic calendar. I'll see if i can work something out. (; Btw, what was the pyschometric test like when u took it on 19th Sept? Did you have an essay component afterwards as well?</p>

              <p>@AD93, the essay component was during the first round (SA). So like we had the physical assessment (height and weight, checking of hands for any scars or abnormal joints) then the essay then verification of documents.</p>
              <p>the psychometric test has 2 portions (one that is timed and one that is untimed). The first part is more of your own logical deduction for example they give you a paragraph of text and ask you whether is it possible to infer this from the text (true or false). There’s a couple of other things also but mainly logical questions (no number patterns, or shapes etc). Then the untuned portion is about your own personal traits (eg: are you a worrier?

              <p>the scars that they check for is like those self harm wounds (you know like if you cut your arm that kind). As well as tattoos. Not like those fall down kind of scars.</p>
              <p>the essay topics are manageable (mine was how do you think you leadership experience will prepare you to be an inspector) there are some other questions about spf, current affairs, technology as well.  </p>
