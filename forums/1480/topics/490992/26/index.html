              <p>Let's say I already have a full-time job upon graduation. IF (and only IF), the SPF do give me an offer, how do I go about quitting the job I'm already in? Won't you be breaching the company's contract whatsoever? How do I go about telling my company that I wanna quit because SPF is calling me, hahaha you get what I mean. My dream job is to be a Police Officer and I will do whatever it takes to be one. :D</p>

              <p>Saw your post regarding torn ACL. Get a specialist to certify and confirm that you have fully recovered. If it's certified, I think its fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't worry about breach of contract. The most the company do is deduct your salary. In your resume, put 1 month notice. Perhaps it might help.</p>

              <p>I got my dreaded rejection letter from CNB after 2 months of waiting after the psychometric test...Feeling so demoralised. I was still so happy after making it past the 1st week. Not sure if CNB &amp; SPF does things the same way.</p>

              <p>Sorry to hear that. Hopefully mine won't turn out this way. I am aware that u tried SPF last year. I am just curious, are you a local graduate? </p>
              <p>I did applied for CNB after my SA in SPF but I was rejected a few days later. They didn't slot me for any interview session.</p>

              <p>I graduated with one of the distant learning degrees in SIM. Somehow I keep having this feeling that it's my degree thats giving me problems despite recruiters and ppl here mentioning that there are successful applicants from SIM. Well, maybe they just struck the $10m toto draw. Why else would CNB only wait till 2 months to reject me and SPF not even giving me a chance for the SA. But whatever the cause i'll never find out and theres no point being sour over it.</p>
              <p>I'm sure everyone of us has had this thought in our minds" How does that guy(who you deem somewhat inferior) get this opportunity while i'm stuck here?" Life's unfair suck it up. Whining and self pity gets you nowhere. </p>
              <p>But no matter the cause, we have to come to terms with it. There are many things in life for which we can never have full closure. So all we can do is just do the best with what we have. I'm still grateful for being born in this safe country and being privilleged with good healthcare and education. (I'm sure all of us here are degree holders). Just look at whats happening in the middle east and majority of the southern hemisphere countries.</p>
              <p>It's really has been a depressing past year for me since graduation. Having anticipated this career my whole life and being rejected just like this, meritocracy, tightening headcount or whatever the cause might be. Well, its back to trading days for dollars with uber while waiting for my next application. That being said, I sincerely wish everyone here all the best with their applications. especially those with a true selfless passion and commitment to keep our country safe. Here's a toast to you! </p>

              <p>I just received my email for the first interview on 12 Apr 2017. Anyone else got the same email invitation?</p>
              <p>Can someone with experience please help to let us newbies know what to expect during the first interview and the kind of questions that they expose you to on the written essay test?</p>
              <p>Thanks so much! I'm freaking out already!</p>
