              <p>Feel free to update/correct or add on anything you deem appropriate. Hope it helps thanks (:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Please bring items that you are unsure on the first day of enlistment, nothing will happen to you, they will just seize it and return to you on your first book out but of course, use some common sense, don't expect to bring a parang on first day and think nothing will happen to you. Please do not bring it again or use this excuse as this is only a one-time and first-day thing. Please exercise common sense and prudence as matters like this are of serious nature. Please do not breach it is just not worth it.</p>
