However, don't expect to be automatically upgraded to SO after you got your degree! You have to apply, get endorsed by your supervisor, and attend interview by a interview panel made up of very high ranking officers. Only a small portion of graduate POs who applied get upgraded each year. You also cannot quit the force and apply as a senior officer. You will not be accepted. If your ultimate goal is to become a senior officer, get your degree 1st.</div>
