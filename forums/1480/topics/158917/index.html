            <div class='col-md body'>in prison service, spo means senior prison officer.  as long as u have a degree, u are eligible to apply.  there is an 18-week residential training (academic, ippt, some self defence &amp; restraint techniques).  after that, u will pass out and be posted to one of the many prisons in singapore.<br><br>there are generally two types of work u can do: one is staff work (paper work either in hq or one of the prisons) and the other is operations work (direct supervision of prison inmates).  every year, u are required to pass your ippt. u may also likely be required to work shifts &amp; on phs, but u get time off for that.<br><br>the job is challenging, with the many initiatives and programmes being rolled out to help inmates in their rehabilitation, and would especially be suitable if u like helping people.</div>
