              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just received an sms from spf today. I have applied for the Police Officer position. The system generated message says that I have been invited to a final interview on the 20 July at Police HQ, M tower, HT career centre. Because I have submitted all my documents, I think this time I'll just have to dress formal and head there for the final interview. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this the normal procedure? As I have a friend who went for selection assessment 2 weeks after me, she received a letter for medical check up 1 week after that. I have not received any letter for medical check up and this is the first time I'm hearing from them after going for my selection assessment on the 27 May 2010, with checking of documents, physical assessments, interview with 3 interviewers...</p>
              <p>I'm just wondering why I'm heading for a Final interview instead of medical check up like my friend. </p>
              <p>Kindly advise.</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>to <a href="/users/269109">Arisd</a>: haha. most likely we are in the same batch, i guess. i also waiting for the bond signing. probably we need to wait up to 2-3 months for the bond signing ba. cos there is an intake on 15 july for junior PO. AND WE HAD MISS IT! nv mind, soon will be our turn~~~ :)</p>
              <p>to <a href="/users/268594">Andrachua</a>: actually i also went for the final interview. my other friends also directly went for the medical checkup. then i went to ask my police friends, they told me that some people they perform well during their 1st interview therefore they can directly go for the medical checkup. the final interview is like they give you another chance. but no need to worry so much. my final interview is more like a chat session compare with the 1st interview! be confident! next will be medical checkup!!! :D</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>So long didn't post over here. Been busy with the training..</p>
              <p><a href="/users/268594">Andrachua</a>: for your question i think Sk1 has already replied you. Just go for the final interview. Been yourself, that's the most critical part. I went for 2 interviews which same as you. So no worries..</p>
              <p>Medical checkup will come after the final round of interview. So still, you need to clear that before entering HTA.</p>
              <p>Sk1 and <a href="/users/269109">Arisd</a>: Regular PO's intake is every wednesday at Room 55. But currently, you guys may need to prepare to wait a little longer, as most of them are busy with upcoming SYOG. As mentioned, 2-3mths time.. After SYOG, most prob will resume to normal.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Thanks for the replies all. :)</p>
              <p>I went for my final interview... it went better than the first one. </p>
              <p>My main interviewer was SUPT Koh Wei Keong!! The one who used to host ch8 crime watch... No wonder he looked so familiar. And he looks good. Haha. </p>
              <p>Now I'm waiting for either a reject letter or a medical checkup letter. Hope its the medical check up one. Can't wait to start training if everything goes well :)</p>
              <p>Huh.. 2- 3 months for the next intake? That's quite a while to wait.</p>

              <p>you know what! i got the same interviewer as yours. omg he is freaking handsome, even though he is quite old already. i only remember it after i reach home. haha!</p>
              <p>after medical check up, it will take about 1 month then they will contact you! but now they got SYOG, alot of staff are deploy outside. not sure whether the intake will be affected or not.</p>
              <p>if you are working full-time, and you need at least 1 months notice. your enlistment will be delay, but of course please inform them about it! or else they think you want to withdrawal.</p>
              <p>good luck! :)</p>

              <p>Just went for medical check up last friday!! They took quite fast to reply me.. My final interview was on the 27th, and my medical checkup letter was printed dated 28 july.. and reached my letter box on the 1st aug... and went for it on the 6th august.. so the next letter should be saying that I passed and hopefully can be bond signing?</p>
              <p>Hope there is a chance of intake in sept.. Can't wait to start actually! :)</p>
