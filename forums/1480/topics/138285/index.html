But for selection its not easy as if you dont have proper dip. But if u have good 'O' still got chance.<br><br>If you apply as a PO you need alot of experience before for selection to be upgraded to SO. Well it definately be a few years... for sure. But by than you will only be an inspector and it takes a while to get an ASP.<br><br>- Consider other jobs ba -<br>But than Jia you!</div>

Focus on your studies now and get some fantastic grades. Preferably a First Class Hons in Engrg, Sci, Law, Med, etc. Check with PSD for recognised degrees as well.<br><br>It is not easy to be put up for SO conversion from JO cos it takes time. Fundamentally, how long are you willing to wait for this opportunity as it may never happens in the entire career in SPF. You will need to put up as Acting Inspector (AI) and subsequently been selected to attend the "C" course to move on as Probationary Inspector (PI) .. and eventually be confirmed as Inspector ... and graded as Inspector of Police (I).<br><br>Go get a First Class Hons and be a ASP.<br><br>Good luck!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
