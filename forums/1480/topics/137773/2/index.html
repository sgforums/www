Are you the one who was scoulded actually?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As someone who is (still) in the NPCC as well as having half a foot in the SPF via the VSC, I have heard of comments like this till kingdom come, and it bored me to no end. Lets take it this way. The instructor trainign you is an SPF regular, someone used to training police officer trainees for goodness noes how long. Not every instructor can adapt that easily practically overnight when suddenly tasked to take charge of a bunch of (sensitive?) teenagers. Of coz, this is no excuse, and yes, I do agree that this officer could have handled the situation a little better by adapting his style according to the "clients" involved here.<br><br>That said, this is no excuse for cadets to take the opportunity in defending their own wrong-doings by highlighting such flaws. A cadet who continues smiling in the file is obviously asking for a reprimand, and I dont think this cadet is some secondary one kiddy who dosent noe basic expectations of drill. The NPCC may have internal guidelines frowning upon capital punishment in general, as well as the use of profanity in any circumstance, but does this apply to external instructors? Not neccesarily. These instructors owe you nothing. They are not there to conduct their duties according to your expections. They do it according to their sense of professionalism, and what they deem as the best way to get their message across and to meet collective objectives.<br><br>Lets face it. This world isnt going to be governed by rules which forbid insults. Learn to accept them and handle them, something which seems to be diminishing along with the way current educational values are being moulded. I can see that some folks above seem to agree with me on this one?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
