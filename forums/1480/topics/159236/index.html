Would advise you to heed the mata up there's advice and get his particulars, the division, and the IO's name (investigating officer). There is also usually a contact number of the IO and a case number, so get that too so that you can call him up yourself and quote it. No number is ok...just the IC of your friend will do also lah.<br><br>He has no reason to be reluctant to tell this to you, since he is asking for your favour, and you can take it as your personal right to enquire before parting with your money. Please do be careful and be completely sure about his criminal case before investing a cent. From the sound of it, this case dosent sound very normal, for why would a normal person tell another to invest and run his company if this person ends up running to this forum and asks us such questions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
