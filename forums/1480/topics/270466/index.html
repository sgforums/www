            <div class='col-md body'>Dun tailor make until it restricted your movement.<br>As long as you are comfortable and look smart on it, shouldn't be any problem lah.<br>If too tight, later when you need to chase suspect.

            <div class='col-md body'>I know the answer to your question. The reason for the officers wearing the tight pants is because that regulars get access to a special police tailor when u pass out if you choose not to wear the standard issue. So some choose it lah, coz they like it tight!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Then your uniform would be tailor-made lo. Unlike those pants that they issue in HTA, which for me the leg is SO not tight. Guess too tight also i would have problem in the SOC.</div>

Guess too tight also i would have problem in the SOC. </div></blockquote>Some corrections:<br><br>Uniforms issued in HTA tend to be slightly larger for the sake of convenience then anythng on the part of the logistics company. Its far better to issue an oversized uniform than an undersized one for obvious reasons. Too big? Go alter yourself loh. Too small and you have to change one.<br><br>I do notice trainees with varying "tightness", so I doubt there are actual rules against alterations or you insisting on getting a more fitting set in the first instance. A fair number of officers would do alterations soon after leaving HTA, be they regulars of NSFs.<br><br>The tailor shop, be it the official or unofficial one, can be rather inconsistent when it comes to "tightness". I have had several tailored uniforms which had to be rejected outright for being far too tight for wear, despite no changes in my size, and with me not uttering a word on my preferences during measurement. It depends on luck, but you can reduce the suspense somewhat by telling them your preferences.<br><br>And one final and probably most relevant point: the majority of tight uniform cases are actually a natural result of mass gain. Yeap, do expect to gain some weight after the HTA phase, especially if you are an NPCO. You are entitled to new sets of uniforms per year, but not all officers are bothered to get them. Some choose to wear their uniform for years and years irregardless of their body size. My preferred set of uniform is almost 6 years old, for example, through thick and thin!</div>
