            <div class='col-md body'>Arming of British police hasnt really changed since 9/11.<br><br>They have differing armouries depending on region or constabulary.<br><br>While the standard street policeman/woman will not be armed, there are a fair amount of Firearms Officers.<br><br>The specialist Firearms Officers routinely train with the SAS, and even within the London region there will be weapon variations between local units [ie. Thames / River police and Met / SO19 / Anti-terrorist branch].<br>Within the Met, so19 train D/RPG's, AS, SB, and others [bodyguards, air marshals].<br><br>Weapons spotted have been the standard MP5 variants [LE variant with SA only and 10 rnd mags, as well as standard models], Glock's [usually 17], Browning [phased out], Sig's, AUG LE variants and G36's [both carbine and rifle variants]. MP5K is also used.<br>Marksmen have been seen with the AI [incidently recently saved from receivership] L96's.<br>The Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Model 10 revolver is still issued [usually only Special Branch].<br>[LE variants are all usually semi-auto only, with low capacity magazines]<br><br>I say they havent changed much since 9/11 mainly because people forget that the British Isles has lived through terrorism before, for 30-40 years during the Irish troubles [which are not yet over] -  a fact that seems to have been forgotten by alot of people [perhaps most of all by Americans..] - but has armed the British services with probably more active experience than anyone else in the world [indeed they are often asked overseas to lend their experience to others combatting terrorism].<br><br>As for actual shooting, police tend to be trained for centre of body mass shots and not using anything that would likely go beyond the targets body..<br>[depending on situation obviously]<br><br>[the police actually also offer training to certain sectors of the public, but its pretty expensive] - and the preferred weapons are the mp5 and the glock.<br>Taser's are now also employed.<br><br>While not strictly police, the MOD police have been issued the H&amp;K MP7.<br></div>
