Holders of a 2Upp Hons degree and above from a recognised univeristy will be Assistant Superintendent (ASP) while those with other degrees will be Inspector (INSP).<br><br>Interesting thing to note is that while in the SAF and SCDF, other ranks will only salute ranks of commissioned officers for SAF ( 2LT and above )and senior officers of  ranks LTA and above for SCDF, in the police force, a Station Inspector ( SI) is warranted a salute from the junior ranks. This SI rank is something like a warrant officer.<br><br></div>

This is in preperation for the first tour of duty of the newly passed out senior officer.<br><br>As for the OCT course, well, I'm also not in a position to provide much info for I wasn't an OCT before. According to my OCT friends, they go through OBS course but not overseas training.<br><br>Regular Senior Officer Trainees wear silver strips not silver bars. I use the word 'strip' to differentiate between that of what you see of 2LT( normally you call bar). It's like longer and it goes through the whole empaulette?<br><br>I don't have a picture of it to show you so hope that you can picture it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
