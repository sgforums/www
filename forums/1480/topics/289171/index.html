            <div class='col-md body'><strong>COPIED AND PASTED FROM A MASS EMAIL I RECEIVED.</strong><br><br>http://www.spf.gov.sg/mic/2007/071018_supcourtphonescam.htm<br><br>24/10/2007.About noon time, there is an incoming call to my office<br><br>direct line. When I pick up the call, it was a voice recorded message<br><br>that said, 'You have a message from the Supreme Court. Press 9 to<br><br>listen to the message.' I pressed 9 and it was transferred to an<br><br>operator that answered by saying, 'Supreme Court reception, can I help<br><br>you?' I told her I received a voice message from Supreme Court telling<br><br>me to press 9 to listen to that message. She proceeds to ask me for my<br><br>name and I/C number. So I told her and it sounded like as it she is<br><br>keying in and paused awhile and told me I had a notice from Supreme<br><br>Court with a charge of working with 'Ah long' (Illegal Loan sharks) to<br><br>open 2 bank accounts for them and the Supreme Court had already sent<br><br>me Court summon letter to me.  I was so shocked and told her I did not<br><br>know any loan sharks and I will never do that and I did not receive<br><br>any letter from Court at all. She told me for that I'm one of the<br><br>person who is involved in this illegal act and if I want to verify my<br><br>case, she would get the CID police in charge of this case to call me.<br><br>In less than a few minutes, I received a call from someone who claimed<br><br>to be a CID officer looking for me. I answered him I am the person<br><br>he's looking for. He told me that on such a date, the police had<br><br>cracked down and napped a 'ah long' (Illegal Loan Sharks) and in his<br><br>house, they found a name list containing several bank accounts open by<br><br>a group of people and I happen to be one of them. I was so socked and<br><br>told him that I never would do such a thing and I do not know any ah<br><br>long or loan sharks at all. He then challenge me and told me, 'do you<br><br>want to see the evident we got?' I told him, 'Yes I would like to come<br><br>down to your police office to see it because I did not do that.' I<br><br>then asked him to give me the address, which department he is from and<br><br>his name so that I can go down to see him. He gave me his name is<br><br>Officer Khoo Boon Hui at Police HQ. CID Tower . Blk C, level 5. His<br><br>office number is 6435 0000. However he quickly change the subject and<br><br>ask me a few questions to pretend to be investigating me. He asked me<br><br>have I lost my I/C, Bank account book? I answered No. He then asked me<br><br>did I let anyone photocopied my I/C or Bank account book? I thought<br><br>for a while and answered him I did a few months back at DBS Bank when<br><br>I thought of opening a Investment Account.  He then told me that it<br><br>could be due to corruption, the bank officer may have sold my data to<br><br>the Ah long (loan shark) in return for some cash.<br><br>He told me since from his investigation he assume I'm innocent and one of those whose<br><br>I/C and bank data the ah long (loan shark) obtained from corrupt bank<br><br>officers to make false ID and bank document to open bank account, he<br><br>would fax my case to a Supreme Court office to further investigate and<br><br>present my case before the Judge. As such there is no need to go down<br><br>to see him at the police HQ he said. He told me he will get the<br><br>Supreme Court officer in charge to call me and further arrange how she<br><br>can help me to plead with the Judge together with those innocent<br><br>parties that had been framed. From the voice of that man officer who<br><br>talked to me, I can tell his speaking accents sound like from China .<br><br>My mind was so confused and troubled after hearing him talked to me<br><br>all these things I did not question that at the moment..<br><br>In a while time, a lady called me on my mobile phone saying the 'CID' who had<br><br>earlier on investigated me had called her and told her about my case.<br><br>She would need me to cooperate with her in further investigation. She<br><br>told me that she would need to begin to do a series of questions she<br><br>need me to answer honestly. All my conversation with her will be<br><br>recorded as Court evident. It's so professionally done that you think<br><br>you're really going through a investigation answering those questions<br><br>like did you disclose any of your bank information, documents, ID to<br><br>anyone? Did you loss your passport, ID, bank book, credit card??  At<br><br>the end of the series of questions, she told me that they are working<br><br>together with international police to crack down these illegal ah long<br><br>loan sharks organization that go around corrupt bank officers to sell<br><br>their customer's bank information, photo copied ID document to do fake<br><br>IDs, passports, and open bank accounts for them.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>She told me that right now just because I said I'm innocent it doesn't prove anything.<br><br>She need me to do one last thing. She asked me how many bank account<br><br>do I have and how much money I have in my bank account. She said she<br><br>need me to cooperate with them to check my bank account to see if<br><br>there's any activities transactions that are unusual. She need me to<br><br>go to Bankok Bank at Cecil street to TT my bank account money to this<br><br>'International Police' account to monitor and protect my money for me<br><br>as my bank account is no longer saved as anytime it could be frozen.<br><br>If I am really innocent and has nothing to do with any ah long<br><br>organization, I would cooperate with them to help them catch any party<br><br>that is using my account to wash black money for them. If I don't<br><br>cooperate with them to TT my money then it is clear to them that I<br><br>have something to do with ah long organization and she shall turn me<br><br>over to the Judge straight away to pled me guilty and sentence me. It<br><br>was under so much confusion and fear that they succeed to con people<br><br>to TT money to this unknown 'International police officer' said to be<br><br>someone who will monitor any suspicious transactions, dealing and to<br><br>save guard and protect the victim's money. She assured me that if<br><br>after the investigation is over about 2 hours later, after they<br><br>checked my account and found nothing unusual and no black money, that<br><br>international police officer will contact me and will TT the money<br><br>back into my bank account.<br><br>I was really confused and when I kept asking her for any black and white to verify her identity to really<br><br>make sure she is a real officer from Supreme Court that she told me<br><br>her name is officer Hong Mui Ying and I can reach her at this Supreme<br><br>Court telephone number: 63381034. She told me not to hang up and not<br><br>to tell anybody about what I'm about to do so that it will not mess up<br><br>their investigation process. She instructs me to go to 108 Cecil<br><br>Street , BangKok Bank to TT the money. She told me to talk to her when<br><br>I arrived at BangKok Bank then she would disclose to me the details of<br><br>the International Police to whom I am to TT my money to. The following<br><br>is the details she gave me to TT my bank money to when I arrived at<br><br>Bangkok Bank:<br><br>Name of person receiving the money: MOORDOO JAESH<br><br>Account  No: 398-073768-2<br><br>Address: MAESAI<br><br>I almost TT one thousand dollars to this account she gave me to TT my money to. But while I was at the<br><br>counter, something on the inside of me tells me, 'how could you simply<br><br>believe these things she talked to you about? How do you know if she<br><br>really is a Supreme Court officer? You don't even know who this person<br><br>she told you to TT your money to. What if this is a cheat and once you<br><br>TT your money over to this unknown person, you get cheated of your<br><br>money?' So I withhold what I was about to do at that moment and<br><br>started to talk to this 'Supreme Court officer' again on the phone. I<br><br>asked her if I can go down to Supreme Court and look for her to verify<br><br>her identity also with Supreme Court too. She told me she would be<br><br>very busy as she is handling a lot of such cases and may not have time<br><br>to see me. She kept telling me to cooperate with her if I'm really<br><br>innocent and should let them check my money which makes no sense to<br><br>me. Finally I said to her, 'I really want to go down to Supreme Court<br><br>to verify your identity and I don't mind waiting for you at the<br><br>Supreme Court. Should you be busy, I'll wait for you at Supreme Court<br><br>and also want to check with the officer at Supreme Court too if you<br><br>really are an Officer who work there.' She then said, 'ok, you may<br><br>come down to Supreme Court and look for me.'<br><br>After I put down the phone, I went straight to Supreme Court to look for her. To my<br><br>surprise, when I was there at Supreme Court reception counter to ask<br><br>for this lady officer, the receptionist told me that there isn't any<br><br>such lady officer in Supreme Court and I'm not the only person who had<br><br>came down to look for or called to look for these lady officer. Then<br><br>the receptionist took out a recent newspaper and showed me that<br><br>recently a man was cheated of $10,000 also received such call claiming<br><br>to be officer from Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court receptionist then<br><br>asked me for my name and IC number when I was there at Supreme Court<br><br>reception counter to check if there are any real court case or charges<br><br>I have. So I gave him my IC number and Name. After searching through<br><br>the system, he told me that he cannot find any charges or court case<br><br>with me. It was then I realized that I have been conned by those 3<br><br>people who had impersonated to be Supreme Court staff and CID.  Then<br><br>the receptionist told me that it is better for me to go down to a<br><br>police station to do a police report on this and I went down to Kreta<br><br>Ayer NPP to made a police report on the same day 24/10/2007. I hope<br><br>the police would quickly catch these evil cheaters out there trying to<br><br>cheat people of their money. The police officer at Kreta Ayer NPP also<br><br>told me I'm not the only victim of such case. He told me I can go and<br><br>read about this at -</div>
