              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Through the subject, you might think that i will ask about Navy stuffs which is not related to the Police Force, but i would ask another question which is similar but for the Police Force.</p>
              <p>I have been receiving letters from NAVY and airforce asking poly students to join their scheme(Joint Poly-SAF diploma scheme, or whatever) as their servers and receive benefits from them. But i did not care about them due to no interests on their scopes.</p>
              <p>Came to think of that, i have not heard of, or received any this sort of letters from Singapore Police Force. I would be glad if they have this scheme as i have more interests and passion towards being a police officer. Had thought of signing on to SPF upon poly graduation but it is still 1 year + away. My friends suggested me to check out for schemes(or what they thought, a scholarship) from SPF, whereby we will be signed on to SPF while in our study and upon graduation, we will be admitted straight to SPF.</p>
              <p>So, if any kind people here with knowledge about this could tell me more about it, i will appreciate it real much.</p>
              <p>Thanks so much.</p>

              <p>well, unfortunately there is no equivalent scheme in the spf to the army-polytechnic sponsorship.</p>
              <p>you can only apply to join in your final year, to facilitate your application to join once you graduate.</p>

              <p>Nope, i don't really need them to pay for my studies or so, i just hope that i could sign on earlier to SPF so that immediately after i graduate, i can go straight to their training and start my career after that.</p>
              <p>I am still studying, so i dont think that i can apply now according to Tiggerific?</p>

              <p>that is the answer. want to join spf, do it after you graduate. if you really think that there is a scheme, email or call their recruitment hotline. that will be the primary source.</p>
