              <p> Screams were heard and a woman was pronounced dead in <strong>Little India</strong> yesterday.</p>
              <p>Police are now investigating the murder of the 41-year-old <strong>Chinese Malaysian. </strong></p>
              <p>They received a call at about 7.15pm about an injured person in
              a building in Flanders Square, a dead-end street off Petain Road.</p>
              <p>The woman, found lying face up on the ground floor with
              injuries to her upper body, was pronounced dead by paramedics at
              7.25pm. <strong>She was fully clothed.</strong></p>
              <p>The owner of the building discovered the body and informed
              the police. It has not been established whether she lived there.</p>
              <p>The row of three-storey residential units houses mostly
              foreign workers from India, <strong>Bangladesh, China, Thailand and Malaysia. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Malaysian was the third woman found dead last week. Two
              bodies had earlier been discovered in Bukit Batok and Sentosa. </strong></p>
              <p>Last night, the road in front of the buildings in<strong> Flanders
              Square </strong>and the dark walkway behind them were cordoned off by the police
              for at least five hours.</p>
              <p>Eyewitnesses told The Sunday Times that at about 7pm, they
              heard two screams from a woman. One man said he saw a woman, believed
              to be the one found dead later, run in and out of a building shortly
              after.</p>
              <p><strong>Bangladeshi</strong> construction worker Rabiaul Awal, 27, who lives
              with 30 others in another building, said he heard a commotion. He
              looked down from a third-storey window and saw several men running
              along the street.</p>
              <p>'I was scared, so I called my friend. We left the building
              and had dinner elsewhere,' he said. He returned at about 9pm but was
              kept out by the police cordon.</p>
              <p>A Chinese national, who gave his name only as Mr Gong, said
              that several units along the street are known to house brothels.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old supermarket assistant has lived in the area
              for four months and said the street was usually quiet and peaceful,
              except on weekends when foreign workers sat in groups along it.</p>
              <p>'The prostitutes use mainly the back alley. I never see them.
              I never talk to my neighbours. We're all busy with our own lives,' he
              said.</p>
              <p>Another <strong>Chinese national</strong>, a retail assistant who wanted to be
              known only as <strong>Ms Li, 22</strong>, moved into the area four days ago and was
              shocked to learn of the murder.</p>
              <p>'I visited the area with a <strong>local </strong>friend who told me not to
              stay here as he said he did not have a good feeling about this place,'
              she said. She had previously lived in Tiong Bahru.</p>
              <p>'But I was urgently looking for a place. Now I don't know if I dare to stay here anymore.'</p>

              <p>'I visited the area with a <strong>local</strong> friend who
              told me not to stay here as he said he did not have a good feeling
              about this place,' she said. She had previously lived in Tiong
              Bahru.</p>
              <p>'But I was urgently looking for a place. Now I don't know if I
              dare to stay here anymore.'</p>
