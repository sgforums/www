I don't know how SPF works, but the only chance you get to cross over to OCS in the army is in BSLC or ASLC, ie: before you get your 3sg rank.<br><br>I'm not too sure about this, but that only applies for NSF. I knew some dude who signed on with Provost in NP, and was told that he couldnt' cross over to OCS in BMT.<br><br>But do remember, my sources are all hearsay.

Come to think of it, is OCS planning to do the same thing?<br><br>Anyway even if these NSIs join VSC, apparantly they might still be stuck with the same kind of roles as we discussed in the VSC thread.</div>

Correct me if I'm wrong though.. I'm not from SPF.<br><br>However, having spoken to some NS Senior Officers that were once NSPIs, my understanding is that most of them were actually deployed to ground/operational duties during their NSF days.<br><br>I suspect that the policy of putting NSPIs into staff roles came after the reorg/ implementation of the NPC system.</div>
