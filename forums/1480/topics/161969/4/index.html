            <div class='col-md body'>I came to this forum and saw that this page had four pages of replies. Was initially heartened, until I read the contents.<br><br>This is no different from strangers picking fights with each other over someone else's coffin. How very "mature" and "well brought up" indeed, and I am all the more saddened for the deceased.<br><br>vicious, if you believe that VSCs contribute more to national security than specific groups here, then I would certainly love to see you contributing less to this forum and more constructively to society. The level of hypocrisy here is astounding. I wonder how someone could sing praises of an organisation, yet back stab it at the same time without feeling a tinge of remorse.<br><br>Reading comments made above by a fellow VSC member gives me great embarrasement. No wonder VSCs are still having problems intergrating into the force, even if it dates back 60 years, or is part of the Home Team. Nice words...on paper only apparantly. In practise its an entirely different world altogether.<br><br>And yes, if I do have a problem, I would probably call that number you sent to me via PM. But what problem would I have to call you? Tell you to at least behave your age, know the value of humbleness and humility, and give due respect to your peers as much as you wish others to give them to you? Stop assuming that respects comes just by telling others you have touched every weapon on the planet, and has white hair long before others are still swimming in liquid?<br><br>Serious...so what? Do others care?<br><br>So, I dont care who you are, and I dont care who I am either, but please give due respect to this man and would all please quit polluting this thread with this kind of gabbage. Enough is enough.</div>

I will remember the scene of the truck suddenly screaching to a halt inches away from the blinkers, smoking burned rubber tires and all for quite some time.<br><br>Turned out the driver fell asleep and woke up only at the last moment on seeing the blinkers on the patrol cars. Cant imagine whats gonna happen if he continued sleeping...</blockquote>Be thankful your regular is quick enough to screamed at you.  Be thankful that you learnt a lesson from it.<br><br>The roadblock team in question wasn't newbies at this.  They faced this danger every week, per their duty nights.  Don't assume that only you have had fellow patrol mates down and this is a unique experience.<br><br>It may be first and unique to you. Not to us.</div>

Was initially heartened, until I read the contents.<br><br>This is no different from strangers picking fights with each other over someone else's coffin. How very "mature" and "well brought up" indeed, and I am all the more saddened for the deceased.<br><br>vicious, if you believe that VSCs contribute more to national security than specific groups here, then I would certainly love to see you contributing less to this forum and more constructively to society. The level of hypocrisy here is astounding. I wonder how someone could sing praises of an organisation, yet back stab it at the same time without feeling a tinge of remorse.<br><br>Reading comments made above by a fellow VSC member gives me great embarrasement. No wonder VSCs are still having problems intergrating into the force, even if it dates back 60 years, or is part of the Home Team. Nice words...on paper only apparantly. In practise its an entirely different world altogether.<br><br>And yes, if I do have a problem, I would probably call that number you sent to me via PM. But what problem would I have to call you? Tell you to at least behave your age, know the value of humbleness and humility, and give due respect to your peers as much as you wish others to give them to you? Stop assuming that respects comes just by telling others you have touched every weapon on the planet, and has white hair long before others are still swimming in liquid?<br><br>Serious...so what? Do others care?<br><br>So, I dont care who you are, and I dont care who I am either, but please give due respect to this man and would all please quit polluting this thread with this kind of gabbage. Enough is enough.</div></blockquote>Are you privy to the PM I had received from the young men here or you just telling me how much you assumed?<br><br>To behave my age. I have every right to tell you off for being young, immature and definitely with an ego not filled enough with experience but youthful hot air.<br><br>To behave my station, I would tell you. Stop assuming and call and get your facts right before you embaress yourself any further. Especially on the lack of your actual understanding of your training and the realities on the patrols.<br><br>And for one that is meant to be a VSC. YOu certainly arent that concern that VSC are being put down in favour of other HOme Team Units and happily supporting that the other Home Team units are superior then the VSC.<br><br>Since you dont have the heart for the VSC, why waste your time?  So that you can brag to the girls that you hold a warrant card?  You might as well join the other Home Team and contribute more.<br><br>And about me on this forum? You didnt seem to have grasp the notion that it was posted via office hour.  But then.....who knows....maybe you didnt have to work and post in this forum during office hour and can perform more duties during day time.</div>
