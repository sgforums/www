It's partly to help when it comes to paying compliments to the other uniformed organisations as well. Agreed that this is very much " on paper", as in not many people actually follow this.

I'm not too sure about pay strcuture because the SAF always pays it's regulars very well; I believe even than the SPF.<br><br>The equivalent of warrant officers would be the Station Inspectors of the SPF.

My point is that this is only a rough guide .<br><br>Yes certain practices are also different. SIs and above are saluted in the SPF but only commisoned officers of ranks 2LT and are saluted.However, I remember seeing a document on rank equivalent though during my NSF days and therefore I'm believe that there is such a equivalent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> As for it's relevance or not, that's a different topic to be debated on.
