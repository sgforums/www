              <p>Hi, Men &amp; Women in blue. I have some questions about the law which need your expert opinions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Is the taxi driver legally right to with-held your IC while you go and get cash to pay taxi fare due to short of money?</p>
              <p>Similarly is it legally right for the security guard for a private company to ask for your IC to exchange for pass when you go visit their premises.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) What is the procedure for the change of address? Is there any documentary proof required to prove that you are actually staying at this particular address?</p>

              <p>The answer to your first question is... no. It came out in the papers one time, and the spokesperson for taxi companies commented then that taxi drivers are not allowed to detain a passenger's NRIC, bag, handphone, or basically any property, while awaiting for you to go away to get some money to pay for your fare [if you happen to be short of cash].</p>
              <p>In fact, they do not even have to lodge a Police report: all they have to do is report the matter to their taxi companies, as well as LTA. The claiming of the unpaid fares will then be done from there.</p>
              <p>With regards to the private company thing, they do have the right to do so, for a very simple reason:</p>
              <p>it is a private compund, and as such their management already have procedures in place for visitors / non-staff to comply to in order to account for their presence within the premises.</p>
              <p>For your second question, I believe rednano has answered perfectly.</p>

              <p>Basically, security guards are looking after a private premise. Hence, these guards are empowered to detain anyone inside who cannot account for their presence, e.g. visitors who do not have a pass, trespassers, etc.</p>
              <p>With regards to taxi drivers, basically they can detain you if you have committed an offence lah. If not, nothing lor.</p>
