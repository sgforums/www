I remember when I was measuring my uni, I could sort of specify how fitting I want my pants to be? Unless of coz all those folks ask for fitting uniforms.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So anyway, usually the ones issued to us with standard sizes are quite loose-fit right? I was wondering if my pants was unusually loose, but I recon it is a relatively new amendment due to officer's feedback?<br><br>And talking about feedback, actually what to the public tend to think of our uniforms ah? I remember in another thread in another section of this forum, someone was saying that the police uniform is so tight that he can imagine us chasing after criminals in it!</div>

But the information can only be accessed with a password. The palmtop can also double as a phone, and when fitted with a small attachment, turns into a digital camera. If all goes well during the six-month trial, all officers will carry the Hewlett-Packard Jornada 928. The device was developed over six months at a cost of S$1 million.
