              <p>@ViDhya, Chomeisen &amp; yjkeh:</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot, that was really helpful advice. By the way, I've verified that the security studies minor are only open up to those in security-related industries coming next year.</p>
              <p>Is the psychometric test similar to the one taken prior to enlistment @ CMPB?</p>
              <p>I got a phobia towards such tests as I have went for the COMPASS test conducted by RSAF. It was excruciating.</p>

              <p>Shawnteo87, maybe we have met before. </p>
              <p>Fret not, i guess the intake dates are not really fixed. Although it was said in this thread that the next intake date was December, there was one recently. Like what my friend tells me, if you've passed through the medical, the next hardest stage is waiting. hope to see you soon in HTA!</p>

              ShawnTeo: did u state ur notice period before ur medical? Or they called u again to double confirm ur notice period? 
              
              Chev: How did u receive ur medical results via? U mean they called u up and told u that u have passed the medical ah? Cuz for me, they simply said pending management approval.

              <p>Chev, the recent intake was 26nov. Yes man,see u soon in HTA. But I wonder if there's anyone being rejected even after medical report states fit for employment. I don't mind waiting, I'm just worried it is not confirm. Because I feel like quitting my current job and take a rest.haha</p>
              <p>chris, I stated during my panel and hr interview, but they still called me up,and even ask me if I'm still studying or working. Obviously I have graduated. Anyway my medical report is letter mailed to me. And I email to ask on my status he just told me that they will call us up once our application is approved. Never even mention anything about pending management approval. </p>

              <p>hi everyone! hope that someone's reading this thread still! haha. :)</p>
              <p>i'm very interested in a career with the SPF, thinking of applying for senior police officer (since i'm a degree grad). just realised that it's not indicated anywhere about the physical requirements for female police officer, anyone's got any tips on the requirements and how are they gonna test for physical fitness? is it similar to the napha test standards? also, do you guys know if their bmi requirement is strictly below 25?<br><br>haha, i'll have to work on quite a lot of stuff as i havent been training much after my jc days. lol, too happily enjoying life. haha!</p>

              <p>orangsea: There's IPPT once you become an SPO, but there's no NAPFA like test during the selection process. The timings are similar to NAPFA, but run times expectations lower the older you get. If you had Gold and Silver during your pre-university days you should be fine. If you are concerned about keeping up with the PT during training, then go ahead and start training now :)</p>
              <p>Afraid I can't comment on the rest. Haven't applied yet (planning to). Personally worried about how stiff/cracking joints from old injuries might affect my application.</p>
              <p>Have you graduated already, or are you graduating next year? I've been following this thread as well, thinking of getting one going for the 2013 intake, which I'd be applying for.</p>
