              <p>@dvjesyjomh thanks for the advice! i was a bball player in school so gold for napha wasnt much of a problem for me back then (plus, you should have realised the napha standards for girls is kinda... lenient, lol.) i didnt do napha for my jc days coz of my kneecap injury then. tbh i'm not so afriad of the physical fitness test, it's the bmi requirement that i'm not confident of. i've got a higher-than-acceptable bmi since school days and i never bothered about it, i mean, i did well for sports and cleared medical examinations so it didnt appear as an impt problem. now i'm starting to worry that it's gonna restrict me from going into what i want. looks like i've got some work to do, hmmm.<br><br>i've graduated with an oversea's degree (haha, didnt do too well for my a's). actually i'm a little worried that they wouldn't consider my degree as a recognised one even though I've done a check on the aussie gov site and my uni's in the list of the gov recognised ones. if they were to insist that they'd only consider local uni degrees as the 'recognised' ones, i may consider going for the junior post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, can anyone advise on how long does it usually take for them to reply you whether or not you are selected for the 1st round of interview?</p>

              <p>(I wouldn't recommend going for the PO post if you already have a degree.) If the aus govt recognises it, then it shouldn't be a problem. A really easy way of checking, I think, is simply typing the name of your university when you fill in your resume at the careers@gov portal. If it's in the drop down list then I don't see why it wouldn't be recognised. </p>
              <p>Maybe you could drop SPF recruitment a line about your BMI concerns? BMI isn't the best indication of health/fitness anyway (athletes usually have higher BMIs etc.).</p>
              <p>If by 1st round of interview you mean the selection assessment, based on the posts in this forum, they seem to contact people usually within a month to inform them if they've been shortlisted or not. The speed of processing will probably depend on when they manage to schedule each assessment stage i.e. Person A applies 6 weeks before the selection assessment X, Person B applies 4 weeks before the selection assessment X &gt; both are informed 1 week before the selection assessment date. At least, that's how I think it goes. Since you've already graduated, I think you'd be prioritised on the list, as opposed to someone graduating only the 2nd quarter of the year.</p>
              <p>Once the process starts, though, from SA to final interview, <em>shortest</em> duration that will last is a month (. They may have been streamlining their processes the past two years, especially this past year it seems (?). The waiting game based on previous threads seems a right torture.</p>
              <p>(and call me dvjes. I think that's easier to type/remember anyway xD)</p>

              <p>yes my intake is on the 17th of December. From what I heard from recruitment is that the intake period is from 17-31, so people may come in in cluster. </p>

              <p>@dvjes: yep, my uni's in the list over are the career@gov portal and i did quite well for gpa so i really hope they wouldn't put me off the list just because i aint from any of the local uni.</p>
              <p>i've actually talk to a career advisor from spf during some anti-ah long exhibition recently and he mentioned that they are in fact 'hiring all year round' these days, so there isn't a rush to submit my application i guess. i wanted to make sure that i'm at least fit enough before i apply as i've heard previously that re-applying after getting rejected's not that easy. i've tried emailing them about the bmi and physical fitness expectation for female officer just now and they mentioned that they are unable to reveal the requirements (i really don't know why are they so secretive about it! lol.).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh anyway, they've just posted openings for SO position on career@gov so if u think u are ready u can try goin for it! jia you!</p>
