              Hi Choimeisen
              
              It's ok if you don't have your transcript. The recruitment officers will just tell you to submit it when you have them. Anyway your pes status can be obtained from your ns portal. If you served in spf for ns, you have to ask your pns office for your pes status.

              Hi Chomeisen,
              
              I thought it was ok. I did a similar test before so I was more or less expecting something like that. Anyway it's actually ok if you cannot finish the test. I think its more crucial that you get more questions correct. That said, you should have done a majority of the questions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well done choimeisen! Haha the interview is at most 2 to 1 with the AD manpower and another manpower officer. Mine was done with the manpower officer only cos the AD was in a meeting. The actual interview should last only half an hour. The questions for me were focused on my motivations for joining the police, the courses i did and also my experiences. So you can take some time to reflect on them before you attend the interview.</div>

              The interval between stages shouldn't be more than a month, normally 2 to 3 weeks. I believed the application process between ICA and SPF are seperate though they might share the same physchometric assessment results since i remembered that they asked if we had done any such assessment in the past year.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, doubt so. Different venues. The selection test itself will take the whole day at Old PA. The interview itself is done by AD Manpower at NPP. I doubt she will be at Old PA to wait for you. I think the selection process for JO and SO is different. </p></div>
