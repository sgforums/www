              <p>Chris_111, which stage are you at now? I applied previously but was unsuccessful. I gave them a call but they said that they have reopened my file to process again and I can ignore the status on careers@gov. Did anyone else go through something like that too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone know if age limit is an issue with Recruitment? I am 28 this year but I have foreign law enforcement experience.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone!</p>
              <p>Glad to know there is such a thread around with so much info for the SPO.</p>
              <p>I just received a notification for my psychologist interview. Hopefully I will be able to move on to the panel interview soon.</p>
              <p>Looking at the timeline, it seems that the longest wait is always after the medical checkup. Is it possible to be rejected after medical checkup?</p>

              ViDhyA: For panel just try and read up more on how SPF operates and stuffs. They will also ask about urself, quite similar to 2nd round just that there are more people around. They might also ask you stuffs which you mentioned to the psychologist. Just relax and dont be intimidated. They are quite nice actually. 
              
              98168: Nope, Ive no idea. Sorry. I think age isnt an issue thou, and 28 isnt that old as well. Haha.
              
              geckoian: Possible to be rejected after medical checkup. They will check ur blood, and x ray, etc. If you fail any, I think they might reject you. I've heard from my friend that his friend got rejected after medical. 
              
              Chris_111: Hey! I am going in next monday, they called me up yesterday! But they haven tell me when I need to sign bond though...Couldnt call through them after that.

              <p>Chris_111, I was not even called up for a selection assessment for SPF despite being ex-PNS. Been pretty dejected about it. I did apply for Prisons previously and I passed everything and they even made an offer but I rejected it eventually due to personal circumstances.</p>
              <p>Just a personal survey for successful applicants, care to share which secondary/poly/jc/uni you guys went to? Responses would be greatly appreciated. I graduated from Canada (4 years degree - 2nd lower) so I don't see any reason to reject me right off the bat without even calling me up for a selection assessment? I am just hoping for an opportunity so that I can shine in front of the panel.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I intend to join the SPF/CNB in 3-4 years time, but I'm not sure which degree should I take that is helpful in terms of aiding law enforcement agencies. My poly GPA is only 3.1 so I guess my best pick would be UniSIM itself.</p>
              <p>What's the psychometric test about? Is it difficult?</p>
              <p>Please advise.</p>

              Kirayamato100: I would suggest the degree course in SIM on Bsc management and security studies. Maybe you can take a look at it, it will be useful if you choose to join spf in future.
              
              psychometric test is just numerous questions posted to you to answer. More like testing your psychological aspects. Not to worry so much. Just have enough rest before you go for it. 
              
              goodluck !!

              Kirayamoto: I'll recommend you do something you like. It will be a pain if you are taking a degree that is of no interest to you. Also choose a degree that offers honours(some degrees does not offer honours). Ultimately ur salary/rank is peg to ur honours, if you are not worried about ur salary then you don't need to worry about honours. Finally, just make a list of schools u wanna go, check w SPF whether they recognise or not, before you make a choice. 
              
              As of psychometric test, there is no way you can prepare for it except having suffice rest the day before.  
              
              Hope my opinion will be of help to you!

            <div class='col-md body'>Kirayamato100: I think its not wise to take the Bsc management and security studies for your first degree. In the govt sector, only the SPF will recognise it and it will otherwise be useless outside of SPF. Not a good choice if you realise that SPF is not your choice employer after a few years down the road. Also, they are not particular about what you do for your degree and Chomeisen is right that the honours actually matters more.</div>
