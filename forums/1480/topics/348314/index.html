              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p><br>I'm currently in the 2nd year of my degree course and I am super, extremely interested to sign with the SPF as a SPO. I've read the the previous post about the selection test thingy. Today, I happened to open a Police magazine and I realised that the graduating course is very very small. If there is alot of applicants, that means the probability of me getting in is quite slim.</p>
              <p>1) I'm really interested to give the Police Security Command a try and i need to serve as a police officer first before I'm able to give a shot at PSC. I would like like to know how many intake are there in a year. What is the percentage of getting in.</p>
              <p>2) I've served as an Officer in Army and I am EOD (explosive ordnance disposal aka bomb squad for layman term). WIll my chances be higher?</p>

              <p>First, you need to be accepted as a Senior Officer.</p>
              <p>After which, you will serve a mandatory stint in investigation branch in any of the land divisions.</p>
              <p>Once this posting is done, you will be posted to become a supervisor in one of the NPCs. Only after these two postings have been completed can you apply for a post in Police Security Command.</p>
              <p>You don't have to worry about the intakes: Senior Officers get to move around in the organization much, much, much more easily than junior officers. As you approach the end of your supervisor stint, you will be asked to apply for a staff posting. This is where you can apply to go to whichever department you would like, subject to approval of course.</p>
              <p>Also, your background in the SAF will come in handy.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>Well, if you get rejected, you can always apply again. I have seen people who got rejected the first time get in the second time round.</p>
              <p>And yup, SOC is physically taxing. Their IPPT standard tables are also different from the rest.</p>
