              <p>teacher goes back teaching, A disturbs B, cycle continues.</p>
              <p>B feels he has no choice but to summon batman. batman solve the problem, everyone wins.</p>

              <p>You can call for Police, but as been said earlier, how long they take to arrive will depend on the night. They might be engaged in other cases around the area, or there may be plenty of other noise pollution cases.</p>
              <p>Anyway, besides calling for Police, you can also make a Police report. Tell them that you would like them to step in and help in this matter. However, the Police will require your assistance to lay a complaint with the Magistrate at the Subordinate Courts due to the nature of noise pollution offences. One the file is created, the situation will be monitored on a regular basis between the Police and the Courts.</p>
              <p>Another avenue you can go by is by the community mediation centre [CMC]. You can either enquire with them, or ask the Police about the nearest CMC to your house. Once you get the details of this CMC, you can let them know of this matter, and they will see what they can do for you. They will in touch with you, as well as the other party.</p>
              <p>Yet another avenue for expression will be the MP. You can write in, or tell him when he does his house visits, or meet him for his weekly meet-the-people sessions.</p>
              <p>There are many ways to go about the situation. Hope this helps.</p>

                                one elder bro in his NS and one younger sis still in Sec
                                Sch).  Actually, not really from time to time.  It's like
                                once a week, machiam like got quota to meet one, every week must
                                make noise.  When they quarrel, they should very very
                                loud.  I usually have my door closed and windows shut cuz I
                                now live in a corridor unit and need privacy. </p>

              <p>If you report to your NPC, make sure to exaggerate the incident like this</p>

              <p>That will escalate the simple late night loud noise scenario to a someone is going to kill somebody scenario and I am sure the officer will be more than willing to investigate <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I know it works... But you might be charged for filing a false complaint.. This might be a serious offence because there might be others who is more in need of help at the same point of time....</p>
