              <p>Just a heads-up for some of you who might be interested....</p>
              <p>The
                                                      SRA (Singapore Rifle Association) has tentatively confirmed a Basic
                                                      Pistol Course for civilians on Sat &amp; Sun, the 8th &amp; 9th of
                                                      March 2009 at the National Shooting Center which is located at the end
                                                      of Old Choa Chu Kang Road.<br><br>Course fee - $500 plus cost of ammo which you buy from the range and firearm rental. Yup, you can actually rent one there. I will post additional details including cost of ammo and pistol, etc soon. Minimum age limit is 18 as per SRA.<br><br>I
                                                      will be one of the two instructors for the course and the course is
                                                      pretty intensive even for a basic course. It is geared towards those
                                                      who might be in interested in getting into the shooting sports, whether
                                                      casual plinking or dynamic like IPSC (www.ipsc.org) or IDPA
                                                      (www.idpa.com).<br><br>It is open to the public (there might be some
                                                      folks from the SAF) BUT I will provide additional information (as soon
                                                      as I get them) on any additional requirements by SRA for those
                                                      interested. I expect them to open this to their members first but I
                                                      know that non-members are allowed.<br><br>As you know, courses like
                                                      this do not come around very often and the interest for dynamic
                                                      shooting is on the rise; I have noticed new faces in the shooting
                                                      sports over the last year or so.<br><br>Please keep in mind that I am currently travelling so any replies to Qs might be delayed due to the difference in time zones.<br><br>Thanks all.</p>

              This course has nothing to do with TRACOM. It is open to the public in general. TRACOM has a different facility I'm sure.  
              Sorry for the confusion.

              <p>That is funny how some folks would think that CCK is actually ulu. You make it sound as if Singapore is the size of Arizona bro. Well maybe in a way you're right if the idea of being in a car 30 to 45 minutes is long.</p>
              <p>I train mostly in the States and to get to the range that I partly own, I drive 3 hours each way. I drive in morning, train and drive back at the end of the day. Whenever I get back to Singapore, nothing feels like a commute anymore.</p>
              <p>On a separate note, land is scarce in Singapore as we all know and this is the shooting sports after all. For safety, noise and land size required purposes, there's no way the NSC can be anywhere closer. If it was supposed to be an indoor range, that would have been different.</p>

              <p>Hi there, so where can we register for this course? I'm willing to fork out the fees as long as it's in line with IDPA or IPSC ways. Thanks for sorting this out, my buddies and I have always been practical shooting fans and this is one opportunity we can't miss.</p>
              <p>On the other side, any idea how much is the SRA membership?Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>Thanks very much for the support and the interest I am seeing. Here are some additional info that is also now available online at this <a title="SERT BPC" href="http://www.sert-singapore.com.sg//html/sert-sin-courses-BPC.html">LINK</a> .</p>
              <p>1. Rental pistols at NSC/SRA - see link for a list of what's available. Rental of pistol is $40 per day.</p>
              <p>2. It is 2 days only, Sat &amp; Sun BUT it's going to be a pretty
                      demanding 2 days. It is a pretty intensive course. The idea is to get
                      your money's worth
                      on such a course.</p>
              <p>3. Registration is on-going. More info at link provided and below.</p>
              <p>4. SAFRA members? Sorry brother. Don't know about that one. Contact
                      info is provided at the link and below. Please contact Marcus from SRA who is
                      in-charge of the course. His email and phone are both given.</p>
              <p>5. Will it be inline with IPSC or IDPA? It will be the necessary basics
                      that
                      you would require to shoot booth. FYI, I am the Area Coordinator for
                      IDPA, the current regional IDPA Certified Safety Officer Instructor and
                      a 2-gun Master by US standards. That said, we shoot all 3 disciplines;
                      IPSC, IDPA and
                      Tactical 3-gun. Ths course will get you started in the right direction
                      especially when it comes to weapons handling and safety. You are
                      guaranteed to
                      see the difference before and after the course.</p>
              <p>5. For all registration and for any other questions about NSC or SRA, please
                      call Marcus at SRA/NSC at 6790-7284 or you can also email him at <span style="color: #ff0000;">SRA1862 (AT) singnet.com.sg</span></p>
              <p>FYI, the second instructor is an associate of mine who was a former senior
                      firearms and tactics instructor for STAR and the Asst Match Director/Chief
                      Range SO for last year's IDPA at the 2007 SOSC. You are guaranteed to be in
                      good hands.</p>
              <p>Feel free should you have any other Qs and mods, thanks for letting us do this.</p>

              Hi,
              
              Just wondering, whats the extra $500 for? and will such courses be held in the future? or is it a one time course on the 2 days mentioned? BTW are there any slots available? Interested in signing up =)
              
              Cheers

              <p>Roger that brother. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Kenshin, that $500 is the cost of the course itself - total being $830 unless we shoot too much while having too much fun and you end up buying more ammo <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>If this pans out, SRA will probably make this course available again but for now, this is the only one that has been approved. There are still slots so kindly contact Marcus or Raymond at your convenience bro.</p>
              <p>Sorry for the delayed replies folks. I'm attending the SHOT Show in Orlando right now.</p>
