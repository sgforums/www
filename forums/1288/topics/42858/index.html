Really do have much impact in your life too....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Funny thing is ah.. me oso dun remember my dreams well.. and i never try to interpret what my dreams are telling me.. ahhaha.. But i do help others...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But anyway is good to keep a dream journal.. So that next time when it really come true.. you can refer back to what you have dreamt and wrotw it down in your journal.. then maybe from there you can haf a much better view of what is it telling you..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Its a good try and a good start.. Maybe i should do that oso.. ahaha then whenever you wake up from dream.. start to write.. dun wait.. once you wait you tend to forget 90% of the dreams liao.. then it would clear of what's goin on...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Place a pen and book beside your bed.. immediately you wake up froma dream.. try to jot it down ASAP!! dun ever wait for more than 5 mins...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

So that next time when it really come true.. you can refer back to what you have dreamt and wrotw it down in your journal.. then maybe from there you can haf a much better view of what is it telling you..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Its a good try and a good start.. Maybe i should do that oso.. ahaha then whenever you wake up from dream.. start to write.. dun wait.. once you wait you tend to forget 90% of the dreams liao.. then it would clear of what's goin on...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Place a pen and book beside your bed.. immediately you wake up froma dream.. try to jot it down ASAP!! dun ever wait for more than 5 mins...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div></blockquote>tat's at HOF. think zacken the 1 who answer my qn.</div>
