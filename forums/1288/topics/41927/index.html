This dreams are call "Prophetic Dreams"<br><br>Prophetic dreams are a very interesting and hardly explicable phenomenon, the existence of which has been found throughout the history of humanity. It is hard to believe that dreams can foretell the future since the science doesn't provide any appropriate explanation on this issue. Though, it is very possible that having prophetic dreams is connected with our intuition, or so called 'sixth sense'. A lot of examples of prophetic dreams are found in the bible. One of the most well known modern prophetic dreams is the dream of the American president A. Lincoln, who had seen his own funeral two weeks before his assassination.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There are more explanation to it.. but its going to be long.. so i jus leave it out...!! hehee  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Your non-traditional path to success will prove to make you unique and stand out from others. Alternatively, the museum may represent a <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>history of yourself and your past.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ghost</strong></span><br>Some believe that the ghosts in their dreams are real representations of the dead. This is an unlikely explanation of this dream. More likely the ghost is representing a<span style="color: darkred;"><strong>part of you that is unclear and that you do not understand.</strong></span>At times, ghosts represent those things that unattainable or fleeting. Demonic type of ghost images may represent your negative tendencies, unpleasant parts of personality or your "shadow." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In general, ghosts symbolizes <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>aspects of yourself that you fear.</strong></span> This may involve a painful memory, guilt, or some repressed thoughts. You may be afraid of death and dying. Alternatively, ghosts are representative of <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>something that is no longer obtainable or within reach.</strong></span> It indicates a feeling of disconnection from life and society. This dream may be a calling for you to <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>move on and abandon your outdated modes of thinking and behavior.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Toilet</strong></span><br>To see a toilet in your dream, symbolizes a <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>release of emotions or getting rid of something in your life that is useless.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kitchen</strong></span><br>Houses in dreams generally represent the dreamer (dreamer = house). The kitchen is the heart of the house. To see a kitchen in your dream, signifies your <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>need for spiritual nourishment</strong>. </span>It also forewarns that you will be met with <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>some depressing news.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Motorcycle</strong></span><br>To see or ride a motorcycle in your dream, symbolizes your <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>desire for freedom</strong></span> and need for adventure. You may be <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>trying to escape from some situation or some other responsibility in your waking life.</strong></span> A motorcycle is also symbolic of raw sexuality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The points are highlighted..

They usually symbolize <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>our emotional and psychological selves</strong></span>. All of your experiences, stages of development, and parts of your conscious and unconscious life may be represented by that house. The house may be representing issues concerning a particular <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>dilemma in your life</strong>, </span>or it may be more general and comprehensive. Either way, if you pay attention to the details in this dream, you may learn a thing or two about yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Falling</strong></span><br>Dreams of falling usually reflect a <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>feeling of loss of control, your fears and insecurities, and can be a sign of stress, tension and pressures in your current life.</strong></span><br><br>Interpret your dream by considering your primary fears, current difficulties, and situations in your life that seem to be on a downward spiral, especially those situations that seem outside of your control (financial, romantic,etc.). You feel you cannot keep up with your social circle or that you don't measure up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chasing</strong></span><br>To dream that you are being chases, signifies that you are <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>avoiding a situation</strong></span> that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>some form of insecurity.</strong></span>  (possibly your own habits and negative behaviors).<br><br>The pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent a part of yourself. Your own feelings of anger, jealousy, fear, and possibly love, can assume the appearance of something threatening for the dreamer. One may be consumed by their own anger, jealousy, love, or self-destruct behaviour.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I think you are basically feeling very insecure about something.. but somehow you dun wish to think about the insecurity you had and trying to push it away... Its all about your emotions, soul, and well-being of yourself..<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
