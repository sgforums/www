            <div class='col-md body'>Dreaming is one of our most intimate experiences. Every dreams, every night is unique. Our dream world, however confusing, frightening, wonderful or saucily sexy, reveals all our secrets. Every human emotion and experience can be reflected in our dreams. They <strong>mirror our deepest desires, hopes, fears and fantasies</strong>. Our hidden self, the one we try to keep from the outside world, emerges from our subconcious. We see ourselves in the raw, sometimes quite literally! Its this complete exposure that makes our freams so important.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Interpreting dreams can help us understand ourselves and help us solve problems. A dream can warn of potential danger. Things that trouble us frequently crystalize in a dream. Some dreams even predict the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Recent studies show that dreams take place in a real-life time span. Studies also show that it's possible to dream with you eyes open, when brain becomes overloaded with the toxins created by fatigue. In extreme exhaustion, when someone succumbs to the need for sleep, the dream can be cut short by a built-in desire to survive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When we fall alseep each night, a complex series of changes in our consciousness occurs. This period of <strong>Rapid Eye Movement or REM </strong>is when we dream. It happens about 5 times in an 8-hour period. We usually wake up after the last one, and naturally these are the dreams we remember best. There is some evidence that women dream for longer periods than men. Perhaps they simply enjoy their their dreams more!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Sex plays a major part in our dream world because, like hunger and ambition, it's a powerful driving force in our everyday lives. While we're awake, sex is ruled by social conventions, but in our dreams, even the most timid can have explicit and excitingly sexy dreams. That's why very proper people often use filthy language when waking from an anesthetic.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Sex is a significant bodily need, and any unusual or enforced period without it may result in a sexual dream. Frank sexual dreams occur frequently in adolescence and often result in actual organsm. In adults, everyday sexual needs and preoccupations are dealt with indirectly in dreams. If you have a sexual dream, you must ask yourself - is it really due to unfulfilled sexual tension?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Sexy images often express feelings of closeness or intimacy in the dreams. Feelings of control, loos of control, issues of superiority or inferiority, can all be expressed in a sexual dream. So if you dream of a passionate encounter with your boss, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have one!!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Sweet dreams!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Dreams are thought to be part of the world of the unconscious mind. When dreaming, the unconscious mind has access to all of your fears, desires, and inhibitions, and randomly weaves dreams that show you pictures, sounds, feelings and scents. It is believed that dreams give us important information about ourselves and those close to us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
