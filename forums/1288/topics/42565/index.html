            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What is a dream symbol?</strong><br>A dream symbol is an image from the unconscious that is important for you to understand in the present moment. Symbols can be understood subjectively and personal associations can be made to understand the dream's message. However, at times, the objective associations of the dream symbol may be more revealing and meaningful. For example, if dreaming about a ruby you may have personal associations such as: I inherited my grandmother's ruby ring or the ruby is my birth stone. These associations may be important, but if you consider the objective definition of a ruby it may bring you closer to the essence of the dream's message. Thus, a ruby is a precious stone harvested from deep within the earth. Historically, it represents healing and irrepressible light. With these associations, one may conclude that the dream has to do with inner wealth which may be harvested though introspection and that may bring about healing and enlightenment, or that the deepest level of healing is needed in the dreamer's life.<br><br>Each dream symbol may have multiple meanings and can be applied to many aspects of the dreamer's life. Thus, understanding the ruby dream with the use of subjective and personal associations may be meaningful and valuable on one level, but it may also have a wider and deeper meaning when looking at it with objective associations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Dream Symbol of the week: (21st April - 27th April)</strong><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Maze</strong></span></span><br>The maze could represent your current mental outlook. A maze is a frightening and confusing place. If in your dream you are trapped in a maze and are having difficulty getting to the end, then you need to stop and consider your current emotional and psychological status. I don't mean to suggest anything is terribly wrong. Simply speaking, are you often confused and unsure of which way to go? If you are facing many hard decisions this dream is a good indicator that you need to step back and look at the entire picture. Edgar Cayce said that being in a maze in a dream may be symbolic of an "emotionally disorganized" person. At times we are all emotionally disorganized and confused, but admitting this dream's message is a step in the right direction.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Dream Symbols of the week: (29th April - 5th May)</span></strong><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Morning</strong></span></span><br>When you are interpreting a dream, the setting is generally important. It provides clues about the larger and the true meaning of the dream. The morning is a symbol of new beginnings and of purity. It suggests endless possibilities and a unique innocence. The early morning is a time of peace and quiet. It is a perfect time for reflection and is symbolic of the birth of man in Eden. Thus, some consider the morning as a time of blessings and of promise. If the setting of your dream is the morning, then its interpretation should be made in the light of positive aspirations and optimism.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Poverty</strong></span></span><br>Most spiritual paths respect or require material poverty so that spiritual wealth may be acquired. "Blessed are the poor" said Matthew in 5:3. In medieval times they called it a "perfect poverty," where the individual would give up material wealth and seek spiritual development. In Islam, this quest for spiritual development through material poverty is called "faqr." If in real life you are not poor, dreaming that you live in poverty or experiencing great poverty in your dreams may be considered a dream of the contrary or a compensatory dream. Superstition based dream interpretations would say that if you are poor in your dream you will gain material luck in the near future. Dreaming about poverty may be interpreted in the light of what is going on in your daily life (as do most dream interpretations). Thus, if you are on a upward swing and are doing really well financially, you may have a compensatory dream of being poor. This is simply a way by which you obtain psychic balance. However, if you are experiencing financial stress, dreaming of being poor may be a way for you to cope with fear and anxiety that you are unable to cope with directly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
