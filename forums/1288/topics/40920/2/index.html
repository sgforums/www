Characters in your dreams also represent unfinished communication with that person and may continue to appear in your dream until the conflict is resolved. Consider also how you know the people your see in your dreams and whether they not acting like themselves.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Faceless:</strong></span><br>-- To see a faceless figure or person in your dream, indicates that you are still <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">searching for your own identity </span></span>and finding out who you are.  Perhaps you are unsure of how to read people and their emotions. And therefore are expressing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">a desire to know and understand these people</span></span> in a deeper level.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Being Stab:</strong></span><br>-- To dream that you have been stabbed, signifies your struggle with power. You may be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">experiencing feelings of inadequacy and defensiveness.</span></span> Alternatively, you may be feeling betrayed as the popular phrase goes, "being stabbed in the back".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fighting:</strong></span><br>-- It usually symbolizes anger and confusion that comes about in times of change. If nothing is changing in your life, it may be a clue that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">a change is needed </span></span>or that you want to change internally. Dreaming about fighting reflects the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">difficulties you have in balancing your conflicting personality traits</span></span>. If you are watching a fight: you could help other people with your conciliatory words to diffuse the tension between them. But however, for yourself, to see others fighting in your dream, suggests that you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">unwilling to acknowledge your own problems and turmoil</span></span>. You are not taking any <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">responsibility or initiative in trying to resolve issues in your waking life</span></span>.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stabbed Someone</strong>:</span><br>-- To dream that you stab someone, indicates your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">fear of betrayal and your untrusting nature</span></span>.  You may be too much on the defensive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blood:</strong></span><br>-- Seeing no blood indicates that situations in life hasn't been solved. The worst is yet to come.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Hmm... It doesn't seem rather a good sign.. Somemore you dreamt of that twice.. Relationship/conflicts hasn't been really ceased! Like what you told me.. you said this guy you cherished alot.. but in the end it din turn out to be good.. Maybe the dreams is trying to tell you something.. Every dream is connected with our own "reality". Our hidden self, the one we try to kepp from the outside world, emerges from our subconcious mind. They mirror our deepest fears, desires, hopes and fantasies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I higlighted some points.. maybe from there.. you be able to see a clearer picture of your dreams.. and linked it up to the confilcts you have now!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Note: Sorry to reply so late!! </strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
