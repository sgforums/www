The evil one was somehow using me to threathen the other guy.. i dun really understand what they were saying... but i believe the first guy did not agree to do wat the bad guy wanted... i felt a great sadness projected from the first guy...<br>Anyway.. that bad guy stabbed me... at the side of my stomach... in my dream , something told me he wanted to stab me right in the heart... i think he missed...<br>The bad guy then went after the good one....<br>They were in the midst of fighthing... when i see myself standing up and came up from behind the bad guy and killed him... i stabbed him right through his head...<br>He had a suprised look.... and then i'd wake up...<br>The feelings are still very vivid... the happy feeling at first... then the fear and lastly the sorrow...<br>One thing missing was blood... so much stabbing i did not see a drop of blood...<br>And i had this dream twice... both times exactly the same...<br>Is there a meaning to all this?!?!?!</div>
