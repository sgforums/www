But anyway, you had two different dreams.. Dreams are created sometimes when one person is too stress or things that influence them during the day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The x-men show is always advertise on TV and ppl have been toking about it.. even here in the forum.. So my guess is that you tend to dream of it cos of the surrounding.. nothing much on this dream.. maybe you should go watch it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for the second one...<br><br>Friends<br>Our dreams are full of symbolism with their messengers being all different types of people. It is very common to dream about our friends. These are individual that are emotionally valuable to us and we learn about ourselves through them. Dreams are very rarely prophetic, thus whether your dream was good or bad, don't expect it to come true. This dream is more than likely attempting to bring up uncomfortable feelings that you have about yourself or others. (Remember "uncomfortable" does not necessarily mean bad.) Dreams are created by our own thinking processes, our own thoughts (conscious or unconscious) create dreams, thus, the mind that created the dream also knows its meaning!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It also signifies aspects of your personality that you have rejected, but are ready to integrate these rejected part of yourself.  Additionally, this symbol foretells of happy tidings from them and the arrival of good news.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hmm... dont worry that much on your exams.. Its giving stress.. try to relax more.. It tells you that you be receiving good news.. so don't worry too much..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Well, good luck for your exams.. ANd hope you can score well for it!!! Try to sleep early and dun study till so late... And before exasm starts.. Eat some chocolate or sweets.. It does help alittle..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
