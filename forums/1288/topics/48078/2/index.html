However most times you keep silent and would remain independant rather than let someone fuss over you. Seems that everyone around you is very concerned over that point, and they think that you should take more care of yourself...?<br><br>Seems to me that recently, your health or maybe financial situation had taken a plunge... Or perhaps it maybe that you are questioning and losing faith in a situation/ person? By trying to chase the wild dogs away, it'd seem to me that you are trying to "recover"? Perhaps by taking more care of urself, taking a part-time job, or maybe just forcing yourself to stop being suspicious towards the event or person. Yet you seem to be unable to fully convince yourself...?<br><br>You might probably feel that people ard you do not take you seriously or respect your decisions/ coices in life...? Yet you are fiercely independent... So much so that sometimes, it'd seem that you'll push away a helping hand... That at one point, people just stop offering... It also seem that past memories are haunting you, perhaps a past experience that seem to be repeating itself...?<br><br>Your dream also seem to suggest that by not settling for the second-best, you get what you really deserve!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  The best!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Since your bf appeared after ur ex in the dream, but only after you keep rejecting your ex...<br><br>The photos and carcass would signify the past...? probably memories... Which ever way, it would be that a bond is built between u guys  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> By dying within his arms, would signify to me the trust you have in him... Also a death is a new beginning... Perhaps it is telling you that your r/s with ur bf might soon be reaching another level...?[/quote]<br>Try asking yourself wat the symbols in your dream means to you, then try to form your own interpretation.  Your dream may seem absurd or scary, but there is always a hidden message that is up to u to determine...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>paiseh for nagging  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
