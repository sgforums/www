Why do people sometimes have nightmares??   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>A nightmare is a disturbing dream that causes the dreamer to wake up feeling anxious and frightened. Nightmares may a response to real like trauma and situations. These type of nightmares fall under a special category called <span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Nightmares (PSN).</strong></span></span><br><br>Nightmares may also occur becos we have ignored or refused to accept a particular life situation. Research shows that most people who had regular nightmares have had a family history of psychiatric problems, bad drug experiences, people who have contemplated suicide, and/or rocky relationships. Nightmares are indication of fear that need to be acknowledged and confronted. It is a way for our sub-conscious to make up take notice.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To get rid of recurring nightmares requires understanding of your problems and resolving what causes this tension.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now back to your dream!!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pocket</strong></span><br>To see a pocket in your dream, represents <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>hidden talents and undeveloped abilities</strong></span>. You have not utilized your strengths to the fullest potential.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Girl</strong></span><br>To see a girl in your dream, represents your playful, innocent, and childlike nature. Perhaps you have been <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>behaving prematurely</strong>.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Egg</strong></span><br>To see cracked or broken eggs in your dream, denotes that you will suffer from many <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>disappointments and misfortunes</strong></span>. It is indicative of a <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>fragile state in your life and feelings of vulnerability</strong></span>. Alternatively, you may be breaking out of your shell and being comfortable with who you are.<br><br>Eggs represent our captive souls. Therefore, the egg in your dream may very well <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>represent you in the most profound sense</strong></span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Baby</strong></span><br>To dream of a crying baby, is indicative of a part of yourself that is <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>deprived of attention and needs some nurturing</strong>. </span>Alternatively, it represents your <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>unfulfilled goals and a sense of lacking in your life.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blood</strong></span><br>Blood is a symbol of vitality. Seeing a blood in a dream: be careful of other people in different situations. It also represents life, love, and passion as well as disappointments. Some believe that when you see blood in your dream, the <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>distressing situation </strong></span>in your life which is at the root of the dream has <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>come to an end</strong>, </span>and the worst is over. Consider the details and the relationships between of all the symbols in your dream before making an interpretation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>_____________________________________________________<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>School</strong></span><br>To dream that you are in school, signifies feelings of inadequacy and childhood insecurities that have never been resolved. It may relate to <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>anxieties about performance and abilities</strong></span>. You may also be going through a "spiritual learning" experience. Alternatively, a dream that takes place in school may be a <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>metaphor for the lessons that you are learning from your waking life.</strong></span><br><br>Either way, going to school or attending class in a dream is your unconscious reminder that there is a need for new learning and that you may <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>have not learned an important lesson.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't worry too much!! Know what's your problem with you in real-life now.. and try to solve or come up with a solution... Cos if you push all things at the bad of head.. Consciously you wont think abt it.. But when you are alseep the subconscious mind will take over.. ANd then from there it will tell you about the problem you had in your mind that hasn't been solved and transfer it into a dream!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Try not to avoid it.. Acknowledge it!!! Then after that you will have better sleep..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
