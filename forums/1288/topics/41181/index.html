Interpret your dream by considering your primary fears, current difficulties, and situations in your life that seem to be on a downward spiral, especially those situations that seem outside of your control (financial, romantic,etc.). Some people believe that if you keep falling in your dream and don't wake up that you will die at the point of impact. This is absolutely not true. In a falling dream you wake up out of fear and not because of danger of dying. Superstition based dream interpretations say that if you fall a long distance in your dream and get hurt, be prepared for really hard times ahead; but if you fall and are not injured your upsets will be minor and temporary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Dreams of falling usually reflect a feeling of loss of control, your fears and insecurities, and can be a sign of stress, tension and pressures in your current life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>According to biblical interpretations, dreams about falling suggest that man is acting and walking according to his own way of thinking and not those of the Lord.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It could instead symbolize an ending of a different kind. You may be burying relationships, conditions or even emotions that you no longer need and that are no longer conducive to your personal growth. On the other hand, this dream may symbolize the burying of sensitivities and emotions that are too difficult to cope with. It may reflect numbness or a feeling that is the opposite of aliveness, such as depression and emptiness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Maybe for guy A it would jus a crush on him.. And since now you havent met any other guy.. And A is someone who you are interested in.. More or less you will tend to dream of A and hoping that one day you 2 will become an item.. Well.. If you feel that the dream is telling something important see how does it goes first..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For A let nature takes it course.. Like what you have said.. Maybe you would chose soemone else rather than A.. probably.. this guy might appear someday sometime in your life.. so make wise decision.. Don't rush things..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
