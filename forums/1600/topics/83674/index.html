They are disturbing other people.Â’ But instead of admitting their mistakes, they give me that Â‘None of your bloody businessÂ’ craps.  So I pick those children up and smashed their heads against the window.<br><br>Their fcuking parents freak out and tried to protect their bastards.  The mum tried to bite me and the dad tried to hit me.  But they were just too slow, I gave the mum two tight slaps and the dad a punch at his groin.  They were no match for me.  They asked the other passengers for help.  But nobody moved.  I am really not surprise, they deserve it.  Their children were now crawling towards their parent in pain, and the parents were now begging for forgiveness.  By then all my anger have gone, I told them to control their children in the future and alight at the next station.<br><br>I feel so much better, another good deed done.  Parents should really control their children in public area. <span style="color: red;"> Next time, I may really do it</span>.<br><br></div></blockquote>so u did not actually do it? wtf!!! and I was cheering for you and smiling and nodding.</div>
