            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, as some of you may know, I have my so called FishFile thread but that is like all expired now.<br><br>Would be good to have a nice collection under 1 thread where others can contribute too. Some of the features may have been posted before but this is just to collate everything together.<br><br>Remember. It has to be <strong>Fresh</strong> or <strong>Brackish water </strong>fish. No fish found in the ocean please. Thanks<br><br>To start off:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="large"><strong>Vampire Catfish</strong></span></span><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/elindra/Vacir.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/elindra/tn_Vacir.jpg"><br><br>Family:   Trichomycteridae (Pencil or parasitic catfishes)<br><br>Order:   Siluriformes  (catfish)<br><br>Class:   Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes)<br><br>Max. size:   5.0 cm SL (male/unsexed; Ref. 50921)<br><br>Environment:   demersal; freshwater<br><br>Climate:  tropical<br><br>The candirÃº or canero (Vandellia cirrhosa) or Toothpick Fish is a freshwater fish in the group commonly called the catfishes. It is found in the Amazon River and has a reputation among the natives as the most feared fish in its waters, even over the piranha. The species grows only to a size of an inch in length and is eel shaped and translucent, making it almost impossible to see in the water. The candiru is a parasite. It swims into the gill cavities of other fishes, erects a spine to hold itself in place, and feeds on the blood in the gills, earning it a nickname as the "vampire fish of Brazil".<br><br>It is feared by the natives because it is attracted to urine or blood, and if the bather is nude it will swim into an orifice (the anus or vagina, or even in the case of smaller specimens the penis - and perhaps deep into the urethra). It then erects its spine and begins to feed on the blood and body tissue just as it would from the gills of a fish. The candiru is then almost impossible to remove except through an operation. As the fish locates its prey by following the water flow from the gills to its source, urinating while bathing increases the chance of a candiru "homing in" on a human urethra.<br><br>A traditional option is the use of two plants, the Xagua plant (Genipa americana) and the Buitach apple which are inserted (or their extract in the case of tight spaces) into the affected area. These two plants together will kill and then dissolve the fish. More often, infection causes shock and death in the victim before the candirÃº can be removed.<br><br>If anyone is interested, you can follow this link to see the surgical procedure of removing the fish from a human.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Freshwater Electric Eel (Electrophorus electricus)</strong></span></span><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/elindra/ElectricEelWFE_Ap4AAf1.jpg"><br><br>The Electric Eel is an amazing creation of nature. While many fish are able to create an electrical charge to use as Â“radarÂ”, this is one of the few species that can create a charge thatÂ’s strong enough to disable its prey!<br><br>Even though it is eel shaped, the Electric Eel is not a true eel but is more closely related to many of the knifefish that are found in South America.<br><br>Because of their ability to generate a strong electrical charge, this large animal is definitely a candidate for a single species aquarium. They can grow as large as 8 feet long and can weigh as much as 45 pounds although the size attained in an aquarium will be smaller. They are not a particularly active fish so they will not need a tank as large as other species their size would require. If the tank is longer that the fish is and it has plenty of room to turn around, it should suffice but remember that even in captivity, this fish can grow to over 4 or 5 feet.<br><br>Electric Eels are very hardy but avoid specimens that are less than 1 foot in length. For some reason, the smaller ones tend to be weak.<br><br>The Electric Eel dwells in the freshwater rivers of the lower Amazon basin in South America. The rainforest environment provides a diet of smaller freshwater fish, and amphibians.<br><br>Although the Electric Eel is occasionally eaten by local people in the Amazon, it is largely avoided due to its ability to deliver a powerful shock. When the eel is caught in fishermen's nets, the other fish are often found dead due to the shocks from the eel. It has been known to discharge electric shocks up to eight hours after death due to continued activity in the electric organs along the eels tail.<br><br>Another distinguishing feature about the Amazon river habitat is the low concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water. For this reason the eel surfaces frequently, as previously mentioned, to gain sufficient oxygen for respiration. Up to 78% of the total oxygen intake is from the atmosphere, as opposed to the 22% extracted by the gills. Emission of carbon dioxide is done primarily through the skin (81%), but a small amount of C02 is emitted through the mouth (19%)<br><br><strong>Care and Feeding</strong><br>Electric Eels are predatory fish, carnivores that will eat almost any animal thatÂ’s small enough to fit into their mouth. In the wild this mainly includes fish, invertebrates and small mammals. You will probably have to feed them live fish at first but usually they can be trained to eat dead freshwater fish such as defrosted frozen smelt.<br><br><strong>Distribution</strong><br>The Electric Eel is a very common South American fish and is found throughout most of the Amazon and Orinoco basins.<br><br><strong>Size - Weight</strong><br>These fish can get up to 8 feet long (250 cm) and can weigh as much as 45 pounds (20 kg), they are usually smaller in the aquarium reaching only about 4 - 5 feet (125 - 152 cm)..<br><br><strong>Social Behaviors</strong><br>The Electric Eel is not aggressive but due to its method of catching its prey, it is suitable only for a single species aquarium.<br><br><strong>Sexual Differences</strong><br>There are no known external sexual differences.<br><br><strong>Water Region: Top, Middle, Bottom</strong><br>They will spend most of their time resting on the bottom of the aquarium.<br><br><strong>Acceptable Water Conditions</strong><br>The Electric Eel  is not very fussy about Ph or water hardness.<br>Temp: 74-82 F (23 Â– 28Â°C)<br><br><strong>Breeding/Reproduction</strong><br>Has not been bred in captivity.<br><br><strong>References:</strong><br><a href="http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2001/riis/electriceels2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2001/riis/electriceels2.htm</a><br><a href="http://animal-world.com/encyclo/fresh/Eels/ElectricEel.php" rel="nofollow">http://animal-world.com/encyclo/fresh/Eels/ElectricEel.php</a></div>

Live blackworms or small earthworms work well to start with.  Add some feeder white clouds also.  TheyÂ’d probably also enjoy ghost shrimp as they grow.  You can eventually convert them over to frozen brine shrimp and frozen bloodworms.  Some eventually convert to eating flakes or sinking pellets.  Most community fishes will eat all the flakes before the flounders start looking for them.  Flounders have an eating advantage at night<br><br><strong>Temperament: </strong>Very calm, never bothers other fish but is known to be picked on by most species.<br><br><strong>Tankmates:</strong> Feel free to mix these guys with other medium-sized brackish water fishes Â– African butterflies, dragon gobies, African ropefish (if your flounderÂ’s too big to swallow), mollies, and other livebearers (because they like salt also).  Livebearers also provide additional live food periodically.<br><br><strong>Color:</strong> Freshwater flounders try to blend into whateverÂ’s on the bottom.  They can control the size of their various pigment pores to change from dark to light in the greys and browns.  Some develop spots to complete the camouflage.<br><br><strong>Other Comments:</strong> They need good filtration, likes to suck onto the glass and hang out on the bottom, needs sand! if u have gravel along with sand its gotta be rounded so it doesnt cut the flounder's soft belly.<br><br>Like the other flounders, these weird little guys have both eyes on one side of their bodies.  Their left eye migrates to the right side of their bodies.  The left side becomes its whitish underbelly.  They spend all their time lying on their underbellies.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Species Stats</strong></span></span><br><strong>Min.

Found in the Peruvian Amazon (Ref. 6329).<br><br><strong>Care:</strong> Very difficult fish to keep, definitely not for beginners! Monocirrhus polyacanthus are true predators. They are best not accompanied by other fish, although they can be accompanied by diskusfish, angels, and larger Corydoras species. Leaf fish can only be fed live food, juveniles will accept small live food like bloodworms. Older specimens are more picky, and require live fish. They eat approximately their own weight per day, so to keep them properly, you'll need a few tanks in which feeder fish can be bred, or have lot's of money to spend.<br><br>A pair can be kept in an 80 cm aquarium, although the larger the better. The tank should be well planted, especially with plants that have large leaves, like Echinodorus species, in between which the leaf fish loves to hide. They are extremely good at hiding, and it will always take some time before you spot them in the aquarium. A dark soil and some floating plants will be appreciated by the fish, but are no necessity. Some driftwood is definitely recommended!<br><br><strong>Breeding:</strong> At a lower pH(below 6) the fish will spawn in a setup as described in the care section, and if fed well. Up to 300 eggs, which hang by a thread on a leaf, are deposited by the female, and guarded by the male.<br><br>At 25 degrees, the eggs will hatch in 4 days, and the fry are around 5 mm. If fed well, they can reach 3 cm in 3 months.<br><br><strong>Sexual dimorphism: </strong>Recognisable at 4 cm, females display a ovipositor.<br><br><strong>Additional Information: </strong>Do not use guppies as feeder fish! Many guppies are infected with fishtuberculosis, and leaffish are highly susceptible to TBC, and may contract it through the feeder fish.<br><br><strong>Life expectancy:</strong> 8-9 years.<br><br><strong>References:</strong><br><a href="http://www.nscontact.com/catalogue/-nsc-en_60_51_01_390_1_Monocirrhus_polyacanthus_Amazon.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nscontact.com/catalogue/-nsc-en_60_51_01_390_1_Monocirrhus_polyacanthus_Amazon.aspx</a><br><br><a href="http://aquaworld.netfirms.com/Other/Monocirrhus_polyacanthus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://aquaworld.netfirms.com/Other/Monocirrhus_polyacanthus.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/willowdaleaquariumsociety/library/leaf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/willowdaleaquariumsociety/library/leaf.html</a></div>

Between the two species, ATFs can grow to over four - five feet, but in aquariums, less than half to about half of that is expected at the maximum.<br><br>Minimum Tank Size: 125 US gallons - 6' long minimum (the longer, the better!)<br><br>Care: Let's take in mind the enclosure first; because of this fish's strength, speed, and size, a very large tank is important. I've successfully kept a small one in an 80 Gallon, but when he gets larger, he'll need much more room... I would suggest 125 at a bare minimum. The bigger the better. A 240 or more would be reasonable. The reason such a tank is needed is because these fish can seriously hurt themselves by running into the glass if it is too small of an area. Within your large tank, large plants (like swords) and larger-sized tankmates (bottom dwellers - NOT mid-dwellers) are okay, but rocks, sharp objects, and other hard objects are to be left out. A tiger fish can fatally wound itself if running into objects as hard as rocks or as sharp as, i don't know, a sharp rock. This is especially true when they hunt. When attacking its prey, they're likely to charge at it seemingly full force. Whatever is behind it's prey, the tiger fish will most likely run into. Don't under-estimate the power these fish output. Standard lighting, heating and filtration is clearly necessary. Keep a good cover on the top of the tank. These fish are very gutsy jumpers if they need to be. Substrate type is unimportant, as these fish are mid-dwellers. Keep water chemistry in good quality (common sense). Nitrites and nitrates should be an attempted zero, and try to keep pH steady at 7.2 to 7.6. Never forget water changes weekly and clean out any leftover "fish-bits" that the ATF hasn't eaten. It is recommended here and there to keep them in small shoals - 5 minimum.<br><br>Feeding: Guppies, Ghost Shrimp, Rosy Reds... ...etc. Do not dump feeder fish straight in from the store, quarantine them long enough until you can tell they are safe to feed. Some ATF owners have swayed their fish to eat non-live meaty food, but a lot of ATFs will not eat unless their food is "fun" and hard to catch - it seems that they like a challenge, and would get bored eating prepared or frozen foods.<br><br>Sexing: No physical determination.<br><br>Breeding: Unknown in captivity<br><br>Written by Wonderboy from<br><a href="http://www.fishforums.net/index.php?showtopic=134743" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishforums.net/index.php?showtopic=134743</a></div>
