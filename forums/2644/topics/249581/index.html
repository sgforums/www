            <div class='col-md body'>By Paul Rincon<br>Science reporter, BBC News, Preston<br><br>Brown dwarfs are a type of "failed" star<br>A class of "failed" star called a brown dwarf emits beams of radiation that are thousands of times brighter than any released by the Sun.<br><br>The brown dwarfs are behaving like an altogether different and exotic cosmic object called a pulsar.<br><br>Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit a flashing radio signal.<br><br>When the rotating beams sweep Earth, astronomers detect the radio pulse, which has been likened to the rotating beacon of a lighthouse.<br><br>Pulsars are created when a massive star explodes in a supernova and its core collapses into a rapidly spinning neutron star.<br><br>Brown dwarfs, on the other hand, are stellar also-rans which lack the necessary mass to kick-start nuclear fusion reactions in their cores.<br><br>Greg Hallinan from the National University of Ireland in Galway and his colleagues used the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico to observe a very cool, rapidly rotating brown dwarf called TVLM 513-46546.<br><br>40-year-old problem<br><br>A bright flash from the brown dwarf was observed roughly every two hours.<br><br>All the planets with a magnetic field, including Earth, have bright radio emission from their magnetic polar regions.<br><br>Brown dwarfs are thought to generate their emission in a similar way to pulsars. But here, the emission is many times brighter than that from planets. The radio waves are produced above the object's magnetic poles.<br><br>This radio emission requires these brown dwarfs to possess magnetic fields as powerful as those detected at the most magnetically active stars.<br><br>The periodic pulses detected from brown dwarfs are very similar to those observed from pulsars. But the whole system is on a much slower and smaller scale, so it is easier for astronomers to decipher what is going on.<br><br>Link made?<br><br>How pulsars produce their radiation has been a problem in astrophysics for 40 years.<br><br>This is because we have little understanding of how hot, electrified gas, or plasma, behaves in the extreme conditions present at a pulsar.<br><br>Brown dwarfs are now the second class of stellar object known to produce persistent levels of extremely bright, "coherent" radiation.<br><br>Moreover, this radio signal manifests itself as periodic pulses. However, in the case of brown dwarfs, both the source conditions and the emission mechanism are reasonably well understood.<br><br>For some time, scientists have wondered if there were similarities between this type of emission and the periodic radio beams from pulsars. Observations of TVLM 513-46546 could provide the first direct evidence for such a link.<br><br>Dr Hallinan said: "Our research shows that these objects can be fascinating and dynamic systems, and may be the key to unlocking this long-standing mystery of how pulsars produce radio emissions.<br><br>"It looks like brown dwarfs are the missing step between the radio emissions we see generated at Jupiter and those we observe from pulsars".<br><br>The National University of Ireland astrophysicist presented details of his work at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Preston.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42824000/jpg/_42824355_brownd_nui_203.jpg"><br>Brown dwarfs are a type of "failed" star<br><br>The star is unique and I simply love it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Taken from :BBC NEWS <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
