Â“The main mantle is about one meter across and its total length is about eight meters.Â”<br><br>Scientists would take samples from the creature, identified by state parks officials as an Architeuthis, which can grow to more than 33 feet in length and weigh more than 606 pounds. The Tasmanian animal weighed more than 500 pounds, Pemberton said.<br><br>The tentacles had been badly damaged, so the overall length of the animal could not be determined, a Tasmania Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman said. Park rangers had moved the remains from the water.<br><br>Giant squid, once believed to be mythical despite occasional sightings by mariners, feed on fish and other squid. Last year, fishermen off the Falkland Islands caught a complete animal measuring more than 24 feet.<br><br>Scientists believe giant squid usually live at ocean depths of between 660-2,300 feet, relying in part on volleyball-sized eyes, the largest in the animal kingdom.<br><br>Scientists said giant squid gathered along AustraliaÂ’s continental shelf in cold mid-winter waters to feed on Grenadier fish. The squid were in turn hunted by sperm whales migrating north from the Southern Ocean.<br><br>Japanese ocean researchers captured the first ever pictures of a live giant squid in September 2004 off JapanÂ’s Ogasawara Islands at a depth of 2,700 feet.</div>
