Professor Brannstrom said the pregnancies are now at about 120 days, and the pregnancies will last for another 20 days.<br><br>The team will deliver the lambs by Caesarean.<br><br>They also now plan to carry out a womb swap between two ewes.<br><br>The team had previously achieved successful pregnancies after womb transplants in mice.<br><br>When transferring a womb from one person to another, one of the biggest problems would be rejection, especially if that occurred during a pregnancy.<br><br>Peter Bowen-Simpkins, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology said it was very important that the proof of principle was tested in animals before being attempted in humans.<br><br>"They are going the right way about it, instead of racing off to do the work in humans."<br><br>He added that transplant technology in humans had progressed tremendously and it had been shown that certain drugs used to prevent rejection in renal transplants did not harm a baby during pregnancy.<br><br>"There are not a huge amount of women who will need this - either those born without wombs or those who have had to have a hysterectomy.<br><br>"It's quite exciting but I can't see it is something that will become normal procedure within the next 10 years," he said.<br><br>From BBC news <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
