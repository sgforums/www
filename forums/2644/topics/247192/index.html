            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>A single gene could explain much of the size difference between dog breeds, according to a study.<br></strong><br><br>DNA study sheds light on dog size<br>The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) shows the greatest range of body size of any mammal.<br><br>Researchers studied 3,000 dogs from 143 breeds and found small dogs all shared a mutation in a gene that influences size in other animals.<br><br>This form of the gene was almost absent in large dog breeds, an international team reported in Science journal.<br><br>The 14 small dogs in the sample, such as Portugese water dogs, chihuahuas, fox terriers and pomeranians, share a specific sequence of DNA that includes the gene for making a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).<br><br>The scientists also looked at DNA from nine large breeds including Irish wolfhounds, St Bernards and Great Danes.<br><br>The IGF-1 gene has been known to influence size in other organisms, including mice and humans.<br><br>Gene selection<br><br>Dr Carlos Bustamante, a member of the research team from Cornell University in Ithaca, US, said: "It is staggering to think that so many of the small dog breeds came about through selection on the same mutation in the same gene.<br><br>"These results suggest that while there are invariably differences among breeds - even in genes for size - IGF-1 has played an important role in the evolution of many small breeds by being a gene that consistently affects body size."<br><br>The new research suggests that a mutation in this gene led to the appearance of small dogs more than 10,000 years ago.<br><br>Over the several thousand years that ensued, selective dog-breeding ensured the dog gene was kept around and spread through human migration and trade.<br><br>All domestic dogs are descended from wolves. They were the first animals to be domesticated more than 15,000 years ago, although early humans and wolves may have co-existed for about 400,000 years.<br><br>Huge variety<br><br>While wolves tend to look the same, today's dog breeds come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes.<br><br>The genetic origin of this diversity has long puzzled scientists, especially the size differences.<br><br>"We know this is only part of the story, but it's a necessary part of the story," said Elaine Ostrander of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, US, an author on the Science paper.<br><br>She noted there were a few exceptions, with the small-dog sequence appearing in larger dogs. Other, as yet-unidentified genetic factors must cause the exceptions.<br><br>Dr Ostrander said the research could assist the understanding of cancer and other disorders of growth.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42771000/jpg/_42771863_dogs2_science_203.jpg"><br><span style="color: blue;"><br>Dog show the greatest variation in size of all mammals<br></span><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42771000/jpg/_42771993_dog3_science_203.jpg"><br><span style="color: violet;"><br>Small dogs may have appeared more than 10,000 years ago<br></span></div>
