              <p>hi fellow smokers...</p>
              <p>well this another case of caught by NEA... or not i duno... i was smoking at SIM near the overhead bridge staircase area.. which is very far from the bus stop (and also my regular spot) but was caught, NEA officers approached me as i light up and demand by IC.. 1st of all i do not know y a place so far away from the bus stop can be counted as a non smoking area and will be fined...</p>
              <p>i delayed the time and say my IC was in my lecture room and they told me to wait, later they will walk with me to retrive my ic in class, i was not willing to pay for a fine which i dun even know is an offense... so i access them and concluded that they cant outrun me.. even if im in slippers.. i took the chance they wasn't looking and ran off..</p>
              <p>as expected... i ran away.. but now im scared... anyone did such a thing like me? would they be able to regonise your face and put you in wanted list? will the same officers be stationed at SIM again in the next few days? of course guys you can blame me for running away and deserving to have my life lived in such agony.. but i just dun feel its ok to giv a fine for an offense that i dun even know is an offense...</p>
              <p>guys you can blame me... but could any kind hearted smokers out there have any precious information to sooth my mind... at least a little... thanks in advance...</p>
