              <p>Prohibition on imitation tobacco products<br> <br> In Singapore, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are currently
              prohibited under Secion 16 (1) of the Tobacco (Control of
              Advertisements and Sale) Act, which is enforced by the Health
              Sciences Authority (HSA). This legislation prohibits the
              importation, distribution, sale or offer for sale of any
              confectionery or other food product or any toy or other article
              that is designed to resemble a tobacco product or the packaging of
              which is designed to resemble the packaging commonly associated
              with tobacco products. HSA takes a serious view on any person who
              contravenes the law. Those guilty of the offence are liable to a
              fine of up to $5, 000 upon conviction.<br> <br> More information on the health risks of e-cigarettes can be found
              at HPB's website at:
              http://www.hpb.gov.sg/smokefree/article.aspx?id=674<br> <br> Should you have any information on the import or sales of such
              electronic smoking products in Singapore, you may report to the
              Tobacco Regulation Branch at Tel: 6684 2036/2037 or Email:

              <p>Electronic addiction: Facts about e-cigarettes<br> <br>     The electronic cigarette, or e-cigarette, is
              touted as the healthier alternative to cigarettes by its
              manufacturers. However, WHO has never officially endorsed
              e-cigarettes!<br>     E-cigarettes are devices made to resemble real
              cigarettes.<br>     An e-cigarette consists of a mouthpiece , a
              heating element, a rechargeable battery and is activated with a
              cartridge which contains a liquid chemical mixture. The liquid
              chemical mixture is composed of nicotine (a highly addictive
              substance found in cigarettes), propylene glycol (a known irritant
              when inhaled or ingested) and may also contain many other harmful
              chemicals found in conventional cigarettes. An e-cigarette also has
              a LED light at the end of the device which lights up to simulate
              the process of combustion when the smoker inhales.<br>     As the user inhales through the e-cigarette, a
              heating element powered by a rechargeable battery is activated and
              vaporises the liquid chemical mixture, generating a fine heated
              mist.<br>     The fine mist generated contains nicotine that
              is inhaled and absorbed into the user s lungs.<br>     Some marketers of e-cigarettes have claimed that
              their product is an effective nicotine replacement therapy and a
              smoking cessation aid endorsed by the World Health Organizations
              (WHO).However, WHO had issued a press statement in September 2008
              stating that it does not support e-cigarettes as a legitimate
              therapy to help smokers quit as there is a lack of conclusive
              scientific evidence to substantiate the efficacy, safety and
              quality of e-cigarettes. WHO also called on marketers of
              e-cigarettes to immediately stop the unproved claims on
              e-cigarettes.<br>     Electronic cigarettes have so far been proven to
              be neither safe nor effective in helping smokers quit. More
              research still needs to be done to establish the usefulness of
              e-cigarettes to help people quit smoking.<br>     Although e-cigarettes do not contain some of the
              harmful substances found in normal cigarettes, this does not mean
              that they are entirely harmless. The nicotine present still poses a
              health risk to users.<br>     Users may still develop a dependence or
              addiction to nicotine by inhaling the fine nicotine mist produced
              by e-cigarettes.<br>     Imitation tobacco products such as electronic
              cigarettes are prohibited by law. For more information on imitation
              products, please click here.</p>
