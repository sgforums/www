              <h1 class="clr">More youths unaware of smoking risks: HPB</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A recent survey by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has
              showed that nearly one in five youths in Singapore agree smoking is not
              harmful.</p>
              <p>71 per cent of the surveyed also feel they can stop smoking anytime they want.</p>
              <p>Ms
              V. Prema, Deputy Director of the Youth Health Division of HPB said the
              misconceptions regarding smoking and its effects are worrying.</p>
              <p>"Quite
              of lot (of youths) think that they can quit anytime but that’s not such
              an easy feat because nicotine is quite an addictive drug," said Ms
              Prema.</p>
              <p>"We recommend that you don’t even start in the first
              place, otherwise, once you get into the habit, it’s not impossible to
              quit, but it’s very, very difficult."</p>
              <p>The survey also indicated
              while just nine per cent of young people aged 13 to 16 smoked, another
              common misconception is that lighting up is a cool act that "a lot of
              young people are doing".</p>
              <p>Analysis from the survey data showed
              that social network plays an important part in advocating youths to
              pick up their first cigarette.</p>
              <p>59 per cent of youth smokers
              polled have at least one parent who smokes, while only 34 per cent of
              non—smokers have smoking parents.</p>
              <p>95 per cent of youth smokers have close friends who smoke, while only 34 per cent of non—smokers could say the same.</p>
              <p>Apart
              from ’scare tactics’ such as placing images of long—term effects of
              smoking on cigarette boxes, the HPB has also adopted other measures in
              an effort to discourage youths from taking their first puff.</p>
              <p>The
              HPB has also actively promoted anti—smoking messages through the media,
              anti—smoking activities and curriculum in schools, and set up fairs and
              competitions.</p>
              <p>Going forward, the board said it will tie up with
              the YEH (Youth Evolution for Health) programme, where youth advocates
              will help talk to other youths about the risks involved in smoking.</p>
              <p>Ms
              Prema hopes that parents can play a part in discouraging their children
              from lighting up, or help them kick the habit if they already have.</p>
              <p>"I think if parents themselves can be good role models and stay smoke free, that would be (great)," she said.</p>
              <p>"I
              think it’s also important for parents to talk to their children about
              smoking... talk to your kids about the harmful effects, tell them how
              to say no, maybe even role play with them. That would help them face
              with that kind of (peer) pressure when the time comes." — CNA/yb</p>
