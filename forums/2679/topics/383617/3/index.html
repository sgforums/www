              <p>Nice, your trying to help by laughing, stellar, my day is
                  complete.</p>
              <p>and sorry about ur uncle dude, but please dun assume im a chain
                  smoker, obviously it makes an ass out of u n me. im sure more than
                  enough of singapore know that smoking leads to death and all sorts
                  of shit, but honestly those ppl that die, they got attribute and
                  tell us about the other factors like stress and depression? Most
                  probably not. My grandmother chain smoker for as long as i could
                  remember survive till 80+. She was happy with getting smoke in her
                  lungs, for all i know it could be keeping her alive lol.</p>
              <p>But do u honestly think slapping a 330 dollar fine on a smoker
                  and litter bug changes him in anyway? Singapores approach srsly
                  damn fucked up. If ur a smoker yourself you would probably know
                  that, after you tell this kind of story to your buddies they will
                  probably offer you yet another cigerette and ask you smoke it off
                  and forget about it. But what do i know man. im just a kid
                  right?</p>

              <p>No, I didn't assume that you were a chain smoker. I just know that the earlier in life you start smoking, the higher the chance of you becoming a chain smoker eventually.</p>
              <p>I also just made the observation that you're an underaged smoker. You deserve to have your ass whooped because you broke the law willingly and you're now crying mother crying father over the situation that <em>you got yourself into.</em></p>
              <p>Yeah, a $330 fine will not change a <strong>stupid</strong> smoker. But it may change a <strong>smart</strong> smoker who realizes that it is a really small price to pay compared to getting lung cancer later on in life.</p>
              <p>And yeah, Singapore law is stupid in a way. As we have seen from your post, a $330 fine doesn't work on morons. If I had it my way, I'd have people like you caned and thrown into reform school since you're too dumb to learn from a small $330 fine.</p>
              <p>You can just learn a lesson worth $330 now, or you can pay for the lesson in years to come. Your grandmother got lucky; my uncle didn't. It's your choice. </p>
              <p>Oh, and the freedom of choice extends to me too.</p>

              <p>You must feel really great laughing at peoples problems. I would wonder if your negative karma was transfered to your uncle in any sense. Xia suay mah, my ah ma smoke so long bo tai ji, your uncle smoke 20 years one day kana, then oops go to heaven. sorry loh.</p>
              <p>You are no better than me, in fact worse, categorizing people by intelligence, please get a fucking life, to be classifying people by intelligence, your making singapores education system seem more brilliant, classifying people into Express and Normal. Seriously fuck that shit, seperating people by their level of intelligence gets you no where bitch, your only widening the social gap between the two creating more problems.</p>
              <p>Smoking is against the law wiseguy but it isnt morally unjust, if you said i stole something from someone or got caught for fighting and ijuring someone, by all means point and laugh, but please dickshit you need to reflect your fucked up mindset.</p>
              <p>Neither was i crying mother father, i just wanted to know what the shit ill be facing so i can answer to my family which i deeply regret disappointing, but if its a choice i made i will take responsibility for my actions, and its not possible to hide it forever either, but being underaged just makes it harder to answer for my actions.</p>

Like ive said, ive got my own reasons for doing my own things. For others, i cannot speak on their behalf. And one thing seriously guys, smoking and death, youve got to stop correlating the two. Almost whatever we do leads us to dying slowly, its just that smoking has been more publicicized on.</p>

              <p>Wow your a genius. I did not scold anybody but, did you not notice the but? If you need reference check dictionary.com my use of "but" was indicating as a reference he was being made an exemption, i think your really quite free. Sure you can say "except" was a better choice of words, but this isnt exactly the place to show off your level of english proficiency. And even if it was, i really dont think the phrase "i saw you scolded someone" is grammatically correct neither is it structured properly.</p>

              <p>honestly, school cant protect you much. Unless you have a record of good behavior, conduct, from teachers. The NEA will most likely (if they decide to charge you), talk to your teachers in school (eg, form teacher, eng teacher) maybe principal(if he knows you). Then the school will contact your parents. (if they decide to). im speaking from what i know.</p>
              <p>NEA can most probably do anything, from dropping the charges to putting you up for CWO. NEA is part of the gov, and schooling, MOE, is also part of the gov. Age doesnt really matter, for there is a juvenile court in sg for underaged offenders.</p>

              <p>No, I didn't assume that you were a chain smoker. I just know that the earlier in life you start smoking, the higher the chance of you becoming a chain smoker eventually.</p>

              <p>Yeah, a $330 fine will not change a <strong>stupid</strong> smoker. But it may change a <strong>smart</strong> smoker who realizes that it is a really small price to pay compared to getting lung cancer later on in life.</p>
              <p>And yeah, Singapore law is stupid in a way. As we have seen from your post, a $330 fine doesn't work on morons. If I had it my way, I'd have people like you caned and thrown into reform school since you're too dumb to learn from a small $330 fine.</p>

              <p>Notice to attend court for the offence of littering. The date is set by the court, not NEA thats why cannot give you the notice on the spot. The NEA officer should have explained that too to you. But letting you know the offence is sufficient.</p>

              <p>Honestly, smoking dun really cause cancer. Mostly the air that we inhale consist of carbon monoxide, foreign oxidents, pollens and blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>Most of my relative, friends or colleagues, died of lung cancer. Out of 10 of them, only 2 were smokers. So therefore, how to explain of the rest getting lung cancer not smokers??? From 2nd hand smokers, some would say. "Not really" would be my reply, the answers is above(see also in 1st para). I am a 35yr old smoker myself and started since I was, like, 17yrs old. Had a buddy, same age and started smoking at 19, had smokers' cough. BTW, I am a heavy smoker at abt 20 cigs per day and also smoking Ang Hoon. My buddy is a light smoker with less than 10 cigs per day. As Xiaoming put it this way, when your time is up...means up. Sometimes, it depends on ur genectic structures of ur DNA. ANYWAY...back to the topic here.</p>
              <p>Hey Xiaoming, wanna share this with u. On Thurs, 3rd Dec, I was kenna stopped my 2 NEA plain clothes. Showed my their cards (the colour was kinda pale yellowish/orangy) One Indian, one Chinese. Chinese stopped me, flash badge and ask for my IC. I told them I got no time and need to rush of to take the MRT(3mins to arrival) to work, but thats juz a BS to them to excuse myself. Abt to take out IC, my Boss call and tell them I need to take the call from my Boss. "But Sir, I still need ur IC", Chinese guy said. "Ya wait, I really need to take this call from my Boss and needed to rush off". And then I jabot thru the MRT gates and vanish from thier sight. Cool or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png?1212956094" alt="Wink">. i think they got a bit stun.</p>
              <p>So how ah? I heard that they got take picture if u siam them and will ambush u next time and tio double, ah? Hope not leh. Now I must siam that nearest MRT stn. Dang it NEA.</p>
              <p>Thinking back, as times are bad, scarly, they r fake one, meh, and juz want to scare and extort $$$ from me, how? Or maybe, suucar suucar, take down my particulars and later go borrow $$$$ from Ah Long. I remember got one malayu couple smoke and throw the butts in the drain full of ciggy buts, but they nvr tio stop...and, CB,  I suay suay tio. Walau, jin eh tio beh sai or ToTo. i think they see colour one. F them lah.</p>

              <p><br>Same here, bro. Ciggies are my best friends and nvr had letted me down. They solved 85% of my problems or stress.</p>
              <p>"Got stress, sit back, take a puff and relax"</p>
              <p>if the Gov wanna curb all these (smoking related) littering, underaged or whatever problems, why dun they ban ciggies in the first place, like they did to chewing gum??? Logic or not. Issit that they can earn billions from ciggies every year? Or scared that Ang Mohs, Expats or Tourist who are smokers would NOT want to come into here, juz bcoz the Gov'y banned smoking???</p>
              <p>As for littering, who can avoid if they had impliment more Bins. Some places like the stretch Orchard Road. You can see alot of Bins. Other places, ha, not even one in sight. Maybe the Gov'y wanna save some cost, or the Bins keneh kooped by Karung Guni. Some littering cases, are genuine. example, some ppl cannot find Bins to throw their used tissues or sweet wrappers, put it inside their pockets. But, when they want to take something out, like coins, from their pockets, the litter from it fall out without them realising it, and tio fine. Explain or appeal also no use. NEA want ur money to pay for advertisements. I tot our country got alot of $$$$$$$$$$$. So where did it goes? Wanna save for war? For what??? WE ARE ONE PEOPLE!!! Human beings should not fight against one another.</p>

              <p>Honestly, smoking dun really cause cancer. Mostly the air that
              we inhale consist of carbon monoxide, foreign oxidents, pollens and
              blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>Most of my relative, friends or colleagues, died of lung cancer.
              Out of 10 of them, only 2 were smokers. So therefore, how to
              explain of the rest getting lung cancer not smokers??? From 2nd
              hand smokers, some would say. "Not really" would be my reply, the
              answers is above(see also in 1st para). I am a 35yr old smoker
              myself and started since I was, like, 17yrs old. Had a buddy,
              same age and started smoking at 19, had smokers' cough. BTW, I am a
              heavy smoker at abt 20 cigs per day and also smoking Ang
              Hoon. My buddy is a light smoker with less than 10 cigs per day. As
              Xiaoming put it this way, when your time is up...means up.
              Sometimes, it depends on ur genectic structures of ur DNA.
              ANYWAY...back to the topic here.</p>
              <p>Hey Xiaoming, wanna share this with u. On Thurs, 3rd Dec, I was
              kenna stopped my 2 NEA plain clothes. Showed my their cards (the
              colour was kinda pale yellowish/orangy) One Indian, one Chinese.
              Chinese stopped me, flash badge and ask for my IC. I told them I
              got no time and need to rush of to take the MRT(3mins to
              arrival) to work, but thats juz a BS to them to excuse myself.
              Abt to take out IC, my Boss call and tell them I need to take the
              call from my Boss. "But Sir, I still need ur IC", Chinese guy said.
              "Ya wait, I really need to take this call from my Boss and needed
              to rush off". And then I jabot thru the MRT gates and vanish from
              thier sight. Cool or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png?1212956094" alt="Wink">. i think they got a bit stun.</p>
              <p>So how ah? I heard that they got take picture if u siam them and
              will ambush u next time and tio double, ah? Hope not leh. Now I
              must siam that nearest MRT stn. Dang it NEA.</p>
              <p>Thinking back, as times are bad, scarly, they r fake one,
              meh, and juz want to scare and extort $$$ from me, how? Or maybe,
              suucar suucar, take down my particulars and later go borrow $$$$
              from Ah Long. I remember got one malayu couple smoke and throw the
              butts in the drain full of ciggy buts, but they nvr tio stop...and,
              CB,  I suay suay tio. Walau, jin eh tio beh sai or ToTo. i
              think they see colour one. F them lah.</p>

              <p>You only cannot buy cigarettes, or liquor.</p>
              <p>Except for your parent's and school principal's law, there is
