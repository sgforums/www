              <p>Yes, I am. I kick you in the arse now so that you jolly well wake up your ideas.</p>
              <p>If you want to know, my uncle passed away recently at the young age of 57.</p>
              <p><strong>Cause of death</strong>: lung cancer.</p>
              <p><strong>Elapsed time between diagnosis and death</strong>: four weeks.</p>
              <p><strong>Probable cause of cancer</strong>: he was a chain smoker for over 20 years.</p>
              <p>You think you had it rough, eh?</p>
              <p>My uncle had to learn the really, <em>really</em> hard way that smoking doesn't pay. For you, the lesson is a $330 fine and some ass-whooping by the fellas here at sgforums. The question is, are you gonna be smarter and truly be a man by learning this little lesson?</p>

              <p>Looking at his response ("stereotypical", "You got your own views, i got mine"), I think he isn't gonna change or learn anything from this.</p>
              <p>He should probably already know we are trying to HELP him, not the other way around, so it's his choice to make. In the end, he is the one paying the price, not us.</p>

              <p>Nice, your trying to help by laughing, stellar, my day is complete.</p>
              <p>and sorry about ur uncle dude, but please dun assume im a chain smoker, obviously it makes an ass out of u n me. im sure more than enough of singapore know that smoking leads to death and all sorts of shit, but honestly those ppl that die, they got attribute and tell us about the other factors like stress and depression? Most probably not. My grandmother chain smoker for as long as i could remember survive till 80+. She was happy with getting smoke in her lungs, for all i know it could be keeping her alive lol.</p>
              <p>But do u honestly think slapping a 330 dollar fine on a smoker and litter bug changes him in anyway? Singapores approach srsly damn fucked up. If ur a smoker yourself you would probably know that, after you tell this kind of story to your buddies they will probably offer you yet another cigerette and ask you smoke it off and forget about it. But what do i know man. im just a kid right?</p>

              <p>and dkcx.</p>
              <p>My school bo zheng hu one, dun bother. All underage smokers get caught are protected and most severe case ive seen is police warning letter, no fine issued even, how to give anything else when they are under the jurisdiction of the school? All prinicipal want to protect their lovely schools reputation.</p>

              <p>However i would say most of my better behave boys are the non smokers and just so happen both of my better behave boys were there due to sexual offences rather than the more common smoking/fighting/rioting.</p>
