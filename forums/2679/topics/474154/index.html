              <p>Tobacco use kills 5.4 million people a year worldwide - an average of
               one person every six seconds - and accounts for one in 10 adult deaths 
              worldwide. It kills up to half of all users. Most of tobacco's damage to
               health does not become evident until years or even decades after the 
              onset of use. So, while tobacco use is rising globally, the epidemic of 
              tobacco-related disease and death has yet to reach its peak.</p>
              <p>In Singapore:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>About 7 Singaporeans die prematurely from smoking-related diseases each day.</li>
              <li>Smoking-related
               diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke and Chronic 
              Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - also known as Chronic Obstructive
               Lung Disease (COLD)- , are the nation's top killers.</li>
              <li>The social
               cost of smoking in 1997 ranged from S$673 to S$839 million. The social 
              cost of smoking in Singapore includes the direct costs (payments for 
              hospitalisation and healthcare due to smoking), morbidity costs (lost 
              production due to smoking related illnesses) and mortality costs (lost 
              production from people who died early due to smoking).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Smoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the world. Don't let yourself or your family become the next victim.</p>

              <h2>Your Questions on Smoking, Tobacco Use and Health</h2>
              <h3>Is there a safe way to smoke cigarettes?</h3>
              <p>No.
               All cigarettes can damage the human body. Any smoking is dangerous. The
               cigarette is the only legal product whose advertised and intended use -
               smoking - is known to harm the body and cause cancer.</p>
              <p>Some people
               think that switching from high-tar and high-nicotine cigarettes to 
              those with low tar and nicotine makes smoking safer, but this is not 
              true. When people switch to brands with lower tar and nicotine, they 
              often end up smoking more cigarettes, or more of each cigarette, to get 
              the same nicotine dose as before.</p>
              <p>Smokers have been led to believe
               that "light" cigarettes have lower health risk and are a good option to
               quitting. A low-tar cigarette can be just as harmful as a high-tar 
              cigarette because a person often takes deeper puffs, puffs more often, 
              or smokes them to a shorter butt length.</p>
              <h3>Are menthol cigarettes safer than those without menthol?</h3>
              <p>Menthol only adds to the flavour of the cigarettes. It does not make the cigarettes any less dangerous.</p>
              <p>In
               fact, menthol cigarettes may even be more dangerous. The added menthol 
              produces a cooling sensation in the throat when the smoke is inhaled. It
               also decreases the cough reflex and covers the dry feeling in the 
              throat that smokers often have. People who smoke menthol cigarettes can 
              inhale deeper and hold the smoke in longer.</p>
              <h3>Is cigarette smoking really addictive?</h3>
              <p>Yes. The nicotine in cigarette smoke causes an addiction to smoking. Nicotine is an addictive drug just like heroin and cocaine.</p>
              <h3>What are the normal reactions after you quit?</h3>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>Difficulty in concentration or dizziness because your brain needs to get used to having more oxygen</li>
              <li>Cough and running nose as your lungs get rid of all the dirt and germs that had accumulated inside while you were smoking</li>
              <li>Strong craving for cigarettes while your body gets rid of the nicotine</li>
              <li>Tingling sensations in your arms and legs as your blood circulation returns to normal
              <p>Not
               everyone will get these withdrawal symptoms but don't lose heart if you
               do. They will disappear in one or two weeks and they are actually signs
               that you are getting better.</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Am I at risk if I puff the cigarette without inhaling the smoke?</h3>
              <p>Yes.</p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>Many chemicals in the cigarette smoke (including nicotine) can be absorbed through the mouth, nose and skin.</li>
              <li>The
               smoke that you blow out stays in the surrounding air. When you take 
              your next breath, it goes straight into your lungs, without you 
              realising it.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>What does nicotine do?</h3>
              <p>In large doses, nicotine is a poison and can kill by stopping a person's breathing muscles.</p>
              <p>Smokers
               usually become dependent on nicotine and suffer physical and emotional 
              (psychological) withdrawal symptoms when they stop smoking. These 
              symptoms include irritability, nervousness, headaches and trouble 
              sleeping. The true marker for addiction, though, is that people still 
              smoke even though they know smoking is bad for them -- affecting their 
              lives, their health and their families and friends in unhealthy ways.</p>
              <h3>Who is most likely to become addicted?</h3>
              <p>Anyone
               who starts smoking is at risk of becoming addicted to nicotine. Studies
               show that cigarette smoking is most likely to become a habit during the
               teenage years. The younger a person is when he or she begins to smoke, 
              the more likely he or she is to become addicted to nicotine.</p>
              <h3>Why do smokers have "smoker's cough" ?</h3>
              <p>Cigarette
               smoke contains chemicals that irritate the air passages and lungs. When
               a smoker inhales these substances, the body tries to protect itself by 
              making mucus and coughing. The early morning smoker's cough happens for 
              many reasons. Normally, tiny hair-like formations (called cilia) beat 
              outward and sweep harmful material out of the lungs. Cigarette smoke 
              slows the sweeping action, so some of the poisons in the smoke stay in 
              the lungs, and mucus stays in the airways. While a smoker sleeps, some 
              cilia recover and begin working again. After waking up, the smoker 
              coughs because the lungs are trying to clear away the irritants and 
              mucus built up the day before. The cilia will completely stop working 
              after they have been exposed to smoke for a long time. When this 
              happens, the smoker's lungs are even more exposed and prone to infection
               and irritation.</p>
              <p>The same noxious chemicals that cause the simple 
              smoker's cough can lead to far more serious conditions such as 
              bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia and lung cancer.</p>
              <h3>Why do I cough more after I've quit smoking?</h3>
              <p>Your
               lungs start to function properly again and are working to clear tar, 
              dead cells and extra mucus accumulated from the cigarettes.</p>
              <h3>My 
              husband was only 30 years old when he suffered from a stroke. The doctor
               said that smoking is the main cause of his stroke. How can smoking 
              actually cause stroke?</h3>
              <p>Smoking causes a build-up of fatty 
              deposits in the blood vessels, resulting in narrowing and blockage of 
              the vessels. If the blood supply in these vessels leading to the brain 
              is blocked, the surrounding brain cells will die, resulting in a stroke.</p>
              <h3>I've
               heard that smoking causes a fatty build-up in the blood vessels. But 
              how is this so when fat is not an ingredient in cigarette smoke?</h3>
              <p>The
               moment you light a cigarette, thousands of poisonous chemicals in the 
              cigarette smoke enter your body and are absorbed into the bloodstream. 
              Some of these chemicals make your blood vessel walls sticky, damaging 
              them, and causing them to collect the tiny fatty deposits that float in 
              the bloodstream. The more you smoke, the more the fatty deposits build 
              up.</p>
              <h3>How does smoking cause a heart attack? Is it similar to how smoking causes stroke?</h3>
              <p>Yes.
               Similar adverse effects take place when the blood vessels leading to 
              our heart are blocked by fatty deposits. This cuts off the blood supply 
              to our heart muscles, killing the tissue. As a result, a heart attack 
              occurs.</p>
              <h3>How many cigarettes do I need to smoke to get lung cancer?</h3>
              <p>Lung cancer can begin from cell damage caused by smoking just ONE cigarette.</p>
              <p>Research
               has found that one of the cancer-causing substances in cigarette smoke 
              (benzopyrene) directly attacks and damages the p53 gene which blocks 
              cancer and prevents cancer cells from growing. When cancer threatens a 
              lung cell with a damaged p53 gene, a deadly tumour starts to grow.</p>
              <h3>Can quitting really help a lifelong smoker?</h3>
              <p>Yes.
               It is never too late to quit smoking. The sooner you quit, the more you
               can reduce your chances of getting cancer and other diseases. Within 
              minutes of smoking the last cigarette, your body begins to restore 
              itself.</p>
              <h3>Suppose I smoke for a while and then quit?</h3>
              <p>Smoking
               begins to cause damage right away and is highly addictive. Some studies
               have found nicotine to be as addictive as heroin or cocaine.</p>
              <h3>Do filters reduce the dangers of cigarette smoking?<sup> </sup></h3>
              <p>Cigarette filters may trap part of the tar and nicotine, but they do not remove any poisons from the cigarette smoke.</p>
