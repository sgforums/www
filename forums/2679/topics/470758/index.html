              <p>You can also write to us with your comments at: The Health
              Promotion Board, Substance Abuse Department, 3 Second Hospital
              Avenue, Singapore 168937<br> <br> All responses will be carefully considered by the Health Promotion
              Board, Health Sciences Authority and the National Environment
              Agency.<br> <br> Aim<br> <br> 1.       The Health Promotion Board
              (HPB), Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and the National Environment
              Agency (NEA) are considering changes to tobacco control policies to
              further reduce smoking rates in Singapore and would like to seek
              public views on these changes.<br> <br> Background<br> <br> 2.       Tobacco use is the single
              most preventable cause of death in the world today1. Tobacco can
              potentially cause up to half of its users to die, on average 15
              years prematurely. The World Health Organization estimates that 5.4
              million people die from tobacco-related diseases every year. This
              could rise to more than eight million every year by 2030.<br> <br> <br> 3.       In Singapore, smoking is
              linked to six out of eight main causes of death including cancer2.
              The National Tobacco Control Programme aims to reduce the smoking
              prevalence in Singapore by:<br> <br> i.    Building a supportive environment that
              encourages tobacco-free lifestyles;<br> ii.   Preventing young people from picking up
              smoking;<br> iii.  Promoting ways to help smokers break the habit;
              and<br> iv.  Protecting non-smokers from the harmful effects of
              second-hand smoke.<br> <br> <br> 4.       While the prevalence of
              smoking spell between 1980 and 2004, the latest National Health
              Survey 2010 showed that there was a slight increase in the number
              of smokers aged between 18 and 69 years. The most significant
              increase is among adult males aged 18-29 years old (from 18.2% to
              25.3%) and 30-39 years old (from 22.7% to 29.3%). This trend
              underscores the need to review and revisit existing tobacco control
              strategies.<br> <br> <br> 5.       In 2010, Singapore amended
              the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act to strengthen
              measures against tobacco marketing and sales. Subsequently, tax
              rates for non-cigarette tobacco predicts were also increased. The
              Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act was amended to increase
              the protection of the public from exposure to second hand
              smoke.<br> <br> <br> 6.       Examples of enhancements
              made to strengthen tobacco control measures included:<br> <br>     Stricter tobacco packaging requirements<br>     All cigarette packets now carry a mandatory
              health warning message alongside the requirement for 50% of the
              front and back of pack to display the graphic (picture) health
              warning.<br>     Restricting availability of tobacco<br>     Currently, tobacco cannot be sold at outlets
              that 1) sell health products or youth-specific products or
              services; and 2) are located in any health establishments licensed
              by MOH/HSA (e.g. hospitals, medical clinics and licensed
              pharmacies).<br>     Increasing taxation on non-cigarette tobacco
              products<br>     The total amount of tax on a packet of
              cigarettes sold in Singapore is around 69%. A 25% increase in taxes
              for beedies, ang hoon and smokeless tobacco, and 1.5% increase for
              unmanufactured tobacco, cut tobacco and tobacco refuse, was
              announced during the Budget 2013. This was part of the
              harmonisation process to bring the tax rates of these non-cigarette
              products closer to that of cigarettes.<br> <br> <br> 7.       These amendments are
              consistent with international developments. For example, some
              countries have increased the size of their picture (graphic) health
              warnings to further discourage smoking. Uruguay, Sri Lanka and
              Thailand now have among the biggest health warnings covering at
              least 80% of the packet (front and back). With regards to taxation,
              New Zealand has announced plans to increase taxes on cigarettes by
              10% every year from 2013 for 4 years in order to reduce the demand
              and consumption of cigarettes.<br> <br> <br> 8.       This public consultation
              seeks your views on some emerging international best practices. One
              key measure on which we are keen to hear your views is to disallow
              tobacco products to be displayed openly in retail outlets. Another
              is the extension of the smoking ban in public places. Additional
              comments on other tobacco control measures or ideas that you may
              have are also welcome.</p>
