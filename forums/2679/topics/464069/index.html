              <p>We are exposed daily to a form of air pollution that causes twice as 
              many deaths as all other types of air pollution put together. This is 
              known as Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), which is actually the smoke 
              from other people's cigarettes.</p>
              <h4>What is ETS?</h4>
              <p>Also referred
               to as second-hand smoke, about 85% to 90% of the smoke from every 
              cigarette ends up in the air as ETS. A lighted cigarette produces two 
              types of smoke that a non-smoker breathes in:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Mainstream Smoke which is inhaled by the smoker through the filter tip of the cigarette, and then exhaled.</li>
              <li>Sidestream Smoke from the burning tip of the cigarette which goes straight into the air that we breathe.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>ETS
               consists of around 85% sidestream smoke and 15% mainstream smoke. 
              Sidestream smoke has a higher temperature than mainstream smoke and does
               not pass through the cigarette's filter tip. The concentration of 
              chemicals in sidestream smoke is thus higher than in mainstream smoke.</p>
              <p>This
               does not mean that smoking is less dangerous. The smoker inhales far 
              more smoke than the people around him because unlike ETS, mainstream 
              smoke does not get mixed with the surrounding air before reaching his 
              lungs.</p>
              <h4>Why is ETS dangerous?</h4>
              <p>Cigarette smoke contains over
               4,000 different chemicals, of which at least 400 are poisonous to man. 
              The World Health Organization reports that at least sixty cancer-causing
               chemicals have been identified in secondhand smoke. Research on ETS has
               shown that living with, working with or just being around a smoker can 
              harm your health. When you breathe in ETS, your health is affected 
              adversely.</p>
              <p>A person exposed to ETS is at risk of developing health conditions similar to those faced by the smoker, which include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>eye, nose and throat irritations</li>
              <li>respiratory
               tract infections, with worsening of pre-existing respiratory problems 
              such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema </li>
              <li>heart disease and cancers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Recent
               studies have estimated that non-smokers exposed to ETS at home or in 
              their workplace have their risk of lung cancer raised about a quarter, 
              while heavy exposure at work doubles the risk of lung cancer.</p>
              <h4>How are children affected by ETS?</h4>
              <p>There
               is evidence to suggest that babies and children are particularly 
              susceptible to the health effects of ETS.   When parents or other 
              caregivers like grandparents smoke, their children suffer as well.</p>
              <p>Some examples of the harmful effects on children include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>more coughs and cold.</li>
              <li>higher chance of irritation of the eyes and nose</li>
              <li>reduced lung growth and function</li>
              <li>increased
               susceptibility to coughs, wheezing and asthma. Children who have never 
              had asthma before are more likely to develop it if one of their parents 
              smokes. Continued exposure to ETS can cause asthma attacks to be more 
              severe and occur more often.</li>
              <li>higher risk of suffering ear and 
              chest infections. Younger children who are especially sensitive to 
              cigarette smoke are more likely to develop lung diseases such as 
              pneumonia and bronchitis. Children are more likely to miss school and 
              are less likely to do well in studies as a result of falling sick more 
              often.</li>
              <li>or infants - increased risk of sudden death.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Risks during pregnancy</h4>
              <p>According
               to the Surgeon General Report, women who smoke while they are pregnant 
              or are exposed to ETS are more likely to suffer a miscarriage or 
              stillbirth. Their babies may be born prematurely or have a lower than 
              normal birth weight.</p>
              <h4>More likely to pick up smoking</h4>
              <p>Children
               whose parents smoke are also likely to pick up smoking, as seen in the 
              Student Health Survey 20064 where 6 in 10 youth smokers have at least 
              one parent who is also a smoker.</p>
              <h4>Third-hand smoke - additional danger after secondhand smoke</h4>
              <p>An
               additional danger remains even after a cigarette has been stubbed out. 
              Third-hand smoke refers to cigarette residual particles that remain in 
              the environment after a cigarette is extinguished. These particles 
              linger on a smoker's hair, clothing, household fabrics such as carpets, 
              curtains, rugs and surfaces like floors and windows. Young children and 
              infants are especially susceptible to these toxins as they crawl on, 
              play on, touch and inhale particles from these contaminated surfaces. 
              This shows that the adverse impact of lighting a cigarette goes a long 
              way.</p>
              <p>Smoking has many harmful effects on health and ETS is one of 
              them. Not lighting up a cigarette marks the beginning of a healthier 
              lifestyle for you and your loved ones. Breathe in the fresh air by going
               smoke free today!</p>
