              <p><strong>Smoking ban to be extended to all indoor public places</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The smoking ban will be extended to all indoor public places and some outdoor places by January 2009. 
              <br> <br> The National Environment Agency (NEA) will also step up its enforcement efforts.
              <br> <br> Some outdoor places, like playgrounds and exercise areas, will be smoke-free next year. 
              <br> <br> So too will all indoor public areas such as multi-storey and basement
              car parks, lift lobbies, non air-con shopping centres and shops.
              <br> <br>Many have observed that ash trays demarcate a smoking zone. And so
              come January 2009, an ash tray at the entrance of Bras Basah Complex
              will probably no longer be there, as the smoking ban has been extended
              to include a distance of five metres from the property's entrance or
              exit.
              <br> <br>Sung Jee Tong, chairman, Bras Basah Complex Merchants' Association,
              said: "Hopefully, we can change all the dustbins to those that are
              covered. So people do not have the impression that this is a smoking
              area."
              <br> <br>With more areas becoming smoke-free, NEA will double the number of
              enforcement officers from 50 to 120, who will now spend 490 man-hours,
              a 300-man-hour increase. <br> <br> But during the initial phase, they expect to issue more warnings, rather than fines. 
              <br> <br> Khoo Seow Poh, Director-General Public Health, NEA, said: "In the first
              few months, people need to adjust to it. We will always be helping
              them, giving more advice. And if need be, in situations where people do
              not cooperate, then enforcement has to come in.
              <br> <br>"I guess eventually, smokers will have to go to designated smoking
              areas to smoke. If most of the public areas are covered under the
              smoking ban, then smokers will have to go to (designated smoking areas)
              smoke. And there are also wide open areas outside buildings where
              smokers can actually go to take their puff."
              <br> <br> The smoking ban will also apply to restaurants and bars in the integrated resorts (IRs).
              <br> <br> The NEA has not yet indicated if there is a cap to the amount of smoking areas within the gaming halls.
              <br> <br> But it said it will be giving its inputs to the IRs on their house rules.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, Resorts World at Sentosa said it is looking at different
              options in segregating smoking and non-smoking areas within its casino.

              <p>i think its a great move, fully supportive of this move and i'm eagerly awaiting the day they cost 50 bucks a pack and you can only smoke in your own house.</p>
              <p>nowadays i'll just walk off even if its my own friend smoking. after all the times i've been forced to take in all that smoke and told
              i can always be the one to move away if i don't like the smoke i
              strongly feel smokers should be squeezed into their own corner where

              <p>i think its a great move, fully supportive of this move and i'm
                  eagerly awaiting the day they cost 50 bucks a pack and you can only
                  smoke in your own house.</p>
              <p>nowadays i'll just walk off even if its my own friend smoking.
                  after all the times i've been forced to take in all that smoke and
                  told i can always be the one to move away if i don't like the smoke
                  i strongly feel smokers should be squeezed into their own corner
                  where they can't disturb anyone.</p>

              <p>because when you drink, you can choose not to drive, or get into fights (even so, for every 100 person who drinks, maybe 20 gets into a fight, but for every 100 person who smokes, 100 of them poisons their neighbour).</p>
              <p>you can't choose not to poison others when you smoke. you just do.</p>
              <p>yeah, i'm pretty tired of having to siam because of inconsiderate smokers, so i applaud this move.</p>
