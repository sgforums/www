              <p><strong>Singapore Forum : Curbing Smoking Addiction</strong></p>
              <p>Smoking
              addictions is one of the growing problems in Singapore. Findings from a
              report highlighted a rising trend of young female smokers aged 18-29
              years, with an increasing smoking rate from 5.2% in 1998 to 6.6% in
              2004. [12] Furthermore, according to statistics in 2007, daily smoking
              was most prevalent in young adults aged 18 to 29 years (17.2%).</p>
              <p>Hence, we have decided to try tackling this problem by coming up with several ideas.</p>
              <p>The ideas are as follows:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Setting up vending machines that sell cigarettes</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This
              has already been implemented in several countries around the globe. For
              example, Japan has implemented this measure and only those who own a
              taspo card is able to purchase the cigarettes from the vending machines.</p>
              <p>Our idea is to adopt this measure and further modify it to remove the limitations of the current measure.</p>
              <p>Advantages:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>able to track down smoking addicts</li>
              <li>only allow those who are of the legal age to purchase the cigarettes (usage of taspo card in Japan's case)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Limitations:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>minors are able to attain the cards from their parents or adult friends to buy the cigarettes</li>
              <li>previous shop owners who sell cigarettes would not want to support this measure as they would suffer a huge loss in revenue.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Modifications:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>implement a fingerprint checking system</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This
              double checks that no minors are able to purchase the cigarettes. Even
              if they steal the cards from adults, they are unable to purchase them.
              Such acts would be detected and these minors will be sent for
              counselling.</p>
              <p>In addition to that, it also double checks the
              identity of the consumer. This would enable us to take acton on those
              who purchase cigarettes excessively in a day.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>place the vending machines in the shops (shop owners have control over the vending machines)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Shop
              owners would be the ones replenishing the stocks of the vending
              machines. They would still be able to attain the profits gained from
              the sale of cigarettes from the vending machines. Hence, the shop owers
              won't incur a huge loss anymore.</p>
              <p>2. Establishment of anti-smoking camp</p>
              <p>Smokers
              would get psychological support from fellow smoker and certified
              hypnotherapists. According to research quoted on the Hypnosis Network
              site, "studies shows that a single session hypnosis treatment to stop
              smoking produces about a 25% success rate, whreas about 66% of those
              engaging in at least 4-5 sessions of hypnosis quit smoking after a 6-12
              month period. (Hammond 1990, p 407).</p>
              <p>In this camp, they
              would get the aid and psychological support which they require, thereby
              making it easier for them to quit smoking as they constantly receive
              encouragements from fellow smokers or the certified hypnotherapists.</p>
              <p>Advantages:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>assist smokers kick their habits</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Make
              it easier for them to share their thoughts and feelings to people who
              have gone through the same kind of situation as them. They also know
              that they are not going through it along. It also allows them to get a
              lot of support from a lot of people, especially family and friends.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>a wake up call</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Consultation
              by professionals would help them realise their mistakes in their
              lifestyle. They are aware of the many options whereby they can live
              their lives.</p>
              <p><br>Limitations:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>camp is costly</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Professionals are hired to monitor the smokers' progress after and during camp.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>small number of professionals</li>
              </ul>
              <p>They have a fear that it may be too tough. They may also feel a social stigma that the society does not tolerate smokers.</p>
              <p>Modifications:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>involve volunteers</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Professionals
              who are truly passionate about helping smoker kick the habit or reduce
              on their intake of cigarettes. Hence, we do not neeed to spend money on
              hiring them.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>create anti-smoking hotlines</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Another
              method to assist current smokers to kick the habit. Those who cannot
              afford the camp can call the hotlines to guide them through their
              intention of kicking the habit.</p>
              <p>3. Setting up a police force that specializes in operations to curb illegal sales</p>
              <p>Presently,
              operations to curb illegal sales of cigarettes are conducted by
              neighbourhood police centres and their efforts are inarguably not
              coordinated. Most of the operations are also conducted by general
              officers, who might not have the expertise and experience on tackling
              such problems.</p>
              <p>Advantages:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>more specific job scopes</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The
              officers would be more specialized and trained in these aspects. They
              are more skilled in tackling and handling such problems.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Shows the governement's support</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This
              shows that the government takes this problem seriously as they are
              willing to set up a branch specifically to attend to such problems.</p>
              <p>Limitations:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>increase in cost for the police force</li>
              </ul>
              <p>They
              would have to send the police officers for training. They would also
              have to recruit more officers and hence, increasing the amount of
              salaries that have to be given out.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>requires approval of the singapore government</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We have to go through the government before this measure can be implemented.</p>
              <p><br>Modifications:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>leveraging volunteers at the Recidents' Committee(RC) level in the fight against smoking.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This
              reduces the workload of the police force. However, the police force
              would have to train them and have monthly checks on their progress.
              This is a good modification because the RC has a better understanding
              of the estate that they are in charge of and they know the community
              better so it would be easier for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em>We
              hope that you will give your feedback on which measure is the most
              effective and if you think that these measures are feasible after the
              modifications that we have made. We would really appreciate your
              opinions and ideas on how to further improbe this project of ours.</em></strong></p>
