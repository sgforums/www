              <h1 class="clr">HPB distributes flowers to women to encourage them to quit smoking</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has decided to use flowers to encourage more women to quit smoking.</p>
              <p>HPB’s representatives distributed geberas’ to women in the Central
              Business District on 17 March as part of a new effort by the Fresh Air
              for Women’ network.</p>
              <p>The latest campaign targets women aged between 18 and 29 as HPB found that this group has the highest number of female smokers.</p>
              <p>A
              2004 health survey found that the percentage of young women who smoke
              daily rose from five per cent in 1998 to seven per cent in 2004.</p>
              <p>Rachel
              Ngo Xiu Tong, Senior Executive, Smoking Control, Health Promotion
              Board, said: “Every woman has a family so we hope that they will
              seriously think about quitting. Not just for themselves but for their
              loved ones, be it a family member, a parent, even for their partner."</p>
              <p>And
              the spokesperson for this year’s campaign is the late Zita Roberts. The
              mother of three was 38—years—old when she died from lung cancer in 2007.</p>
              <p>Fresh
              Air for Women’ hopes that Zita’s message of pain, anguish and regret
              will reinforce the message that death from lung cancer is very real and
              that smoking tears families apart as well.</p>
              <p>A total of 18,000
              flowers will be given out at various locations island—wide and each
              flower comes with a message of support and inspiration.</p>
              <p>Also part of the mobile campaign is a display which is made up of 3,000 gerberas that forms the word strength’.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">HPB puts spotlight on female smokers to kick habit</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: More women are smoking. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) of
              Singapore discovered this during a survey which also revealed that the
              number of male smokers is dwindling.</p>
              <p>To help women quit smoking, the Fresh Air for Women (FAFW) network, an initiative by the HPB, has launched a very public drive.</p>
              <p>It
              has set up a Glass House along the Orchard Road shopping belt and won
              the support of a 26 year old smoker who is openly declaring her
              determination to quit.</p>
              <p>Cheyenne Lu will spend three days in the Glass House in her battle to stop smoking and go cold turkey during that time.</p>
              <p>The
              first three days, also known as the 'three—day hump’ is the most
              difficult period of quitting and Lu will put the philosophy to the test
              while showcasing a smoker’s smoke—free journey.</p>
              <p>If the attention
              she draws living the Glass House won’t get Lu to stick out the urge for
              a stick, the FAFW has also provided her with wireless internet access,
              a collection of her favourite DVDs and an entertainment system to play
              them on, as well as stylish furnishings and snacks.</p>
              <p>In addition,
              the HPB has arranged for several activities to keep the freelance
              writer distracted and help her overcome any cigarette cravings. These
              activities include fitness workouts, make—up sessions and consultations
              with a quit advisor.</p>
              <p>Through the effort, the FAFW hopes other women smokers can learn ways to also quit smoking.</p>
              <p>Ms
              Choo Lin, Deputy Director of the Health Promotion Board’s Smoking
              Control Programme said: “This is the first time that someone is going
              to quit smoking in such a public event. I think that this shows her
              commitment and her courage and that is very important for FAFW because
              that is what we represent, we want to encourage women to feel the
              strength and try to stop smoking.</p>
              <p>“I think many women are very
              afraid of issues such as weight gain or stress or temptation (if they
              quit) we hope that through Cheyenne’s actions, they will feel inspired
              and more courageous to give (quitting) a try.”</p>
              <p>Like many, Lu who has been smoking for 12 years started the habit during her teen years due to ”peer pressure”.</p>
              <p>The
              heavy smoker who describes her latest effort as “one of the biggest
              challenges” in her life, has been smoking about 12 to 15 sticks a day.</p>
              <p>In
              terms of health cost, Lu saw a deterioration in her health and skin
              condition, forcing her to steer herself in a smoke—free direction.</p>
              <p>Financially, she calculated that she’d been spending more than S$300 a month on cigarettes.</p>
              <p>The
              money saved from cigarettes she reasoned, could go towards a ticket to
              London where the soccer fan can do something she’d dreamed of ——
              catching her favourite football club, Arsenal in action.</p>
              <p>“It’s a
              start where I consciously save the money used for smoking, and use it
              for something that is more meaningful and beneficial to me things which
              I can enjoy more than smoking itself, like travelling to England to
              watch Sesc Fabregas and Arsenal play!”</p>
              <p>Lu will document her smoke
              free journey on her online blog. Members of the public are also invited
              to leave her messages of encouragement through her message board or
              visit the glass house outside Ngee Ann City to cheer her on.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">26—year—old smoker goes smoke—free for three days on Orchard Road</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A 26—year—old smoker who has been smoking for nearly half
              her lifetime has managed to spend the weekend free from cigarettes.</p>
              <p>Cheyenne Lu spent three days and two nights living in a glass house set up by the Health Promotion Board (HPB).</p>
              <p>Ms Lu said this weekend was her longest time without a cigarette since she was 14.</p>
              <p>She said her previous attempts to quit failed because she did not tell her family or friends she was trying to give up.</p>
              <p>But this time she had the support from her family, friends and the HPB.</p>
              <p>Her
              mother, Josephine Teo, said: "Now I think she’s determined, so I think
              she will do it. She didn’t smoke at all in the last three days, so I
              think she will make it."</p>
              <p>After spending her weekend in the glass
              house along Orchard Road, Ms Lu said: "It is difficult especially when
              you see people walking past and lighting up. But the thing is, being in
              here for three days and two nights and not smoking, despite having
              other smokers around me, has proved to me that I can do this even when
              I’m out with my smoking friends. I can persevere and go on smoke—free."</p>
              <p>She has kept a blog of her experience to encourage other women to kick the habit.</p>
              <p>The project is part of HPB’s Fresh Air for Women campaign to counter the growing trend of smoking among young women.</p>
              <p>Choo
              Lin, HPB’s deputy director of smoking control, said: "We (brought) in a
              quit counsellor and she basically drew up a quit plan for Cheyenne.
              That is one of the most important things to be prepared."</p>
              <p>Over
              the weekend, visits from friends and family helped distract Ms Lu from
              thoughts of smoking. A fitness instructor was also brought in to teach
              her yoga and pilates to stretch her mind and muscles, and help her cope
              with stress.</p>
              <p>The public also left messages to motivate her to remain smoke—free. — CNA/ac</p>
