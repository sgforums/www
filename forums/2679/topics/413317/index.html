              <p>HPB: Approximately 7 Singaporeans die of smoking every day.</p>
              <p>Right now, at this moment, you can imagine them breathing their last, heavy stinky breath.</p>
              <p>Not only do they lose their live, but they cause their loved ones to suffer both physically and emotionally.</p>
              <p>They pollute the environment with carcinogens, garbage and wrong examples for our children.</p>
              <p>The number of smokers in Singapore hit a record high in 2009, I aim to reduce this amount.</p>
              <p>I also plead with all smokers out there to respect the health and comfort of all your relatives, friends and colleagues. Second-hand smoke contains more pollutants than the smoke you breathe in.</p>
              <p>You can help by avoiding smoking outside entrances and exits, at pedestrian crossings, stairwells, toilets, pathways etc. To sum it up, just smoke in places where there are no non-smokers passing by.</p>
              <p>Remember,
                   a single puff of second-hand smoke can do serious damage to an 
                  asthmatic, the elderly, a pregnant woman, a baby, or anyone with health 
                  problems, and can be potentially fatal,.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I plan to clean our air by using publicity, education, deterrence and eventually petioning with the Government for more restrictions.</p>

              <p>1 thing i wan to say is,  isn't the smoker also passive smoking? becos when he puff out the smoke, the smoke can't magically move away from him and he have to breathe right?</p>

              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Myths about Smoking </strong>[followed by the truth]</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p><em>Myth:</em>  If you can smell cigarette smoke then the "bad" parts of the smoke are also there.<br><em>Truth:</em> The portion of smoke that you can smell is only a small fraction of the content but it is also the longest lasting.  Do you really think that because you can smell "smoke" in your clothes the next day that the smoke is still there trying to kill you?  If so you belong to the neurotic (and exceedingly stupid) class of antismokers.<sup>7</sup></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><em>Myth:</em>  Second-hand smoke is unfiltered smoke and therefore worse than the smoke that the smoker is inhaling.<br><em>Truth:</em> The smoke that a smoker exhales is what you are exposed to as the cigarette does not give off significant smoke while idle.  Therefore the smoke has not only been filtered by the cigarette's filter but also the smoker's respiratory system.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><em>Myth:</em>  A lot of people have an allergy to tobacco smoke.<br><em>Truth:</em> We have looked but been unable to find a single documented case of an allergy to tobacco smoke. What people sometimes call an allergy is really a perceived irritation of the respiratory tract.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><em>Myth:</em>  Cigarettes cause lung cancer.<br><em>Truth:</em> Cigarettes do not cause cancer but are but one of many factors that can increase the incidence of lung cancer. People who have never been exposed to any type of cigarette smoke still get lung cancer. Not only that but for every 100 lifelong heavy smokers, less than 6 of them would ever get lung cancer.<sup>1,2</sup>  Hardly any direct correlation.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><em>Myth:</em>  Cigarettes are as addictive as heroin.<br><em>Truth:</em> Not only cigarettes but now also hamburgers are as addictive as heroin.<sup>8</sup>  Of course these are false.  Such statements are  misinterpretations of recidivism rates.  Basically, these people say that because someone who stops smoking or eating a hamburger, often have another cigarette or hamburger down the road at about the same rate as someone who kicks heroin, that they must therefore be equally addictive.  This is nothing but pure sophistry (the incorrect use of logic to fool the public).  It is also a purposeful confusion of psychogenic and physical dependence.  The 1964 Report of the Surgeon General (p.352) states, "The compulsion (to smoke) appears to be solely psychogenic since physical dependence does not develop to nicotine ... nor does tobacco, either during its use or following withdrawal, create psychotoxic effects which lead to antisocial behavior....  In contrast to drugs of addiction, withdrawal from tobacco never constitutes a threat to life.  These facts indicate clearly the absence of physical dependence."</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><em>Myth:</em>  Smoking has no medical benefits.<br><em>Truth:</em>  It helps to prevent the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.<sup>9-14</sup>  It may also be helpful in ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.<sup>14</sup>  Smoking has been found to be relaxing for beneficial for some anxiety disorders and people with type A personalities.  In fact, taking away smoking from some subgroups can increase their medical problems and chance of dying). Smoking like caffeine can help a person get going in the morning and improve their energy state.<sup>7</sup>  Though some of the benefits from smoking may be due to some individual components such as nicotine, studies need to be done and an effective means of administration needs to be developed.</p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"<span style="font-size: medium;">Yes, smoking is bad for you, but so is fast-food hamburgers, driving, and so on. We must weigh the risk and benefits of the behavior both as a society and as an individual based on unbiased information. Be warned though, that a society that attempts to remove all risk terminates individual liberty and will ultimately perish. Let us be logical in our endeavors and true in our pursuit of knowledge. Instead of fearful waiting for lung cancer to get me (because the media and much of the medical literature has falsely told me that smoking causes lung cancer), I can enjoy my occasional cigar even more now...now that I know the whole story.</span>"<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">2</span></sup></em></p>

              it's inconsiderate, rude and harmful to the people around you, so
              don't smoke near them, UNDERSTAND?</p>

              <p>And to Zweis: Yeah I know there are a lots of 'Myths' and all
              but I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MYTHS. What I care about is 'PASSIVE
              SMOKING IS HARMFUL'. I DARE YOU to say that passive smoking is
              '100% NO HARMFUL EFFECTS'. I DARE YOU TO SAY THAT.</p>

              i am not a smoker.  
              
              but smokers have the right to smoke whenever they want as long as the law allows it.  
              
              based on your 'logic' i can say the same thing about motor vehicles.  
              
              maybe you should prove to us that pollution from the car is '100% no harmful effects'.  i dare you to say that.  motorists should be more considerate.  stop driving!!!.
