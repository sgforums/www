              <h1 class="clr">Smoking ban to be extended to more areas from January 2009</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : The smoking ban will be extended to more areas next year.
              From 1 January 2009, it will be an offence to smoke in all children’s
              playgrounds, exercise areas and markets.</p>
              <p>Entertainment outlets like pubs and bars are already no—smoking
              areas. And this has led to a significant improvement in the indoor air
              quality, with an 80 percent reduction in the amount of air—borne
              particulate matter — which are associated with a higher risk of
              developing respiratory and cardiovascular problems.</p>
              <p>The Ministry
              of Environment and Water Resources said it has also received positive
              feedback from pub operators and patrons. So it is extending the smoking
              ban to more areas, to offer greater protection to non—smokers.</p>
              <p>From
              1 January next year, smoking will be prohibited at all children’s
              playgrounds, exercise areas, markets, underground and multi—storey
              carparks, ferry terminals and jetties.</p>
              <p>It will also be extended to non—air conditioned areas in offices, factories, shops, shopping complexes and lift lobbies.</p>
              <p>There are plans to cover more areas.</p>
              <p>Dr
              Yaacob Ibrahim, Environment and Water Resources Minister, said, "In the
              meantime, we are consulting the hotel industry on the possible
              extension of the smoking prohibition to hotel lobbies. We will also be
              working with building owners to prohibit smoking at the entrances and
              exits of buildings and facilities, as well as the covered walkways
              abutting buildings."</p>
              <p>Dr Yaacob added that efforts to raise awareness among the young on the ill—effects of smoking have also paid off.</p>
              <p>Such
              efforts include mandatory counselling for recalcitrant under—aged
              smokers and making available smoking cessation services in all
              polyclinics and several hospitals.</p>
              <p>As a result, there has been a reduction in the proportion of youths aged between 13 and 16 who have tried smoking.</p>
              <p>This went down from 26 percent in 2000 to 19 percent in 2006.</p>
              <p>The
              Minister was responding to various MPs who raised questions in
              Parliament on Friday on the government’s plans to create a sustainable
              environment for the future. — CNA/ms</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Mixed reactions to planned smoking ban extension</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Reactions are divided on the government’s announcement that
              the smoking ban will be extended to more public areas from next year.</p>
              <p>Smoking is already banned in places like inside air—conditioned buildings and inside entertainment outlets like pubs and clubs.</p>
              <p>From
              1 January next year, smoking will also be prohibited at children’s
              playgrounds, exercise areas, markets, underground and multi—storey
              carparks, ferry terminals and jetties.</p>
              <p>The ban will also be extended to non—air conditioned areas in offices, factories, shops, shopping complexes and lift lobbies.</p>
              <p>The government is extending the smoking ban so as to offer greater protection to non—smokers.</p>
              <p>The move is music to the ears of non—smokers.</p>
              <p>"I think it will be a better environment for everyone," said a non—smoker.</p>
              <p>"If
              you don’t ban (smoking), those teenagers, school—going children will
              tend to buy (cigarettes) and smoke. It’s not good for them. So ban (it)
              totally is better," said another.</p>
              <p>But others are not happy over the ban.</p>
              <p>"It’s
              a good idea....but in the open (areas), they should give people
              choices. If there’s a group of people smoking, (if) you don’t like the
              smell, you don’t go near them," said a member of the public.</p>
              <p>"Air is everywhere, so when you smoke.... it (the smoke) will also travel, so there’s no point....." said another.</p>
              <p>The latest expansion of smoke—free areas will not stop here, as there are plans to further extend the smoking ban. — CNA/ir</p>
