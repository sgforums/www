              <p>ABOUT 11/2 years ago, country club supervisor Ibrahim Mat watched his
              assistant bleed profusely from the nose because he had nose cancer.</p>
              <p>His assistant, Mr Yip Kok Lung, a non-smoker in his 30s, had developed the disease from passive smoking.</p>
              <p>Months later - after accompanying Mr Yip on 12 hospital trips -
              Mr Ibrahim, then a chain-smoker, felt so guilty that he bit the bullet.</p>
              <p>He signed up with Cabaran Muharam ('cabaran' means challenge
              in Malay, while 'Muharam' refers to the Muslim New Year), a programme
              which challenges Malay smokers to abstain from cigarettes for a month.</p>
              <p>Mr Ibrahim, 51, who started smoking at 14, has been smoke-free ever since.</p>
              <p>'My friend was in constant pain and had to eat out of a tube.
              From that day on, I knew I had to quit,' said Mr Ibrahim, who used to
              smoke two packets of cigarettes a day.</p>
              <p>'It was horrible seeing him suffer.'</p>
              <p>The father of three won this year's challenge, and was speaking
              yesterday at the launch of the 2009 run, which began yesterday and will
              last through January.</p>
              <p>In its fifth year, and organised by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and the</p>
              <p>Malay-Muslim community group Clubilya, the challenge will
              provide smokers who sign up with free workshops to teach them
              strategies on quitting.</p>
              <p>Mr Hawazi Daipi, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Health and Manpower), was the guest of honour yesterday.</p>
              <p>So far, 538 participants have registered for next year.</p>
              <p>In the past few years, an average of 10 per cent of these participants successfully stopped smoking for a month.</p>
              <p>Currently, 18.6 per cent of Malays aged 18 to 69 smoke - the
              highest compared to other ethnic groups. The national average is 12.6
              per cent.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Sazali Wahid, 48, who is an HPB consultant for
              quitting smoking: 'It is not easy to quit, but the challenge is a
              platform to get smokers to commit to quitting. It is important, because
              many are ambivalent about it and need a push.'</p>
              <p>Side effects range from headaches to nausea, said Mr Sazali, himself an ex-smoker.</p>
              <p>'But once they have stayed smoke-free for a month, about 80 per cent of the participants never go back,' he said.</p>
              <p>It will be a real challenge for goods transport driver Mohamad Zali, 29, who has signed up for the latest challenge.</p>
              <p>'I smoke when I drive, I smoke when I wait for goods to be loaded.</p>
              <p>'But both my wife and son have asthma, and I will try my best to quit,' he said.</p>
