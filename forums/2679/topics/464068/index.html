              <p>The National  Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) was formed to 
              develop and implement smoking control programmes to reduce the smoking 
              rates in Singapore. The NTCP utilises a multi-pronged approach to combat
               smoking. Strategies include taxation, tobacco control legislation, 
              public education, collaborative partnerships and provision of smoking 
              cessation services to combat smoking by reducing the supply and demand 
              of tobacco.</p>
              <h2><a id="1" class="bookmark" title="1" name="1"></a>Tobacco taxation</h2>
              <p>The
               Health Promotion Board plays an active role in advocating and 
              recommending tobacco taxation strategies, and works in partnership with 
              the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance on a regular basis.   
              Taxation has been shown to be a cost effective strategy to reduce 
              smoking prevalence rates. A study by the World Bank showed that for 
              every 10% increase in the real    inflation adjusted    price, there 
              will be a decrease in the consumption of cigarettes by 2% - 8%. Local 
              data has shown that increasing cigarette prices correspond to a 
              decreasing per capita consumption.</p>
              <p>Tobacco tax has increased 
              regularly since 1987 to discourage non-smokers from picking up the 
              smoking habit, and to encourage current smokers to stop or smoke less. 
              The current cigarette tax is $0.352 per stick of 1g or below, and an 
              additional $0.352 per stick of 1g for each additional 1g or part 
              thereof.</p>
              <h2><a id="2" class="bookmark" title="2" name="2"></a>Tobacco control legislation</h2>
              <p>Legislative
               measures, started in the early 1970s, undergo regular reviews to 
              incorporate the best international practices, as well as to keep up with
               social behaviour trends among Singaporeans. The two main legislation 
              instruments are:</p>
              <p>The  <strong>Smoking (Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) Act</strong> (enforced by the  <a title="Health Sciences Authority" href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_products_regulation/tobacco.print.html?Status=1">Health Sciences Authority</a>), which includes:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Prohibiting tobacco advertisements and promotion.</li>
              <li>Mandatory rotation of graphic health warnings on tobacco products.</li>
              <li>Limiting the tar and nicotine levels of cigarettes sold locally.</li>
              <li>Prohibiting the use of tobacco products by persons below 18 years of age.</li>
              <li>Prohibiting the sale/supply of tobacco to these under-aged youths.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In
               July 2010, the Parliament passed the Amendment Bill to the Smoking 
              (Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) Act which was 
              subsequently renamed as the  <a title="Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act" href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_products_regulation/legislation.html#Smoking"><strong>Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act</strong></a><span class="linkExt">.</span> The proposed amendments aim to strengthen Singapore   s tobacco control efforts and include:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Removing an exemption clause that currently allows tobacco companies to be acknowledged for sponsoring events;</li>
              <li>Empowering Minister to prohibit the import and sale of emerging tobacco products;</li>
              <li>Expanding
               the scope of the Smoking (CAST) Act to comprehensively cover different 
              forms of tobacco products, including tobacco derivatives and substitutes
               not covered under the Medicines Act for medicinal purposes;</li>
              <li>Extending health warning labelling to the outside packaging of tobacco products; and</li>
              <li>Prohibiting misleading labelling on tobacco products, such as    mild   ,    lights    or    low tar   .</li>
              </ol>
              <p>For more information on the Amendment Bill, please refer to the  <span class="linkExt"><a title="Second Reading Speech" href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/speeches.aspx?id=24666">Second Reading Speech</a></span> and  <span class="linkExt"><a title="Closing Speech" href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/speeches.aspx?id=24666">Closing Speech</a></span> by the Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan.</p>
              <p>2. The <span class="linkExt"><a title="Prohibition on Smoking in Certain Places Act" href="http://app2.nea.gov.sg/ban_non_air_conditioned_indoor_outdoor.aspx"><strong>Prohibition on Smoking in Certain Places Act</strong></a></span> (enforced by the  <a title="National Environment Agency" href="http://app2.nea.gov.sg/faq_smoking_ban_in_public_places.aspx#q1">National Environment Agency</a>)
               prohibits smoking in public places. To date, the Act has been extended 
              progressively to include all public transport, air-conditioned indoor 
              workplaces and restaurants, non-air-conditioned indoor places; hospitals
               and educational facilities, pubs and bars; and some outdoor places.</p>
              <p>Places under the ambit of the smoking ban include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Public transport, clinics, hospitals, maternity homes, nursing homes.</li>
              <li>Public libraries, libraries in institutions of higher learning, public museums, art galleries, government workplaces.</li>
              <li>Rooms
               used for public functions, public areas in banks, indoor sports stadia,
               bowling alleys, billiards saloons, gymnasiums, aerobic and fitness 
              centres, fast food centres, air-conditioned restaurants, mini 
              supermarkets, supermarkets, departmental stores, coffee shops and hawker
               centres.</li>
              <li>All air-conditioned workplaces, Changi International 
              Airport, all air-conditioned shopping centres, public queues, public 
              toilets, swimming pools, stadia and pedestrian underpasses.</li>

              <li>Air-conditioned and enclosed areas in private clubs, and air-conditioned shops in town centres, hotels and petrol stations.</li>
              <li>All hawker centres, coffee shops and al fresco eating establishments.</li>
              <li>All entertainment outlets, including pubs, bars, discos and lounges.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The
               smoking ban has recently been further extended in January 2009 to 
              include non air-conditioned indoor places such as factories, underground
               and multi-storey carparks; and some outdoor places such as children's 
              playgrounds, exercise areas, markets, ferry terminals and jetties.</p>
              <h2><a id="3" class="bookmark" title="3" name="3"></a>Public education</h2>
              <p>Public
               education is intended for prevention of initiation of smoking, as well 
              as for provision of information to both smokers and non-smokers.</p>
              <p>HPB
               works with community organisations and organises roadshows with Quit 
              Advisors on-site to provide advice to both smokers and non-smokers. 
              Efforts to raise awareness of smoking-related issues among the general 
              public also include the annual month-long smoking control campaign, held
               in conjunction with World No Tobacco Day on 31st May. On this day, 
              through HPB   s efforts, many tobacco retailers cease sales of 
              cigarettes and cigars in an extraordinary show of support. Some of the 
              past campaigns include the Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COLD) 
              campaign held in May 2008 and the hard hitting Oral Cancer campaign, 
              which was adapted from Australia, in 2007.</p>
              <p>Extending beyond public education, HPB has also developed programmes targeted at specific subgroups of at-risk adults.</p>
              <p>To curb the increasing trend of smoking among young women (18-29 years), HPB launched <a class="linkExt" href="http://www.freshair.sg/">Fresh Air For Women</a>,
               in August 2004. This on-going programme provides women smokers with the
               relevant information and social support network to help them quit 
              smoking.   Adopting an integrated approach, this programme incorporates 
              marketing, public relations and partnerships to reach the young women 
              with educational, motivational and empowerment messages.</p>
              <p>To tackle
               the smoking rates among the Malay community, HPB partners with mosques 
              and Malay/Muslim organisations to implement customised educational 
              initiatives and intervention programs. An example of a programme that 
              weaves in religious and cultural practices is the Muharram Challenge, 
              which is an intensive one-month programme to encourage Malay smokers to 
              quit smoking at the start of the Muslim calendar year.</p>
              <h2><a id="4" class="bookmark" title="4" name="4"></a>Partnerships</h2>
              <p>Partnerships
               are key to the successful implementation of HPB   s programmes. HPB 
              actively engages educational institutions, private workplaces, the 
              uniformed groups, healthcare professionals, youth organisations, 
              community and religious groups, and parents, to promote a smoke-free 
              lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Healthcare professionals are a major partnership group 
              for HPB. Evidence-based programmes include hospital in-patient services 
              that offer bedside brief advice to patients who are smokers. HPB 
              provides smoking cessation counselling to women smokers attending 
              antenatal and postnatal clinics at Singapore   s dedicated women   s and
               children   s public hospitals.</p>
              <p>HPB also trains pharmacists, 
              General Practitioners, optometrists and dentists to provide 
              opportunistic smoking cessation advice to patients. Capacity building 
              for smoking cessation counselling is conducted through various training 
              courses such as the Certification for Quit Smoking Consultants (CQSC) 
              Program, launched in 2005. The CQSC course aims to enhance and maintain 
              therapy standards among HPB   s service providers and healthcare 
              partners.</p>
              <p>Workplaces are excellent platforms to develop 
              comprehensive and sustainable health promotion programmes to address 
              issues affecting the health and health behaviours of the working 
              population. HPB provides consultancies to help workplaces set-up 
              workplace smoking cessation programs. Training is conducted regularly to
               equip health promotion facilitators with advocacy skills to secure 
              management buy-in and programme planning skills to implement in-house 
              cessation interventions and year-long educational activities.</p>
              <p>In 
              addition, HPB also works with the various uniformed groups to implement 
              smoking control programmes. Via these partners, HPB has put in place 
              several measures such as partial smoking bans within army camps, health 
              awareness talks and smoking cessation services.</p>
              <h2><a id="5" class="bookmark" title="5" name="5"></a>Provision of smoking cessation services</h2>
              <p>One of the key strategies of the NTCP is to offer smoking cessation services that are affordable and accessible to smokers.</p>
              <p>Since
               the 1990s, smoking cessation services have been integrated into the 
              primary healthcare settings such as the hospitals and polyclinics. These
               services are also now available in non-governmental organisations such 
              as the Singapore Cancer Society, Singapore Heart Foundation, Youngberg 
              Wellness Centre and retail pharmacy chains, providing a wide network of 
              accessible smoking cessation services for smokers.</p>
              <p><strong>HPB also 
              manages a QuitLine (1800 438-2000) to provide personalised advice by 
              trained Quit Advisors on how to quit smoking. Through this toll-free 
              hotline, the public can also request for free self-help print resources 
              to be mailed to them.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <p>Smoking is an addictive behaviour which is mostly picked up 
              during adolescence. The prevalence of smoking on at least one day in 
              past 30 days declined from 11% in 2000 to 9% in 2006 to 6% in 2009. 
              Youth pick up smoking easily, for example due to peer influence or 
              simply out of curiosity.</p>
              <p>HPB implements a variety of tobacco 
              control programmes for children, teenagers and youth. Besides targeting 
              the general youth population, programmes are also tailored to suit 
              specific youth groups. In addition, teachers, parents and counsellors 
              are engaged to help youth lead smoke-free lives.</p>
              <h2>Targeting the general youth population</h2>
              <h3>Educational activities in schools</h3>
              <p>HPB organises a variety of activities aimed at raising youth's 
              awareness about benefits of leading a tobacco-free lifestyle, dispelling
               common misconceptions of smoking (e.g. I can quit smoking anytime; 
              Smoking helps me to lose weight, etc) and equipping youth with life 
              skills (e.g. self-esteem, decision-making) to refuse cigarette offers.</p>
              <p>Interactive programmes such as skits, Too Tuff To Puff Sports Programme
               and ‘Live It Up’ tobacco prevention module are some examples of the 
              school-based initiatives coordinated for youth studying in pre-schools, 
              primary schools, secondary schools, pre-universities and Institutions of
               Higher Learning.</p>
              <p>HPB also works with youth groups to develop and
               implement creative initiatives to promote a tobacco-free lifestyle 
              among their peers. This includes programmes under the Youth Advolution 
              for Health (YAH) Programme*. A signature event under the YAH Programme 
              is the commemoration of World No Tobacco Day.</p>
              <h2>Empowering teachers, youth workers, counsellors and parents</h2>
              <p>HPB also engages teachers, youth workers, counsellors and parents in 
              promoting a smoke-free lifestyle among the young. Regular workshops are 
              conducted to keep them updated on youth smoking issues and equip them 
              with skills to discuss related issues to help youth lead a smoke-free 
              lifestyle.</p>
              <p>HPB also arranges for parenting workshops, entitled 
              ‘Parents, You Can Make A Difference: Raising Smoke-Free Teens’, at FSCs 
              and schools.</p>
              <h2>Targeting at-risk youth</h2>
              <p>HPB adopts a 
              targeted approach by collaborating with schools, Family Service Centres 
              (FSCs) and various youth and public organisations to hold activities to 
              help at-risk youth embrace a smoke-free lifestyle. Activities include 
              social etiquette-cum-grooming courses and soccer clinics where smoking 
              control education is presented in refreshing ways.</p>
              <p>HPB also 
              organises training sessions for youth facilitators and counsellors who 
              work with at-risk youth, to equip them with knowledge and skills to help
               the young stay away from tobacco.</p>
              <p>Smoking cessation services are
               available for youth smokers in schools and most polyclinics. HPB trains
               teachers or counsellors to equip them with knowledge and skills to help
               students who smoke to kick the habit.</p>
              <p>Face-to-face smoking 
              cessation counselling is supplemented by a  web-based smoking cessation 
              programme, available at www.breakfree.sg. This programme will provide 
              additional online guidance and support for today s net-savvy youth.</p>
              <h2>Encouraging positive parental role modelling</h2>
              <p>Parental smoking can result in children picking up smoking.  The 
              Student Health Survey 2009 conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB)
               showed that 50% of youth smokers had at least one parent who smoked. 
              Similarly, a study by researchers at Dartmouth College revealed that 
              children with parents who smoked were 4 times more likely to purchase 
              cigarettes, as compared to children with non-smoker parents.</p>
              <p>Since 2009, HPB has stepped up programmes to encourage smoker parents to
               kick the habit. These include promoting positive parental role 
              modelling and engaging healthcare professionals to reiterate to parents 
              the importance of being tobacco-free.</p>
              <h2>Partnering youth-centric partners</h2>
              <p>HPB is always seeking to work with relevant partners to incorporate 
              tobacco-control messages in their premises, products, programmes or 
              events. If you have a proposal to share with us, please contact Miss 
              Diana Sim at <a href="mailto:diana_sim@hpb.gov.sg">diana_sim@hpb.gov.sg</a></p>
              <h2>Prohibition of under-aged smoking</h2>
              <p>Youth below the age of 18 years are prohibited by law to smoke or 
              purchase any tobacco products. HPB works with the Tobacco Regulation 
              Unit, Health Sciences Authority to put in place restrictions and develop
               resources to enable retailers to refuse sale of tobacco products to 
              youth below 18 years of age.</p>
              <h2>Leveraging on youth-centric media</h2>
              <p>Non-traditional and youth-centric media such as internet blogs, 
              websites, radio, ZoCards and youth magazines are extensively used to 
              reach out to the young to promote a tobacco-free lifestyle.</p>
