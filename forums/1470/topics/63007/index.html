            <div class='col-md body'>29/11/2003<br>Third time no luck..., but nearly. Real Madrid earned a valuable point from their visit to one of the toughest grounds in first division. They played a spotless Osasuna, which showed its standing on the table and its aspiration to European goals. The Whites played very seriously and managed to get over the first blow by local forward Bakayoko. Their reaction was fantastic and the target was finally hit by Ronaldo in the second half. Beckham had to leave the field with an injury after doing the best performance of the Whites alongside the Brazilian striker. He had to be replaced in the late minutes when Queiroz' boys were showing their best play.<br><br>Queiroz made a more classic choice with a very clear-cut 4-4-2 lineup. Beckham and Solari were positioned at the flanks; Cambiasso took over the defensive front line and Guti made the link with the strikers, though he also swapped positions with the English, who displayed a powerful drive all the time. The spirit of the team did not change though, as they stuck to the obsession to control the ball right from kick-off. They tried hard to do so despite the overwhelming pressure of the home side.<br>The locals were highly motivated by the great atmosphere on Pamplona's stands. The crowd supported the amazing authority that their side enjoyed for the early ten minutes of play. Osasuna did wonderfully, including Bakayoko's hit in a top-quality action. They proved a constant danger on Casillas' goal.<br><br>Madrid was not doing badly, as all its moves flowed smoothly. However, their attacks did not seemed to match the local drive. Then, they stepped their play up with the result of Cambiasso's first warning. His long-range shot went too high. Ronaldo was the next to try on the local goal (27'). His shot hit Josetxo. The Brazilian went for it again dribbling past three defenders, but his assist finally got no destination. The tide of the play began to turn gradually as the goal-scoring opportunities were now on the other goal.<br><br>This change of course did not last much longer because Osasuna took a deep breath to show all their aggressiveness (three straight cards). The danger came from Valdo and Bakayoko's feet, which enjoyed the assistance of Alisi and Moha. The local coach was going for the attack and his tactics seemed to be getting a reward. In the meantime, Madrid tried hard to get its own. The most active player in the white side tonight was Ronaldo, who brushed the woodwork in the last dangerous action of the first half, with no doubt an exciting one.<br><br>Beckham to the centre<br>There was a tactic change in the second half. Beckham moved to the centre for good, leaving Guti's position further to the side. After that, NÃºÃ±ez came on to reinforce the right flank. Madrid got more possession of the ball. Osasuna was encouraged by a favourable score that they did not want to risk. Besides, Valdo kept giving a lot of trouble to their old teammates (PavÃ³n, RÃ¡ul Bravo, NÃºÃ±ez...). The local coach seemed to have planned the game very well.<br><br>The circumstances seemed to point at a third straight defeat in Pamplona... but then, Ronaldo came up to show why he is the most lethal striker on earth. His great goal made the draw and puzzled the so far perfect play of the home side. It was a most harmful goal. Ronaldo took advantage of the bewilderment. The tables had been turned. Now the game was in Madrid's hands, and so was the ball and the opportunities. Beckham's unfortunate injury cooled down the Whites' ardour, as he has been the best white player. The draw finally seemed a good result for both sides.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>disgusting real madrid performance ....<br><br>i thot they really looked clueluess without ZZ's vision and passing in midfield<br>Figo's wing play and creativity<br>as well as Carlos direct and hard working running on the left flank<br>No one in madrid's lineup seem interested in taking charge of the game ... all passing the ball around wifout proper intent.<br><br>Think generally Real's defence all rite ... except for the moment when Bakayoko turned the last man and shot past Casillas ...<br>Midfield, Becks wif setting up the equaliser ... he was alrite in the game. Guti and Solari was horrible ... they lost the ball and did not want to fight 4 de ball. Cambiasso .... so so ...<br>Raul very quiet in the game ... sigh ... guess he was missing his best partner in crime: ZZ<br>Ronaldo superb equaliser ... out of nothing ... nice snap shot ... several occassions quite selfish ... but definitely was one of the Best players on the pitch.</div>
