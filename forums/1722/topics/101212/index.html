Your mind isnÂ’t wandering, you are not thinking of something else; you are totally involved in what you are doing Â… Your energy is flowing very smoothly. You feel relaxed, comfortable, and energetic.Â’<br><br>A rock climber explains how it feels when he is scaling a mountain: Â‘You are so involved in what you are doing [that] you arenÂ’t thinking of yourself as separate from the immediate activity Â… You donÂ’t see yourself as separate from what you are doing.Â’<br><br>A mother who enjoys the time spent with her small daughter. Â‘Her reading is the one thing that sheÂ’s really into, and we read together. She reads to me and I read to her, and thatÂ’s a time when I sort of lose touch with the rest of the world, IÂ’m totally absorbed in what IÂ’m doing.Â’<br><br>A chess player tells of playing in a tournament: Â‘Â… the concentration is like breathing Â– you never think of it.  The roof could fall in and, if it missed you, you would be unaware of it.Â’<br><br><strong>(Csikszentmihalyi, 1992, pp. 53-4)<br>Csikszentmihalyi, M.

According to him, we have the ability to direct our conscious and such skill is important in improving our psychological well-being.   Flow experience, thus involves concentration of consciousness.  It can be as exciting as participating in a car race or as simple as taking a slip of coffee.<br><br>According to him, most of us spend too much time engaging in passive activities such as watching TV and hence unable to involve flow experience.  Thus if we are able to organize activities that allow flow experience to occur regularly, we can improve our quality of our lives and psychological well-being.<br><br>On the other hand I am not too sure about the last sentence which implies that flow experience will always lead to improving the quality of our lives.  What we enjoy doing most may not always be good for us, such as gambling, drug abuse, etc.<br><br>But if we apply this concept to positive activities I believe to a certain extent it does makes us feel more alive.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>(If my interpretation of the concept/theory is wrong, please correct me.

You feel relaxed, comfortable, and energetic.Â’<br><br>A rock climber explains how it feels when he is scaling a mountain: Â‘You are so involved in what you are doing [that] you arenÂ’t thinking of yourself as separate from the immediate activity Â… You donÂ’t see yourself as separate from what you are doing.Â’<br><br>A mother who enjoys the time spent with her small daughter. Â‘Her reading is the one thing that sheÂ’s really into, and we read together. She reads to me and I read to her, and thatÂ’s a time when I sort of lose touch with the rest of the world, IÂ’m totally absorbed in what IÂ’m doing.Â’<br><br>A chess player tells of playing in a tournament: Â‘Â… the concentration is like breathing Â– you never think of it.  The roof could fall in and, if it missed you, you would be unaware of it.Â’<br><br><strong>(Csikszentmihalyi, 1992, pp. 53-4)<br>Csikszentmihalyi, M.

You are so engrossed in what you are doing that you are mentally Â‘cut offÂ’ from your surrounding?

According to him, we have the ability to direct our conscious and such skill is important in improving our psychological well-being.   Flow experience, thus involves concentration of consciousness.  It can be as exciting as participating in a car race or as simple as taking a slip of coffee.<br><br>According to him, most of us spend too much time engaging in passive activities such as watching TV and hence unable to involve flow experience.  Thus if we are able to organize activities that allow flow experience to occur regularly, we can improve our quality of our lives and psychological well-being.<br><br>On the other hand I am not too sure about the last sentence which implies that flow experience will always lead to improving the quality of our lives.  What we enjoy doing most may not always be good for us, such as gambling, drug abuse, etc.<br><br>But if we apply this concept to positive activities I believe to a certain extent it does makes us feel more alive.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>(If my interpretation of the concept/theory is wrong, please correct me.
