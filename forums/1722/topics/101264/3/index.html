            <div class='col-md body'>i wear my watch whenever i go, i check my time from 4 different sources at home and i will check my watch every now and den, roughly every 10 minutes unless i am busy with something else, then i will check every 25 to 30 minutes, keeping myself updated with time gives me a sense of confidence that i noe what i am doing.<br><br>i used to play with time but timing myself to reach the mrt station exactly in certain period of time, dat means, i have 5 minutes to reach downstairs, 10 minutes to reach mrt station, 6 minutes to wait for mrt, which i will gain around 70% if im lucky.. etc etc. even during exams, i can time pretty well, always ensuring i can get out before the time limit when students aren't allowed to leave.<br><br>back then when i spent all my time chatting on a us website, i had to take note of ca time as well, i had my duties on the web community and we even had online meetings and crap for staff.. imagine having a virtual meeting 3 am in the morning.<br><br>but.. if no watch or anything, its okay la, for a long period of time i oso no watch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> no prob.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">I haven't come across any specific implications about watch wearers.  Of course, issues associated with watch-wearing are interesting.<br><br>The most obvious of these would be a preoccupation with time, which, barring any reason to make such a preoccupation necessary, might be viewed as obsessive behaviour.<br><br>I once looked after a kid who was on the slow side  - he was from an inbred family, and while he didn't fit the criteria to be classified as intellectually disabled, he was quite visibly below average in intellectual ability.  When he was removed from the family home by order of the Family Court (mom was breeding him to be her next sexual partner), he had to call his mother at 7 every evening.  At 6.57 he would start staring at his digital watch (which he NEVER took off) and remind me how many minutes there were to go till he had to make his call, every minute on the dot.<br><br>Eventually, this got really annoying for my colleagues and myself, so I started a systematic desensitisation program.  I started all the kids on their household chores at 6.30, so that they would be done by 7.  Over the course of a few weeks, I moved the start time slowly up to 6.45, and initially this kid made a big hue and cry about not being able to make his call at 7 sharp.  However, over the next few weeks, he found that he could make his call at 7.15 and still be all right, so I never heard him whinging about calling at 7 sharp again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Of course, watch-wearing may not be a matter of time at all.  Both my Rolexes are COSC-certified, making them the most accurate mechanical watches around.  That said, I'm almost always late for wherever I'm going. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In my particular instance, the watch is more of an accessory than a timepiece - hell, if I wanted to tell time, I'd wear a Seiko.  This brings us into the area of social psychology.<br><br>I use a Rolex as a conversation piece - there have been many instances where I've struck up a good conversation with a complete stranger who also happens to wear a Rolex (they're usually pretty well-heeled and high-powered, but that's another matter altogether <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).  To some extent, what we wear reflects our personalities, and it's a useful tool for identifying common ground.<br><br>Just a few weeks ago, I struck up conversation with an Australian film producer who happened to be wearing a Rolex.  I found out that he was a 20-year veteran of the Australian SAS, and he had a very utilitarian view about owning his watch.  Specifically, he said, "This is one of the few watches that you can trade in for a first-class ticket home when everything else has been stolen".<br><br>He also observed that, when doing business in Asia, a Rolex states quite loudly that you mean business.  Personally, I've found that a bit of Swiss bling can be quite unsettling for non-Rolex wearers - it's a subtle but effective tactic when negotiations get tough.<br><br>Note: the above isn't about bragging rights - it's written as an illustration of the social psychological aspect of the subject.</div></blockquote>Sounds like classical conditioning. The poor boy got so used to making that call at 7pm that he would whinge when he isn't.<br><br>Yeah I can also verify your use of swiss time pieces to strike up conversations! It's great though.<br>Saving up for my bling bling...</div>
