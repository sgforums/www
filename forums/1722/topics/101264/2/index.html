            <div class='col-md body'>im surprised too how little people wear watches hmmm<br><br>im highly dependant on my watch and if i step out of the house without it, i'll be in anxiety and i actually believe i'll be quite lost without my watch. physically and geographically lost. weird. its not as if my watch is a compass.<br><br>in my room i have 3 clocks lol<br><br>goes to show the fanatism eh?<br><br>but when i went to stay in a village for a month in thailand, i was without my watch and i felt so comfortable (after a while of course).<br><br>time is really judged by the sky and it could be pitch black and only 8pm but its ok... you dont feel time lost because theres so much time in the day.<br><br>i think people try to maximise the things they do with this construct of "time" by looking at a watch. so we tend to cut our time into portions so we can fit activities into these portions.<br><br>i guess thats why people have organizers and schedules.

            <div class='col-md body'>I haven't come across any specific implications about watch wearers.  Of course, issues associated with watch-wearing are interesting.<br><br>The most obvious of these would be a preoccupation with time, which, barring any reason to make such a preoccupation necessary, might be viewed as obsessive behaviour.<br><br>I once looked after a kid who was on the slow side  - he was from an inbred family, and while he didn't fit the criteria to be classified as intellectually disabled, he was quite visibly below average in intellectual ability.  When he was removed from the family home by order of the Family Court (mom was breeding him to be her next sexual partner), he had to call his mother at 7 every evening.  At 6.57 he would start staring at his digital watch (which he NEVER took off) and remind me how many minutes there were to go till he had to make his call, every minute on the dot.<br><br>Eventually, this got really annoying for my colleagues and myself, so I started a systematic desensitisation program.  I started all the kids on their household chores at 6.30, so that they would be done by 7.  Over the course of a few weeks, I moved the start time slowly up to 6.45, and initially this kid made a big hue and cry about not being able to make his call at 7 sharp.  However, over the next few weeks, he found that he could make his call at 7.15 and still be all right, so I never heard him whinging about calling at 7 sharp again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Of course, watch-wearing may not be a matter of time at all.  Both my Rolexes are COSC-certified, making them the most accurate mechanical watches around.  That said, I'm almost always late for wherever I'm going. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In my particular instance, the watch is more of an accessory than a timepiece - hell, if I wanted to tell time, I'd wear a Seiko.  This brings us into the area of social psychology.<br><br>I use a Rolex as a conversation piece - there have been many instances where I've struck up a good conversation with a complete stranger who also happens to wear a Rolex (they're usually pretty well-heeled and high-powered, but that's another matter altogether <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).  To some extent, what we wear reflects our personalities, and it's a useful tool for identifying common ground.<br><br>Just a few weeks ago, I struck up conversation with an Australian film producer who happened to be wearing a Rolex.  I found out that he was a 20-year veteran of the Australian SAS, and he had a very utilitarian view about owning his watch.  Specifically, he said, "This is one of the few watches that you can trade in for a first-class ticket home when everything else has been stolen".<br><br>He also observed that, when doing business in Asia, a Rolex states quite loudly that you mean business.  Personally, I've found that a bit of Swiss bling can be quite unsettling for non-Rolex wearers - it's a subtle but effective tactic when negotiations get tough.<br><br>Note: the above isn't about bragging rights - it's written as an illustration of the social psychological aspect of the subject.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gedanken, interesting post.  Just wondering what if it is a woman who is wearing a Rolex? Will it have the same effect?  HmmÂ…<br><br>Just to sidetrack a bit.  Regarding being late for appointment esp. going off to work, personally I believe it is an unconscious habit usually due to some hidden reasons.  Maybe unconsciously you wanted to be late!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Take me for example; I used to set my watch 10 minutes even half an hour earlier in order not to be late for work.  At first this method seemed to be working fine.  But gradually even this failed, reason being I was fully aware that IÂ’ve set the watch earlier.

Just wondering what if it is a woman who is wearing a Rolex? Will it have the same effect?  HmmÂ…<br><br>Just to sidetrack a bit.  Regarding being late for appointment esp. going off to work, personally I believe it is an unconscious habit usually due to some hidden reasons.

I am not suggesting that you totally lost track of time.  My boss will kill me too if I did not finish my report on time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Just try not to keep on checking out for the time unnecessary.
