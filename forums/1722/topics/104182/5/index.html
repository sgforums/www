            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting case, Gazelle.<br><br>Well, if you're interested in my bona fides, you already have the basic facts.  You can call the lecturers at either university to confirm that I did in fact attend and graduate from those universities - if you do call Swinburne, make sure that the lecturers were there before 1997, as there have been a fair few changes in the Psychology department.  After you're done, you may as well do me yet another favour and report your findings - you'll only add to the credibility that you've already provided me.  In particular, A/Prof Richard Bell at Melbourne University may just confirm that I broke the departmental record by completing my thesis in eight months, although he'd probably call me a lazy bastard at the same time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Even better, contact the library at Melbourne University and request a copy of my thesis - you might have to pay for it, though.</div>
