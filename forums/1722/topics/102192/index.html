            <div class='col-md body'>As a freethinker I usually donÂ’t mix religions with Psychology.  But sometimes in order to demonstrate a point, I have to break my silence.  I have a friend who is into child development; she is actually the boss of a childcare center.<br><br>One thing I donÂ’t see eye-to-eye with her is that she likes to use the concept of <strong>Â‘object permanenceÂ’ </strong>to support the existence of God/gods and the Â‘backwardÂ’ mentality of non-believers. (I do not wish to turn this into another religions thread so I shall not disclose her religion)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>According to the <strong>Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980)</strong> very young babies perceives the world around them as <strong>impermanent</strong>.  Basically it means that if they are unable to perceive an object in a certain ways, <strong>it ceases to exist.</strong>  For example if you takes a toy away from a baby while he/she is playing with and keep it away from his/her, he/she will simply lost interests in it.  She/He may tries to grab it away from you, but once he/she canÂ’t see it, to him/her, it ceases to exist, out of sight, out of mind.<br><br>As we grow older we know very well that the world continue to exist although we may not see it.  We understand the concept of <strong>object permanence</strong>.<br><br>So my dear friend loves to use this concept to belittle non-believers.  She will bring in this concept and proceed to ask them why are they behaving like babies? If you are unable to see God/gods, does that mean that God/gods donÂ’t exist?  Of course those who have not read about Jean PiagetÂ’s theory will be completely speechless and she will continues to Â‘bombardÂ’ them with all her other theories.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>What I want to point out is that there is a flaw in her argument.<br><br><strong>In object permanence, the baby has actually seen the toy.</strong>  It was only when it was taken away from him/her when he/she perceives it as non-existence.  <strong> Religion is all about Faith. </strong> To a religious person, he/she does not to see God/gods to know God/gods exists.  As for non-believers, since they do not share the same faith, it is understandable that they would first want to be able to perceive God/gods in a certain ways before making a decision.<br><br>Thus it will be unfair to use the concept of object permanence to explain why non-believers do not believe the existence of Gods/gods.<br><br>So Cindy, did I answer your question?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The use of psychology to further a hidden agenda  is offensive and certainly merits censure for professional misconduct.<br><br>In fact, the Psychologists' Registration Act in Australia was written because of such misconduct.  Scientologists were offering free psychological tests to draw the unwary into their church, and as a result of this abuse and the ill-effects it had on the said unwary, the Act was introduced to ensure that quacks could not legitimately create damage by claiming to be psychologists.<br><br>Unfortunately, of course, that does not entirely stop quacks from wreaking havoc, as in your friend's case, DP.  She's a classic case of how a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.<br><br>You've hit the nail on the head there by showing how she has failed to justify a case of object permanence here.  Because nobody has actually physically seen God, the principle does not apply.  Excellent work!<br><br>In any case, she shows faulty logic here.  While not seeing something does not confirm the lack of something's existence, it is a stretch to extend that conclusion as proof that something exists.  Perhaps you could clobber her over the head with some Cartesian logic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
