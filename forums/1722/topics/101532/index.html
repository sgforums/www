            <div class='col-md body'>Just saw the show "Identity"....it's quite a complicated show but the main theme i guess is about multiple personalities...okie cut the story short..<br><br>If ppl were to see it from a lay man's pt of view, they may think of it as though he is possessed by some demons..but a psychologist would look at it as a mental disorder due to stress, or traumatic experience..etc<br><br>Interesting right? So what 's your opinion on this? Can this be explained or it's totally supernatural?(possession by demons)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually psychologists, psychotherapists, etc do not link the causes of mental problems with religions.  Take for example consciousness. As far as I know, till now there is no theory that can fully explained how does consciousness comes about or where exactly is it located? (In the brain?)  If you adopt a religious approach the answer is simple, consciousness is the soul.  Do you believe it? Well it is entirely up to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In the case of Multiple Personalities, personally I think the best perspective to address this problem is the Psychodynamic Perspective.  It is possible to use defence mechanisms especially splitting to explain Multiple Personalities.  If you are interested, you can read up on Freud, Klein, Jung, and etc. arguments on the fragmented selfhood.  It is too long to summarize their points, but if I got the time in the future I will try to post them here.<br><br>By the way in my opinion Multiple Personalities is not the same with Social Roles/Social Identities.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not psychologist.<br>But my lay man understanding is..

One time she dyed her hair all blond cos "The bad people are coming to get me, i know you can't see them, but they are coming." We discussed this after watching a beautiful mind together, he said that it is partly genetic. Since then, i've been 'watching' out for him.

Gedanken, wasn't there someone who was recorded to have up to 80 personalities? I don't know, i read it somewhere...  can't remember where. Supposedly these personalities take over the body and the actual person cannot remember what was said or what they did. Well.. that's what i think anyway.</div>

Schiz is actually a vague cluster of disorders that involve:<br>- distortions of reality<br>- disturbances in thought and language (this covers hallucinations)<br>- poor social skills<br><br>Sounds like the trolls on SGForums, doesn't it?<br><br>I wouldn't be particularly concerned about schizophrenia if I were your friend -IIRC, the last time I checked up on the figures, there less than a 5% chance of a schizophrenic person's child developing schizophrenia.  However, I'd stay well away from drugs if I were your friend - there's plenty of evidence that drug use triggers schizophrenia in people who are predisposed to it.<br><br>More likely than not, your friend's mother is on antipsychotics like Resperidone, which are meant to keep her from going overboard and becoming a danger to herself or others around her.  The prognosis is fairly poor - if you've kept a schizophrenic individual safe, clean, well-clothed and well-fed, chalk it up as a roaring success.<br><br>In your friend's mother's case, it appears to be pretty much the textbook definition of paranoid schizophrenia.  She doesn't see or hear any imaginary people.  Instead, she infers that they are there and out to get her by objects and events that she takes as evidence of their existence - though distortions of reality, anything can look suspicious.<br><br>I'm probably being hard-headed about it, but I haven't seen any research that convinces me that a person can have multiple personalities, instead of simply acting in an uncharacteristic manner as a reaction to severe stress.</div>
