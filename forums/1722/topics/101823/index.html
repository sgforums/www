            <div class='col-md body'>The overwhelming majority of my time studying and practicing psychology has been spent in Melbourne.  As such, I have found the level of use of psychology in a developed nation like Singapore quite surprising, and unfortunately disappointing.<br><br>Here are some examples of what I mean:<br><br>1) Former PM Goh's "stayers and quitters" speech:  Come on, even your average person on the street could see that this was going to piss people off instead of motivating them to stay or return.  This was a blunder that anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of psychology, much less the eggheads in government, could have easily avoided.  What happened?<br><br>2) The state of recruitment practices in Singapore is well behind that of other developed countries.  Not only do unstructured interviews seem to be the mainstay of recruitment in Singapore, the very fact that many employers announce "only successful applicants will be notified" would horrify practicioners worldwide.<br><br>Despite that, many Singaporeans flock to seminars by psychologists (or those claiming to be psychologists).  Is this a fad?<br><br>Like I said at the start, most of my time in the last ten years have been spent in Australia, and maybe I haven't been around long enough to see evidence of Singapore appreciating psychology to the extent that other developed countries do.  I'd like to hear your experiences and opinions, both positive and negative.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to hear your opinion, do you think the government takes Psychology in Singapore seriously?  I donÂ’t think so, when is the last time you hear the government praising doctors/ staffs from Institute of Mental Health?<br><br>The only time it came into the news was during the SARs period when some of the patients/staffs were suspected of having the virus.  Most of the time their contributions to this country remain unknown.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oddly enough, I think the government is probably the one body that best recognises psychology as a profession - in particular, the Ministries of Defence and Education are probably the biggest employers of psychologists here.<br><br>Part of the problem is public awareness of psychology.  When I was in LA last year, I was very surprised at how Americans who were not in the profession still had a good idea of what psychologists actually do.  The American Psychological Association has done a lot of work to get psychology recognised as a profession in the US, and of course the work performed in the course of the two World Wars made a significant contribution to how Americans view psychology.<br><br>Psychologists in the US certainly have it better than those in Singapore (and to some extent Australia) because more people actually know about it.  I suspect that in Singapore, people don't recognise the importance of psychology because they don't know enough about it.<br><br>That said, I think we do actually have it better here than in some other countries.  One of my former classmates is a military psychologist from the UAE, and he said he's got an uphill battle because some psychological principles are in conflict with the teachings of Islam.</div>

Going back to my earlier point about how psychology is taken stateside, Americans are a lot more conscious of the applications of psychology in fields such as management, market research and education.  In these parts, people still have difficulty making the distinction between psychiatrists and psychologists.</div>

Second, at the present time we don't know enough about most mental illnesses to develop preventative measures.</div>
