Sure enough there are a fair few psychiatrists out there who match your description, but there are also a few good ones who are trying to change things.<br><br>I had the good fortune to work as a research assistant with John Mathai at the Royal Children's Hospital, and he's a psychiatrist who's of the firm view that medication is absolutely the last resort.<br><br>One problem you will find in the psychiatric field is inappropriate use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.  The key characteristic of DSM-IV is differential diagnosis, by which diagnoses are reached only when all other possible causes of symptoms have been ruled out.  Of course, ruling out all other causes is often a long and complicated task, and so I have seen many cases of psychiatrists not performing the differential diagnosis thoroughly.<br><br>A classic case of this is ADHD.  Research has already comprehensively documented that the presenting symptoms of PTSD in children are very similar to those of ADHD.  Proper differential diagnosis is carried out by taking and examining a comprehensive patient history, with particular attention paid to family history.  I have seen plenty of cases where practicioners have failed to do so, and kids with PTSD end up diagnosed as having ADHD instead.<br><br>Of course, the worst part of this is the medication.  They go straight on to Ritalin, with a dose of Catapres at the end of the day to offset the hyperactivity spike when the Ritalin wears off.  As you would know, fymk, Catapres is also used to reduce blood pressure - you can just imagine what effects keeping an 8-year-old on Catapres would have after an extended period of time.<br><br>Anyway, back to John.  He was not satisfied with the diagnostic method, and came across some research into EEG readings showing that hyperactivity episodes are related to increased theta-wave activity and decreased beta-wave activity.  John was trying to get funding for research into using EEG as a diagnostic tool - if it can be validated as a diagnostic method, it gets us away from the guesswork that is currently used to diagnose ADHD (and that unnecessarily puts a lot of kids on Ritalin).<br><br>So, despite the ongoing rivalry between psychiatry and psychology, I'd say that there are a feww good psychiatrists out there, and if they have their way, the field will improve.</div>

I do know someone who was on antidepressants for years - tricyclics, SSRI, the works.  Eventually he got tired of having to deal with all of the side effects and decided to stop taking them altogether.  These days he's coping, although he does have depressive episodes now and then.<br>He's a rare case, though - I've seen a few other people try to get off the antidepressants, and within a week things have gotten so bad they've had to get back on the meds.<br><br>On the point of "talking away" a problem, most people naturally have a tendency to ask why someone is depressed.  If the depression is event-related like what fymk described, fine, but some days there is no "why" - it just is.
