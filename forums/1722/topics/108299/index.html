In direct answer to your first question, you will need to following to be a registered psychologist in Singapore:<br><br>1) A Master's degree or Doctorate and;<br>2) at least 400 hours of supervised practice and;<br>3) full membership of the Singapore Psychological Society<br><br>Those requirements are fairly relaxed.  I'm registered in Australia, and I needed a minimum of 960 hours of supervised practice to qualify.  I eventually got 1600 hours as part of my doctorate - the Master's students got 960.  Also, the degree had to be vetted to ensure that it met the registration board's requirements.<br><br>Singapore is not the most psychologically-aware country in the world, so you will probably find that pay scales are behind other countries.  When I graduated as an organisational psychologist, I was worth A$72,000 (about S$90,000) a year - I seriously doubt you would find the same deal here.  Also, pay varies according to the field of psychology in which you practice - as a comparison, a counselling psychologist with a doctorate would probably be worth A$40,000 on a good day.<br><br>Ultimately, you will find that, pay wise, breaking out on your own serves you much better than being employed as a psychologist.  Now that I'm running my own show, 72 grand a year is an unacceptable figure.<br>As for what university to get in, I'm not sure about Singaporean universities - perhaps one of the other guys here might know the state of affairs in Singapore.  What I can tell you about is the distinction between undergraduate and postgraduate courses.  Some universities are better at one than the other - I did my undergrad at Swinburne University, which gave me a very good grounding in the basics but could not offer adequate academic support for postgrad research.  On the other hand, I did my postgrad at Melbourne university, which provided great support for research but sucked at undergraduate training.  The Honours students I tutored while I was a postgrad were very weak in their basic skills, and I had to start teaching them from the ground up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering, how different is the work of a hospital-based psychologist from a psychiatrist?

            <div class='col-md body'>That's one thing.  Test administration and interpretation falls much more into psychologists' roles than psychiatrists'.

I'm not sure if you also need to be a qualified teacher to be an ed psych in Singapore.<br><br><strong>Social psychologists </strong><br>Social psychologists specialise in the interactions between people and their social environment.<br><br><strong>Organisational psychologists </strong><br>Org psychs deal with business-related psych issues.  The vast majority of the work is related to HR, but it also covers things like industrial relations and organisational behaviour.  Organisational psych is usually paired with industrial psych, which covers areas like ergonomics and human factors.<br><br>Note that the above list is a very broad description of the fields.  You can also see that the different fields can interact with each other - for example, counselling can be part of clinical practice, and social psych is part of organisational behaviour.<br><br>The above are all fields where one practices under the title of "psychologist".  On the other hand, you have jobs in which psychology comes in handy.  The obvious examples are HR and advertising.  If you're in HR or you're an advertiser, you can use what you've learned in psychology without having to practice as a psychologist.<br><br>Hope that starts to clear things up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>btw i was asked to do a simple write up on what inspired me to choose psycho as a choice..<br><br>and i typed this..can someone offer me any suggestions to edit ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>"My interest in psychology comes from mainly family experience, media &amp; crime documentaries and my strong interest in analysis. I have a relative suffering from a psychological problem and I am always interested in what goes on in a human mind and the causes that results in the problem. Of late, the government is concerned over the rising numbers of stress-related ailments in jobs and the risks of such ailments going undetected or untreated. Besides this, the fact that some social problems may be attributed to mental health issues is another reason for my interest in psychology because I have always wanted to analyse such situations to know why this is happening, find out and develop protocols to treat and prevent or lower the frequency of these kinds of problems. Lastly, the use and importance of behavioural analysis in some crime files to solving the case has always greatly interested me due to the application of the human mind."</div>
