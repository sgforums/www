I have a relative suffering from a psychological problem and I am always interested in what goes on in a human mind and the causes that results in the problem. Of late, the government is concerned over the rising numbers of stress-related ailments in jobs and the risks of such ailments going undetected or untreated. Besides this, the fact that some social problems may be attributed to mental health issues is another reason for my interest in psychology because I have always wanted to analyse such situations to know why this is happening, find out and develop protocols to treat and prevent or lower the frequency of these kinds of problems. Lastly, the use and importance of behavioural analysis in some crime files to solving the case has always greatly interested me due to the application of the human mind."</div></blockquote>Honest opinion?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Seems like I have a buddy in my line, I'm also working as an industrial and organisational psychologist concurrently, but my company originated from Thailand. It seems that Singaporean companies were pretty much skeptical in placing an I/O consultant to work related matters.<br><br>Back in the good old days, most big organisations have had an industrial psychologist, but practice was generally degenerated through the years, perhaps axed as I/O psychologist was pretty much of a 'luxury' position in companies, which of course, had no major contributions which deemed its position accountable, and which HR practioners could do as the better.<br><br>Most I/O Psychologist are now working as HR Managers, practioners etc... Although not carrying the tag, this role allows integration of psychology and practical, justifiable contributions to allow I/Os to get paid.<br><br>I took my bachelor and masters from Queensland back in Aussie.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, cool!  Pleased to meet you, Black_Ace!  I was from Melbourne Uni.<br><br>I think it made sense that I/O psychs were not employed in-house.  Let's face it - the nature of the work is more suited to an outsourcing arrangement anyway.  Even for HR practicioners, since HR is a support function rather than one that directly contributes to the bottom line (e.g. a manufacturing division), organisations tend not to treat HR as a core department.  I'm not sure if you know Mark Spatz, who used to run Ansett's department - his opinion is that it'll be a long time before HR gets a seat at the big table.  You often see HR being relegated to a payroll function instead of encompassing the broad range of duties that they're capable of.<br><br>I'm quite happy acting as a consultant - it makes for more interesting work.  I've known a few in-house I/O psychs, and they get to do a lot less than I do.<br><br></div>
