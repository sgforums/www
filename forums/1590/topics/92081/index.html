            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: white;"><span class="small">words i would never say to you but need to let out.....<br><br>dear you,<br><br>i spoke to colin yesterday and he told me you are over me. he told me i should get over you too. i wonder what made him say that when i didn't mention anything about not getting over you. i am over you. over you so many times. what still hurts me are the questions i have that i have no answer for. i don't know what lies you told your best fren. i am angry that once again u got no balls to be responsible for your actions. the hurt and pain u inflicted had brought me to the pits of emotions time and time again. you treated me like i am nothing special. you used me for your own selfish reason. come on, don't try to defend yourself, those words "i agreed to patch back becos i didn't want you to feel i am throwing you aside" where not words of love, they were pity, like throwing a dog a leftover. i am not your dog, i don't eat leftovers. you gave our relationship an expiry date and expected me to take it. you didn't bother keep our appointments and expect me to tolerate it. i left and cried for days, you didn't even send me a message. when i am finally calm. u contacted me again and messed up my emotions. i didn't want to get back with you even though i loved you. u picked me up at the airport and give me a flower - something u never did since you went to aus. you showered me with the care i was looking for and i was so foolish to fall again. i even agreed to 'be' your gal, stage a show for your dad and did all the things we used to do. you blew hot, i blew cold. i blew hot, you blew cold. you asked me out, bring me for trips. did all the things happy coupled do - create sweet memories but yet we are not a couple. finally i could not take it anymore and told you i never stopped loving you but situations are tearing us apart. i told you i would love you will all my heart and soul til the day i had to go. you never said a word. we drove back to brisbane. and that was the last day you show me any care or attention. you rushed ard to get your PR stuff ready. i followed you, cooked for you, clean the house, washed your clothes, made phone calls for you. i didn't complain even though u never brought me out for dates or trips again. 7 weeks passed, i would be leaving. you brought me out for dinner at the casino, our last dinner in brisbane, our last and only date since. i left on a plane, no having the heart to break up, we both stayed on in this limbo. the 5 weeks in singapore were a heartache, u only bothered to call me twice. once again u show me wat i am to you - a dog, good as a companion, forgotten when out of sight. i flew back to bris, you welcomed me. but then i knew i had to ask you one more question. on the mountian top, we talked, i ask you what you want of us and our relationship. you spoke nothing. i prayed, i cried. the next day, you showed me u have not changed. the jealousy monster appeared. you were jealous i was with my guy fren (a fren i have not seen for 7 yrs). u made me come home. i came home only to find you all ready to bring me over to your gal fren's place to help her move house. wat is this? i kept quiet when i found out abt the stuff u did for her and now u expect me to scarifice meeting my long lost fren just becos u want to help her move stuff? 3 days later, i have to leave again, this time for we will not meet again for a year or more. no answers came about the decision on us. i asked you again and u said "i want a relationship without strings". i held back the lump in my throat, held on to my mind and said "then you are asking me to be single but attached. that is not fair. i rather be single". you keep quiet, my heart is bleeding when i look at you. the last call sign is blinking furiously, i said "i'll be back in a years time,let see what happens then. i still love you". we shared one last kiss and that was the last time we touched.<br><br>it's been a year since that kiss. you had only called me once. everytime i had tried to talk to you, you brush me off. heartbroken, realising your promises are empty, realising i really don't have a place in your heart. my life spun out of control, i did all i can to erase you from my life - i destoryed mine. bet you say that is my choice. bet you would say i am the b|tch. bet you would put all the blame squarely on me. it's always be like this, never your fault but the world. i hate you. i hate you for stomping on my heart, i hate you for stringing me along for your own pleasure. i hate you for lying to me. i hate you for not having the balls to tell me you are tired of me. i hate you i hate you i hate you!!!<br><br>you are an ass-hole.<br><br>now someone had found me and is patiently nursing my heart back to life i don't need you or your best fren to tell me wat to do. get out and stay out</span></span></div>
