            <div class='col-md body'>if it's for ROM, i suggest you not to use songs, use music. No singing at all.<br><br>few months back i had my ROM at national library courtyard. I choose all piano music, mostly richard clayderman.(easy to get, just spend some time to go download, or go neigbourhood CD shops to buy them at 3 for $10) Before the solemisation, when the guest came, most of them just sit around and talk, taking photo with us. Then during the solemisation, i turn the music softer but kept it on. After that everyone start eating catering food.<br><br>Songs with romantic lyrics are good, but if you are using it for ROM background, remember that the music is just for "background" purpose, you dont want the guest to put too much attention on the songs, you only want the music in the background to create a better atmosphere.<br><br>i tired some saxphone and violin music but they seem to be the sad type though romantic enuff. So i didnt use them. Piano give a more happy feeling for the event.<br><br>If you really like a particular song, or a particular song is special to the two of you, you can use it during the "walk in".<br></div>
