            <div class='col-md body'>I just saw my friend's graduation rubbish photos on friendster..  (brings out voodoo dolls).. as usual perfect, not a strand of hair out of place in bloody stinking hot Singapore.<br><br>Recall 1 1/2 years ago.. On the december 17th/18th i can't remember.. I collected my gown on the last day possible. Took one sad picture with my partner... poor thing wore a suit and was dragged all over the place by me. Booked some photo session that i didn't bother turning up to.<br>On the actual ceremony day.. it was stinky hot, so i rocked up in mini skirt, thongs and a stupid surfie top. My gown squashed in some paper bag. My friends who were there as girlfriends or partners whatever were yelling at me. Screaming at me for wearing what i was wearing.. Then i stumbled up the stage, hat nearly falling off. Ran off at the first opportunity, dumped my gown and hat and ran off to the nearest pub with my 'supporters'. The photos that i had of that day were shocking to say the least. Hat gone to one side.. thongs (not gstring, but slippers) showing under the gown. I didn't even want to show it to my family -&gt; so embarrassed. Consequently they never did have my graduation photo.<br><br>Sniff.. was anyone else as slack as me. Or is everyone else Ms/Mr perfection on graduation day? By the time i finished 4 years of slavery, i couldn't give two hoots anymore.<br><br>-Ling</div>

I told her not to bother. Grandma was so excited, i told her not to bother.<br>In the end, only my ex colleagues, my ex best friend and her freak bf and my bf who apparently told me that he didn't know when i was on stage or even if i was even on stage. Well.. there goes...<br><br>Then a showoff was waiting for me to get off.. desperately wanting to find out if i had a distinction. I told her yes, i found out long ago, it's not a big deal at all.
