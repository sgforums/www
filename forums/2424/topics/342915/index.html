              <p><em>Wanting more: Manchester United's Carlos Tevez celebrates scoringed</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Carlos Tevez, dubbed the 'Electric Mouse' by Sir Alex Ferguson, is putting a permanent move to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> at risk by demanding pay parity with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Talks between United and the Argentina striker's advisers have stalled because of £120,000-a-week demands from the 24-year-old, who has repeatedly stated his desire to stay at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferguson and United have agreed a fee of £32million with Tevez's owners, MSI, £4m of which has already been paid during Tevez's two-year loan spell at the club.</p>
              <p>But personal terms are proving a sticking point, with United offering £80,000 a week rather than placing him among their highest earners, including European player of the year Ronaldo and regular captain Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>Tevez, due to arrive back in England today after being allowed to spend time in Argentina for family reasons, is now allowed to talk to other interested parties Inter Milan and Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>But United are determined they will not be blackmailed into clinching a deal for the player and Ferguson is not putting pressure on chief executive David Gill to go 'the extra mile' to sign him.</p>
              <p>'The Tevez situation doesn't concern me long term,' said Ferguson, who hopes the player's wish to continue at United will prove an influence in his final decision about accepting United's terms.</p>
              <p>Tevez will not be available for today's FA Cup third-round tie at Southampton, where Dimitar Berbatov will hope to build on his winning goal against Middlesbrough on Monday night, following a slow start to his Old Trafford career.</p>
              <p>Berbatov has scored only three Premier League goals since a record £31m move from Spurs and Ferguson believes the reason for his struggle is that United's players do not realise how good he is and are too reluctant to pass to him.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 'I don't think we are using him enough. He is one of those players who can take a ball under pressure because he is so well balanced and has great upper body strength.</p>
              <p>'Eastern European players can get their body between the man and the ball and you can never get it off them.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson has ruled out any more January deals after the £17m signings of young Serbians Zoran Tosic and Adem Ljajic from Partizan Belgrade.</p>
              <p>England midfielder Owen Hargreaves is due have a second operation on his right knee on January 15 as he tries to cure a long-standing tendinitis problem.</p>
              <p>Former England international Alan Shearer was able to resume his career after a similar operation and Hargreaves hopes to be fully fit for next season.</p>

              <p>Most players expect an improvement to their current contract each time they sign a new deal... Unless they know that they are on the wane then probably they may accept lesser like maybe G Neville, just to stay at the club for his final years... Money to such players are no longer important... Cos if the club don't offer him a new deal he may even retire...</p>
              <p>Tevez would be no exception from most player at their peak if he knows he can get a better deal elsewhere... This isn't exactly surprising, but what is, is the amount he is asking for... as United's pay structure is such that Rio in on $130k, Ronaldo on $120k &amp; Rooney on around $105k... So I think its hard to give him such amount if he is not even a first choice at United tho he could be if he moved to other clubs...</p>
              <p>At the end, I think he could leave or United could let let him go cos there is no point in keeping him... and the depreciation of the sterling could make him a very attractive purchase from those clubs in Europe...</p>
              <p>It would cost about $20m to buy him and in the past, it would be about $30 over million euros, now its about the same with the Pound, Suddenly he become rather cheap to European clubs... about $20m euros too...</p>
