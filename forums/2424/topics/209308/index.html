            <div class='col-md body'>Carrick poised for United debut<br><br>Michael Carrick will make his full debut for premier league leaders Manchester United against former club Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday, manager Alex Ferguson confirmed on Friday.<br><br>Carrick joined United from Tottenham in July for a fee that could rise to 18.5 million pounds ($34.66 million) but is yet to start a match after sustaining an ankle injury in pre-season.<br><br>The 25-year-old midfielder is now fully recovered and after one substitute's appearance for United will get the chance of an early meeting with his former employers.<br><br>"I think he will be glad to get it over with. I think anybody playing for the first time against their old team will want to get it out of the way," Ferguson told reporters.<br><br>"He owes a lot to Tottenham. They took the chance on him at West Ham when maybe others didn't."<br><br>Carrick has a key role to play for Ferguson's side, particularly following United's failure to land top target Owen Hargreaves from Bayern Munich before the transfer window closed.<br><br>Tottenham manager Martin Jol said: "I've had to cope with the idea of not having Michael (Carrick) for the last six or seven weeks so it hasn't been easy because we wanted to keep him.<br><br>"But he wanted to move up north and in particular to Manchester United. So when they paid us I had to let him go.<br><br>"I saw the problem of us not being able to pick a pass against Everton (when Tottenham lost 2-0 at home) and we just have to work on it.<br>"<br>He added: "The amount of money we received for him doesn't make me proud because I would've loved him to stay.<br><br>"Michael will continue to get better. I don't agree with people who say he isn't the complete holding midfielder because nearly every one of our attacks started with him."<br><br></div>
