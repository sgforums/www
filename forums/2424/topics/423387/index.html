              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> defender Patrice Evra has put pen to paper on a contract extension to keep him at Old Trafford until 2014 - and remains as hungry as ever for medals.</strong></p>
              <p>The 29-year-old has already helped United land three Premier League titles, a Champions League, plus three League Cups - the last of which he lifted after skippering the team to victory over Aston Villa last year.</p>
              <p>And, with his future now secure, Evra is adamant his desire for silverware has not been satisfied yet.</p>
              <p>'Ever since I arrived at United, it's been a dream come true playing here,' he said.</p>
              <p>'The fans, the players, the manager and the staff all work hard to make this club the best in the world.</p>
              <p>'I have won a lot in the last five years, but I want to win more and I know that's the mentality of everyone here.'</p>
              <p>Evra has established himself as one of the world's top left-backs since his £5million arrival from Monaco in 2006.</p>
              <p>He has always been a popular figure amongst the United support and his occasional bizarre outbursts - he recently claimed Arsenal was a fabulous football centre but mocked their inability to win trophies - have only reinforced that view.</p>

              <p><strong>His links to Monaco will make him a hate figure amongst the Marseille support when United head to the south of France for Wednesday's Champions League encounter with Didier Deschamps' men.</strong></p>
              <p>But Sir Alex Ferguson has no fears about Evra handling the abuse and, at a time when the most experienced members of his squad are beginning to end their careers, reckons the defender's influence will become more apparent.</p>
              <p>'Patrice is unquestionably one of the world's best left-backs,' said the Scot.</p>
              <p>'He has developed into a key character in the dressing room and it is great that he has committed himself to the club.</p>
              <p>'His experience and skill will be increasingly important to us.'</p>
