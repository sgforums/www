Wenger insists that, having come through their first major test of the season unscathed, Arsenal are ready for another challenge this weekend.<br><br>"We have come out of our first big test this season stronger," he told Sky Sports. "We played without the handbrake on, without any restrictions and we were faithful to the game we wanted to play.<br><br>"I cannot fault anyone, it was a fantastic game. Manchester United is another big test, but after this performance we will be facing United much stronger."<br><br>Sunday's point took Arsenal back ahead of United at the summit of the Barclays Premier League table on goals scored, and Wenger insists his side have already proven their worth as genuine title contenders.<br><br>"I have always been very confident of what we could achieve this season," he said. "I said it before the season started and now we have convinced a few more people.There is a long way to go, but we have the talent to fight right at the top for the Championship."<br></div>

Ferdinand reported to United's Carrington complex on Monday but went for a scan instead of training. </strong><br><br>The England centre half fears a recurrence of a groin problem that forced him to miss four of United's final six games in the run-in to regaining the title last season. Coming on the day when it was also revealed midfielder Paul Scholes will be ruled out until February, it was hardly the news manager Sir Alex Ferguson needed before the clash with rival Arsene Wenger and his Premier League leaders.<br><br>Ferdinand was replaced by Gerard Pique 20 minutes from the end of Saturday's convincing 4-1 win over Middlesbrough, a victory that lifted United to the top until Arsenal took a point from Liverpool on Sunday. Ferdinand's solid defensive partnership with Nemanja Vidic had been a key feature of United's return to form along with the blossoming partnership in attack of Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez. Ferguson's recordequalling side have now hit four goals past their last four opponents.<br><br>United insiders expect Ferdinand to bite the bullet for Saturday's crucial lunchtime showdown at the Emirates, which is likely to be one of a handful of matches this season that settle the destination of the title. But there is concern that Ferdinand's injury will have to be addressed in the long term if it keeps returning to bother the defender, who is 29 next month.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boss ready for key clash</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson admits Saturday's trip to the Emirates Stadium could be a key clash in this season's Barclays Premier League title race.<br><br>Table-topping Arsenal and second-placed United are separated by just goals scored going into the match, with both sides in top form.<br><br>Having seen the Reds score four times in four consecutive matches, however, Sir Alex is confident that his side are facing the leaders at the right time.<br><br>"Everything is coming together, as I thought it would, and in good time to take on Arsenal in what could be a key match in our title defence," he is quoted as telling the Daily Star.<br><br>"It's still an open race but Arsenal have had a great start and they're the ones we are chasing at the moment. The main thing is I know we will chase them with great fervour and determination."<br><br>Arsene Wenger's side have confounded their critics this season with some superb displays en route to leading the pack, and Sir Alex admits they are genuine contenders for United's crown.<br><br>"I know challenging for a title is a new experience for a lot of their players, but some of them have been there before and the manager has, and that is a big help," he said.<br><br>"People said the same about us last year, but we led the league for three-quarters of the season, so I don't think it's a handicap."<br></div>
