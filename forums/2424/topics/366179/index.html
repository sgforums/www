              <p>Carlos Tevez has claimed that Sir Alex Ferguson
              made a mistake in leaving him out of the starting line-up for the
              Champions League final, as he prepares for an exit from Old Trafford. <br><br>Tevez's contract expires today and he is widely expected to seal a move to Manchester City by the end of the week. Talking to <em>The Guardian</em>, Tevez reflected on United's 2-0 loss to Barcelona in Rome.<br><br>"You cannot argue with Alex Ferguson," he said.<br><br>"He is like the president of England. It is impossible, you always lose.<br><br>"But
              he made a mistake to leave me on the bench. That was the only final the
              team had lost since I had been at Manchester United."<br><br>'Carlitos'
              then revealed that he had no second thoughts about leaving United,
              continuing, "My family knows how much I suffered at United.<br><br>"I
              could not arrive home after a match or a training session and forget my
              pain. It was not good and I transmitted all my sadness to them.</p>

              <p>on hindsight fergie should not played Ronaldo as  a lone striker, shd have played either tevez or berbatov as striker and ronaldo as winger. Ronaldo too solo liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the first 10 mins was all Man Utd attack, with barcelona in the backfoot, then barcelona scored on its first attack and its all barcelona all the way to chinatown.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whether man u would win if tevez started, thats difficult to say wor.</p>
              <p>but Barcelona is worthy winners as they played the most attractive football in the entire season. see if they can retain the CL or not.</p>

              <p><br>Arsenal that time was seriously weakened, with clichy injured and gibbs his replacement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that said, Arsenal were outgunned over the 2 legs. If Arsenal were to play Barcelona, Arsenal will be outgunned too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>difficult to say if tevez or berbatov were to started, will they made a difference, but it might as man utd were attacking very well in the first 10 mins, before that first barce goal deflated them. dunno why they ran out of steam, shape, discipline. they should have showed the determination of the 99 team, when they concede a goal early, they battled hard and equalised only in the injury time and won the game with the last kick of the game deep in stoppage time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>alas the fightback was not to be seen, remains a mystery why they played so badly after conceding the first goal.</p>
