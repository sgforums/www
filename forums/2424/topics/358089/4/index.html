              Man Utd era wont go on forever de. once fergie does retire, the next manager is under pressure to match fergie achievements. 
              
              just look at the busby babes after winning the european cup in 1968, downhill after that, with man utd relegated in 1974.
              
              If Mourinho does take over, hmmm, I dun mind either, but I hope he behave well.

              <p>the key is not to judge the new manager by what being done already, but what he is going to achieve, cause U can't fight history..</p>
              <p>whoever takes on the job after fergie know the task at hand, and hence he can be no weakling, but has his own establish identity. We certainly don't want a newcastle-situation where the managers are changing like the seasonal fashion.</p>
              <p>why mourinho, U don't mind, cause he gurantees instant success? If he comes, we have to take his whole package, his ego, and etc.</p>
              <p>already Fergie identified Moyes, not sure how that will work out.</p>

              <p>Flying boot I think that was an unfortunate incident that really made the relationship beyond salvage.</p>
              <p>I think Ferguson does allow some players more leeway than others. Whether it's justified or not I don't know.</p>

              wah becks left for many years and still talking about it here?
              
              i think fergie does not like his image and that of his wife posh spice victoria. It is true that he doesnt like her. being old fashioned, its no wonder that his favourite players in the squad is scholes, who doesnt talk much and to the media. outside football, you wont hear news on scholes and his private life, he just comes in training and then play matches on sat/sunday and then off he went home to his wife and children. then the boot incident was the last straw, as both nearly came to blows in the dressing room after the match.
