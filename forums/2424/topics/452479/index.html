              <p><span><strong>Michael Owen is on the lookout for a new club after Sir Alex Ferguson told the striker his contract was not being renewed.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Owen made just four appearances this season and has been hampered by injuries since arriving at Old Trafford in the summer of 2009.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 32-year-old former England striker last played in November before picking up a thigh injury but he turned out for United in Harry Gregg's testimonial against a League of Ireland XI this week. </span> </p>
              <p><span>'The manager informed me after our testimonial match on Tuesday that the club would not be offering me a new contract,' Owen wrote on his Twitter account.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I have loved every minute of the 3 years I have spent at such a fantastic club. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I would like to thank the players, staff and fans for their support and wish them well for the future.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I now plan to have a short holiday during which I will contemplate my next move.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Owen insisted he is not ready to retire but ruled out moving down a level to the Championship.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>Ferguson paid tribute to Owen's professionalism as he told the club's website: 'It is a pleasure to have had Michael at Manchester United. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'Michael is a consummate professional and was an influential figure in our dressing room. Unfortunately he had no luck with his injury this season.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Michael’s record of goals per game is exceptional and we wish him all the best for the future.'</span></p>
              <p><span>The highlight of his time at United was his injury-time winner in a pulsating 4-3 derby win over Manchester City in September 2009, a goal which warmed sceptical fans to him given his Liverpool connections.</span></p>
              <p><span>He also struck in the 2010 Carling Cup final win over Aston Villa but was forced off injured later in that game and any hopes of an international recall in time for the World Cup were ended. </span></p>
              <p><span>Owen scored 40 goals in 89 appearances for England but has not played internationally for four years. </span></p>
              <p><span>His announcement will lead to speculation that he may now retire but, even while sidelined, he has never indicated that he is considering that option. </span></p>
              <p><span>Owen burst onto the scene as a precocious teenager with Liverpool in 1997 and went on to make a huge impact at the following year's World Cup. </span></p>
              <p><span>He left Anfield for Real Madrid in 2004 but spent only one season in Spain before returning to the Premier League. </span></p>
