              <p class="add-linkout">Sir Alex Ferguson will make a final attempt to splash the Ronaldo cash when Valencia duo David Villa and David Silva arrive at Old Trafford this week.</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">The Spanish pair will play in a pre-season friendly for their club, and Ferguson will inquire about both players.</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">Ferguson was knocked back over £30 million-rated attacking midfielder Silva at the end of last season.</p>
              <p class="add-linkout">MANCHESTER UNITED will tell Valencia to name their price for David Silva this week. Although boss Sir Alex Ferguson claims United are not in the market for further signings, they are prepared to deal at the right price.</p>
              <p>United will meet Valencia officials before Wednesday's prestige friendly at Old Trafford, but will have to pay £25million to land the Spain midfielder.</p>
              <p>Silva's Valencia team-mate David Villa also remains on their radar, but the striker has always maintained that he wants to remain at the Mestalla.</p>
              <p>Silva, 23, can play in a number of midfield positions, but has been used in a deep-lying role behind the main striker at Valencia.</p>
              <p>Although Ferguson maintained during United's pre-season tour of Asia that they had finished their transfer business for the summer, they lack goals.</p>
              <p>The United chief has challenged his team to break the 100-goal barrier once more this season and Silva can help provide them.</p>
              <p>Villa remains a target for United and Liverpool, but Ferguson is unwilling to blow the transfer budget on a player who does not want to leave Spain.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, French club Le Havre say United have behaved "lamentably" in signing 15-year-old sensation Paul Pogba.</p>
              <p>Le Havre are going to make an official complaint to FIFA.</p>
              <p>Club president Jean-Pierre Louvel added: "I am fed up with clubs doing certain things without punishment."</p>

              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p class="introcopy">MANCHESTER UNITED boss Sir Alex Ferguson has targeted Atletico Madrid’s Sergio Aguero as the man to provide the missing Old goals.Argentinian Aguero, 21, is seen as the ideal replacement for Carlos Tevez, having formed a potent partnership with ex-United striker Diego Forlan in La Liga. Ferguson, despite bringing in hitman Michael Owen on a free transfer from Newcastle United, <br>sill privately feels that there are missing cogs in the Old Trafford goal machine after the summer departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Tevez. <br>The son-in-law of Argentina manager Diego Maradona, Aguero has admirers throughout Europe and so far Atletico Madrid have been beating off all enquiries by quoting an asking price of £50million. <br>But United, together with other interested clubs like AC Milan and Barcelona, believe that is too high and Ferguson is weighing up an offer of around £35m. <br>The United boss will also use the opportunity of Valencia’s visit to Old Trafford for a friendly on Wednesday night to bring himself up to date on the situation regarding highly-rated David Villa and David Silva. Teenage Gremio midfi elder Douglas Costa, valued at £20m and seen as someone with a huge future ahead of him in the world game, is another on United’s radar. <br>Ferguson said: “We lost two good players in Ronaldo and Tevez but Manchester United is a club that moves on.</p>
