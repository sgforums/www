              <p>I believe alot of utd fans are quite upset and frustrated with foster yesterday. dunno what he was thinking of when he came out and then chut pattern to concede a needless equaliser. his kicking isnt brilliant isnt it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so lets do a poll here and post your comments if you really think foster should succeed VDS as utd no 1 goalie. Let me start off by saying what I think first. I think he is not suitable at all. Utd need a great and experienced goalie, and not a good potential goalie to succeed VDS. the stage is too big for foster to fill VDS boots.</p>

              <p>wah lau still early days yet la. Foster has started only 5 games this season?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His handling and shot stopping is actually quite good. Judgement of balls coming in....that one he has potential. Not every tom dick and harry can come in and command the likes of ferdinand, vidic, evra etc in the back four. They are still getting their chemistry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Give him time to rough it out and he has the potential to be a big time keeper. Even schmeichel's first season had some jittery moments but they had a golden era after that. relax la....chill.</p>

              <p>well, firstly, I still have nightmares of his kicking after the charity shield. Once pressured, his kicking just went bonkers, no accuracy.</p>
              <p>Now, it shows he has another flaw that all strikers will exploit. And being a keeper, do U want that? and esp at United where it is so result-oriented?</p>
              <p>Frankly, I am surprised that United got an one-legged kicking keeper. Over the years, they have always picked keeper who can clear with both legs.</p>
              <p>To foster's credit, he has no major clangers, like a taibi or howard or barthez. But I still fee he is on thin ice.</p>
              <p>I think SAF is impatiently waiting for EDS to return, and get the german keeper. He has showed over the years, he is rather rutheless with keepers.</p>

              <p>We made three mistakes and City punished with 3 goals</p>
              <p>1. Boo Boo by Foster and the statue Ferdinand</p>
              <p>2. Someone headed the ball back towards own goals straight to a Man C player, he pass it to Bellamy and Bellamy scored.</p>
              <p>3. Mr Statue Ferdinand again pass the ball straight to Petrov and Bellamy scored.</p>
              <p>Forster could have prevented both the first and the last one. Went down too early for the third goal</p>

              <p>Foster is already quite limited in his skills. his right leg kicking is atrocious. decision making is also slow. he often delay his time kicking the ball when strikers are charging in, even on his favourite left leg. when the striker is too close to the ball, he chut pattern by trying to trick, dribble or feint. how many times have you seen foster do that already, quite a number of times since last season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>someone mentioned he is english and thats the reason why Thomas Kuszak was on the bench. bingo, thats right. I cant think of any reasons why foster is better than thomas. Although thomas is not a top top keeper, he doesnt do things like what foster did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its a sad state that england doesnt have a top goalie. last time england had was david seaman, who retired in 2003. in between, Paul Robinson and David James shares the responsibility as england no 1, but they are not a top goalie anyway.</p>

              <p>Casillas I think wouldnt leave RM and that left Cech and Buffon. Chelsea wont sell cech to man utd and now the only hope is Buffon would want to leave Juventus and Italy and move to england, fingers crossed.</p>

              <p>I dunno why people say he got potential to be good in future. he isnt different from scot carson, paul robinson frankly speaking. all above average english goalie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remembered when David James first joined Liverpool from Watford during the souness era, alot also talked about James as potential for the future and england international. Sure he make it to be england goalie, but that is as far as he goes. nothing much spectacular in an england jersey. due to his clangers at liverpool many a time that costs them points, he was later sold. it prove one thing, the stage at liverpool is too great for him and he proved to be successful at portsmouth. I think the same also apply to foster, sure he may make it as future england goalie, but the stage is too big for him at man utd. how many times you want to see him costs utd points due to his howlers.</p>

              <p>well, MU went one long way before getting EDS, and it shows that excellent keepers are gems.. MU will have a problem when EDS or even SAF retires.</p>
              <p>At the moment, Foster seems to have problem with kicking and all strikers are going to go at him when the ball is played to his right. It is quite funny when U see MU defenders giving him cover when the ball is played back to him.. I think that takes away alot of confidence and not healthy.</p>
              <p>the city game was an escape, but what happens if it is an impt UCL game?? that would cost MU millions.. surely, SAF won't wait till then to stop the rot, right?</p>

              <p>yes foster weaknesses are plain to see. he is basically a left footer and his right leg kicking is basically non-existent. I thought footballers, including goalie, are two footers these days in modern football?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun mind foster staying at man utd, but not as no 1. I dun think he will be given chance to prove as no 1, but by staying as no 2, whoever is the no 1 when VDS retire. not to mention he is a bit injury prone. you cant have a no 1 goalie out for few weeks or months out.</p>

              <p>I hope this once and for all show that foster really cannot make it.</p>
              <p>how many times have he come out of his box to collect or challenge for the ball and the ball rolling into an empty net. I am wondering why fergie still persists on playing foster. he made a few mistakes and he is still in the team. its so unfair to kuszcak. he deserve to play and ahead of foster.</p>
