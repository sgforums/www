              <p><strong>Manchester United forward Bebe finally got his first Champions League goal after UEFA had initially threatened to classify his late strike against Bursaspor on Tuesday as an own goal.</strong></p>
              <p>But the 20-year-old Portuguese winger is determined to keep a low profile as he fights to make his mark at Old Trafford following his £7million summer move from Guimaraes.</p>
              <p>'I am a very humbled person,' said Bebe yesterday. 'If you had told me two years ago that I would have been playing for United at this stage, I would have laughed.'</p>
              <p>With United boss Sir Alex Ferguson juggling a long injury list featuring wide players such as Ryan Giggs, Antonio Valencia and Nani, Bebe looks set to play more than anticipated in the coming weeks.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson was happy with Bebe's performance in Turkey this week. 'He is lacking in fundamental coaching but he has raw talent,' said the United manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Bebe revealed yesterday he has been learning English with the help of compatriot Nani since arriving in England in August, and confirmed the story that Ferguson had asked him to shave off his dreadlocks.</strong></p>
              <p>'He told me I had to learn English quickly and to go as fast as I could to the hairdresser and get my hair cut,' said Bebe. 'It was like a joke, but I think he maybe meant it, too.'</p>
              <p>French striker Gabriel Obertan, also 21, scored his first goal for United on Tuesday.</p>

Only, unlike his Mexican team-mate, his learning curve did not include a pre-season with the Old Trafford outfit.<br><br>With that in mind, <strong>Goal.com UK</strong> decided to look at the player’s lightning quick adaptability and rise in stature.</span></span></p>

A fierce shot deflected away for a corner proved to be his contribution as Sir Alex Ferguson's men - although led by Mike Phelan on the night - ran out 5-1 winners against the Championship side.</span></span></p>

His shot took a deflection from George Elokobi to end up over the line, but it was his darting runs and fleet-footed play that captivated the crowd on the day.<br><br>However, he was substituted with less than 10 minutes to go, as Javier Hernandez came on and stole the show by scoring a fantastic goal that proved to be the winner.</span></p>

The youngster latched onto a well disguised pass from Paul Scholes and scored with a single touch of the ball.<br><br>In essence, Bebe took two all too short appearances to get himself accustomed to the challenging environment, and picked himself up, sharpened his trade, and managed to score his first goal in his first start for the club.<br><br>The one against Bursaspor at the Ataturk Stadium only served to add further proof that the young 20-year-old forward is picking things up as he goes along. Opponents may shudder to think of what he can be in a couple of years.</span><br></span></p>

              <p><strong>Bebe has already offered a glimpse of the talent that prompted one of the most remarkable transfers in the Reds' history, and in his first magazine interview with Inside United he has promised that there’s more to come.<br><br></strong>The 20-year-old Portuguese attacker is humble but ambitious, determined to prove that he can complete his almost unimaginable rise to the top of the game.<br><br>"When United signed me it was because they believed in me – give me some time and I will provide goals for the club and show the Manchester United fans it was worthwhile signing me," he tells <strong>Inside United</strong> magazine, out now.<br><br>Bebe's incredible back-story starkly contrasts against his new-found fame. "I am a humble person. The streets I come from on the outskirts of Lisbon are very poor – I had nothing," he says. "But I am a good person and I want to show people that I can fight all the adversities I have had in my life. That's why I am here."<br><br>Inside United also features interviews with Bebe’s fellow summer signings Javier Hernandez and Chris Smalling, discussing the trio's very different journeys to OT, and how their lives have changed on and off the pitch since.<br><br>Chicharito's goals and enthusiasm have already captured fans' imaginations, while Smalling's assured displays at the back bode well and Bebe has grabbed two goals in recent weeks. "It's really amazing how much my life has changed," says Hernandez. "I played a lot of games in Mexico, went to the World Cup and now I have this chance at United. It's unebelievable."</p>
