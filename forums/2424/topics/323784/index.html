              <h1>United &amp; Uefa Respond To Blatter's 'Slavery' Charge</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United have predictably responded robustly to Fifa president Sepp Blatter's claim that the "enslaved" Cristiano Ronaldo should be allowed to leave Old Trafford if he wants to.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/jb2/blatterehh_get41222.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="412" height="232"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Blatter said in an interview with Sky News that he was critical of a trend towards "modern slavery" in football. His view has raised eyebrows (and probably temperatures) at Old Trafford - and met with an unimpressed response within football generally.</strong><br><br>United are insisting that Ronaldo, having signed a lucrative long-term contract, will not be allowed simply to walk away from the club.  It should be stressed that the Portuguese international has not categorically stated that he wants to leave, though he has been sending out (presumably calculated) mixed messages about his future.<br><br>Real Madrid have been publicly courting the player all summer. He is currently recovering from ankle surgery, and a United spokesperson said: "All our players - like at other clubs - enter into their contracts after an open and free negotiation.<br><br>"Most of [them] do after taking advice from a FIFA-registered agent. "Many do so on a number of occasions and enjoy long and successful stays at Old Trafford."<br><br>And Uefa have effectively refuted Blatter's claim that players are slaves to clubs, warning that in fact they are becoming more and more powerful because of the Bosman ruling. Indeed, Uefa's communications director, William Gaillard, who is also a special advisor to the body's president, Michel Platini, stressed that players' salaries are "spiralling out of control.<br><br>"It would be useful to remind people that slaves in all of the slavery systems never earned a wage," Gaillard told Sky Sports News. Since 1995, under Bosman, players have been allowed free transfers at the end of contracts, and those nearing the end of their deals are inevitably targeted by rival clubs. "It seems that both clubs and players are trying to negotiate an exit before the player is free," said Gaillard.<br><br>"It is a consequence of the Bosman ruling - there is nothing we can do about that. "It is obvious that today players have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago, undoubtedly, and agents have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago. "It is true that salaries are spiralling out of control. Many clubs have pointed that out."<br><br>Asked if he felt sympathy for Ronaldo's current position, Blatter replied: "Absolutely, absolutely. "Definitely as a footballer and the Fifa president, I'm very in sympathy with the player Ronaldo." He added: "I think in football there is too much modern slavery, transferring players or buying players here and there, and putting them somewhere. And we are trying now to intervene in such cases."</p>

              <p class="story"><strong>Women's football:</strong> "Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts. Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so, and they already have some different rules to men - such as playing with a lighter ball. That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic, so why not do it in fashion?"</p>

              <h3>Blatter words anger PFA</h3>
              <p><strong>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Professional Footballers' Association</span></span> have called for FIFA
              president Sepp Blatter to retract his claim of "modern slavery" in the
              game.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United have also taken issue with Blatter after
              he declared Cristiano Ronaldo should be allowed to leave Old Trafford
              if he wants.</p>
              <p>PFA chairman Chris Powell told Sky Sports News: "I
              really hope Sepp will retract what he has said and that we can get on
              with resolving this saga because I am sure Manchester United want it to
              be."</p>
              <p>He added: "Ronaldo is not fit now with his injury and having
              his operation, but I really hope for our sake, and football's sake,
              that Ronaldo wears the red again of Manchester United again next
              season."</p>

              <p><strong>Ronaldo backs Blatter's 'slavery' comments</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has backed FIFA president Sepp
              Blatter's condemnation of 'modern slavery' in the modern game.</p>
              <p>When asked about Ronaldo's long-mooted prospective transfer to Real Madrid,
              Blatter yesterday suggested that there was a trend towards treating players like
              slaves in the transfer process.</p>
              <p>His comments have been met with criticism in some areas, with Professional
              Footballers' Association chairman Chris Powell calling for him to retract the
              comments while UEFA president Michel Platini reacted by highlighting the
              spiralling wage demands of players.</p>
              <p>But Ronaldo, who is currently recovering from ankle surgery after taking part
              for Portugal in Euro 2008, has failed to commit himself to United and has given
              mixed messages about Real's obvious interest.</p>
              <p>He has now supported Blatter's stand, but refused to shed any more light on the
              proposed transfer.</p>
              <p>'I agree with the comments of the president of FIFA. What he said is right,'
              he told Portuguese channel TVI.</p>
              <p>'At the moment there is no agreement with Real Madrid. We have to wait for the
              next few days to see, but I do not know where I will begin next season.</p>
              <p>'This is all I have to say at the moment.'</p>
              <p>Regarding his injury, the winger confirmed he would be out for as long as three
              months but remained upbeat about his rehabilitation.</p>
              <p>'I'm very well. I'm optimistic. My recovery is going well. Everything is
              fine.'</p>
