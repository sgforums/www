              <p>English midfielder Bryan Robson spent 13 years
              dominating the midfield for Manchester United. He was signed from
              midlands side West Bromwich Albion for a then British record fee of
              Â£1,500,000 in October 1981, stating that his motivations were medals.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i38.tinypic.com/2pos57p.jpg" alt=""><br><br>He
              claimed two league titles, four FA Cups, a League Cup, a European Cup
              Winners' Cup, a European Super Cup, and even won a double in his final
              season as a Red Devil.<br><br>Manchester United manager Sir Alex
              Ferguson has recently stated that he thought nobody believed he could
              replace a legend like Bryan Robson (who received 90 international
              caps), but then Roy Keane, who was bought from Nottingham Forest,
              emerged into the first team and went on to captain United to multiple
              trophies.<br><br>Similarly, in Roy Keane's absence, Ferguson again said
              that replacing the Republic of Ireland international would have been
              mission impossible, but now Anderson is emerging as the heir to the
              central midfield throne.<br><em><strong><br>Midfield Evolution<br></strong></em><br>Ferguson
              also stated that Robson and Keane were different midfield players, just
              like Anderson again has a contrasting style, but insisted that this is
              how a midfield evolves. <br><br>Robson, though, believes that Anderson has some way to go before he can achieve what he and Keane did with the club.<br><br>"He's got a lot of attributes - lots of energy, but he's still learning
              and has a bit to go," Robson explained in the <em>Manchester Evening News. </em><br><br>"He can be erratic with his passing
              and I'd like to see him score more goals. But he's got lots of
              qualities and the energy to get box to box. <br><br>"One of his best qualities
              is that he's not daunted by anything," Robson said, referring to Anderson's big-game mentality. <br><br>"Everybody talks about the flair
              of Brazilians, but the thing I noticed about them the first time I ever
              played against them was their mental toughness. Nothing fazes them,
              they just love playing."</p>
