            <div class='col-md body'>Wayne Rooney has dismissed talk that a lack of goals in his last eight games is weighing heavily on his shoulders.<br><br>Much has been made of the striker's relatively quiet start to the season which was not aided by an untimely three-game ban just a week into the season.<br><br>Despite having not hit the back of the net since his opening day brace against Fulham, Rooney, who has looked back to his best during United's last three victories, insists he is not worried by his current goals drought and is happy with his form.<br><br>"I'm not really too concerned [about not scoring]," he told Manchester United Radio. "I know what my job is for the team and I feel like I'm doing good enough.<br><br>"I'm getting better in each game but the most important thing is the team's doing well, that's all that matters. We're winning games and are top of league so there's no real concern there."<br><br>The 2-0 win over Rafael Benitez's side helped the Reds leapfrog Chelsea to the Premiership summit, albeit on goal difference.<br><br>Rooney fully expects the title race to go to the wire but is confident United's growing maturity will enable them to remain in and around the top spot for the remainder of the campaign.<br><br>"I think the younger players like myself, Cristiano [Ronaldo] and Fletch [Darren Fletcher] are getting better and more consistent each year," insisted the striker who turns 21 on Tuesday. "We're all learning more about each other's game and that's helping the team as a whole.<br><br>"Chelsea have raised the bar over the last couple of seasons. They've been consistent and have won a lot of matches and everyone else has had to raise their game to match them.<br><br>"But I think people are now starting to realise that they can be beaten and other teams are starting to have a go at them.<br><br>"I think the title will go down to the wire," he added. "It will be a battle between the top three or four teams in the league to win it.<br><br>"We're pleased with the start we've had - we're playing good attacking football at the moment and have been picking teams off on the counter-attack away from home too.<br><br>"We want to stay above Chelsea and if we're still in with a shout for the league approaching the last couple of games of the season, hopefully we can nick it [the title] off them."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=373108" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=373108</a></div>
