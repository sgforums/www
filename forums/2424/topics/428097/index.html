              <p>Manchester United captain <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/24529/Nemanja-Vidic"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Nemanja Vidic</span></a> says he wants to see out the rest of his career at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Vidic was handed the armband by <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> at the start of the season after he signed a new four-year contract amid speculation Real Madrid were preparing a bid for him.</p>
              <p>And despite rumoured interest from AC Milan, the 29-year-old defender insists he has no intention of leaving the club: "I hope to spend the rest of my career here at United," said Vidic.</p>
              <p>"I heard the speculation about me maybe leaving last year, but I know where I want to be and I have shown my commitment to the club. I have given the best years of my career to this club and the talk about me leaving here was never correct.</p>
              <p>"I always give my best. Of course, sometimes you have good and bad days, but I think I always try to give 100 per cent and especially now I have that armband and the responsibility that goes with it.</p>
              <p>"I'm definitely here for the rest of my career now. It never came from my mouth that I would be leaving United. I love it here and I think I show that on the pitch."</p>
              <p>Vidic has enjoyed another solid season at the back as United look to bounce back from their FA Cup semi final defeat to Manchester City by claiming the Premier League and Champions League titles, reflected by his nomination for the PFA player of the year award.</p>
              <p>He added: "The boss told me at the start of the season he was giving me the captaincy. Then after a few games he said that I would be captain for the season, which was great news.</p>
              <p>"Being captain of United is a big honour and I am really enjoying the role."</p>
