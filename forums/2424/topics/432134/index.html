              <p><img src="http://img.skysports.com/10/12/660x350/Blackburn-Rovers-Phil-Jones1_2542637.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="350"></p>
              <p class="v5-txt-strong"><em>Skysports.com</em> has learnt Blackburn 
              Rovers defender Phil Jones is at Manchester United having a medical as 
              he closes on a move to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p><span class="lingo_region">
              </span></p><p>The in-demand centre-half is also a target for Arsenal and 
              Liverpool but it would appear United have stolen a march on their 
              Premier League rivals in a transfer race that could be concluded soon.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were thought to be the early front-runners for the England 
              Under 21 international but Sir Alex Ferguson, with a healthy transfer 
              chest of his own, is set to land a player many believe will be a 
              mainstay for the senior national side for years to come.</p>
              <p>It is understood United have offered the player a five-year contract,
               despite widespread reports he was to undergo a medical at Liverpool's 
              training ground on Wednesday.</p>
              <p><em>Sky Sports News </em>understands the player also spoke to Arsenal 
              but decided to make the move to the Premier League champions rather than
               switch to The Emirates.</p>
              <p>The 19-year-old was supposed to travel to Denmark on Wednesday with 
              the England Under 21s for this summer's European Championship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transfer fee in the region of 16 million pounds and diouf might be going the other way for 3 million.</p>

              <p><strong>Did Wayne Rooney get rapped by Manchester United officials for letting the cat out of the bag as the club tried to finalise a deal for Phil Jones?</strong></p>
              <p>The Blackburn defender was wanted by both Arsenal and Liverpool but was reported to be at United this afternoon for a medical ahead of a £16m move.</p>
              <p>The news has yet to be confirmed by either Blackburn, United, or the player himself but that didn't stop Rooney posting a very complimentary tweet about the 19-year-old who could soon be his teammate, before hastily adding that he didn't know if Jones was joining United or not.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>At around 2.45pm he wrote: "Phil jones is a good young English player. 1 of the toughest defenders I played against last season. Can play midfield to."</p>
              <p>Just eight minutes later he posted: "I don't know if phil jones is signing for us just saying he is a good player that's all. I haven't got a clue if he is signing or not."</p>
              <p>Had the club warned him off talking about deals on Twitter before everything was signed and sealed?</p>

              <p>Let's not get carried away with Barcelona here... This is to rebuild the United squad and the future... If this guy is really that good and with great potential, then I don't see why not?</p>
              <p>It's not often we see such a young player with the option to pick where he wants to go with choices like Liverpool, Arsenal, City and United waiting...</p>
              <p>He could be a very good defensive midfielder in the future... or a centre-back replacing Johnny Evans...</p>

              <p>I am not saying that we should miss out on opportunities to sign potential youngsters like him.</p>
              <p>I am just worried that we are just replacing people and remain stagnant because I assume SAF's 3 signings quota is firm, so there goes 1 slot. And with the linked names so far they ain't that impressive except sneidjer and probably nasri.</p>

              <p>Be patient... The 3 could probably be "star quality" players... This one is probably an add on. Fergie may had wanted to wait another year but was force to act now or they may lose him to Pool in this window...</p>
              <p>To be honest, all along I thought he was heading to Liverpool. It was like almost a done deal kind of thing then suddenly I hear this happen... I know United were linked with him too lah but Pool was like way ahead in negotiations with Blackburn liao then suddenly...</p>
              <p>Ashley Young, De Gea and perhaps, another midfielder / playmaker could make up the 3?</p>

              <p>To be honest, I don't really know much about this kid but obviously with so many clubs after him and willing to meet the clause in his Blackburn contract and pay his released fee, he should be worth the effort...</p>
              <p>Harry of Spurs made a last minute attempt to turn his head while Blackburn were willing to offer him $10k more than United a week just to stay back at Ewood Park...</p>
              <p>And yeah, he could be ahead in the pecking order over Evans in the centre-back role... Or who knows, he could turn out to be a very good defensive midfielder in the future cos Fletcher can't go on forever... In 3 to 4 yrs time his all action running style can't go on and that's where Jones comes in? </p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>For Phil Jones, now only an official announcement away from being confirmed as the most expensive teenager in English football, it came down to a position where virtually every top club in the country were fluttering their eyelashes in his direction.</p>
              <p>Only Manchester City out of the Premier League's top six did not follow up their interest in the former Balshaws High School pupil who still lives with his parents, Mark and Helen, in Leyland. City had watched him closely and were impressed by his potential, the way Jones had slipped seamlessly into top-flight football and the leadership skills that had led to comparisons with a young John Terry, but concluded that the Blackburn Rovers player made too many mistakes and may not be value for money.</p>
              <p>At <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> they saw something different: someone with such a rare talent they could not allow him to join one of their rivals – even though the timing did not entirely suit.</p>
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sir Alex Ferguson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> had been leaning towards waiting a year before it became apparent he could not delay any longer. Jones was already mulling over offers from Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur by the time United moved in and triggered the £16m release clause to gazump everyone.</p>
              <p>Chelsea had also begun the process of trying to extract him from Ewood Park but Jones had misgivings about moving to London and, to quote one friend, "did not fancy Liverpool". By the time Arsène Wenger rang on Tuesday night the teenager's mind was already clear. Ferguson, always aware of the benefits of getting the family onside, had already spoken to Jones's parents, promising that United would provide a stable environment for a player thrust into a new life of riches and potential glories.</p>
              <p>The only issue for Jones now is how long he has to wait. Wes Brown and John O'Shea will shortly be leaving Old Trafford but Jones is still joining a club with an established central defensive partnership in Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, an accomplished backup in Chris Smalling and a fourth player, Jonny Evans, who has endured a difficult year but still shown sporadic glimpses of developing into a top defender.</p>
              <p>The signing, moreover, does not necessarily mean Ferguson will abandon his plans to recruit the 18-year-old Raphaël Varane from Lens. Varane, like Jones, has come to United's attention after a series of outstanding displays in central defence and as a holding midfielder. He would cost around £8m.</p>
              <p>The player with the most legitimate cause for concern is Evans, who seems certain to be shunted into the role of fifth-choice centre-back only a year after being the first-choice replacement if either Ferdinand or Vidic was absent.</p>
              <p>But Ferdinand, too, could be forgiven for wondering what Jones's arrival means for him over the next couple of years. Ferdinand is 33 later this year and his injury problems mean he may be approaching his final season as an automatic first-team pick.</p>
              <p>What cannot be disputed is that it leaves United's defence in tremendous shape for the short, medium and long-term. An £18m deal for Spain's Under-21 international goalkeeper, David de Gea, should be finalised with Atlético Madrid in the coming weeks. Patrice Evra admitted on Wednesday "this wasn't my best season", culminating in his poor performance in the Champions League Final, but the Frenchman is still a talented, attacking left-back. Add to that, the development of the 19-year-old Da Silva twins, Rafael and Fabio, and potentially Varane, and Ferguson, that strategic planner, is entitled to think he has put in place United's defence for the next decade.</p>

              <h1 class="h2">Jones deal nears completion</h1>
              <p>Phil Jones will finally become a Manchester United player next week with
               lawyers from the two warring clubs working out the details of the 
              player's transfer valuation, according to <em>ESPNsoccernet</em> sources.</p>
              <p><em>ESPNsoccernet</em> has been informed that once Manchester United 
              reach the magic mark of £20 million that Blackburn Rovers want then 
              Jones will become a United player.</p>
              <p>The 'compromise' being thrashed
               out at the moment between the two sets of lawyers revolves around 
              United winning trophies and Jones' appearances, which could make the 
              transfer worth in excess of £20 million depending on United's capacity 
              to continue to win silverware on a regular basis, and the player's 
              ability to hold down a place in the team.</p>
              <p>A figure of £20 million, though, will be reasonably attainable, and that will be the generally-accepted figure of Jones' value.</p>
              <p>An
               insider suggested that it was pointless for Liverpool to bid £22 
              million, as widely reported, as the player has signed a contract for 
              Manchester United made up his mind to go to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Blackburn were incensed that they have to sell at the price being quoted
               when the player was valued at £25 million, while United are annoyed 
              that they should pay anything more, as that £16 million was the price 
              stipulated in the get-out clause.</p>
              <p>"The two sets of players are 
              sorting it out, and there is sure to be a compromise by the middle of 
              next week," said the well-connected Ewood Park source.</p>

              <h1>Phil Jones to sign for Manchester United after Blackburn Rovers admit defeat</h1>
              <h2>Phil Jones is set to rubber-stamp his £16.5 million transfer to Manchester 
                United today after Blackburn Rovers’ Indian owners conceded defeat in their 
                attempts to inflate the cost of his move to Old Trafford.</h2>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/"><strong>United</strong></a> hope to confirm the central defender, who played for England Under-21s 
                against Spain in the European Championship in Denmark last night, as their 
                player after weekend talks involving senior figures and legal advisers from 
                United and Blackburn resolved the impasse between the two clubs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Blackburn’s owners, Venkys, had been investigating the possibility of a legal 
                challenge to force United to raise their bid substantially due to their 
                perception that the Premier League champions had benefited from leaked 
                information surrounding the escape clause in Jones’s contract, which was 
                inserted into the 19 year-old’s deal following a renegotiation in February.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Venkys also believed that the wording of the clause suggested that offers of 
                over £16 million for Jones would merely entitle the bidders to open talks 
                with the defender prior to making a more substantial offer to buy him.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>With United being granted permission by senior figures at Ewood Park to 
                perform a medical on Jones last Wednesday, however, the belief at Old 
                Trafford is that Blackburn’s acquiescence to that examination taking place 
                is in itself proof of meeting the terms of Jones’s clause.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>The absence of a recognisable structure of senior management at Ewood Park 
                following the recent departures of long-serving chairman John Williams and 
                managing director Tom Finn has contributed to the confusion surrounding the 
                Jones transfer.</p>

              <h1 class="h2">Man Utd clinch deal for Phil Jones</h1>
              <p>Manchester United have confirmed the capture of England Under-21 defender <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/140032/phil-jones?cc=5739">Phil Jones</a> on a five-year deal after agreeing an undisclosed fee with Blackburn Rovers.</p>
              <p>United thought they had secured Jones' services last week, only for 
              the transfer to be halted due to an unforeseen snag. It was claimed 
              Blackburn were holding out for more cash and that Liverpool had jumped 
              in with a superior offer.</p>
              <p>However, Jones, who featured for England
               Under-21s in their opening European Championship match against Spain in
               Denmark, apparently told Rovers he did not wish to join any club but 
              United and the deal is now in place.</p>
              <p>''Manchester United is 
              delighted to announce it has signed an agreement with Blackburn Rovers 
              for the transfer of Phil Jones," a United statement read. "The player 
              passed a medical in Manchester last week and has agreed a five-year 
              contract. The deal will be completed once the player returns from 
              international duty."</p>
              <p>A Blackburn statement, released on behalf of 
              the owners, board and manager, on the club's official site read: "Much 
              as we would love him to stay on with us - and we made all efforts to 
              convince him to stay - Phil has to finally follow his heart. We are 
              extremely happy with his contribution to our team and we wish him all 
              the very best in his future endeavours."</p>
              <p>It appears the breakthrough may have come after United agreed to up their offer as Rovers boss Steve Kean has told <em>Sky Sports News</em> that the deal is worth around £20 million - a significant increase on the original £16.5 million bid.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless,
               Kean revealed Blackburn had offered to make Jones the highest paid 
              player at the club had he stayed at Ewood Park and is disappointed the 
              player made the decision to move on.</p>
              <p>"The offer we made he was 
              staggering for a 19-year-old, but it wasn't the money," Kean said. "Phil
               wants to play Champions League football now and we're not at that 
              level.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure we will be in the coming years, and we gave it a 
              real good try and made him a fantastic offer, but I understand why he 
              wants to go now. He goes with our blessing and it's an opportunity for 
              us to invest in other young players across other areas of the pitch.</p>
              <p>"We
               were hoping he was going to be captain of our club and captain of 
              England. He's a fantastic prospect and I'm sure he'll be an England 
              regular very soon.''</p>
              <p>United are also hoping to complete the signing of Spain Under-21 
              goalkeeper David de Gea, who produced an excellent performance when he 
              featured against Jones in Sunday's game.</p>
              <p>However, it is also 
              anticipated Sir Alex Ferguson will land Ashley Young first, once Aston 
              Villa have sorted out their managerial vacancy, and a replacement is 
              also anticipated for Paul Scholes, who confirmed his retirement last 
              month.</p>

              <p>hi, I think I share your concerns. my two cents.</p>
              <p>but then, would 3 players really revolutinize MUFC and propel it to the same level as Barca? unlikely..</p>
              <p>MUFC has to get one or two gems, and develop their own youths to step up.</p>
              <p>Unless U are mCity or chelsea, there is no way to "buy" to match Barca's quality.</p>
              <p>For me, crucially, MUFC has to identify someone with the same fire as SAF who can propel the team for next 20 years.</p>
