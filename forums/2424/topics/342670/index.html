              <p class="small bold"><em>RISING STAR ... Fabian Delph</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to <em>The Sun</em>, the British tabloid newspaper, Manchester United are readying a bid totalling £10 million for Leeds United midfielder Fabian Delph.</p>
              <p>The 18-year-old has turned heads in League One this season, and a host of Premier League clubs have sent their scouts to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
              <p>Newcastle United wasted no time tabling a bid, but their £1 million offer was rejected rather firmly by Leeds chairman Ken Bates, who is determined to keep hold of such a huge prospect.</p>
              <p>"Fabian Delph will be moving to the Barclays Premier League - but we hope he'll be moving with us via the Championship," Bates said in November.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, Portsmouth, Bolton Wanderers and Sunderland have also been linked with the England Under-19 star, while Fulham boss Roy Hodgson's eyes and ears were in the stands as Leeds beat Stockport Country 3-1 last weekend.</p>
              <p>It was reported earlier this week that the Cottagers had made an official £6 million offer for the Bradford-born starlet, but it would seem United have trumped their top-flight rivals by offering the same sum with a few tasty add-ons.</p>
              <p>A series of bonuses based on performances and appearances would potentially see the Whites collect an extra £4 million, but Sir Alex Ferguson is also willing to loan them midfield prospects Darron Gibson and Rodrigo Possebon until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Delph has been variously compared to Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes due to his tenacious attitude, eye for a pass, and ability to romp forward and get on the score-sheet.</p>

              <h1>Delph beware: Leaving Leeds for United might not be a good move - just ask Alan Smith<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/02/article-0-00F15BCC0000044C-767_306x426.jpg" alt="Smith" width="306" height="426"></p>
              <p><em>Badge kisser: But Alan Smith's move from Leeds to Manchester United upset Elland Road fans</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1104164" rel="1104164_3" href="/sport/football/article-1104164/Delph-beware-Leaving-Leeds-United-good--just-ask-Alan-Smith.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>As Fabian Delph contemplates leaving Leeds to join </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong>, the 19-year-old could do well to remember what happened to the last Elland Road star who signed up to the Theatre of Dreams.</strong></p>
              <p>Alan Smith was a hero at Leeds, scoring at Anfield on his 1998 debut aged just 18, and netting 52 goals in 229 games for the club. He also scored seven Champions League goals as the Yorkshire side reached the semi-finals in 2001.</p>
              <p>However, as soon as he joined United in August 2004 in the wake of the side's relegation  from the Premiership, his cult status evaporated at Leeds - as did his goalscoring powers.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson shelled out £7m for Smith's goals but was repaid with a just 11 in a three-year, 93-game spell that was punctuated by red cards, injuries and the form of Cristiano Ronaldo,  Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy.</p>
              <p>Indeed, so sharp has Smith's decline in front of goal been that he is now regarded as a midfielder and after a £6m switch to Newcastle in the summer of 2007, he went a whole season and 37 appearances without scoring. He's not played this term because of injury.</p>
              <p>Delph is more of a creative player than the aggressive Smith so will not expected to be the new Roy Keane.</p>
              <p>And if he does make the Roses switch to Leeds' most hated rivals, he will join a long line of high-profile defectors over the years, the most successful being Eric Cantona who quit the White Rose for the Red Rose in 1992 after helping Leeds win the title - then became the first player to win back-to-back championships with different clubs.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other high-profile moves: </span>Rio Ferdinand (£29m) July 2002; Gordon McQueen (£500,000) February 1978; Joe Jordan (£350,000) January 1978.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">High-profile United players moving to Leeds: </span>Lee Sharpe (£4.5m) August 1996; Gordon Strachan (£300,000) March 1989; Johnny Giles (£33,000) August 1963.</p>
