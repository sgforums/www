              <p>I can understand why tevez left man united. he was seething inside when united went out to spend 30m on berbatov when he was still on loan. he must be thinking, why the heck didnt they want to spend the 30m on me instead?  if berbatov come, where will he play? on the bench of course.</p>
              <p>hindsight is a good thing to have. it is proven that berbatov is a flop, should have signed on tevez for the 30m spent on berbatov. past expensive flop were veron at 27m, but the amount was recouped when he was sold to chelsea for 15m after 2 seasons at united.</p>

              <p><br>Who care as long as he bang in goals...  Messi also short short and doesn't look like a holding position strongman but look what he did? He did every soccer fans wanted. Score goals.</p>
              <p>Tevez maybe far from Messi but what he's doing currently is awesome. And you all also cannot forget, he is one of the reason for Man Utd CL success in 2 years ago.</p>

              <p>I agree, that's exactly what Rooney was doing before he got injured - he worked his socks off, tracking back to defend, chasing loose balls and pop up to score goals. The team was influenced by that.</p>
              <p>Take the Bolton game for example when Rooney was out, with Berba leading the line. For the first time he actually covered the lengh of the pitch and managed to score twice.</p>
              <p>And for every other game in this season, Berba is just trotting around taking lame shots at goal.</p>
              <p>I admit i was disgusted when Fergie signed Berba instead of Tevez. I just don't think he will suit United's attacking system. Before he joined, United had Ronaldo, Rooney, Tevez and Giggs upfront, all pacey and can launch quick counter-attacks. After he joined, his main contributions are "shielding" the ball when the counter-attacks are launched, fall down under fair challenge, miss golden shooting opportunity.</p>
              <p>My take is Fergie's patience with Berba has run out. He will purchase a new striker soon and Berba will be sold off cheaply to whoever wants him.</p>

              <p>well, for tevez, the biggest thing that went against him was the goal ratio, the hardwork he puts in didn't equate to goals.Yes, he alters game, assists but end of day, he is a centre-forward, goals do count. I do believe he did mention that his game changed when he came to United cause he has to do more running/chasing.</p>
              <p>No doubt, he puts his heart into each game, but I guess Berba was bought (against the older player rule in MU now), due to fact, he brings a different dimension to MU in terms of technical ability that was suppose to propel them towards another UCL title.</p>
              <p>Given how Berba gel with Keane, and has a high goal/assist rate in EPL for 2 seasons, and seemingly, played UCL b4, on paper, he seems a perfect fold for Rooney. He holds ball, releases, and Rooney just thunders, goal..</p>
              <p>However, on paper and on field different, Rooney still likes to come to MF, collect, and creates, taking the space that Berba operates, and worse, their understanding did not take off.</p>
              <p>With Rooney's injury, it was a perfect time for Berba to take the team and run, however, it didn't. He was not meant to play alone, he needs another striker to feed out his distribution.In a way, SAF's tatical play was questionable also. Kiko was just wet behind the ears, owen is a liability and MU has no one left.</p>
              <p>For me, I was irked by his constant whinning in the blackburn game. Why weren't gameplans worked/iron out in the training pitch?</p>
              <p>The big decision is whether to sell him, for 20M+. I am not so sure there are many good strikers, with pace, attitude, youth, and scoring power that can shine in EPL, that are within United's budget.</p>

              <p>I think it could be that Babartov was playing the wrong way that is not suitable for him. I see that he is trying to follow what Rooney does as in running back to help the team to defend and things like that. I think SAF bought him to be the out and out striker and link passes up front. Barbartov got it wrong by trying to imitate Rooney hoping to win over some fans.</p>
              <p>That's not how he plays when he was performing at Spurs... Or maybe he is just not suitable for the style of play in United.</p>
              <p>Anyway, just sell him... :D</p>
