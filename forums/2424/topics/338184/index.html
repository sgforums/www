              <p><strong>Robinho targets United scalp</strong></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ROBINHO has set his sights on inflicting more pain on Cristiano Ronaldo in the Manchester derby this weekend. City’s £32.5million ace helped Brazil knock six past a Portugal side which included the United winger last week.</h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">His Eastlands pal Elano was on the scoresheet that night in Brasilia and the Samba pair are now eyeing a Sunday repeat. Speaking after that 6-2 thrashing, Robinho said: “We are all looking forward to the match with United.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">"We have good chances to win, although they are very strong. “But we play at home. We have to think that, in our stadium, we are always favourites. “And it would be great to repeat the victory I had with Brazil against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. “I really hope Elano and I can have the same success in the derby that we enjoyed for our national team.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo was tipped to be a possible replacement for Robinho at Real Madrid all summer before eventually deciding to stay at Old Trafford. While the Brazilian was widely expected to join his countryman Phil Scolari at Chelsea before his stunning deadline day move to Eastlands.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Robinho, 24, said: “Chelsea? This question belongs to the past. "I’m a City player and I only think about making the club successful. “I don’t regret the choice I’ve made — I’m very happy at the club.”</p>

              this season fixture list is like so difficult for Man Utd.
              
              We had to play all away to first liverpool, chelsea so early in the season and then arsenal away? 
              
              Now 3 away matches on the trot wtf fixture list?
              
              Its good to do away with the toughest encounter,but if man u continue to trail chelsea/liverpool by 8 pts come Jan 09, it willbe very difficult to clop the gap, as always playing catchup and depending on the leaders to falter.
              
              Last season was different circumstances cos of chelsea sacking of mourinho so early in the season, but with chelsea starting so good, difficult to see them falter, but they also had injuries to counter like essien out till next year.Liverpool this season also starting very good,really surprise they are contenders.
              
              Man Utd is playing catchup now, cant afford to lose or draw 2 many points.

              <p>agree.. I just hope that MU doesn't end up with nothing consdering that they need to go to Japan and will be two games in hand, so they need to play even more games this season.</p>
              <p>however, some light at the end of tunnel, in that Brown, Neville, Scholes should be back then..</p>

                  not necc - Man U has played the all big boys away (Liverpool / Chelsea / Arsenal) and will play them at home.  Of these, I think if they can get 7 points (assuming they draw Chelsea) - things will be okay.  Moreover, I persoanlly think its better that they get the away games out of the way.
              
                  
                  This weekend Man City vs Man U - i think it will be a draw.  Recently, Man U has not been doing too well in Manchester Derby.  
                  
              
                  Also, Man U typically peak after the winter, so I think they will put together a string of good results.  But I think this season, they won't win the BPL title - partly because the other teams are hungrier and showed more desire - I think Chelsea will win it.

              Man Utd cannot afford to slip now. if not forever playing catchup.
              
              Dun think they will win epl this season. as for CL, shd be favourites to win, especially Ac Milan in Uefa cup hehe.
              
              Man Utd will also go for the FA Cup, after losing finalists in 2005 &amp; 2007.
              
              If not for last season loss to Portsmouth which was a freak result, man u would have won the treble if they won Portsmouth.
              
              If Man U were to win epl this season, they better start their run now, starting this sunday against Man City.

              Dimitar Berbatov has returned to training after a hamstring injury and
              could be in line to face City on Sunday.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Red Devils' record
              £30.75million signing has missed the last two games after reporting
              back from international duty with a minor problem picked up against
              Serbia.</p>
              <p>He was able to join his team-mates for the latter part of the
              training session on Thursday morning, putting him in contention to face
              Mark Hughes' side at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>But <span class="iAs" style="border-bottom: medium none ! important; font-weight: bold ! important; text-decoration: none ! important; padding-bottom: 0px ! important; color: darkblue ! important; background-color: transparent ! important; cursor: pointer ! important;">Ferguson</span> has vowed not to take any chances with the former Spurs striker and will assess his fitness over the next 72 hours.</p>
              <p>"Dimitar started training today but hamstring injuries are never easy to deal with," said the United boss.</p>
              <p>"We have to be careful because he has never had one before.</p>
              <p>"We will have to gauge whether it is wise to use him from the start on Sunday or better to have him on the bench.</p>
              <p>"It really depends how he comes through the next couple of days."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also confirmed veteran duo Gary Neville and Paul Scholes were back in training.</p>
              <p>Neville has been struggling with a groin injury, although he
              might face City, but Scholes - who had a knee operation after the
              Champions League trip to Aalborg on September 29 - is more likely to be
              held back until the return meeting with the Danes in a fortnight.</p>

              <p><strong>SIX</strong> reasons why the champions won’t win away to their nouveau riche neighbours:</p>
              <p><strong>1. </strong>Manchester City won both Manchester derbies last
                  season, winning the home encounter 1-0 before completeing the double
                  with a 2-1 win at Old Trafford - United’s only home league defeat that
                  season.</p>
              <p><strong>2. </strong>The home win last year wasn’t a one-off - the Citizens have won four of their last six home games against Manchester United.</p>
              <p><strong>3. </strong>Manchester United have won just one of their last six Premier League game and that came against struggling Blackburn.</p>
              <p><strong>4.</strong> Manchester City have averaged two goals a game
                  against the Big Four so far this season whereas United have scored just
                  seven goals in their seven away league games this season - Hull have
                  scored double that in the same number of games.</p>
              <p><strong>5. </strong>Mark Hughes has a strong record against his
                  former club having lost just one home game of four against the
                  champions, as well as twice taking points from Old Trafford.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><strong>Superman to the Rescue</strong><br><br>It’s hard to steal the
              Eastlands spotlight from Robinho, but Stephen Ireland has done just
              that in the last few weeks. The man in the Superman pants has been out
              of this world, scoring goals for fun.<br><br>This run of form began two
              weeks ago at Hull City where his brace secured a hard-fought 2-2 draw.
              He followed this up with an inspirational performance against Arsenal,
              scoring the opener, and picking apart a ramshackle Gunners defence at
              will. Ireland got on the score sheet again in the mid week UEFA Cup
              victory against Schalke 04.<br><br>All this marks a remarkable
              turnaround for the Cork-born player who found himself at the centre of
              one of football’s most bizarre scandals last season. ‘Granny-gate’
              occurred when he concocted the 'deaths' of his grandmothers to escape
              the Republic of Ireland’s international set up.  <br><br>The
              controversy created a fire storm that impacted on his club form. He
              dropped out of the starting line-up as the campaign drew to a close,
              and was nearly sold to Sunderland.<br><br>How Mark Hughes must be glad
              this didn’t happen. Just as the Blues'  fortunes have been transformed
              by the injection of cash from Abu Dhabi, so Ireland has been a
              different player this season. Along with Shaun Wright-Phillips and
              Robinho, he will be expected to tear apart United on Sunday. <br><br>City
              have struggled for consistency though. Their mid-table position attests
              to this, with glorious days against Arsenal coming alongside dour
              defeats to Bolton Wanderers.<br><br>The Eastlands fans will be
              desperate for a repeat of last weekend’s win so they can continue their
              terrific form against the Red Devils.<br><br>Two wins last year saw the
              local bragging rights go to the Blue half of Manchester. With some more
              help from their very own super hero, this run could be continued on
              Sunday.<br><br><strong>No goals, no glory</strong><br><br>These are
              uncharacteristically lean times for Manchester United. Two goalless
              draws in a week ended their tremendous record of scoring in the last 36
              Premier League games, and stopped them from sealing their place as top
              dogs in Group E in the Champions League.<br><br>Getting back on the
              score-sheet will be paramount in Sir Alex Ferguson’s mind as he
              attempts to even the score against Manchester City.<br><br>In all the
              glory of a double-winning campaign in Europe and at home, you can bet a
              double of a very different kind has been on the mind of the Scottish
              manager.<br><br>A 1-0 defeat at Eastlands plus a faultless City display
              in the 2-1 win on United’s own turf took some of the gloss off their
              dominant 2007/08 season.<br><br>Ferguson has always been aware of
              football’s tribal side, happily engrossing himself in United’s
              rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Leeds United and Arsenal as
              he came down south to take the Old Trafford reins.<br><br>A big boost
              to his hopes of settling the score with the Blues has been the return
              to training of Dimitar Berbatov this week. The Bulgarian endeared
              himself to the United faithful by turning down an even bigger money
              move to City in the summer, but hasn’t completely won them over on the
              pitch.<br><br>That his absence has coincided with his team mates firing
              blanks can’t be just by chance. If he can end this run by notching his
              first away Premier League goal for the champions at Eastlands then
              he’ll take a big step towards acceptance.<br><br>Ferguson will also be
              aware that a winning show against City could pile the pressure on
              Chelsea as they prepare to host Arsenal straight after. A victory by a
              few goals will set an even bigger marker down, and show that United are
              back in business.</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Robinho looks set to return to the Manchester City side after sitting out the 2-0 Uefa Cup win over Schalke with a slight ankle injury.</strong> <strong>Gelson Fernandes (hamstring) and Pablo Zabaleta (thigh) are also available. </strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United's Dimitar Berbatov is in contention after returning to training following a hamstring injury. Defender Gary Neville (groin) and midfielder Paul Scholes (knee) have resumed training, but only Neville looks likely to be in the squad. </p>
              <p>Berbatov has missed the last two games and United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has vowed not to rush him back. He said: "Hamstring injuries are never easy to deal with. We must be careful because he has never had one before. "We will have to gauge whether it's wise to use him from the start on Sunday or to have him on the bench."</p>
              <p>Bulgarian Berbatov, 27, was injured while on international duty. Meanwhile, Ferguson also confirmed that veteran duo Neville and Scholes are also back in training.</p>
              <p>Neville has been struggling with a groin injury, although he might be fit to face City. But Scholes, who had a knee operation after the Champions League trip to Aalborg in September, is more likely to be held back.</p>
