              <p>Wah... kan chiong all the way... Lucky United win... hahaha...</p>
              <p>On Ronaldo being sent off, I guess he deserved it as it was a hand ball but on the issue, I don't think he was trying to use his hands to score, if that was the case, one hand would be better to direct it... It looks more like he was trying to prevent the ball from directly hitting his face... But nevertheless, it was still a handball...</p>
              <p>Anyway, still happy with this win over in-form City... Good match, good match...<img title="Mr. Green" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" width="29" height="15">  </p>

              <p><br>Well, Rafael got a yellow card early in the match and a 2nd yellow would get him send off too...</p>
              <p>Of that incident, Rafael was said to have foul Robinho and as they were still very close to each other, Robinho tried to play the ball against Rafael's leg... If it had hit him, he could get a 2nd yellow for obstruction or not moving back to the limit length when a free-kick is being taken... But like I said, the boy was smart and he probably saw Robinho's ill intentions and leave his feet as there were no other City players ahead of him...</p>

              <p>Wah... kan chiong all the way... Lucky United win... hahaha...</p>
              <p>On Ronaldo being sent off, I guess he deserved it as it was a hand ball but on the issue, I don't think he was trying to use his hands to score, if that was the case, one hand would be better to direct it... It looks more like he was trying to prevent the ball from directly hitting his face... But nevertheless, it was still a handball...</p>
              <p>Anyway, still happy with this win over in-form City... Good match, good match...<img title="Mr. Green" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" width="29" height="15">  </p>

              <p>i think like what Sand king said, they were too straight in the middle and lobbing long balls, perhaps SWP felt useless on the wing and went to play defence? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
