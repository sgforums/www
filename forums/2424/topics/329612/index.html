              <h2><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00801/ronaldo_801134a.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="288"></h2>
              <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo has attempted to smooth over differences with Manchester 
                United supporters as he gets ready to make his long-awaited return for the 
                club at the end of the month.</h2>
              <p>For much of the summer it was anticipated that United fans had seen the last 
                of their Portuguese star with Real Madrid relentless in their pursuit of the 
                23-year-old.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo hardly helped the situation by refusing to commit his future to Old 
                Trafford. But the former Sporting Lisbon winger has since taken 
                responsibility for his actions and admitted being “naïve” to push for a move 
                to Spain.</p>
              <p>"After we'd won the Champions League I felt that I'd help win everything there 
                was to win," Ronaldo, who is expected to make his return from ankle surgery 
                on Sept 27, said. "I felt maybe I needed a new challenge.</p>
              <p>"I never hid the fact that I wanted to play in Spain, at Real Madrid in 
                particular, and I thought it could be the right moment.</p>
              <p>"Apart from the challenge, everyone realises that Spanish and Portuguese 
                culture and lifestyle are more similar. I also have to recognise that my 
                family would welcome the change,” Ronaldo added in an interview with Inside 
                United magazine.</p>
              <p>"The chance of being an hour's flight from my family was very attractive. The 
                people at United, particularly the manager, understood my reasons.</p>
              <p>"What I said publicly, which was maybe a little naive, I take total 
                responsibility for. I just said what I thought: I have a dream of playing at 
                Real and I thought it was time to move on.”</p>
              <p>After winning the Champions League, Ronaldo admits his head was swayed by the 
                prospect of fulfilling a childhood dream and was desperate for United to 
                sanction a move to the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>"I knew Real were interested in me and they had, allegedly, made a substantial 
                offer. For a while, I wanted United to accept. If we hadn't been European 
                champions, I probably wouldn't have thought about going to Madrid. And 
                another thing - I never wanted to leave against United's will.</p>
              <p>"I'm 100 per cent professional and have always given my heart and soul to this 
                club.</p>
              <p>"If one day I leave, I want to do it knowing I did everything I could to help 
                the club win as much as possible."</p>
