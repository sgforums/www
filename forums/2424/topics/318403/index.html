              <p>Real Madrid boss Bernd Schuster believes Cristiano Ronaldo will play for the Spanish champions at some point in his career.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese winger has been constantly linked with a move to the Primera
              Liga and Schuster is confident he will eventually grace the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>The German told Spanish television channel <em>Noticias Cuatro</em>: 'Sooner or later,
              Cristiano Ronaldo will wear the white shirt. I hope that it is when I am still at the club.'
              Ronaldo was non-committal about his Old Trafford future after helping his side
              beat Chelsea in the Champions League final last night, despite missing a penalty
              in the shootout.
              And Schuster, who led Real to a second straight Primera Liga crown this
              season, claims the Spanish side cannot afford to miss out on the free-scoring
              forward should he leave Manchester.
              He added: 'If there is any chance of signing him, Real Madrid have to try
              it.'</p>
              <p>wtf again real madrid and schuster..he should rot in hell</p>

              <p>Nvm lah, let him say what he wants... Afterall, United may want to sell Ronny in 3 years time when his game slow down... and what better place to sell him to where they can still get big bucks for a 26, 27 yrs old player... lol</p>
              <p>Ronny's game is base alot on speed so when he reach 26, 27... he will obviously slow down and won't be the same like a 22 or 23 yrs old kid... Therefore, shouldn't be too bother by them...</p>

              <p><strong>Ronaldo: I'll sign next week</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CRISTIANO RONALDO confirmed he WILL sign a new deal at Manchester United next week. The Portugal superstar, 23, finally quashed all the speculation about his future — which has been driven by Real Madrid’s fanzines.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo said: “My future will be clear next week. Everyone will be pleased — my club as well as me. “I think I will definitely be here next season. Yes, I want to stay. “I have played five years for this club and I’d love to stay here. “I love the people, the players are fantastic, the atmosphere is unbelievable, the staff are great. That is the reason I want to stay.</p>
              <p class="article">“We won the most important trophies this season. I want to do it again next season but no one knows the future. “I want to stay, I feel very happy in the club. I win trophies, the people are friendly, supporters are amazing, everything is fun for me. It’s very good.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson’s assistant Carlos Queiroz was equally categorical about Ronaldo’s future. Queiroz said: “Without doubt he will continue with United. He’s very happy with us, he has a contract and there is no fear or worry he will go.” Ronaldo admitted it has been an astonishing turnaround since he became Public Enemy No 1 following his World Cup spat with Wayne Rooney two summers ago.</p>
              <p class="article">Back then he had publicly demanded a move to Madrid because he felt boss Alex Ferguson and owner Malcolm Glazer had not protected him after the Rooney row. Now the undisputed King of English football admits the situation has turned in his favour. He added: “After the last two years I feel the English people have been friendly to me. I enjoy playing in England but no one knows the future.”</p>
              <p class="article">But as far as the immediate future is concerned Ronaldo was adamant — he WILL stay at United. He said: “This is a young team and we have everything to win next year. “We want to win the Champions League again and we have a good chance. We have a good team spirit.”</p>
              <p class="article">The 42-goal wizard is now favourite to be crowned European and World Footballer of the Year in December. Yet he insisted: “Of course I can get better. The goals are not the most important thing. Maybe I will play well next year but I won’t score as many goals. “But I’m going to try to do my best. Every season I’ve improved and I want to improve next year.”</p>
