They've had very few injuries so far.<br><br>"Whereas we know as a team we've got another level to go to. We need to take the game to teams and then no-one can live with us."<br><br>Terry's team overcame a dogged Newcastle side thanks to a second-half match-winner from substitute Didier Drogba.<br><br>And he added: "We must go on a run of games and keep winning.<br><br>"We must keep the pressure up. Christmas is a difficult period. United have got tough games. We must just keep winning and keep on like we know we're capable of." </span><br><br>so John Terry was Spot-on About Man Utd And Chelsea</div>
