And Christmas came early for Curbs when Fergie broke off signing his festive cards to tell his old pal: You will be sorry if you donÂ’t.<br><br>Curbs revealed: Â“I spoke to Alex and said West Ham are third from bottom. Â“He said 20 years ago, Man United were in the same position when he took over. Â“And he told me, Â‘What youÂ’ve got is an opportunity to go into a club and be successfulÂ’.<br><br>Â“What I talked to Alex about was the difficulty of going to a club mid stream. Â“There were a few vacancies in the summer where people had the opportunity to prepare pre-season and bring in their own players, etc.<br><br>Â“I was just seeking AlexÂ’s advice on a couple of things Â— in fact, he was writing out his Christmas cards when I phoned and he wanted to get back to them. Â“I just wanted to have a soundbite from him because the League ManagersÂ’ Association, where I am on the committee, can sometimes be classed as the old fogies.<br><br>Â“All I was talking to Alex about was my future and heÂ’s got great affection for West Ham.Â”<br><br>In an ironic twist, FergieÂ’s Red Devils are the visitors to Upton Park for CurbsÂ’ first game in charge on Sunday. And they are the only team Charlton failed to beat during his 15- year reign at The Valley.<br><br>United also inflicted a humiliating 4-0 defeat on the Addicks in CurbsÂ’ last-ever game at the helm in South East London, so now he is hoping for something better. Curbishley added: Â“Sir Alex didnÂ’t hesitate to remind me about my record against his club but thereÂ’s a first time for everything.<br><br>Â“West Ham have upset Manchester United before and maybe they can do it again, even though Sir AlexÂ’s team are playing exceptionally well.<br><br>Also watched-out for the Ferdinand vs Ferdinand battle too.

Before the new manager was appointed, i would say united had a 75% chance of winning... because they were not motivated and were probably on auto cruise mode. But now with a new manager, the players will be fighting hard to prove to the new man in charge... I would say 55% - 60% chance now. Don't forget, they did beat the gunners there not too long ago only...<br><br>West Ham, actually have a very good group of first team players... its just that they were not able to respond to their former manager thats all... Alan Curbishley could do what Martin O'Neill did for Villa... But hopefully starting from the match after this...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Having sacked Alan Pardew on Monday, following last weekend's 4-0 defeat at Bolton Wanderers, The Hammers moved quickly to appoint a replacement.<br><br>Curbishley stepped into the breach on Wednesday and will hope his debut at the helm will prompt a change in his fortunes against The Red Devils.<br><br>During his time at Charlton Athletic, Curbishley never got one over Sir Alex Ferguson's mob in the Premiership, although he will draw only minimal comfort from The Hammers' record against United. West Ham have yet to beat Sunday's opponents at home since the Premiership started, but Curbishley will be guaranteed a full house and full commitment from his players.<br><br>In selecting his first side, he will have to pick a team without the central defensive pairing of Danny Gabbidon and Anton Ferdinand. George McCartney and James Collins paired up at Bolton last week and Curbishley has few alternatives at the back.<br><br>Christian Dailly was given a game in midfield and will hope to keep his place, with Javier Mascherano unlikely to be included. Up front, Marlon Harewood and Carlos Tevez started last week, but Bobby Zamora and Teddy Sheringham are pressing for recalls.<br><br>The current Premiership leaders travel down to the capital having won all bar one of their away games in the league this season. Ferguson could stick with the team which won the Manchester derby 3-1 last week after picking up no new injuries.<br><br>Patrice Evra missed that game with a minor injury and could again sit out with Gabriel Heinze starting at left-back. Ryan Giggs will move into sole possession of second spot in United's all-time list of appearances, if he plays at Upton Park. With United having another midweek off, it would be a surprise if Ferguson opts to utilise his squad players for Sunday's match.<br><br>Player to watch: Ryan Giggs<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 phrase-WASTED CHANCES.especially giggs n ronaldo.<br>united were too panic after conceding the goal,they can't play properly,no dangerous crosses or passes after that.The conceded goal,rather bad luck,or poor marking,no 1 was marking reo cooker who was running late into the box.Rio did his best at right hand post but still...haiz.<br>now chelsea 2 pts within manutd.<br><br>fergie ate his own words really,immediate effect,chelsea worse?they even stronger came down frm behind n beat everton.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that was expected from the start you could see they were really going for it... I said earlier, they had a very good group of first team players and a new manager will do them wonders for a few weeks...<br><br>Anyway, they deserve it...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's really no hope from the way they played just now.. I'm beginning to think what is so special about Rooney? Heck even Harewood is a more useful player than Rooney.. Why the long balls I don't understand.. Possesion play build up come on.. Goodness... So damn heart pain</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd didn't played well today. Rooney? Just to fill up space? Where's his top class performance? He was way off form today.
