              <p>Giggs can take fk, corner kick and make a good killer pass, he can play, but play him sparingly. as for scholes, he not only lack his pace, but his goal scoring touch and his tackles often yielded a yellow card due to his rash challenges, and also often losing the ball in the middle of the park.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anderson should be given more chances to play rather than relying on giggs and scholes all the time, especially in an away match. scholes should retire la, so sad to see him become so irelevant these days.</p>

              <p>he need matches to gain fitness. fitness is one thing, form is another. right now we have fletcher to do his job, but he is also out injured. wonder what happened to fletcher, he also another injury prone with park and brown as well.</p>

              <p>Scholes is still the best long ball passer in the premiership, and having him in the team isn't a bad thing. It only becomes a problem when they are up against a quick running side... In this case, he will need 2 defensive midfielders to protect him while he does what he is good at and that is control the attacking from the back... His passing is still unmatch, how he find players on the far corners are still amazing. And also if Giggs plays, Scholes should not play... unless its against a weaker side and in OT.</p>

              <p>yes giggs is crucial to man utd, as he can take fk, corner kick and is a good passer of the ball. he already created a few goals as a result of his accurate passes. but he should be protected and if man utd is winning matches, he should be sub out to protect him and fresh for next matches.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for scholes, he has lost his midas touch, and goalscoring. his tackles often yielded a yellow for his rash challenge and often loses the ball in the middle of the pitch.</p>

              <p>I think Fergie played giggs, scholes and gary nev today because, portsmouth is a team full of 'big' players who is more tough-tackling than flair. He needs cool heads and experience on the field to carry out the job as he will not be on the sidelines giving instructions directly.</p>
              <p>It paid off with the 1-4 win at fratton park. I expect players like nani. berbatov or even park to play in the midweek carling cup to counter the flair players of spurs.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>giggs contributed 2 goals and scholes almost scored from a scorcher. personally I think Anderson would be a better choice as he is more pacy and mobile than scholes. if you are playing giggs already, better not put another oldie in midfield. if you need to play both, its better to play them at home than away, esp at a hard place at portsmouth. you need anderson exuberance of youth, strength and pace to last the match.</p></div>

              <p>good pt. the thing here is experience and focus. Scholes may lose the extra yard of pace, but he can still deliver the ball out of danger.</p>
              <p>there is no doubt, Scholes, Giggs are on the last leg. I think MUFC is able to transition from the lost of Ronaldo/Tevez, is because of these old birds who are cementing the gaps and ensuring the push for the title.</p>
              <p>And for fletcher, given the mileage he has to cover, and the tackles, it is amazing he is playing so much.</p>

              <p>i dont understand why SAF signed valencia.  berbatov is a
              very technical player.  he slows down man u's game.</p>
              <p>he is more suited to play in spain or italy.</p>

              <p>well, the key +pt  for berba is never his pace, or shooting power, but his ability to hold the ball, using his creativity to open that yard of space for Rooney or etc to come in to attack. </p>
              <p>agree?</p>
