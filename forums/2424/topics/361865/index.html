              1) First goal was the turning point. soft goal to concede.

              3) Strikers no support from midfielders
              
              4) stray passes and long balls were making the siuation bad, as the balls just went back to a Barcelona players.
              
              5) Barcelona possession and passing game, made Utd players tire, as they will have to chase back for the ball
              
              6) all the players didnt not played well, everyone of them did not turn up to play.
              
              7) the substitutions maybe played a part
              
              8) no leader of the field to dictate the match.

              Exactly! Everyone was banging about Utd's sizzling form and how Barce were the underdogs and I'm like.... have you seen United play recently? I thought they completely lost the plot this season and it was thanks to Macheda's goals that we won games instead of drawing them like Liverpool, which was why Pool lost. So really, it was Macheda who was the reason why we have the BPL.

              <p>Man U is a good team.Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>But against top quality opponents, you definitely need top form and not just average form to win.Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Unless the other quality team is slumping also, then different story lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>hmm, so easy to blame when the result is know, what worse, it invited all the pests to come and drop in their "two cents".</p>
              <p>my take -&gt;</p>
              <p>1) MU tried to get the quick goal, but it sort of back-fired.</p>
              <p>2) We do need Fletcher, his energy does help. Giggs is good for set plays but he can't track back much. Scholes did not help much too, sadly.</p>
              <p>3) Vidic had one of his off days again.</p>
              <p>4) Ronaldo may make the most noise after the game, but if only one of his shots in first 10mins went in. but that's football.</p>
              <p>5) Barca is a top team and they played to their strength. Kudos to them.</p>
              <p>6) Tatics wise, SAF did put in Tevez, but Barca seems to know how to pass the ball around. And technically their MF are sound.</p>
              <p>7) Rooney did too much chasing back and compromise his attacking energy.</p>
              <p>8) In short, the real MU did not turn up, and on that night, Barca was the better team.</p>
              <p>No shame.</p>
