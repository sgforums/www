            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GARY NEVILLE admits he fears the end of his Old Trafford career.</strong><br>But he knows when Alex Ferguson brings down the curtain it will be for the best for Manchester United.<br><br>Neville, 31, has seen great players come and go in his 12 years and knows he is not immune from the axe. He said: Â“I know itÂ’s coming. It happens, youÂ’re going to be moved on.<br><br>Â“During the last five years people of my age have left, like Nicky Butt and Becks. The problem is you never want to leave United.Â” Captain Neville got his chance because Fergie was not afraid to get rid of big names.<br><br>Neville said: Â“When the manager first came here, Norman Whiteside and Paul McGrath were heroes to United fans but they left pretty soon after he arrived.<br><br>Â“He changed the culture of the club. Â“It wasnÂ’t just Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis who went, other experienced squad players left.<br><br>Â“They were gambles and yet that side of kids went on to win the double. He had Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt to replace Ince, David Beckham to replace Kanchelskis and me to replace Paul Parker.<br><br>Â“He had incredible faith in us Â— a belief that we didnÂ’t even possess ourselves. Â“We looked up to those players, we learnt the ropes off them. We travelled around Europe with them, listened to his team talks, we watched them play and eventually they made way.<br><br>Â“The one thing that has ensured his success over the last 20 years is changing the team. Â“He sees the end for players before they see it themselves. And 100 per cent of the time heÂ’s been proved correct.Â”<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>RUUD VAN NISTELROOY believes it is his Â“destinyÂ” to meet Alex Ferguson in the Champions League knockout stage.</strong><br><br>The Â£10.3million Real Madrid striker, 30, was forced out of Manchester United in the summer by Fergie. And along with former Old Trafford idol David Beckham, he is itching for a clash with his old boss.<br><br>Real are safely through to the last 16 after their 1-0 win over Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday Â— even though Van Nistelrooy missed a penalty.<br><br>He said: Â“Maybe it is destiny to play United. David and I have said it would be great to go back to Old Trafford.<br><br>Â“Ferguson had personal problems with me and can be an aggressive man.Â”<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>PAUL SCHOLES still fears Alex Ferguson. </strong><br><br>Manchester UnitedÂ’s midfield star said: Â“When I first met him, I was frightened Â— frightened to death, actually. I still am.<br><br>Â“If he is not happy about something, he will let you know.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from my angle, SAF is a team player.<br><br>by removing the rot (Paul Ince  &amp; gang), he establish his own core.<br>nothing wrong with that.<br><br>However, I believe as he aged, he can't be handson in many things.<br>and thus, some transfers really went haywire.<br><br></div>
