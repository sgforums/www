            <div class='col-md body'>1 player to look out for.. Chris Eagles... I felt he was fckin brilliant.. He is better than Giggs.. Giving brilliant through balls.. Kieron Lee was not bad but I think he needs more positioning awareness as a full back... Dong is crap.. Richardson mmm well I guess he just can't improve anymore.. I thought he was a good player but he's not good enough to maintain a regular starting 11 in Man U.. Carrick is too casual and was crappy.. Brown played well yesterday.. Fletcher as usual, excellent display of midfield play..<br><br>For Chelsea, I thought SWP and Kalou was brilliant.. These 2 would be the upcoming dangermen for Chelsea together with Joe Cole.. They would give Chelsea a fast paced attacking flair.. And Drogba up front. Lampard and Essien holding the midfield.. Diarra and Mikel as back up, Robben also as back up.. Still got 2 youth players I felt were impressive, Sahar and Sinclair.. Chelsea has quite a strong team on paper and all they need is to bolster up their defence and maintain this same core team for them to gel.. I'm forecasting great droolicious matches from the big 4 teams in England.. Liverpool and Arsenal have upcoming good young teams too.. Exciting!</div>

And the winger was joined in Sir Alex Ferguson's much changed line-up by two players making their maiden league appearances - Chinese striker Dong Fangzhuo and reserve team captain Kieran Lee.<br><br>"The young players making their debuts, Dong and Kieran Lee, acquitted themselves well," said Sir Alex.<br><br>"I thought Kieran Lee did fantastically well. He's not a well-built lad and he really depends on his reading of the game. But he's an excellent reader of the game and an excellent footballer.<br><br>"Chris Eagles was one of our best players tonight. He provided a great deal of variety in his match, his work-rate was terrific.<br><br>"I think Chris has shown he's got the temperament to play. He does work very hard at his game. He's one of the lads who goes out and practises in the afternoons.<br><br>"You get the rewards of that, and there are great dividends. The dividend for Chris Eagles tonight is that I wouldn't be afraid to play him any time."<br><br>Eagles could even force his way into Sir Alex's FA Cup final plans - the boss told MUTV he only has "eight or nine players" set in his mind for the rematch with Chelsea on 19 May.<br><br>Wednesday's tussle with Chelsea was barely a dress rehearsal for Wembley, given the personnel on duty. But Sir Alex insists there was still plenty to take from a game that occasionally became a battle, despite there being no prize at stake.<br><br>"When people saw our team, they maybe thought, "They're not interested." But we were interested okay because this club has to win all its games," said the United boss.<br><br>"We had a good go at it. Some of the possession was very good and our concentration at the back was superb.<br><br>"It was very competitive. In the first half, I think the boy Obi (Mikel) was lucky to be on the pitch, I think that was a bad tackle (on Eagles). At times it became a bit feisty and hard to handle for the referee. But that just shows you the level of competition between the teams."</div>

"We did it for them [when they were champions in 2005]. It shows great respect between the two teams."<br><br>Brown was impressive at the heart of United's defence in a 0-0 draw, in which he praised the makeshift Reds side Sir Alex named.<br><br>"It was a difficult game for us," he added. "Both sides didn't play their strongest teams, but we have come out with a respectable draw.<br><br>"It was [a strange game]. There was a few lads in from the reserves and some players played out of position. We've not played together all season, so to come to Chelsea we had to play well. I thought we relly stuck together.<br><br>"Chelsea put a lot of pressure on us towards the end of the game. It looked like they might nick a goal at the end, but we managed to hold on and kept on defending."<br><br>Brown clinched his fourth Premiership winners' medal with the title success this season and says this is one of the most satisfying.<br><br>"This one ranks highly for me," he said. "We've not won it for a few seasons, but we've got a team together now that looks very strong, young and talented.<br><br>"We've played well all season, starting off strongly and carrying it on from there. We all bonded and we knew that if we played well as a team we were capable of achieving a lot of things. And we've proved that. We've got the FA Cup to come and hopefully there'll be more success next season.<br><br>"The cup final is a special occasion," he added. "It's great to be involved [in the first final at Wembley], and both sets of players will be up for it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lee loves life at the top</strong><br><br>Kieran Lee says he only learned he would start against Chelsea an hour before Wednesday night's kick-off. But despite Sir Alex's late selection Â– or perhaps because of it Â– the reserve team captain looked supremely comfortable on the right side of defence.<br><br>"I didn't really have time for the nerves to settle in," 18-year-old Lee said of his league debut. "If I'd been told earlier, I think I would have been more nervous and it could have affected me."<br><br>As it was, Lee impressed in his role and showed particular composure on the ball.<br><br>"Being picked for a match like this spurs you on and makes you play even better than you'd expect. The experienced defenders helped me on the pitch, telling me what to do and what positions to take up. It was good to play with them.<br><br>"It was hard work, though. I was tired in the last half-hour but the lads dug in and got a good result. To play against Chelsea in the Premiership is a dream debut. It's different to what I'm used to at reserve level. It's good to play against them; it can help you become a better player."<br><br>Lee's performance didn't escape the United manager, who described the teenager's debut as "fantastic".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Eagles flying high</strong><br><br>Chris Eagles admits he never wanted Wednesday night to end, after the 21-year-old made his first league start for United in the Reds' 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>His selection in Sir Alex's starting XI ended a six-year wait in which the midfielder has been knocking on the first-team door for some time.<br><br>"I've been waiting for this since I became a professional at 17," Eagles said. "To make my full 90-minute debut at Stamford Bridge and play well was unbelievable.<br><br>"The lads have been brilliant. Sometimes it can be hard for a young player coming into a senior team, particularly in these circumstances when they've got an FA Cup final coming up. But they've been brilliant Â– the whole day's been brilliant Â– and I never wanted it to end.<br><br>"You learn stuff off people like Scholesy, Giggsy, Ronaldo and Rooney every day in training. And you learn from playing against the likes of Joe Cole and John Terry. The whole day's been special."<br><br>Eagles admits the experience was enhanced by the appearance of Joe Cole on the pitch at half-time. London-born Eagles joined Manchester United as a 13-year-old but has fond memories of watching Cole as a teenager.<br><br>"I've always looked up to Cole, ever since I was a youngster," Eagles revealed. "We both used to play for London Schools. I was nine when he was 15 or 16 and I used to watch him. He was a good player then.<br><br>"I've always admired him so when he came on it was another proud moment for me because he's always been one of my idols."<br><br>The pair exchanged shirts after the game and Eagles said he hopes Cole "will save mine, like I'll save his".<br><br>Eagles drew praise from the United manager for his part in Wednesday's draw. Sir Alex said the 21-year-old was one of the team's best performers and emphasised his impressive work-rate.<br><br>"I think Chris has shown he's got the temperament to play. He does work very hard at his game and he's one of the lads who goes out and practises in the afternoons. You get the rewards of that and there are great dividends. The dividend for Chris Eagles tonight is that I wouldn't be afraid to play him any time."<br></div>
