            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Proud Owen left frustrated<br><br>Owen Hargreaves says stepping out at Eastlands on Sunday for his United debut marked the biggest moment of his career.</strong><br><br>A bout of tendinitis in his knees had delayed the 26-year-old's competitive Reds' bow much to his obvious frustration.<br><br>But he was deemed fit enough to start the derby and produced an impressive performance, despite it turning out to be a hugely disappointing day for the Reds as City snatched an undeserved 1-0 victory.<br><br>Hargreaves thoroughly enjoyed his first United run-out and is confident the team can turns things around after suffering their worst start for 15 years.<br><br>"To make my United debut in a Manchester derby was the biggest moment of my career so far," admitted Hargreaves. "But I was disappointed not to win. I was hoping we could obviously with his being my first game. I am sure there will be more wins in the future.<br><br>"We need to score goals. The most important thing is to have those chances. We have made them but not utilised them. We could have scored one or two and they are things we have got to work on.<br><br>"We are missing Ronny [Cristiano Ronaldo] and Wazza [Wayne Rooney] and they are key players. We are going to miss those players at any time but we still had enough on the pitch to win the game.<br><br>"We still had a great team out there and we were comfortable. It is a shame that we only have two points from three matches because in those games we have pretty much dominated possession and could easily have won all three.<br><br>"We need to understand that we have played relatively well. We've played all this attractive football but not won games. We will get there. But we need to win games. That is the most important thing."<br><br>Geovanni struck the decisive blow just after the half hour after United had dominated the early exchanges.<br><br>That pattern continued after the restart but a combination of poor finishing and solid defending from City ensured the blue half of Manchester were celebrating at the final whistle.<br><br>"We expected a lot more going into the game. When you look at the flow of the game we were completely in control and could have easily been in front early," insisted Hargreaves.<br><br>"We conceded at a time when they weren't threatening at all. It was a bit of a shock.<br><br>"City did the job of defending relatively well but we still had enough chances to definitely win the game."</div>

That guy only has one thing on his mind, to hit the back of the net. He once said that during training, if there's no net, he won't play.<br><br>Fabio Quagliarella is also a very selfish and single-minded striker.
