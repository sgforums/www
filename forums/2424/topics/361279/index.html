              Manchester United's Patrice Evra has revealed how angry he felt last weekend at the tough tackling from Arsenal players at Old Trafford.
              
              Evra claims the challenges could have cost him an appearance in next week's Champions League final. 
              
              United drew 0-0 with Arsenal in the Premier League last Saturday, a result which confirmed United as champions for the third successive year. 
              
              However, Evra was left fuming at a tackle from Cesc Fabregas at the start of the second half which left him hobbling and still complaining even after treatment. 
              
              The incident followed late challenges by Gunners duo Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin on United's Ronaldo and Michael Carrick respectively, while Samir Nasri was cautioned afterwards for a foul on Evra. 
              
              The French defender told The Sunday Express: "The bad challenge was from Fabregas when he caught my knee. 
              
              "I was very angry. I don't know why the Arsenal players did that. 
              
              "Okay I said some things they didn't appreciate after the Champions League game at the Emirates (which United won to make sure of their place in the final against Barcelona in Rome). 
              
              "But I don't know why some Arsenal players did that. You might miss the Champions League final because of one stupid tackle."

              sometimes I wish they kept it to themselves rather than telling it to the press before the match.
              
              one match in mind was that Rooney rant before the liverpool match and guess what happened, Man Utd lost 4-1. Rooney told the Man Utd press that he hated Liverpool while growing up and still hated liverpool now. This was really unnecessary as it would give the opponent more motivation to win the match. Many years ago, Gary Neville also spoken of his hatred for liverpool during Houllier;s era a few days before playing liverpool and guess what, Man Utd lost the match! What Houllier did was to show the report to the players, he did not even need to say much to them on motivation. The newspaper report was already enough motivation for the Liverpool players.
