            <div class='col-md body'>UnitedÂ’s on-loan keepers both had clean sheets to their names in their respective weekend fixtures.<br><br>Tim Howard helped ensure a first Everton shut-out in six games, despite arriving at the ground suffering from a fever.<br><br>Â“Someone said he wasn't well so I didn't expect him to turn up," said Phil Neville, ex-Red and Tim's team-mate at Everton.<br><br>"When he did turn up he looked even worse, he was sweating. He obviously had a fever but he was keen to play.<br><br>"He made a great save in the first half when they could have got back into it from a set-piece but he's been like that all season. He is a fantastic keeper and is up there with the best in the Premiership."<br><br>A point-blank save from Colin Kazim-Richards was the highlight of HowardÂ’s afternoon, but he also had to be on his toes to block from former Red Danny Webber late on in the game.<br><br>Ben Foster was also in the thick of the action at the Valley as he helped the Hornets eke out a much-needed point, pulling off a trio of fine saves in the first-half, twice denying Andy Reid and once reacting sharply to a Jerome Thomas effort.<br><br>As for the outfield players, Fraizer Campbell capped a fine win for Antwerp with their final goal in a 4-1 win over Sporting Lokeren at the Bosuil. Campbell, Darron Gibson, Danny Simpson and Jonny Evans all made it into the Antwerp starting XI, though Darron Gibson was substituted on 81 minutes - just a minute before Campbell found the net for the second successive week.<br><br>Chris Eagles played his part in NEC NijmegenÂ’s 1-0 win over Vitesse Arnhem, though the game was still locked at 0-0 when he was replaced on 81 minutes. NECÂ’s winner, a penalty late into added-on time, saw them climb another place in the Eredivisie.<br><br>As Rangers squeezed past St Mirren 3-2, neither Phil Bardsley or Lee Martin even made the Gers bench despite manager Paul le Guen ringing the chances after RangersÂ’ historic midweek win against Livorno in the UEFA Cup. Bardsley, however, has insisted he will fight to get back in the side having lost his place after he was Â‘sent offÂ’ in training following a tackle on team-mate Thomas Buffel.<br><br>Giuseppe Rossi spent the afternoon on the bench as Newcastle went down 1-0 to a late Yakubu strike at the Riverside, a result which leaves the Magpies just two points and two places clear of the relegation places. And Gerard Pique was another unused sub, failing to get a run as Real Zaragoza beat Real Betis 2-1 to climb to sixth in the Primera Liga, just three points shy of leaders Barcelona.<br><br>Adam EckersleyÂ’s loan spell at Brondby is over; the defender has returned early to Old Trafford after tearing his hamstring.<br><br></div>
