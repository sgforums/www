              <p>Anfield won't be easy and we know Pool, when United come to town, they will automatically up their game 100% without any motivation needed... Of the lot you mention, only Smalling seems like the most likely to recover in time... Rafael will only return in Nov, probably at the end of it too... Cleverley may recover but might not be match fit... Same goes for Vidic as well... So United may have to make do with what they currently got hopefully without any injuries during the internationals...</p>
              <p>They still got a Champions League match in Romania 3 days later follow by City on the following Sunday... So expect chop and change for the first 11.</p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black; '>Sir Alex Ferguson has challenged his injured players to get back to match-fitness for Manchester United's clash at Anfield when the international break ends. </span></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>United have three players - England duo Chris Smalling and Tom Cleverley, plus skipper Nemanja Vidic - who have a chance of being fit for the crucial Premier League visit to Liverpool on October 15. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Vidic has been out since suffering a calf strain in the opening day triumph at West Brom in August, whilst Smalling and Cleverley are battling to overcome groin and foot injuries respectively.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, Ferguson knows from past experience that merely being fit is not enough to warrant selection at Anfield. He also believes players must have an added edge to cope with such a tumultuous fixture. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'The most important thing is the work they do before the internationals finish,' Ferguson told MUTV. 'We really want to have Vidic and Cleverley doing some really strong work, and Smalling too, that would bring them on to a level that they could play at Anfield. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'You can't go there with players who are semi-fit or just coming back from injury. You need players who are fully focused and up to speed in terms of fitness and sharpness.'</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Meanwhile, United midfielder Anderson has set himself a 10-goal target for the season. Famously, it took the 23-year-old 78 appearances to bag his first United goal. He only got one more in the next 17 months. </span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Now, he is on something of a hot streak. Anderson's header in Saturday's 2-0 win over Norwich at Old Trafford was his fifth in 11 appearances and helped preserve United's narrow advantage over Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">'One particular aim is to score at least 10 goals,' said the former Porto star. 'I am going to try my very best to score more.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">With Paul Scholes now retired and watching from the stands, Anderson has been asked to play a major role for United by Ferguson this season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">He has now started nine of United's 11 games in all competitions this season and feels he is benefiting from the increased exposure. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">'You can say it is my best start because I have never played five or six games consecutively at the beginning of the season,' he said. 'It's been great to stay in the side and help make a big contribution. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">'I feel like this is my time now. I have trained well, looked after myself and the boss has given me a chance. It is important that I take it and show everyone why I am here.' </span></p>

              <p>what's happened to MU's most influencial player, Vidic? He was out with Rio, but given the gravity of Rio's injury, he was out for 3 weeks, while Vidic has been out for 8.</p>
              <p>Certainly, Vidic is needed for combat red's batterling ram, Carroll.. and a nimble jones/smalling to deal with Suarez..</p>

              <p>united and co should target carragher. he is very slow. I think
              he will be at least yellow carded for late or bad challenge, as he
              cant keep up with the pace of rooney, hernandez, nani, young etc.
              although anfield is a cauldron, but their defenders are not that
              good. I dun think they can stop united from scoring.</p>

              <p>Look at the news today, Carragher calling England Cheats, or Downing telling MUFC, Pool is going to click and give MU a hiding...Suddenly, a few wins, and they are getting loud...</p>

              <p>Red Devils skipper Vidic has not played since limping out of the opening day win at West Brom with a damaged calf.</p>
              <p>But the 29-year-old made such good progress with United's coaching staff last week that he forced his way into the Serbian side last night.</p>
              <p>And that has put the centre-back bang in the frame to return to the United line-up against Liverpool this weekend.</p>
              <p>Yet it is the recovery of midfield rookie Cleverley — out since injuring foot ligaments in September's 5-0 win at Bolton — which has really staggered the medical team.</p>
              <p>Vidic's absence from the heart of the back four was highlighted when United leaked three home goals to Basel in the recent Champions League draw.</p>
              <p>But the availability of Cleverley, 22, is an extra bonus, as he began the season in such red-hot form that he was pushing for an England call-up.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KENNY DALGLISH has wound up Alex Ferguson — by claiming Manchester United is NOT Liverpool's biggest game this season. </h2>
              <p>United boss Fergie traditionally talks up the fierce rivalry between the two North-West giants whenever they go head to head. </p>
              <p>And the anticipation surrounding Saturday's game is keener than ever on Merseyside, with United edging ahead of the Reds thanks to a 19th league title last term. </p>
              <p>The fact there is no European football means Liverpool fans cannot wait to face the champs at Anfield. </p>
              <p>But Kop chief King Kenny has taken the pressure off his men — and cranked up the mind games with Fergie — by claiming this is no more important than any other game. </p>
              <p>He said: "People say this is the biggest game of the season but I don't look at any game as being big or small. </p>
              <p>"It's another game, another three points for a win." </p>
              <p>The Scot, though, admits the chance to inflict a first defeat of the season on United and move within three points of them is a big incentive. </p>
              <p>He added: "The only difference this time is the fact that, if we win, we will move a bit closer to them. </p>
              <p>"It's an opportunity to help yourself and dent their chances at the same time." </p>
              <p>Dalglish has been impressed by United's start to the season but is eyeing their place at the top of the pile. </p>
              <p>He added: "United have started the season very well. They're sitting on top at the moment and that's where everybody wants to be. </p>
              <p>"They've had a lot of injuries too but coped well with them. Like all managers, Fergie is waiting to see how his players are after playing for their countries." </p>
              <p>Liverpool have an enviable recent record against United, with three straight wins at Anfield. They have also come out on top in four of the last six league meetings. </p>
              <p>But Dalglish insists that will count for nothing in Saturday's showdown — although he has guaranteed United a tough time.</p>

              <p>And he will never forget the buzz of the first time he walked out in front of 41,000 fans at Anfield — even though he wasn't even playing. </p>
              <p>Rooney, 26 later this month, goes to Anfield with Manchester United on Saturday for the latest clash between English football's fiercest rivals. </p>
              <p>But he grew up a true blue fan of Liverpool's big rivals Everton and remembers the heat of some memorable Mersey derbies when he was a kid. </p>
              <p>Particularly the one in November 1996 when he was Everton mascot, leading the team out before a rare 2-1 Anfield win. </p>
              <p>Rooney said: "We didn't win many. </p>
              <p>"I was mascot at Anfield and that was a great feeling. </p>
              <p>"I used to love the games but I used to feel sick before them because I was so nervous, it was a horrible feeling. </p>
              <p>"If you lost it was dreadful having to go back to school and face your mates who were Liverpool fans." </p>
              <p>Plenty of United fans have known that feeling after losing on their last three trips to Anfield. </p>
              <p>Rooney has played against the biggest and the best in football but admits there is still nothing like a trip to the red half of Merseyside. </p>
              <p>And the day will hold extra-special meaning for Rooney because, along with his family, he retains a deep affection for his first club Everton. </p>
              <p>He said: "For me the toughest place to go and win a game is at Anfield. </p>
              <p>"All my family are massive Everton fans and to beat Liverpool is always a great feeling and a great day when you do that. It's a big day for United with the rivalry with Liverpool — but, for me, it's a massive game." </p>
              <p>His first trip to Anfield with United, in January 2005, was even more special. </p>
              <p>Rooney said: "We won 1-0 — and I scored the winner at the Kop end, so that was a great day." </p>
              <p>He would love to do that again on Saturday against a Liverpool side now being bossed by the club's greatest ever player, Kenny Dalglish.</p>

              <p>wtf what a weakened united side. Park is probably fresher as he has retired from international football, so he is fresher than Nai, who featured in midweek for Portugal?</p>
              <p>what abt Valencia? did he play for Ecuador in midweek? giggs, can he still have the legs for this high intensity match? omg not even anderson started the match. fergie choice of players, is not to get beaten by liverpool. I sure hope united will not be beaten, a draw will do, but then city will overtake united if they beat villa later.</p>
              <p>As for Rooney, he will come on later in the match should united is required to chase the game. much has been said about Rooney's mentality in the papers, so I shall not say much on this.</p>

              <p>wtf what a weakened united side. Park is probably fresher as he has retired from international football, so he is fresher than Nai, who featured in midweek for Portugal?</p>
              <p>what abt Valencia? did he play for Ecuador in midweek? giggs, can he still have the legs for this high intensity match? omg not even anderson started the match. fergie choice of players, is not to get beaten by liverpool. I sure hope united will not be beaten, a draw will do, but then city will overtake united if they beat villa later.</p>
              <p>As for Rooney, he will come on later in the match should united is required to chase the game. much has been said about Rooney's mentality in the papers, so I shall not say much on this.</p>
