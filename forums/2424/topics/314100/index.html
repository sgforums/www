              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ji-sung Park’s recent form has delighted Sir Alex Ferguson – but the United boss may be unaware of just how big a contribution the Korean has made.</strong></p>
              <p>The 1-0 win over Roma in Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg was the livewire winger’s 17th start in the last two seasons – and the Reds have won every one of those games.</p>
              <p>His tireless running caused no end of problems for the Roma defence and he narrowly failed to cap an excellent night with a late goal when goalkeeper Doni deflected his effort onto the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>It was the latest of several impressive displays that Park has made since returning from a long-term knee injury at Christmas to boost the Reds’ title tilt.</p>
              <p>In his nine starts since the turn of the year, United have scored 18 goals and conceded none, a remarkable run which includes the 4-0 FA Cup win over Arsenal as well as the home and away victories over Roma.</p>
              <p>“He has shown absolutely the right attitude and risen to the occasion when called upon,” Ferguson told <strong><em>United Review</em></strong> before Wednesday’s game. “This boy is a very good player.</p>
              <p>“He is incredible in training with tremendous energy and it might just be worth pointing out that a couple of his recent first-team appearances have seen us beat Arsenal 4-0 and Fulham 3-0 with other wins when he has played like 1-0 at Derby and 2-0 against Portsmouth. He never lets us down!”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reds legend Paddy Crerand was equally fulsome in his praise of the 27-year-old.<br><br>"The team Sir Alex put out against Roma shows that the manager is utilising his squad," Crerand told <strong><em>MUTV</em></strong>. "It demonstrates the strength of the squad that United won 1-0 and made it through to the semi-finals of the Champions League.<br><br>"Park is the perfect example. He has done exceptionally well since he came back from injury, and he was excellent again against Roma.<br><br>"He is a player that has been out for a long period with injury. And when players are out for a long time, you sometimes forget how good they are until you see them playing again.<br><br>"Park has got great energy and his movement really troubles teams. He's a valuable asset to the team."</p>
