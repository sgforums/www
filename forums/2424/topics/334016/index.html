              <p>Ruud van Nistelrooy has revealed Real Madrid tried to lure him out of Manchester United a number of times, and he understands the Spaniards are doing the same with Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy claims he was in a similar situation as Ronaldo and finally joined Los Merengues in 2006.</p>
              <p>As a consequence he thinks that the Portuguese will be recruited from the Old Trafford outfit next year.</p>
              <p>“(When I was at United) I almost signed with Real Madrid several times,” he told a press conference. “I didn’t say it before because it was pretty much similar as Cristiano’s situation.</p>
              <p>“I did score 80 goals in 100 games and Madrid planned to sign me, but United said they should wait a bit, and they are now doing the same with Cristiano.</p>
              <p>“As far as I’m concerned I believe we will sign him next year. He wants to come down here and when a player wants to leave, keeping him is hard.</p>
              <p>“We will be team-mates again. He is a spectacular player at the age of 23.”</p>
              <p>The Manchester United legend commented on Sir Alex Ferguson’s character, and he said: “He only speaks Scottish. It becomes difficult when what he expects do not happen.</p>
              <p>“He is a nice person, but he can change and send you a boot in the face. He has been at United for 25 years and rules there."</p>
              <p>The striker has revealed he plans to carry on playing football for three or four more years, as he still feels capable of showing his best level.</p>
              <p>“I am 32, played 15 seasons and I am thinking of retiring at when I turn 35 or 36. I feel good physically, and that is why I retired from international football, in order to be able to rest and be available for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>“This decision was tough to make because my head told me something and my heart the contrary. I still do not feel tired regarding my age.</p>
              <p>“At Madrid we work with doctors and make many tests, they control us a lot.”</p>
