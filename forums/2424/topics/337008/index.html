            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>There has been considerable speculation over Tevez's contract
              situation at Old Trafford in the past few months, inasmuch as he is yet
              to be offered one.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old forward is in the last year of his loan spell from
              Media Sports Investments, the third-party firm which owns the player's
              rights, and there are question marks as to whether the Red Devils can
              match the £34 million asking price.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the summer arrival of Dimitar Berbatov has not only
              depleted Sir Alex Ferguson's transfer kitty but has also given Tevez
              another superstar striker to compete with.</p>
              <p>And Maradona revealed that his protege is concerned that his limited
              first-team opportunities at United will harm his prospects with
              Argentina.</p>
              <p>"Tevez is worried about not being in United’s first-choice team," the World Cup-winning legend said in <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
              <p>"He’s got a challenge ahead of him to win himself a place among lots
              of extremely good players, including Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"But I saw he was in good shape and told him that the best way of
              showing his ability is to win the arm-wrestle against all the other
              players.</p>
              <p>"Then he’ll give himself a good chance with the Argentine team."</p>
              <p>To most neutrals, the idea of Carlos Tevez warming the United bench
              and missing out on international selection is ludicrous - but such is
              the depth of the European champions' and <em>los Albicelestes</em>' squads.</p>
              <p>With Lionel Messi, Diego Milito, Sergio Aguero, Ezequiel Lavezzi,
              German Denis and the like all vying for a place in Argentina's
              forward-line, any extended absence from the spotlight could see Tevez
              slip well down the pecking order.</p>
              <p>However, Maradona is confident that the former Boca Juniors star
              will receive plenty of opportunities to nail down a regular spot in
              Manchester.</p>
              <p>He added: "I believe in his ability and I know he features in Sir Alex Ferguson’s plans."</p>

              <h1>Fergie admits impasse in Tevez talks</h1>
              <p><strong>Alex Ferguson has admitted that Manchester United have yet to broker
              a deal with Carlos Tevez's representatives over a permanent contract
              for the Argentinian striker.</strong></p>
              <p>The former West Ham star, whose
              two-year loan at United expires in June 2009, has been linked with a
              January move to Real Madrid following knee surgery that will rule Ruud
              van Nistelrooy out until next season.</p>
              <p>Tevez has made it clear to
              United that he wants to stay at Old Trafford and wrap up a long-term
              deal, despite his recent inability to claim a starting spot in
              Ferguson's team.</p>
              <p>United are due to pay Tevez's owners, MSI, 22
              million pounds to seal a permanent move, on top of two payments of five
              million pounds to secure the player's signing on loan for this season
              and last.</p>
              <p>But despite the speculation surrounding Tevez,
              Ferguson, whose team face Stoke at Old Trafford on Saturday, admits
              both parties are still keen to thrash out a contract for the player.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "There is no change regarding Carlos, but negotiations like this
              are always protracted and that's the situation we find ourselves in
              with Carlos's agent.</p>
              <p>"David Gill (United chief executive) has been talking to him quite a lot, but there is nothing to report."</p>
              <p>Doubts
              over whether Tevez has a long-term future at Old Trafford have grown in
              the wake of Dimitar Berbatov's August arrival at the club.</p>
              <p>Since
              then it has become apparent that Ferguson wants to build his attacking
              line-up around the Bulgarian with Wayne Rooney currently his preferred
              partner.</p>

              <p>I rather tevez be used as a spare, maybe till next 2 season? Im sure tev will last long if he signs a perm deal. Sooner or later he will be the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
