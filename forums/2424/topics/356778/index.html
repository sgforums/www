              <p><strong>Manchester United's exciting young Brazilian defenders Fabio and Rafael da Silva have revealed they turned down the chance to join Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>The teenage twins played in United's FA Cup semi-final loss to Everton at Wembley on Sunday, and despite the defeat have been tipped to be Old Trafford regulars for the next decade by manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>And in their first interview since joining the club from Fluminense, the 18-year-olds have revealed that Arsenal and Real Madrid also tried to sign them two years ago.</p>
              <p>Fabio - left back at Wembley - said: 'Arsenal were interested and we also spoke to Madrid. But we chose United because they worked very hard and everyone knows them.</p>
              <p>'And Senhor Alex (Ferguson) has always been very supportive of us. He likes to know what people are like, both on and off the field.'</p>
              <p>'Senhor Alex' has already become a father figure to them - 'He jokes around with us,' added Fabio - while Sunday's captain Rio Ferdinand has also played a role in their assimiliation at Old Trafford. Rafael said: 'Rio is a great friend of ours. He has been great. He's the biggest joker of them all.'  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Da Silvas' introduction to the United first team looks seamless but it belies the difficulties of their arrival. The two were banned from playing by the Fluminense president when he learned of their desire to move to England, while Fabio admits he even married his girlfriend earlier than planned in order for her to be granted citizenship in the UK.</p>
              <p>The wedding band on Fabio's finger is how Ferguson tells the twins apart, and Fabio added: 'I got married six months ago. She's called Barbara and is 17. We got married so she could come here.</p>
              <p>'We miss everything from home. The heat, the culture, the people, the humour, playing football and volleyball on the beach. 'But it's worth it because this is the best league.'</p>
