Ji-Sung Park's low drive opened the scoring early on and Michael Carrick's first goal for United doubled the advantage two minutes later.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42447000/jpg/_42447423_carro203.jpg"><br><span class="small">Michael Carrick celebrates after scoring Man Utd's second</span><br><br>Carrick turned creator to cross for Cristiano Ronaldo to head home at the far post 10 minutes before half-time. Gabriel Agbonlahor pulled a goal back for Villa from close range after 51 minutes, but United were a class apart.<br><br>Henrik Larsson was handed his first Premiership start after a goalscoring debut in the FA Cup against Villa. And he almost hit the target after four minutes, meeting Gary Neville's cross perfectly, only for Villa keeper Thomas Sorensen to save his header diving low to his right.<br><br>United did not have to wait long for the opener, however, and it came after 11 minutes. Park scored with a right-foot finish after Villa were troubled by another Neville cross and Gary Cahill presented the South Korean with his opportunity. And United added a second two minutes later, when Park set up Carrick for another low drive that Sorensen touched but could not save.<br><br>United were out of sight 11 minutes before half-time when a calamitous passage of defending by Villa was deservedly punished. The Premiership leaders made a mess of a short corner, but Gavin McCann presented the ball to Park, who fed Carrick and his perfect cross was headed in at the far post by Ronaldo.<br><br>Milan Baros had battled gamely up front, and he offered Villa the slenderest of lifelines after 51 minutes with a strong run and cross that left youngster Agbonlahor with a simple finish from three yards.<br><br>United continued to dominate, and almost added a fourth after 67 minutes through Louis Saha, who had replaced the tiring Park. Neville unlocked Villa's defence with another right-wing raid, and when Sorensen failed to hold his cross, it took a desperate goal-line block by Cahill to deny the France striker.<br><br>United were threatening to score with every attack, Sorensen saving brilliantly from Larsson and the unlucky Wayne Rooney striking the bar with a curling 20-yard effort. Rooney's frustration at failing to hit the target had grown, and he was rightly shown a yellow card by referee Howard Webb for a senseless lunge at Baros.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ferguson believes his side have every chance of ending Chelsea's reign as champions because of their ability in front of goal. Fifty two goals in 23 matches is a record he is rightly proud of. Ferguson said: "There are several things in our favour in the second half of the season. "We have youth in our team and historically we are consistent and strong at this stage.<br><br>"But the other important factor is there is a goal threat about us. That must give a big chance and an edge." Carrick, an Â£18million buy from Tottenham, was pleased to get off the mark. He said: "It was a bonus for me. Winning the game is the main thing. "It was nice to get it out of the way and we can move on. "We played really well first half. Things were happening and we were creating a lot of chances. "Our movement was good and we caused Villa all sorts of problems. "You want to kill the game off early and 3-0 gives you a great cushion going into the second half. "We were disappointed to concede a goal as we wanted to keep a clean sheet."<br><br>Villa manager Martin O'Neill accepts they need some help after a run of 12 games without a victory - Gabriel Agbonlahor's goal their only consolation. But he refuses to enter the transfer market just for the sake of it.<br><br>O'Neill said "We will not be held to ransom. I do not want to be paying exorbitant prices. "I have to be very careful because we need some points. "We have to build some confidence again as we basically have a young team.<br><br>"Considering we were the last side in the Premiership to get beaten, it has changed around now. "These fixtures have hit us hard. However we do now have matches we are capable of competing in. "We are well aware we need to get some points on the board."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm disgusted with o'neill's tactics and formation for this match...<br><br>first, why change the formation with hughes playing just in front of back four when we contained man u well in the fa cup??<br><br>even if he want to play a guy just in front of back four, he could have played osbourne there and not hughes...and then played davis in central mid.....what have davis done wrong to deserve to be benched for two matches in a row?????<br><br>and then in the second half barry was switched to left back and samuel came on in left mid.....wtf??? what was that???? barry was our most attacking threat in the first half and then u go play him in left back......why not just play samuel a natural left back there??<br><br>totally disgusted......the only positive is seeing baros best performance in a villa shirt ever.....gotta hope it's not for attracting clubs to buy him.</div>
