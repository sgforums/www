              Sir Alex Ferguson reckons his Manchester United players are moving into top gear because they have got that big-game smell in their nostrils.
              
              United produced their most accomplished performance of the season at Arsenal on Tuesday to reach the Champions League final. 
              
              It followed an equally assured display at Middlesbrough which leaves Ferguson's men requiring just seven points from their final four games to be certain of completing a Premier League title hat-trick. 
              
              Manchester City present the first hurdle at Old Trafford on Sunday. 
              
              However, having got so close to the prize, Ferguson is quietly optimistic his players will not be denied now. 
              
              "The players are smelling the big games now," said the United chief. 
              
              "They like that big-game situation. They have proved they can handle it and they are hitting top form at the right time. 
              
              "It is ours to win in the sense of the points we are ahead of our opponents. With the form we are in, we have a good chance." 
              
              While there are a number of United players who fit Ferguson's identikit, Cristiano Ronaldo provides the most obvious example. 
              
              A generally slow start to the season after a summer ankle operation for the world player of the year have now been forgotten amid an astounding spell of form. 
              
              Ronaldo has scored seven goals in the last month, including two incredible 40-yard strikes, first against Porto, then in midweek as United stunned the Emirates Stadium with their lightening start. 
              
              "I am not surprised at Cristiano's recent level of performance," said Ferguson. "He is a young man who is still improving because he is nowhere near his maturity." 
              
              The meeting with Barcelona in three weeks' time is already being billed as a shoot-out between the Portugal superstar and Lionel Messi for the right to be regarded as world number one. 
              
              It promises to be the most intriguing sub-plot to an eagerly-awaited contest, by which time Ronaldo could easily be threatening the 30-goal mark once more. 
              
              "Cristiano is coming good just at the right time," said Ferguson. 
              
              "He took a while to get into his rhythm after his operation. 
              
              "Obviously he won't get to 42 goals like he did last season but he is up to 25 now, which is still a fantastic tally for someone who is regarded as a wide player." 
              
              After starring as a centre-forward against Arsenal, Ronaldo should return to a more usual position on Sunday as Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov are among those itching to return. 
              
              Paul Scholes should also be involved, along with Ryan Giggs, who would be playing in an incredible 29th Manchester derby. 
              
              City boss Mark Hughes can only dream of having such strength in depth, despite the vast financial resources currently at his disposal. 
              
              It promises to be a big summer at Eastlands as City attempt to close the vast gulf that still exists between them and their local rivals. 
              
              "For them a lot depends on what happens in the next year or two," said Ferguson. 
              
              "They have a lot of money. Mark knows that. 
              
              "It is a question of how he copes with it in terms of bringing the right players in. They will be big decisions." 
              
              Ferguson hardly needs to be told City badly want to beat his team. 
              
              Last February the Blues put a dampner on the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Munich air crash by ending a 34-year wait for a win at Old Trafford. 
              
              And, with a record-equalling 18th championship so close, Ferguson knows the Blues are hardly lacking in motivation for a repeat triumph. 
              
              "They will be desperate to win the game," he said. 
              
              "That is natural. It is a derby game. 
              
              "Their fans would love to think they can stop us winning the league. There is nothing wrong with that. Our fans would be exactly the same. 
              
              "But that is the nature of derby games. It is not just a rivalry between the fans but also players and the people in the club and the wives and sons of supporters. It involves everybody."
