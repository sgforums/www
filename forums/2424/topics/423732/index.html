              <p><strong>Chris Smalling has been one of United's stand-out performers in recent games, but he is determined to prove he can become a first-choice regular.</strong></p>
              <p>The defender has proved a more than able deputy for Rio Ferdinand this term, but it's his displays in the win over Manchester City and the draw in Marseille that have shown beyond doubt he can handle the big occasion.</p>
              <p>Smalling admits that he didn't expect to play quite so many important matches following a summer switch from Fulham, but he's developed a taste for it and now doesn't want to surrender his place.</p>
              <p>"When you get the shirt and a position in the team you don't want to give it up," he said. "I understand that Rio is the main man and his are big shoes to fill. I just have to make sure whenever another opportunity arises I keep taking them.</p>
              <p>"I know I will have to bide my time, but hopefully with these performances and the sort of games and massive occasions I have been playing in I can justify the manager's faith in me. Hopefully I get many more games because as each match passes I'm getting more confident and that will only help me improve."</p>
              <p>The Reds are challenging in three competitions and Smalling says the players are well aware of the challenges but is confident United can produce the goods.</p>
              <p>"It is a massive stage of the season for us," he says. "We've been at the top for a while now in the league and it's time to kick on and put a bit of space between us and the rest. As players you relish these big games. There's a real togetherness in the squad and hopefully we can kick on in every competition."</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed his delight with Chris Smalling's performances in Manchester United's backline during Rio Ferdinand's absence.</p>
              <p>The ex-Fulham youngster has been featuring alongside Nemanja Vidic at the heart of the Red Devils' defence while centre-half Ferdinand remains sidelined with a calf strain.</p>
              <p>Smalling helped keep a clean sheet against Wigan on Saturday and the 21-year-old is expected to retain his place in the side for Tuesday's clash against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Although Smalling is very much one for the future, Ferguson has been thrilled with his recent contribution and has acknowledged he is continually improving.</p>
              <p>"We are very pleased with his performances," Ferguson told <em>Inside United</em>. "It's an outstanding contribution he has made. But, do you know, I expected him to do well. I had no doubts about him.</p>
              <p>"He's done really well for us and he is improving all the time. He is developing all aspects of his game because he wants to learn and improve. He likes defending, he enjoys it. So he's a real bonus.</p>
              <p>"We started him against City with Rio being out and it's not easy coming in for your first derby at 21 years of age, having only been with us nine months. But I thought he would do well."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also has high hopes for Jonny Evans and believes the Northern Ireland international and Smalling could become the club's long-term partnership.</p>
              <p>"That's the way I look upon it," he continued on Evans and Smalling being the heart of the club's defence for years to come.</p>
              <p>"They're young, but Evans for example has already played a lot of games for us. He played almost three quarters of the matches last season.</p>
              <p>"He is well grounded in terms of what's needed here. His time will come."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>recall reading an article by exMU defender, berg who was analysing smalling, and saying smalling's distribution is suspect, despite his excellent defensive ability. and that did not help in the last UCL game, cause marsellie's players would stand off and allow smalling to distribute the ball and most times, it was not as productive as per Rio would do it. fyi</p></div>

              <p>yeh his touch is not as fine as ferdinand.....but even if it's ferdinand, u look at him distribute balls.....it's better he had left it to the midfielders.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless it's good to see a plethora of talented players on the bench. This smells of trophies.</p>
