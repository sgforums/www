              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1280178" rel="1280178|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1280178/Glazers-great-Manchester-United-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-heaps-praise-American-owners-despite-spiralling-debt.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has praised the Glazer family, insisting that </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester United</span></strong></span></a><strong>'s American owners have offered him constant financial support throughout their stewardship.</strong></p>
              <p>Many United fans are furious at the burden of debt placed on their club by their American owners - currently over £700million - and have been angered further this week by news that interest on one of the Glazers' loans is set to rise in the summer, costing them in the region of £67m over the next seven years.</p>
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>The anti-Glazer sentiment has spawned the green and gold protest movement against the family, as well as a £1.1bn takeover bid by supporters' group the Red Knights, who now appear resigned to their offer's failure.</p>
              <p>Yet despite the widespread criticism, Ferguson has praised the levels of investment the Glazers have poured in, insisting that much of the spending goes unnoticed as it is focused on bringing high quality youth players to the club.</p>
              <p>'They've been great owners,' he said. 'They have supported me every way I've asked them.  </p>
              </div>
              <p>'There's no other reason to think they haven't supported me. If you look at any time I've wanted a player they've provided the money; if you look at what we've done this season - and people don't recognise this - we've spent over £20million on young players.  </p>
              <p>'We've bought Chris Smalling, Mame Diouf and Javier Hernandez. People don't realise how we're structured and how we see our future of the club. We've always based it on a nucleus and foundation of young players developing in the club.'</p>
              <p>Despite spiralling costs at both United and across the Premier League, the demand for instant success and the "greed" of foreign owners makes Ferguson believe a salary cap will not be introduced in football any time soon.  </p>
              <p>'I don't think so,' he said. 'This has been talked about for many, many years. There must be concern about the level of salaries in the game.  </p>
              <p>'But, football is a worldwide game and there's a lot of greed, particularly with the types of owners that come into the game - Russians, Americans, Middle-East owners.  </p>
              <p>'Salary caps will not come into their domain in the sense of the wealth they have and what they can do with that wealth.  </p>
              <p>'They can attract the best players through that wealth and I just don't see that salary caps come into their area of thinking.'</p>
              <p> </p>
