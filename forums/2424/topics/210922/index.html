            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson admitted Arsenal were worthy winners as United dropped their first points of the season on Sunday.<br><br>Emmanuel Adebayor's 85th-minute first strike gave Arsenal the points, following a surprisingly lethargic performance from the Reds.<br><br>"I can't deny Arsenal deserved to win the match," Sir Alex told Sky Sports. "We had some chances, particularly in the first half we had some excellent opportunities but not enough to win the match.<br><br>"I don't think we lost overall control of the match, but in the last 25 minutes I thought Arsenal were much stronger."<br><br>The Boss put his side's sluggishness down to the exertions of Wednesday night's gripping Champions League win over Celtic.<br><br>He said: "With the emotions of it and the pace of the match, it was a real Scotland-England type of match with that type of tempo. It was end to end all night and that's without question one of the things I have to look at.<br><br>"We lost momentum in the second half when we stopped passing forward, and that was a sign of tiredness. It was the second-half that disappointed me. We tired as a team in the last 20 minutes.<br><br>"It was a disappointing result for us. I don't think it was a bad performance but I think we can play better and at the end of the day Arsenal deserved to win."<br><br>Sir Alex cast a protective arm around Cristiano Ronaldo, who surrendered possession in the build-up to Adebayor's winner.<br><br>"I think he lost possession because he's always trying to beat men," he said. "That's the kind of player he is. That's the kind of player we want here. He's an exciting player and he wants to make things happen.<br><br>"Unfortunately he lost the ball and the midfield got caught out. These things happen in football. It could have been any one of the players who lost the ball."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=363963" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=363963</a></div>

We found out that if you give the ball away in the middle of the field, Arsenal are still the best at running off you and breaking quickly.<br><br>"We gave it away too many times. We let ourselves down with our passing. We pride ourselves on that, it's what we do all week and in every game we try to make the pitch as big as possible when we get the ball.<br><br>"Against Arsenal it wasn't crisp enough, quick enough or accurate enough."<br><br>Neville admitted United were playing so poorly during the game he was just hoping to get a point.<br><br>He said: "With five minutes left I thought 'a draw's not a bad result'. But we paid for our mistakes once and once is all it needs."<br><br>Even Wayne Rooney, on his return from suspension, looked out of sorts.<br><br>United had played at home on Wednesday while Arsenal played in Hamburg.<br><br>Neville said: "There's no reason why we should have looked in a worse state than them, but they were fresh."<br><br>He believes the Premiership title remains for grabs.<br><br>Neville said: "The fact the top four sides have already been beaten proves it is going to be tighter this year.<br><br>"We can beat any of the top teams on our day and they know they can beat us." </span></div>

I have never believed that.<br><br>"We are a big club, very ambitious and I believe we can win the title this season.<br><br>"To read the papers recently you would think we would be in the Championship next season.<br><br>"I can keep telling the players they are great but if the words are not backed up by points, it will affect them.<br><br>"I have seen very good teams suddenly look average when doubt creeps in.<br><br>"Given the circumstances and the authority with which we played, this has to be my best win over United at Old Trafford and one that sends out the right signals to everyone."<br><br>Wenger hailed the impact of midfielder Cesc Fabregas in the 1-0 win.<br><br>He said: "Cesc was absolutely amazing. He does not stop from the first to the last minute.<br><br>"His passing is fantastic. He defends, he attacks and in the last five minutes he was still in the box, every time.<br><br>"We were really disturbed after the World Cup. We had lots of players there, lots of young ones too, and it took them some time to recover." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear SAF,<br><br>Lose is lose, dun give stupid excuses like players drained after Celtic match ok ? Ppl Arsenal oso played Champions League what, some more away to Germany.  Man U played Celtic at home and managed only a narrow win, complain for f**k ?<br><br>Blame it on your players and their poor performance and perhaps, there's underestimation of Arsenal ?  Arsenal are without their top players - Henry.  Van Persie is also absent.  You leh, got your strike force back liao, your midfield chao chao can hold its own if you play Carrick early on instead of O'shea.  And for god sake, why is Wes Brown marking Adebayor ?  Is he fast enough to track Adebayor ?  isn't Selvestre a better choice ? But no, you decide to sub him for Evra - what good is he ?<br><br>he is fast yah, but his tackling is not good.  Wheres heinz &amp; Vidic ?<br><br>Only SAF has the answers and honestly I don't buy his excuse.  If SAF is dreaming of challenging the EPL crown, you've got to be able to play two gruelling matches in a week, thats what champions are made of.<br><br>And he better don't cork up against Reading this weekend.  Reading is no easy meat.</div>
