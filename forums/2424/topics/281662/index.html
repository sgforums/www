And he sees no cause for concern.<br><br>"In the summer of 2006 we put in place a long-term financing plan which brought down the interest costs on the business as compared with the takeover in 2005," he said.<br><br>"Since then we have fixed the interest rates, we are moving forward.<br><br>"Our interest cover is excellent, and over time we will generate sufficient funds to make sure the business is on a sound financial footing, and continues to be so."<br><br>And, Gill denied the Glazers had fielded any approach from interested parties over United, which has been valued at over Â£1billion.<br><br>"No, no-one has been in," he said.<br><br>"These things surface every six weeks but the reality is the Glazers are long term holders of the club.<br><br>"If you look at their other investments, whether it be the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or other business investments in the States, they have held them for many, many years.<br><br>"They don't need to sell, and don't intend to sell."</div>
