              <p>Ferdinand has been pleased to come through pre-season untroubled after a calf injury curtailed his preparations for the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>He was sidelined for three weeks after sustaining the problem in the semi-final victory against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand reappeared in the European Cup showdown with Barcelona, only to end up on the losing side.</p>
              <p>The bitter disappointment of failing to retain the trophy, however, has been replaced by a feeling of well-being ahead of the new season.</p>
              <p>United face newly-promoted Birmingham at Old Trafford on Sunday week in their first game.</p>
              <p>And Ferdinand said: "I am fine, there are no problems. I have not missed any training sessions this pre-season, not missed any games and played a lot of minutes.</p>
              <p>"I am delighted and feeling good. Long may that continue this season.</p>
              <p>"The club have been really good. I've had rest and maintenance, a good pre-season tour and training. That's the most important thing. "</p>
              <p>United are aiming for a fourth straight title and Ferdinand insists the club can continue to grow despite the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>The England star is not fazed by the winger's exit and added: "We have been here before.</p>
              <p>"A lot of us have been around a few years and seen so many come through the doors and go.</p>
              <p>"This club moves on from any individual coming and going and that's the same in this instance.</p>
              <p>"The team is more important than one single player. That has always been the case and will always remain."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>The Community Shield may traditionally be viewed as a friendly curtain-raiser, but Rio Ferdinand insists the Reds are heading to Wembley with one intention: winning.<br><br></strong>Sir Alex’s men meet Chelsea on Sunday to contest the season’s first piece of silverware, a trophy United have won 17 times, including twice in the last two years. And Ferdinand, who’s expected to captain the Reds in the absence of Gary Neville, says he and his team-mates are well prepared for the challenge.<br><br>“Obviously being in Asia for two weeks took a lot out of the team – it was a tiring trip – but we should be very close to peak performance by Sunday,” he told <em>ManUtd.com</em>.<br><br>“When there’s a trophy up for grabs it means everything to you to walk out of that stadium as winners.”<br><br>But while professional pride should ensure a competitive spectacle, Rio says the result, no matter which way it goes, shouldn’t be analysed too much.<br><br>“Winning would be great, but it won’t guarantee a successful season. You can’t read too much into these things.”<br><br>Indeed, nine months after suffering a humiliating 3-0 defeat to Arsenal in August 1998, United landed a historic treble.<br><br>That campaign, the Reds fired up front, scoring 128 goals in all competitions. And while Sir Alex’s men haven’t had any trouble finding the net in recent seasons (119 last term, 110 the season before), one of the main sources of those goals – Cristiano Ronaldo – has left for Real Madrid. But it’s not something Ferdinand is worried about.<br><br>“I think the goals will be spread around a lot more this season,” he said. “Over the last two seasons Ronny was sort of our ‘go-to guy’, someone we relied on a lot to stick the ball in the back of the net. His goal record was phenomenal. <br><br>“But the likes of Wazza, Berba and Michael Owen will score plenty of goals, as will our young forwards like Macheda and Welbeck. And you’ll probably see more from the midfielders as well.”<br><br>Owen, in particular, will come in for close scrutiny from the media. And although doubts have been raised about his ability to remain fit, Ferdinand is adamant his England team-mate will prove a hit at Old Trafford. <br><br>“I think the biggest concern with Michael when he signed was making sure he stayed fit,” Rio admitted. <br><br>“But he definitely has the right people around him at the club to help him manage his playing time. It’s just a case of him alerting the staff to any little niggles he has at an early stage and them keeping a close eye on him. <br><br>“We all know he’s got goals in him and we’ll see a lot more this season.”</p></div>
