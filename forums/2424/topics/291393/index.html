            <div class='col-md body'>The secret to UnitedÂ’s exquisite attacking play is a freedom for players to express their ability, which all stems from Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s attacking football philosophy.<br><br>The Reds boss claimed on Sunday that this is the strongest squad he has ever had, and UnitedÂ’s recent performances merely endorse his assertions.<br><br>While some teams have achieved success on the back of regimented tactical organisation, the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and co. are given free licence.<br><br>Â“The manager really wants everyone to be care-free in the sense of expressing themselves on the pitch, and at the moment we are doing it to great effect,Â” Darren Fletcher told ManUtd.com.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve had some great attacks during the time IÂ’ve been around the first team, but what defines this teamÂ’s attack is the youthfulness of it. ItÂ’s a long time since weÂ’ve had such a young group of forwards and wingers.Â”<br><br>Ronaldo got the goals to give United a 2-0 victory over Blackburn. But itÂ’s by no means been a one-man show; the Reds have had ten different goalscorers already this season. Â“Like last year, the goals arenÂ’t just coming from one area, everyone is chipping in,Â” adds Fletcher. Â“You need that, you have to be a threat from all over the pitch otherwise youÂ’ll become predictable, and thatÂ’s an accusation you certainly canÂ’t throw at this team.<br><br>Â“We didnÂ’t score that many goals at the start of the season, but we all knew it would come, and it has. Opposition teams canÂ’t look at us and say, Â‘mark that player and weÂ’ll stop UnitedÂ’. We attack from every direction, up front, from either wing, or from deep in midfield. Each game, somebody new steps up and puts in the star performance.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fletcher, I feel can easily walked into the first team of many clubs such as Spurs, Newcastle, Blackburn.. All these potential clubs pushing the big 4.. I believe he is that good, but the quality of Man U is such that, he can't be a guarantee in the 1st team unless he shoots up like Lampard did.. But frankly speaking, there is no better reliable back-up player then he is.. I wouldn't trade Ronaldinho for Fletcher.. Fletcher is an integral part of the WHOLE MAN U TEAM.. Same goes for Saha and maybe other youngsters.. There is no name, other than Dong, on the Man U squad that I would want to sell right now, if I'm the gaffer..<br><br>If I were to buy another player to complement this attacking flair that we have right now? It would, without a single doubt, be Robinho.. Insanity, people, will reached a new level if he joins..<br><br>Feel free to discuss.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>robinho? nah..... i'll take messi, thank you very very much. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>fletcher is ok la.... squad player @ man utd. i havent seen dong truly in action, so i dun know abt selling him. but the current team was juz built. im sure they have lots of potential to improve. juz imagine, rooney ronaldo and tevez are all still so young. add nani, anderson. probably the only problem is the goalie.... where can we find another schmikes or VDS? foster and kuz havent really played convincingly</div>
