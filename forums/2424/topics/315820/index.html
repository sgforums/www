              <p>Barcelona striker Thierry Henry expects Tuesday's Champions League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford to be far more open than the goalless semi-final first-leg stalemate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wednesday's match at the Nou Camp failed to live up to the pre-match hype as a defensive United side successfully held out for a draw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The result was satisfying for both sides; United going home for the second leg level and Barca managing to avoid conceding an away goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Arsenal legend Henry believes Tuesday's return will be 'different' as both sides attack with more space to play in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'That's true. We might have more space but they will also create more danger,' said Henry, who is unlikely to start the match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>'Here they didn't play their game, because we played well and we expect something different there. On occasions Manchester wanted to play but couldn't. It's not easy to come here and play better than us. </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>'They wanted to but couldn't.'</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Henry is unfazed by the prospect of a return to Old Trafford, scene of some epic battles during his Gunners career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He told the club's website, fcbarcelona.cat: 'It's not like Anfield, which has an incredible atmosphere, but there is some atmosphere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It will be an important moment for them after playing Chelsea this Saturday especially knowing that playing against us won't be easy for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'With Arsenal we played some incredible games there. It was always a pretty fight.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Barca's wretched domestic league form continued last night as Frank Rijkaard watched a weakened side lose limply to Deportivo La Coruna 2-0 in Galicia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite resting the majority of his key players, Rijkaard was able to deploy a front three of Bojan Krkic, Henry and Giovani Dos Santos but the Frenchman and his team-mates produced yet another disappointing performance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The league title has been beyond them for some time but Rijkaard insisted the Catalan giants were still fully concentrated on the clash at the Riazor and not on the United match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rijkaard said: 'No, the team was here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The defeat was the result of many factors: that we played another game a few days ago; the fact that there were a number of players on the pitch who lacked match rhythm; the absence of some players...'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>'Here they didn't play their game, because we played well and we expect something different there. On occasions Manchester wanted to play but couldn't. It's not easy to come here and play better than us. </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>'They wanted to but couldn't.'</strong> &lt;-- we did nt even wanted to play our ''game'' we were just defending though</p>
