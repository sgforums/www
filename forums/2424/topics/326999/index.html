              <div><span><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that Real Madrid did make one official bid for Cristiano Ronaldo this summer.</strong>Â </span></div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>The future of the Manchester United star has dominated the headlines since the end of last season, but he has finally pledged to remain at Old Trafford for at least one more campaign.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>Real made no secret of their desire to bring the Portugal international to Spain with a series of public statements from various members of the club's hierarchy, but never confirmed a bid had been lodged.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>The Red Devils have always steadfastly refused to budge from their long-held position that Ronaldo is not for sale and would be remaining in the Barclays Premier League.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>United boss Ferguson insists the decision that their star man would not be leaving was taken at the start of the whole saga, and admitted that Real have made no attempts to make peace following the long-running battle for Ronaldo's services.</div>
              </div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Ferguson said: "We haven't had any recent contact with Real Madrid. Has there been any attempt to heal the rift? Yeah, that will be right!</p>
              <p>"They put a bid in. I don't know if it was fax or letter or whatever. Just one. It was sometime in the summer. "But the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and Cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days. "It was decided there and then he was staying. There was never any change in our stance."</p>
              <p>The Scot is happy for the matter to have been resolved, and feels Ronaldo could well stay longer than the single season he has pledged. He added: "I think we will just let the thing settle down now. It will take its course.</p>
              <p>"The whole business will settle down, he will realise he is at a great club. It will sort itself out, His future will sort itself out."</p>
