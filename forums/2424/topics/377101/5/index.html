              <p>that is considered mild. he could also mean that the defence failed to protect foster.</p>

              <p>joey barton lol? not for a million years. for what, the troubles he could cause you. if he is blessed with kaka or ronaldino skills, then fergie wouldnt have mind, but he is just an average english midfielder.</p>

              <p>i think while the spotlight is on foster, i think similiarly, the judgement should be on Fergie playing welbeck.. All can see he can't do wing play, he got neither the speed nor the craft, and by drifting inside, he robs Rooney of space and opportunity. Not sure why Valencia was only put on in the 2nd half.</p>
              <p>Kudos to Sunderland for deploying two hardworking MF to negate scholes and fletcher, and in short, choke MUFC's midfield engine.</p>
              <p>I think Berba is a clever player but sometimes over plays and seems to have no real understanding with players who can read his flicks and back heeds to take full advantage. At least he is trying harder.</p>
              <p>The advantage Anderson has over Scholes is younger legs, and he is able to carry the ball longer. He seems to still rush his end-passes, but at least, he is doing good.</p>
              <p>Nani's crossing is dismal. I still think he goes to the ground too often and too easily. Well, think he needs to bulk up. Valencia seems much stronger in that aspects.</p>
              <p>Foster, well, his kicking improves. Sadly, he can't do much with bent's goal. And Jones, he totally dominates Vidic with his aerial power.</p>
              <p>Given Bruce who knows United so well, it is no surprise that he got his gameplay excuted to near perfection. Gosh, I did not know he got so many ex-MU players in his team. No wonder, all of them seems so pumped up to perform.</p>
              <p>Well, MU has a blip, and hopefully, they can pull themselves cause they going to face Pool soon, and that will be a massive game.</p>
