              <p>yes without a shadow of doubt.

              <p>its a 2 points loss. some people may see it as a point gained, well, both are not wrong. utd need to beat teams like sunderland, especially when utd is at home. 2 points may turn out to be crucial at the end of the season. its no longer a top 4 teams now, with city appearing as a challenger and spur and villa are not far off the pace.</p>

              <p><br>cos he sucks at his right foot lol. basically his goalkeeping skills are limited. besides his kicking, his handling like coming out for the ball is also bad. many people say barthez is a clown and bad, but i rate him way better than foster. barthez made goal keeping easier.  barthez is too overconfident and is eccentric whereas foster lack confidence cos he is just an average goalie. I still think english player lack behind european players in terms of skills. english players are all one dimensional basically.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... partly disappointed and yet happy... You know that feeling? Well, in a way we should be happy i guess... cos United were seconds from being beaten by a hardworking Sunderland side... and thanks to an own goal... lol</p>
              <p>One thing this match will give is, by now I belief Fergie will have realised Foster can't make it at United yet... You can't say Fergie didn't give him a chance... He gave him lots of chances and try to give him confidence as well by sticking with him while he has not perform... but its just not working out...</p>
              <p>If Fergie realised this early and drop Foster by the next match, at least the lost 2 points would have been worth it...</p>
              <p>But to be fair, the others didn't play well too... Players like Scholes looked his age, Fletcher not his usual self, Welbeck was a waste of one player's spot, and Nani... only came good towards the end of the match... And I also think its time to bring Brown back for O'Shea as well...</p>
              <p>In the end, like I have said... its a little bitter sweet, I thought it was dead and over when Sunderland looked to be in control then out of nowhere Ferdinand pops up and score when he wasn't even playing... <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>looking at the starting team sheet made me cringe. y give a debut to welbeck now? he kept drifting into the middle. hello u are playing as a winger this time &amp; not a striker?</p>
              <p>the foster factor played a part in the result. i'm not gonna go on like a broken record on the issue.</p>
              <p>defence was really shaky man. vidic &amp; evans were giving free shots from distance. uncharacteristic.</p>
              <p>the midfielders didnt track back fast enough when they counter-attacked, so it was usually 4 against 3-4 sunderland players. too many players were committed to attack, &amp; since passing was way off-par, once sunderland got hold of the ball, we were in danger.</p>
              <p>too much space was given to them. even nani closed down better than fletcher in this game. it was a very disappointing match to watch overall. but credit to sunderland i suppose.</p>

              <p>i think fergie and team underestimated sunderland. This sunderland under steve bruce is an organised outfit. Accurate passes and they were closing down on berbatov and rooney really fast in their own quarter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I looked around the whole united team! Damn, it's so ordinary! The only player making things happen was berbatov! Rooney was off form..he needs to work hard if he wants to be classified in the same game as kaka, messi etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nani is ineffective, Valencia looks like he's really low on confidence. They are wingers but they are not tearing down the flanks and sending in the crosses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foster I still believe has the potential to be a steady keeper. but time running out for him. If he knows that kenwyne jones being strong and steady is getting to the ball, he should have punched the ball out. He attempted to catch it and it went thru his hands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And fletcher normally being so steady lost the ball in midfield which allowed kenwyne jones to score eventually. At other times, he seemed to be outrunning himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh gosh, screw this united performance! The over reliance on giggs is evident now. it's an ominous sign for united on all fronts.</p>

              <p>I think fergie didnt expected sunderland to put up a strong fight, especially when utd is at home and is expected to win as usual, but this is not to be. wellbeck should be playing in league and fa cup matches to give him more exposure and experience or maybe loaned him out for a few months to give him more playing time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope this once and for all showed that foster cant make it at a big club at utd. his kicking is already dodgy and his coming out to collect/punch the ball is pathetic as his kicking. I hope fergie is fair and gives kuszcak more playing time before VDS returns. he cant keep on giving foster chances while he makes mistakes time and again, this is so unfair to the polish goalie, its not like he did not give foster enough chances to play, he did, but foster limited ability is plain for all to see. some say foster is barthez in disguise, but barthez is much much better than foster. he made goalkeeping look easy and is france no 1 for many years and winner of world cup and european championships.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another is the over reliant of giggs as utd playmaker, corner kick and fk taker and he is 36. Nani taking of corner kick is pathetic man. its either delivered to the near post, or far post or too high and easily headed away by the sunderland defenders and giggs is not even on the bench as a standby. scholes is 35 already and how many years can fergie rely on them as playmaker? he need to go out and buy a top playmaker, but the world's best playmaker are in la liga, xavi, iniesta and kaka. who is he going to buy as play maker?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>how many times foster is said to have potential? with his dodgy kicking and pathetic punching of the balls, potential to be a calamity I suppose. Casillas won the CL with RM at age 19 and he was then hailed as potential. indeed he has. foster with dodgy kicking, can also be hailed as potential lol. Like this every player can also be said to have potential, even for a bad player. Imagine foster is the no 1 goalie for utd for the rest of the season, how many points is he going to costs Utd I wonder. He is just an average english goalie, no more than that.</p></div>

              <p>but lucas is not a goalie. when a goalie makes a howler, its usually result in goals being conceded and points lost cos of that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as lucas is an outfield player, there are other players who can step out and take responsibilities. there are also 4 defenders behind lucas, even if he does not do his job properly.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>fergie did not even mentioned on foster's howler in this match. he ranted on the ref performance, saying he is unfit to ref the match and he didnt add extra min to the 4 mins of injury time as such. he did mentioned it was an off performance and bad passing, but strangely he didnt mentioned the goalie performance. probably he will speak to foster behind close doors and give him a hairdryer treatment. if VDS is around, he would have came out to punch the ball or remain in his box and utd probably won it in injury time. many a time in a crucial match, if foster was the goalie making howlers at a crucial CL QFS match, away goals is sometimes the difference between progressing or not progressing to the semis. foster is only suitable for a club like watford, burnley or stoke. a club like utd is too big a shoe for foster to fill. just look no further than howard, taibi, bosnich and carroll. barthez was good in his first 2 seasons, but in his last season, he lost his head and make errors after errors.</p></div>
