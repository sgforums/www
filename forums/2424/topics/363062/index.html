              <h1>Fletcher Targets Starring Role For Manchester United Next Season</h1>
              <div>
              <h2 class="small"><span><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/4-1.jpg"><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/4-1.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="194"></a></span></h2>
              </div>
              <p>There is an element of speculation over which position Manchester
              United manager Sir Alex Ferguson will bolster first this summer. With
              Owen Hargreaves' long-term <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2009/06/05/1307084/fletcher-targets-starring-role-for-manchester-united-next#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">injury</span></span></a> jeopardising his career, the Scot could recruit in central midfield,
              but Darren Fletcher is hoping that his ball-winning and hard-running
              performances this season have convinced his boss that he is the man for
              a starring role.<br><br>Fletcher has been a pivotal player for United
              this season. Often the unsung hero, he has enjoyed a turnaround in
              acclaim as his absence from the Champions League final was telling.
              Fletcher's positional sense, and ability to stifle danger swiftly and
              efficiently, before moving the ball forward have been sterling this
              campaign, but the player credits his self-improvement to his continued
              appearances in Ferguson's first-team.<br><br>"I've always believed in my ability," he told <em>The</em> <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.
              "It is difficult when you are a young player coming through at
              Manchester United. You are surrounded by top midfielders - Roy Keane,
              Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes. <br><br>"When my chances came it was in
              the wide right area and that wasn't a natural position for me. But this
              season I've had a long run in central midfield and my game has improved
              because of that. <br><br>"I am a central midfielder and that's where I want to be, I enjoy playing there and it brings out the best in me."<br><br>Fletcher
              continued, "With a run of games your performances improve and it is as
              simple as that. Sometimes you can go, in previous seasons, six weeks,
              eight weeks and then have to come in and perform. It is difficult. <br><br>"But
              when you get a run of games playing Saturday and Wednesday, your form
              improves, your touch is there and everything about your game is at it's
              top level because it has to be. Your performances improve."<br><br>On
              the subject of his critics he said, "There are always doubters in
              football, even if you have a good season. It is part and parcel of
              football. You've just got to hope that your teammates and the manager
              appreciate you. <br><br>"That's all you've got to do. Obviously it is
              nice to get recognition from other places, but as long as your manager
              appreciates you and your fellow players know what job you are doing,
              that is all any player can ask. <br><br>"As long as the lads know I am
              doing my job, the things that go unnoticed and are unseen by the fans.
              As long as the staff and the manager know, that is fine by me."</p>
