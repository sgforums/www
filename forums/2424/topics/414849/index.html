              <p><strong>Ji-sung Park was both proud and modest after his two goals - the second in injury-time at the Stretford End - yielded a hard-fought and potentially vital league win for United.<br><br></strong>The midfielder was mobbed by his ecstatic team-mates after weaving inside to beat Wolves goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann in the 93rd minute, just when the Reds seemed to be slumping to a sixth draw of this league campaign. The roar around Old Trafford was deafening, but any eardrum damage will be taken in his stride by the South Korean.<br><br>"I’m very happy," Park told <a href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUTV</span></span></strong></a>. <br><br>"We’ve got another three points and I’ve scored the winning goal in the last minute. I’m very happy with that.<br><br>"You can’t compare this feeling to anything else, the feeling of scoring the winning goal in the last minute with the crowd all jumping up and shouting. It’s an unbelievable experience, I really enjoyed that."<br><br>Park's masterpiece was really a solo goal as the actions of defenders in front of him forced him to keep running until the final fraction of space for a shot presented itself.<br><br>"At first, I wanted to cross the ball but then I cut back and I kept driving," he explained. "I was going to shoot but the defender went to tackle me. I avoided the tackle and shot, I scored and everyone was happy."<br><br>The Korean modestly gave the credit for his opening goal, scored on the brink of half-time, to the man who slid the perfect pass into his feet inside the area.<br><br>"It was a great ball from Darren Fletcher, giving me a great chance, one-on-one with the goalkeeper, so it was easy to score," said Park.<br><br>Although that first goal was a body blow to the visitors, given how well they had played in the first half, Wolves recovered to equalise and - Park admitted - worry United that another winning position had been irretrievably lost.<br><br>"We have done it so many times this season, particularly in the early part of the season," Park reflected.~<br><br>"But we know now we can recover from it and score again, especially in front of the home fans. We kept trying to score and in the end we did it."<br><br>Park is pleased that United are going into two tricky away fixtures - at Eastlands on Wednesday and then Villa Park next Saturday - on the back of six consecutive wins in all competitions.<br><br>"Next week we have two very important games and we needed to stay in the winning mood," he said. "We’ve done that and now we have to prepare well for the game against Manchester City."</p>

              <p>Park Ji-sung wants Manchester United to stay in the "winning mood" after his last-gasp effort against Wolves.</p>
              <p>United claimed a sixth successive victory in all competitions at the weekend as South Korea international Park's last-minute goal secured a 2-1 triumph over Wolves.</p>
              <p>The midfielder had earlier put United in front at the end of the first half with his first Premier League goal of the season.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils face local rivals City on Wednesday before travelling to Aston Villa at the weekend and Park stressed the importance of beating Wolves ahead of the two away games.</p>
              <p>"Next week we have two very important games and we needed to stay in the winning mood," Park told <em>MUTV</em>.</p>
              <p>"We've done that and now we have to prepare well for the game against Manchester City."</p>
              <p>Park had scored twice in the Carling Cup this season, but was delighted to get off the mark in the league in such dramatic circumstances.</p>
              <p>"I'm very happy," added Park. "We've got another three points and I've scored the winning goal in the last minute. I'm very happy with that.</p>
              <p>"You can't compare this feeling to anything else, the feeling of scoring the winning goal in the last minute with the crowd all jumping up and shouting.</p>
              <p>"It's an unbelievable experience, I really enjoyed that. We kept trying to score and in the end we did it."</p>
