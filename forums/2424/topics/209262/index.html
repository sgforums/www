            <div class='col-md body'>Gary Neville returns to the United squad for TottenhamÂ’s visit on Saturday.<br><br>The Reds skipper has been out of action since tweaking a calf injury against Fulham on August 20, but is now available again for selection.<br><br>Unfortunately, SpursÂ’ visit comes too soon for three of NevilleÂ’s colleagues.<br><br>Alan Smith had hoped to play a part after completing 90 minutes for the Reserves on Tuesday, but Sir Alex Ferguson quashed talk of an early comeback.<br><br>"He is not ready," he said at his weekly press conference. "It is AlanÂ’s enthusiasm that he says 'if the manger picks me he will play' of course he would.<br><br>"He would play with his leg broke in two that is the type of character we are talking about.<br><br>Â“Alan has a tremendous attitude. He's chipped away, he's handled the whole thing very well but he's not ready for tomorrow.Â”<br><br>Gabriel Heinze and Nemanja Vidic also miss out, although both players trained on Friday and should be in contention for a senior return soon.<br><br>"Vidic goes for a new plaster on Monday,Â” said Sir Alex. Â“Heinze started training today. His rehabilitation is complete, his leg is back to normal and it's a delight to see him.<br><br>He's only just come back after five weeks, I'd think in maybe two to three weeks he'll be ready. I think he should start in the Reserves beforehand.Â”<br><br>TottenhamÂ’s visit pits Michael Carrick against his former team, less than six weeks after swapping White Hart Lane for Old Trafford.<br><br>The Gaffer is confident that the England midfielder will hold his own against Spurs, and has been impressed by his start to life at United.<br><br>Â“I think anybody playing against their former team for the first time will just want to get out there,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“I thought he was tremendous in the first game of the Amsterdam Tournament against Porto. In the second game he was unfortunate to get his injury, which has knocked him back.<br><br>Â“In training he's been great. It's easy for him in a sense because so many English players are there, and he should be ok.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=361538" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=361538</a></div>
