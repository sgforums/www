              <p><strong>Wigan prepare to be overrun by the United army on day of destiny</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://image.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/05/08/RonaldoWiganPhilColeGetty46.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Dave Whelan, the Wigan Athletic chairman, has raised the prospect of major segregation problems inside the JJB Stadium for the visit of Manchester United on Sunday after voicing fears that the town will be "swamped" with up to 20,000 ticketless United fans determined to witness the title decider against Steve Bruce's team. United's official allocation of 4,928 was sold out at Old Trafford last month but thousands more of their fans are expected to make the short trip to Wigan in an effort to buy tickets on the black market.</strong></p>
              <p>Whelan said: "I think we are going to have 10,000 or 15,000 United fans outside this ground on Sunday. It's up to £450 on eBay for a ticket. Manchester United have got fans all over the world and I think we'll be swamped in Wigan. I just feel that we could end up with as many as 20,000 locked outside."</p>
              <p>Such is the anticipated invasion that a Wigan source has confirmed that Greater Manchester Police (GMP) will have twice as many officers as usual on duty on Sunday, approximately 120, and that the Premier League will share policing costs of £34,000 with the club, who lost a court battle with GMP relating to costs in March, in order to ensure that security is as stringent as possible for a game that will decide United's fate in the title race.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Premier League said: "We can confirm that we are meeting the extra policing costs and that it is an appropriate measure when there is the potential for the trophy to be presented at an away ground."</p>
              <p>Wigan officials have also privately expressed concerns over reports of Athletic supporters selling £25 adult tickets for the game to United fans. It is understood that tickets in the home sections of the JJB have been sold to United fans for more than the cost of a Wigan season ticket (£250 for the cheapest) for next season.</p>
              <p>Victory for United would confirm a 10th Premier League title for Sir Alex Ferguson but Bruce, who captained United's first two Premier League titles, stands in his former club's way this weekend. Having paid a £3m transfer fee to Birmingham to secure Bruce's services last November, Whelan believes that the manager's success in steering Wigan away from the relegation zone underlines his standing as a contender to succeed Ferguson at Old Trafford when he decides to retire.</p>
              <p>Whelan said: "When Paul Jewell was here, he was a great manager but I used to feel that when we went to Anfield or Old Trafford, the size of the match used to get to him a little bit. I could sense that. At Liverpool he used to pick a team that would keep the scoreline down and I used to feel it was not the right way.</p>
              <p>"Steve Bruce doesn't have any respect for the big teams. He respects them as football clubs but he is not bothered how big they are, how big the name is, he wants to beat them and you saw that at Aston Villa last Saturday - you could feel it. When United come to choose a new manager, they've got the pick of the world and, if they go for Mark Hughes or Steve Bruce, you've no chance of standing in their way and I wouldn't even contemplate doing so if United came for Bruce. I'd be delighted for him and sorry for the club."</p>
              <p>The talents of the Latin Americans Wilson Palacios and Luis Antonio Valencia are likely to pose the greatest threat to United title hopes on Sunday. United, among others, are monitoring the two players and Whelan admits that Wigan will find it difficult to keep the pair from United's clutches should Ferguson confirm his interest.</p>
              <p>Whelan said: "They are two young quality players and the likes of Sir Alex and the other managers don't miss quality like that. If United knock on the door - and Sir Alex is not one of these managers who does it under cover, he just comes and bangs on your door and does it the right way, up front - and if he does that for Antonio Valencia or Palacios, how am I going to stop them going?"</p>
              <p>Whelan and Ferguson have cultivated a long-standing friendship and it was Ferguson that Whelan invited to open the JJB Stadium in 1999. Yet the Wigan chairman says defeating Ferguson's team on Sunday is the priority for his club.</p>
              <p>He said: "There is nothing we would like better than to roll Manchester United over on Sunday. But they are used to the pressure, they are a good side and it's going to be really hard for us to beat them. If we can beat United, we will do it. Our lads are relaxed and confident and they are up for it big style."</p>
