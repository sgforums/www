              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has insisted he will be in no rush to bring in new faces following the end of Euro 2008.</strong></p>
              <p>There has been little transfer activity at Manchester United or
              anywhere else over the last few weeks with many top players away with
              their countries.</p>
              <p>Following the end of the tournament, clubs are now returning for pre-season and Ferguson expects a busy period in the market.</p>
              <p>However, the Scot has revealed that he does not plan to make
              more than one signing as he is happy with the squad that won the
              Premier League and UEFA Champions League last season.</p>
              <p>He told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "The European Championship derails transfer activity. Nothing really happens when the championships are on.</p>
              <p>"Obviously, now that is all over, people settle down.</p>
              <p>"Managers are back at their clubs and you can get some dialogue
              now if they are interested, but I wouldn't think (we would buy) any
              more than one player.</p>
              <p>"We are looking at one or two things."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is convinced elder statesmen Edwin van der Sar,
              Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs will be key figures for Manchester United
              next season.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson has a fantastic blend of youth and experience available to
              him at Old Trafford and he is not ready to put his senior stars out to
              pasture.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar will be given an extended break following his Euro 2008
              exploits, while Scholes and Giggs will be used to their optimum.</p>
              <p>”Giggs is 34 now and the way we can control the number of games he
              plays, he can give us real quality,” said Ferguson. “He won’t play
              every game but if he gives me 25 games of real quality, that can still
              keep us at the forefront in terms of players who can win matches.</p>
              <p>”Nani and Anderson can improve and the reason we bought them is to replace Scholes and Giggs in the long run.</p>
              <p>"Scholes will give us another couple of years at the top level no question.”</p>
              <p>Van der Sar has called time on his international career with
              Holland, but Ferguson feels the veteran keeper can still operate at the
              highest level.</p>
              <p>The Scot added: “He has looked after himself, that is the key. He
              prepares well and will get a good break. I have told him to have as
              much holiday as he wants. At his age he knows what is best for him and
              he will be back for us and hopefully has another great season.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson is also hopeful that Gary Neville, who has had an injury ravaged 12 months, can return to his best.</p>
              <p>“I am hopeful Gary Neville can come back,” revealed Ferguson. “It is
              difficult at 33 when you have been out of the game for a year, but he
              is such a determined character you would not bet against him coming
              back. And if he does it gives another string to our bow in terms of
              experience.”</p>
