              <p>The Ecuador winger, 25, needed oxygen as he was carried off following an innocuous-looking challenge from Rangers defender Kirk Broadfoot.</p>
              <p>United boss Alex Ferguson said: "I'm afraid it looks really bad. He will be operated on and it's a bad blow.</p>
              <p>"It is a similar injury to the one Alan Smith got when he was with us so we are looking at Valencia being out for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>"We knew it was bad when the Rangers players started waving over to the bench."</p>
              <p>The injury was so serious that Sky Sports decided not to show a replay of the incident during the game.</p>

              <p>I think this Valencia is finish even after he recovers...  Cos I can't recall any player going through this and coming back a better player. At best, he would be an average player from now on... Remember Alan Smiths, Eduardo, Cisse, Kieron Dyer... Eduardo and Dyer were becoming very good players but their injury more or less ended their chance of ever making it at the very top...</p>
              <p>United should have bought Vdv afterall cos now they are short of one good winger...</p>

              <p>I'm not that worried actually. Nani was actually playing in Valencia's position and kept him out of the team. And United do have Obertan right? Maybe he deserves a chance to shine?</p>
              <p>Traditionally, United do not begin the season in top gear, unlike Arsenal and Chelsea. But i'm pretty sure United will pick up pace as the season progresses as soon as the injured players get back and Rooney's personal life is sorted out. And didn't Berbatov and Nani stepped up this season? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>However, i do believe there's a need for new Right-Back!</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Contrary to recent reports there has been no official contact from the Ecuadorian national team. Antonio is perfectly fine, very positive and very determined.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sportsmail revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson was at Valencia’s hospital bedside by 9am on Wednesday to reassure the winger that he still has a future in football.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Although the Ecuador international faces a struggle to play again this season, Ferguson told him he will make a recovery.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A friend of Valencia told Sportsmail: ‘Antonio is devastated and finding it hard to come to terms with what has happened. But it cheered him up that Sir Alex came in to see him. He really appreciated that.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Ferguson ruled Valencia out of the remainder of the campaign and likened the injury to one suffered by Alan Smith in 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When Smith suffered his injury in a freak incident against Liverpool at Anfield, he was ruled out for seven months, claiming afterwards that his eventual return came too </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">soon.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>A similar timescale would have Valencia back in action by April, although by that stage Ferguson might not want to be pushing the winger anyway.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After an impressive first season at Old Trafford, Valencia had been hoping to make further improvement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Instead, he must battle to recover from such an awful setback, with Darren Fletcher among those who feel he will be back.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'He is a strong character and a good lad. He has real determination and works hard. He will be back I am sure. He will have a long future at Manchester United.'<br></span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALAN SMITH'S career at Manchester United was wrecked by a horrific ankle injury.</h2>
              <p>And he shuddered in the stands on Tuesday night as Antonio Valencia was carried off after a tackle from Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot.</p>
              <p>It seemed an innocuous challenge but the diagnosis for Valencia was a fracture and dislocation of his left ankle.</p>
              <p>For Smith to be there as it happened was an astonishing coincidence.</p>
              <p>Now at Newcastle, the midfielder rarely goes back to Old Trafford but
               had a late offer of a ticket from Toon No 2 Colin Calderwood.</p>
              <p>And, when Valencia went down in agony, memories of his own awful fate 4½ years ago came flooding back.</p>
              <p>Smith was out for eight months after dislocating an ankle and 
              breaking a bone as he blocked a free-kick in an FA Cup tie at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>But it was 18 months before he was properly fit again and he moved on to St James' Park.</p>
              <p>United boss Alex Ferguson said at the time it was "one of the worst injuries I've ever seen".</p>
              <p>And, as Valencia lay in hospital on Tuesday night, Fergie observed 
              the Ecuador star's injury was similar to the one Smith suffered.</p>
              <p>It marked the beginning of the end of Smith's United career - but he hopes Valencia can make a full and speedy recovery.</p>
              <p>Smith, 29, said: "I can relate to what Antonio is going through.</p>
              <p>"There's no getting away from the fact it is a hard road back from an injury like that but with determination, you can do it.</p>
              <p>"It means weeks of doing virtually nothing then long days with the 
              specialists, the physios and in the gym building your ankle up before 
              you can even think about kicking a ball again.</p>
              <p>"But the thought of being able to get back on the field is what keeps you going, no matter how far away that day may seem.</p>
              <p>"Valencia is in good hands. United's medical team are excellent and always keep your spirits up.</p>
              <p>"He will get so much support from the fans too. They were always 
              sending me messages while I was out and I'm sure it will be the same for
               Antonio.</p>
              <p>"I really felt for him and it brought back memories of my injury at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"It's strange sometimes what causes serious injuries.</p>
              <p>"Mine was caused by blocking a free-kick when there was no one near me.</p>
              <p>"I just hope, like everyone in football, that Antonio can work his 
              way through rehab and wish him all the best for a complete recovery."</p>
