But we also have to remember we still have so much to go for this season.<br><br>Â“Yes, we are greedy. We wanted to win everything this season. Now we are out of the Champions League, we have to try and win the double.Â”<br><br>Another minor piece of good news to emerge from what was a disastrous evening for the Red Devils is that Cristiano Ronaldo will be available for the start of next seasonÂ’s European campaign.<br><br>Ronaldo was among UnitedÂ’s biggest disappointments last night and capped off a poor evening by collecting a booking which would have ruled him out of the final if his team had gone through.<br><br>There was some suggestion the Portugal wingerÂ’s suspension would carry forward to next season.<br><br>However, UEFA have confirmed that is the case only with red card offences, leaving Ronaldo clear to make his re-appearance in the group stage next term, where UnitedÂ’s presence has already been assured.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel SAF has no choice but to gamble - the make-shift defense is crap and the fact that they are able to pull through the last few matches is becos they faced weak opponents / have home grnd advantage.<br><br>And I agree with his choice, Vidic hurt his shoulder but not his legs, so he can run whereas Ferdinand hurt his groin and won't even able to jog.<br><br>its just too bad that the injuries plagued - but reading the post-match report, i doubt if Man U can hold them back defending a 1 goal lead even if both Ferdinand &amp; Vidic is fit.  They lack a midfield lynchpin who can match Gattuso &amp; Seedorf.  Both Scholes &amp; Carrick are attack / creative minded players, not some one who can hold and guard - like Viera / Keane.<br><br>They need to strengthen that in the coming transfer window to provide steel in midfield.</div>

Keano's breed is extinct alrdy i would say..i cant see anyone in the same mould as him right now, maybe cept for Vieira...</div>
