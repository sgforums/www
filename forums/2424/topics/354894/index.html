              <p>1) <strong>Resurgence of Ronaldo</strong> - he has looked a little inconsistent of late, impressing against inter milan but dipping in form against liverpool and fulham. But last night, he inspired the comeback when no one else could and he finally scored from a free kick this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) <strong>Rooney, Vidic and Scholes</strong> are back - Need I say more?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) <strong>Strength in depth</strong> - Frederico Macheda. With that sort of technique at 17 years old, he is definitely a great player of the future. Not forgetting danny welbeck and johnny evans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) <strong>Once bitten twice shy</strong> - Precisely becos they have lost the title after taking a 12 point lead over Arsenal, Man U are determined not to let history repeat itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) The chase for the <strong>historic quintuple</strong>...the desire to write themselves in world history books as the greatest football team ever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) <strong>Alex Ferguson's strong karma</strong> - so many seasons luck has played a part....be it goal line clearances, last minute goals etc, he's got all of them. And this season, it will be no different.</p>

              <p><br>well 1) is a possibility but when man u won the treble in 1999, their fixtures were congested too. They chased the treble then, man u is also chasing the remanining treble now too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Ronaldo wasnt so affected by RM last night right? lol. Look at the way he celbrated the second comeback goal. His veins looked like they almost burst.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Rooney will learn from his rage lessons. Saw how Capello reined him in as he shone in those 2 midweek internationals?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>after seeing how they come back from 2-1 I was thinking they have tremendous amount of luck. </p>
              <p>the equaliser from Ronaldo was lucky, it does not have much power and he took it beyond the penalty box, had Frediel position himself properly, it would be an easy save.</p>
              <p>the shot by Macheda as brillant and there was nothing to it.  No one expected him to shoot from there - its a beauty. And looking at the Macheda, I think man U can sell Tevez this summer - the whole night he is rendered ineffective - why? bcos he is too short.  and if you look at Man U's play last night, they couldn't cross the ball into the box, Tevez was too short and Ronaldo was knocked off before he could enter the penalty box.  I was surprised why Fergie play Nani instead of Park - maybe he want to keep Park for Champions League.</p>
              <p><br>But Macheda has the look of a strong centre fwd, he is tall and he can develope into a strong striker.  Good future for him.</p>
              <p>Anyways I think Man U will win the title - but it will probably go down to the wire.   But they won't win 5 trophies.  Fergie will want to equal Liverpool's record before bowing out.   Crucial matches: Man U vs Arsenal.  Both Liverpool &amp; Man U need to play Arsenal.  In fact all three teams have to take on Arsenal. </p>
              <p>Man U vs Middlesborough will be interesting - Boro is fighting for survival.... </p>

              <p><br>not the way i saw it. I'm sure many others too. I would have been more sure if man u had won against liverpool and fulham. And even till before the fulham match, I knew that if it was a draw or loss, then title race is no longer in their hands, even though they have 1 match in hand. But last night's fight back tells me that they can go all the way.</p>

              <p><br> well 1) is a possibility but when man u won the treble in 1999,
              their fixtures were congested too. They chased the treble then, man
              u is also chasing the remanining treble now too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Ronaldo wasnt so affected by RM last night right? lol. Look
              at the way he celbrated the second comeback goal. His veins looked
              like they almost burst.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Rooney will learn from his rage lessons. Saw how Capello
              reined him in as he shone in those 2 midweek internationals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Defence is a concern i agree.</p>

              <p>#3, i do recall Rooney going a bit over the line in a tackle against an Ukraine Player, but Capello played it down.. I do think SAF has a better chance of working at it..else, he can enrol in Jack Nicholson's anger management class.</p>

              <p>if U see, there are always 2 players trying to stop him, so I do believe he can't just dribble and be cornered off. so now, he has to do something different. so he tends to go wide, spread the play, and come in from the middle like how he scored the 2nd goal. he is still a good kicker of the ball, no?</p>
