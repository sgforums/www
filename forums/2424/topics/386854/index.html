              <h3>MANCHESTER UNITED are weighing up a £20million bid for Brazilian striker 
                                      Hulk.<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;"> </span></h3>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is an admirer of the Porto star and wants to strengthen his 
                                      forward line as he bids for a fourth successive Premier League title. </p>
              <p>The Brazil international has a clause in his contract that says he cannot be 
                                      released for less than 100m euros, but sources at the Portuguese club say a 
                                      realistic offer of around £20m would see Hulk leave the Estadio do Dragao at the 
                                      end of the season. </p>
              <p>"The big clubs in England have been in contact," said the player's agent 
                                      Teodoro Fonseca. </p>
              <p>"They have asked for details about his contract situation but any decision 
                                      about his future rests mainly with the directors of Porto. </p>
              <p>"I am calm about the situation and so is the player because he has an 
                                      excellent future. I think we could be discussing a move in April or May." </p>
              <p>Hulk, 23, whose real name is Givanildo Vieira de Souza, has four years left 
                                      on his contract and is also rated highly by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman saw him play at the Emirates in last season's Champions League 
                                      but would almost certainly be outbid by United.</p>
              <p>Fergie is believed to like the physical attributes the striker could add to 
                                      his side after he lost Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez last summer.</p>
              <p>Hulk made his Brazil debut against England in November and now has two caps. 
                                      He is likely to be named in his country's World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>He got his nickname because of his stocky appearance and his likeness to 
                                      actor Lou Ferrigno, who played the comic book hero.</p>
              <p>"Hulk would be a good investment for United," said a Porto source. "He has the quality to be a superstar in England and his club will have no 
                                      choice but to take a big offer for him very seriously." </p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United may have to wait until the summer if they are going to sign Hulk, according to the Porto striker's agent.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>The Red Devils are reportedly lining up a £20million raid for the Porto forward, who boasts an impressive scoring record with the Portuguese champions and has made a number of eye-catching performances in the Champions League this season.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old is hoping to secure a place in the Brazil squad for this summer's World Cup in South Africa, and his agent Teodoro Fonseca is wary that a January move could disrupt his progress.</p>
              <p>"Inclusion in Brazil's World Cup squad is the most important thing," he said in The Sun.</p>
              <p>"If he gets in, it could act as the gateway to England for him and that is what we want."</p>
              <p>Hulk, who spent three years playing in Japan before moving to Porto, made his debut for Brazil in November last year when he came on as a substitute in the 1-0 win over England.</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is rumoured to be interested in a striker to relieve Wayne Rooney of the goalscoring burden at Old Trafford.</p>
