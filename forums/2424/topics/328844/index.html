              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Everton</strong></span><strong> have announced they have agreed to sign </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United's</strong></span><strong> Louis Saha, subject to a medical. Toffees boss David Moyes had agreed an undisclosed fee for the France striker, who has been offered a two-year contract with the option of a one-year extension.</strong>   </p>
              <p>The 30-year-old former Newcastle and Fulham forward will become Everton's third signing in a week following the captures of Lars Jacobsen and Segundo Castillo providing he is passed fit by the club's medical staff.  </p>
              <p>Saha, whose spell at Old Trafford was beset by injuries, has 18 international caps and scored 42 goals during his United career. His arrival significantly strengthens Everton's attacking options and caps off a busy few days for Moyes, who admitted last week that his resources were too thin for the rigours of a Premier League campaign.</p>
              <p>He has since signed former Nuremburg player Jacobsen on a free transfer and secured a year-long loan deal for Red Star Belgrade midfielder Castillo. The Scot's hopes of bringing Juventus' former Chelsea playmaker Tiago hit the rocks when the player turned down a move to Merseyside but there could be further additions before the end of the month, with Nigeria striker Victor Obinna also a target.</p>

              <p class="photoDesc"><em>Louis Saha: Beset by injuries during his time at the club.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Dimitar Berbatov's transfer to Manchester United is expected to be finalised this weekend. The Tottenham Hotspur striker was seen yesterday shaking hands with team-mates and staff at the club's Essex training ground while United cleared the way for his arrival by allowing Louis Saha to join Everton.</strong></p>
              <p>United's willingness to allow Saha to leave for no initial fee suggests a deal with Berbatov is imminent. The Frenchman, a £12.8m buy from Fulham in January 2004, still had two years left to run on his £65,000-a-week contract. His departure, combined with the defender Mikaël Silvestre's exit for Arsenal last week, has taken over £100,000 off United's weekly wage bill but left United short of strikers before Monday's transfer deadline.</p>
              <p>"I am quite disappointed that my time with Manchester United has finished like this, with so many injury problems," Saha said yesterday. "But I am very happy that a club of Everton's stature have shown they are interested in me. It's a club that is involved in European football and I was very impressed when I spoke to their manager, David Moyes. He told me exactly how he wanted me to play. He was very honest with me. I also spoke to Sir Alex Ferguson and his opinion was that it would be good for me to sign for Everton because I would get the chance to play more there."</p>
              <p>United will receive nominal payments based on appearances. Moyes is confident that the 30-year-old, who has been offered a two-year contract with the option of a third year and will have a medical this morning, can prove a success if he is given time to return to full fitness. "Louis is a good centre-forward who has a bit of everything," Moyes said. "He can run, head the ball and score goals and he hasn't cost us any money. If I can get him out there 20 times a season, that would give us a chance of winning 20 games. He picked up a calf strain in training at United, but it isn't far away from being OK now."</p>
