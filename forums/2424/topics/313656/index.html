              <p class="ss-text-bold">Ryan Giggs hopes Manchester United's draw with Middlesbrough will be viewed as a point gained at the end of the season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The weekend's action has seen United's advantage at the top cut to three points after the leaders responded to Chelsea beating Manchester City by drawing 2-2 at Boro.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney's goal secured a point for the reigning champions and skipper Giggs was content to settle for a draw.</p>
              <p>"I think overall we're pleased after going 2-1 down," Giggs told <em>Sky Sports</em>.</p>
              <p>"We want to win every game, but we hope that will be a point gained at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"We started the game really well and obviously got the goal, but Boro are a good team and it's always a difficult place to come."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Confidence</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Giggs admits the United squad are relishing the run-in, with the second leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter-final with Roma to come on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The Welsh winger added: "It's just about keeping your good form now, both as an individual and a team. You want to go into every game with confidence and knowing you can win every game.</p>
              <p>"We know it's not going to be easy, but if we play to the best of our ability, then we'll have a chance.</p>
              <p>"It's an exciting time, it's big game after big game and every game is like a little final in itself. You want to be involved in games like this and all the lads are looking forward to it."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Giggs need to shut up and get his act together, His distrubution is terrible. He no longer has any pace and the games have tended to pass him by all season. It's fairly obvious his failings are beginning to affect our performances and Rooney/Ronaldo can only carry him so far. <br>he has been really awful. I am afraid age is catching up on him.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>I think you need to shut up. He has been with this club for so long. He deserves more respect. True, he can't run as fast as he used to, his dribbling may not be that effective now but he is still a great player.</p>
              <p>His experience will be extremely useful during this period.</p>

              <p>agree with you.</p>
              <p>Giggs has been really low on performance. Going by performance, Scholes is much better than him.</p>
              <p>I believe Giggs was kept on the bench to rest his legs, but till date, has not seen him score, a heart-stopping assist.</p>
              <p>I don't deny his calming influence on the game or the players but I think as a AM or winger, he needs to have more end-product.</p>
              <p>And not be borthered by those past charlton records.</p>

              <h1>United Fans Call For Giggs To Be Dropped</h1>
              <h2>Ryan Giggs made his 750th appearance for Manchester United at the
              weekend, but that hasn't stopped growing numbers of Red Devils fans
              calling for Sir Alex Ferguson to drop the Welshman</h2>
              <p>Giggs has delivered a string of poor performances in recent times, with
              some United fans failing to see what the 34-year-old brings to the side
              nowadays. <br><br>The career-long United servant is only nine games
              off equalling Bobby Charlton's all-time record for Manchester United
              appearances, but among sections of the fanbase at least it appears
              there is little room for sentiment.</p>
              <p>“Can you possibly tell me why Ryan Giggs keeps getting 
              the sympathy vote? He was woeful today," said one caller to a phone-in show on United's own TV channel, MUTV. <br><br>Another
              said: “I do not see what Ryan Giggs brings to the side at the moment.
              He has been a great servant and got some fantastic goals. But at the
              moment he’s not worth playing. He’s no threat.”</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson himself was unhappy with Giggs on Sunday as he failed
              to latch onto a great through-ball from Park Ji-Sung late in the game
              at Middlesbrough, which ended 2-2 and saw United's lead at the top cut
              to just three points. <br><br>Indeed, Fergie's recent team selections
              suggest he is reluctant to play the winger in many big names now, hence
              his exclusion from the XI that won in Rome last week.</p>

              <p>oh I once recall a german striker klose doings crazy somersaults after scoring and the doctor advised it will weaken the ankles.</p>
              <p>Saf is giving park a chance to play. Park to me, is the most hard-working and selfless player. However, to me, he still lacks that special quality that Ronaldo, Rooney or even Giggs can bring, that ability to change the match in a split-second with that pass/shot. However, kudos to Park, his engine is just awesome.</p>
              <p>I think Giggs has been a wonderful servant and he is serving in a different capacity. Similiar to Scholes, you can't expect him to go from box to box, score tens of goals but more of a holding and passing midfield cause his legs may be a bit older, amazingly his brain is not.</p>
              <p>But to both Ronaldo, Nani and Anderson, they have great role models in these guys to learn about how they stay in one club, how they mature/grow, and also how to take care of themselves to last this long in the modern game.</p>
