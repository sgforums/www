            <div class='col-md body'>Wayne Rooney talks to BBC Sport on a wide range of subjects, from his favourite footballers to meeting the rich and famous.<br><br>He also gives advice on how to make it as a professional footballer and recalls receiving an unexpected birthday present from Noel Gallagher.<br><br>Q. Is it hard to be in the public eye all the time when people are taking photographs of you whenever you go out?<br><br>A. It's not hard, it's just a hassle to be honest. You're out with your family or your friends having some food, or you're going to your friend's house, and you walk out and there's a photographer there.<br><br>It's just stupid really but that's what the press are like in this country, so you've got to get used to it.<br><br>Q. Do you ever miss the days when you could just go out in the street and have a kickabout with your mates?<br><br>A. I used to do it every day and I love doing it. It was a big part of my life when I was growing up. I still do it now and again when I get the chance to go on the streets and have a kickaround.<br><br>Obviously I'd like to do it more but it's a bit difficult! I think it's brilliant when you're growing up to do that.<br><br>Q. What advice would you give to a young footballer about the best way to become a professional?<br><br>A. Dedication. Practice every day and keep trying to learn. To make the step from a youth team player, to the reserve team and then the first team you have to sacrifice a few things in your life and if you can do that it will give you the best possible chance to achieve that.<br><br>Football's about the young players, bringing youth team players through to the first team and hopefully getting the best out of them so they can go on to play for their country.<br><br>At the minute there's not as many (young English players) as we would like to see coming through but there's definitely players out there who are capable of doing something, it's just finding them and helping them along the way to become better.<br><br>Q. Do you think it's strange that famous people want to meet you?<br><br>A. Yeah of course. You go to some event where there is famous people and obviously it's good to meet them because you see them on the TV all the time, or you've been listening to their music.<br><br>When famous people come up to you it's a bit weird, but it's an honour, really, when they recognise you and want to chat to you for a bit.<br><br>Q. Do you ever get starstruck?<br><br>A. Not really. The one person I wanted to meet was Mike Tyson and I've met him a few times now. That was unbelievable to meet him - it was a dream really. He was a nice guy too.<br><br>Q. When you play football games on your computer do you ever play as anyone else apart from England or Manchester United?<br><br>A. Not really. I always go for United, or if I'm playing an international I go with England.<br><br>Q. It must be strange seeing yourself on the screen?<br><br>A. Yes it is! When I used to play when I was younger I always used to edit it in so it was me and whoever up front, but now when my name's already on the screen it's a bit weird!<br><br>Q. Who's the best player in the world?<br><br>A. Cristiano Ronaldo's been brilliant and he's getting better each year and there's Lionel Messi as well. Those two.<br><br>Q. Is it true Noel Gallagher gave you a guitar for your birthday sprayed in Man City colours with the lyrics to Blue Moon written on it?<br><br>A. Yes. But at the end of the day it's unique.<br><br>Q. Some reports suggested you've given it away - are you planning to keep it?<br><br>A. Of course I'm going to keep it! It's a birthday present and I keep all my birthday presents.</div>
