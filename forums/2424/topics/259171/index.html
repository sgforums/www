            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/smith_look.jpg"><br><br><strong>ALAN SMITH has been told by Manchester United: YouÂ’re not getting a new contract. That will trigger a bidding war Â— with Spurs, Everton, Middlesbrough and Aston Villa all keen to land him.</strong><br><br>The England frontman, 26, wanted to extend his stay at Old Trafford with two years to run on his current agreement. But now it seems United are ready to sell. The Red Devils have spent Â£48million since the end of the season Â— on Nani, Anderson, and Owen Hargreaves Â— and want some cash back.<br><br>Smith, who earns around Â£50,000 a week, signed for United in a Â£7m switch from Leeds three years ago. He had a renewal clause in his original deal which entitled him to a rise after two years at the club. But Smith waived that because he was injured at the time.<br><br>His agent, Alex Black, approached United to start talks this summer. But there was a stony silence until club chief executive David Gill came back with a firm Â‘noÂ’ this week.<br><br>Smith has an open mind over his future. He has previously considered moving abroad Â— to Spain or Italy. But, with so much interest from other Premiership clubs, he will have no problem getting a bumper deal in this country.<br><br>But Black said: Â“Alan remains contracted to United for the next two years so, unless the club decides to sell him, he intends to stay.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Man u will still play with a 2nd striker as Rooney has always done since his time at united, Next season they may even have another player Anderson able to play in that role... The only thing is the top man... I am afraid Smith isn't the best choice for that role cos for a simple fact that he can't get you goals... United have spent quite a sum and they need to get some in return. Letting Smith and Heinze go i guess is correct cos together they could still command a $10m return to the $40+ they have spent... And who knows, they may even get another striker in, one that can score unlike Smith hardworking as he may be but still no end product...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, though i like Smith, i think it's right for him to go.<br><br>Sure, part of it maybe the realities of football, he's more of a traditional hard-working type of player but Fergie evidently wants a shift from that to a more fluid system that requires different sort of players.<br><br>Smith's abilities also deserve better than the bench. He may not be a top-class footballer, but few would disagree that he's a top-flight footballer. With spurs, he may have the chance to feature more in Europe in the Uefa Cup.<br><br></div>

Something that Steve Bruce, Mark Huges and even Bryan Robson has done with West Brom... No doubt he is doing a great job currently at Sunderland but the real test will be... not just survive but to do well in the EPL next season... Only then can we say he is a good manager.</div>
