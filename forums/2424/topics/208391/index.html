            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United turned down the opportunity to sign Argentine midfielder Javier Mascherano on two occasions during the summer.<br><br>On Thursday Mascherano, 22, along with striker Carlos Tevez, 22, signed for West Ham from Corinthians of Brazil on permanent deals for undisclosed fees.<br><br>"We were never interested in Tevez," United chief executive David Gill told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek programme.<br><br>"We were also offered Mascherano but we didn't want to go for him."<br><br>Gill added: "We were offered Mascherano for a significant sum at the start of the summer and also last week on a loan deal.<br><br>"We had watched him last season but the manager and his staff didn't want to pursue him.<br><br>"While he is clearly a very good player it was decided he wasn't required at the club."<br><br>Meanwhile, Gill remains upbeat over the chances of a new contract for striker Wayne Rooney.<br><br>England international Rooney, 20, wants to extend the six-season deal he signed when he joined United in August 2004.<br><br>"His eagerness to sign a long-term deal is great," said Gill. "I think there will be developments over the next few months.<br><br>"We want to tie him down to the club."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there are other reasons why they don't need him, Maybe MSI wanted a lot  of money, it was mentioned around $30m pounds for one player. Also could be Fergie is still intending to get Owen Hargreaves in Jan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United's chief executive David Gill have said:<br><br>'From Manchester United's perspective, Tevez was never on the shopping list. Mascherano we watched closely and very carefully and the experts on that area in our club determined that we did not want to go for him.'<br><br>United have refused to rule out making another bid for Bayern Munich's Owen Hargreaves in January.<br><br>Gill admitted their interest in the midfielder, who played a starring role in England's 5-0 defeat of Andorra at Old Trafford yesterday, would persist despite Bayern's refusal to sell this summer.<br><br>He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek show: 'Owen was on record as being very interested in coming to us and we were clearly very interested in Owen.<br><br>'He is a player we have had on the list for quite a while, actually.<br><br>'Obviously Bayern were very keen - and are very keen - to keep him. We will have to see.<br><br>'If that situation does not change, then obviously we will not acquire Owen.<br><br>'But Bayern have indicated to me that they will let us know if the situation changes and at that point, we hopefully can consummate a deal.<br><br>'These things do not just happen on January 1, one has discussions around the year on these particular transactions.'<br><br>Gill's comments came amid criticism from fans that the club were not active enough towards the end of the transfer window as both Chelsea and Arsenal strengthened.<br><br>However, having invested heavily in midfielder Michael Carrick and goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak following the arrivals of Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra in January, Gill defended the club's activity.<br><br>He said: 'We understand the frustration of fans, who feel we should have been more active.<br><br>'But we are very conscious that the quality in our squad is very high and therefore the players we bring in must add to that quality, they must be defined as reasonably valued and very critically, we believe, they must want to be a Manchester United player.<br><br>'They are the players we are interested in.'<br><br>Gill, who insisted the club had not tried to sign France striker David Trezeguet from Juventus, further promised the cash which had not been spent this summer would be available to manager Sir Alex Ferguson in January and beyond.<br><br>He said: 'Our transfer policy evolves according to what the manager wants and the budget will allow.<br><br>'It is important to know just because we have not spent the money we had anticipated in this window, that money is not lost.<br><br>'That money will be carried forward, those funds will be available for the right player at the right time.<br><br>'I do not think our policy has changed at all.'<br><br>Meanwhile, United expect to sit down with star striker Wayne Rooney and thrash out a new long-term contract within the next few months.<br><br>The 20-year-old is currently two years into a six-year deal, but both he and his employers have shown a willingness to extend that sooner rather than later.<br><br>Gill said: 'He is a key player for us and his eagerness to sign a long-term deal is great.<br><br>'I think there will be developments on that in the course of the next two or three months.<br><br>'We want to sit down and tie him to the club for longer, and really importantly for us and for our fans, he wants to do that.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe Mascherano can't speak english or not so well. It is important that a midfielder is able to communicate with the defenders &amp; strikers.
