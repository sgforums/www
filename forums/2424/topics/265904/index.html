Â“I canÂ’t wait to set up a goal for him. He is a spectacular player who has improved so much at United and I want to do the same.<br><br>Â“I will be proud to play alongside him and prove that Brazilians can flourish in the Premier League. I will be a strong player."<br><br>Anderson insists his main priority in his debut season will be to help United retain their Premiership crown.<br><br>Â“The aim is to win the title and stop Chelsea winning it. I canÂ’t wait," he said. "This is a dream move, one I could not reject. Now I am looking forward to arriving and playing without fear."</div>
