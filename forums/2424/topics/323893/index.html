              <p><strong>Just 52 days after being crowned kings of Europe in Moscow,
              United are back in action at Aberdeen on Saturday, and club captain
              Gary Neville is among the travelling party.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds are
              taking a healthy blend of experience and youth to Pittodrie, with the
              likes of Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes travelling alongside
              youngsters such as Ben Amos, Gary Woods and Sam Hewson.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex
              Ferguson returns to his former club for the 25th anniversary of the
              Dons' greatest triumph, victory over Real Madrid in the 1983 European
              Cup Winners' Cup final in Gothenburg.<br><br>The United manager will be
              delighted to include Neville, who was restricted to just nine minutes
              of senior action last term, while also handing first-team tasters to
              members of the Reserve and U18 squads.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Report: Aberdeen 0 United 2</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>United made a winning start to the new pre-season campaign, as
              goals from Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney sealed a hard-fought
              victory over Aberdeen at Pittodrie.</strong><br><br>The hosts,
              celebrating the 25th anniversary of winning the European Cup Winners'
              Cup under Sir Alex Ferguson, piled plenty of pressure on the Champions
              League holders, and were unfortunate to see a first-half goal from
              Darren Mackie ruled out for offside.<br><br>United's class told in the
              latter stages of the first half and much of the first, however, and
              Carrick moved the visitors ahead by converting a penalty before Rooney
              powerfully headed home after the interval.<br><br>Rooney could have
              buried the hosts single-handedly inside 10 minutes, as he twice shot
              straight at goalkeeper Jamie Langfield and also had a powerful far-post
              volley blocked by a defender.<br><br>Although Aberdeen struggled to
              contain Rooney and the vibrant Ryan Giggs, they still probed menacingly
              during the opening exchanges, and Jeffrey De Visscher came close to
              opening the scoring before Mackie slid a finish past Ben Amos, only to
              see his effort chalked off by a linesman's flag.<br><br>The sell-out
              crowd had to wait until just before half-time to see the first goal,
              when Rooney was brought down inside the area by Langfield after a
              superb through-ball from Carrick. Rooney opted to let his England
              cohort take the spot-kick and, just as he did in Moscow, Carrick sent
              the goalkeeper the wrong way to put United ahead.<br><br>Immediately after the interval United's lead could have been doubled, but substitute Chris Eagles sidefooted Darren
              Fletcher's teasing cross over the bar from close range. The hosts, for
              their part, could have drawn level shortly afterwards, but Amos made a
              superb fingertip save from Jamie Smith's inswinging effort.<br><br>Rooney
              and Giggs continued to terrorise the Dons' defence, however, and the
              latter almost headed home the former's cross, only for substitute
              stopper Bertrand Bossu to brilliantly tip the ball onto the crossbar.<br><br>Twenty
              minutes from time, Rooney went one better by powerfully heading
              United's second goal. Darren Fletcher took Carrick's pass in his stride
              and curled in a teasing right-wing cross, which Rooney glanced
              emphatically into the far corner.<br><br>Danny Simpson had a long-range
              shot well held by Bossu and Eagles saw his chip deflected just past the
              post as United finished in the ascendancy, and held firm to post an
              impressive start to the new season preparations.<br><br><em><strong>United: </strong>Amos
              (Woods, 73); Neville (Simpson, 46), Brown (J Evans, 61), Vidic (O'Shea,
              46), Silvestre; Fletcher, Carrick, Scholes (Gibson, 61), Martin
              (Eagles, 46); Rooney (Hewson, 73), Giggs (Campbell, 61).</em></p>

              <p><em>Wayne Rooney of Manchester United in action during the pre-season friendly match at Aberdeen.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Aberdeen manager Jimmy Calderwood paid tribute to Manchester United veterans Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs after the Champions League holders cruised to a 2-0 win in their challenge match at Pittodrie.</strong>  </p>
              <p>A first-half penalty from Michael Carrick and a Wayne Rooney header after the break demonstrated the superiority of the visitors who were never in any trouble. Afterwards Calderwood pinpointed the talents of Scholes and Giggs in particular, saying: "It was a worthwhile exercise and a wonderful learning process for our players.</p>
              <p>"You could see the quality of the United players. "When you see older players like Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, their attitude, hunger, touch and vision - it was fabulous."  </p>
              <p>Dons striker Darren Mackie had a goal ruled out for offside before United were awarded a penalty a minute before the interval when keeper Jamie Langfield brought down Rooney inside the box after the England striker had latched on to a defence-splitting pass from Carrick.  Calderwood believed his side were wronged on both occasions. "I thought we did really well in the first half when they were at their strongest," the Dons boss said.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              <p>"I don't think Darren Mackie's goal was offside and I spoke to Wayne after the game and he said his touch was too heavy and he wouldn't have caught the ball at this stage of the season.  "But they got the penalty. "However, all in all, it was a fantastic work-out."  </p>
              <p>A near sell-out crowd of 20,500 turned up at Pittodrie for the testimonial game in honour of the Aberdeen side that won the European Cup Winners' Cup 25 years ago in Gothenburg when United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was manager at Pittodrie.</p>
              <p>Ferguson took the microphone after the game and addressed the Dons crowd, saying:  "It was an emotional day for many reasons. "The squad (of 25 years ago) were a fantastic bunch of lads. "Many teams never win a European trophy but it's part of Aberdeen's history, they have won a European trophy."</p>
