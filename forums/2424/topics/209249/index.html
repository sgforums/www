            <div class='col-md body'>United will play in Malaysia next summer after signing a new sponsorship deal to support tourism in the country.<br><br>Chief executive David Gill said today, "Every two years we undertake a major pre-season tour and although the actual itinerary is to be worked out, we'll be in Malaysia next year.<br><br>"We have always had a huge following in the region for three main reasons; history, heritage and achievement. It will be good to have the chance to visit the region again."<br><br>United's visit to Malaysia in 2007, their first since 1995, will come as the country celebrates 50 years of independence.<br><br>"As with all our tours, we will not just turn up, play a game and leave again," Mr Gill added.<br><br>"It will be a genuine attempt to project ourselves to supporters who very rarely have the opportunity to see us live."<br><br>The chief executive was speaking at Carrington, where Tourism Malaysia were introduced as a new club sponsor, alongside existing partner Air Asia - the leading low-fare airline for Asia.<br><br>He was joined at the press conference by Sir Alex Ferguson, Air Asia chief executive Dato' Tony Fernandes and Malaysia's Minister of Tourism, YB Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor. Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney also attended a photo-call.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United have scored an early victory over Premiership title rivals Chelsea by snaring Tourism Malaysia as a new sponsorship partner.<br><br>The deal, which should net the Old Trafford outfit around Â£2million, is an extension of an existing tie-up with budget airline Air Asia and marks the end of Tourism Malaysia's previous association at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"Manchester United have more fans in our part of the world than Chelsea and we feel this sponsorship deal offers us the best chance to promote Malaysia worldwide," said Malaysian tourism minister YB Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor.<br><br>"There are Manchester United fan clubs in Malaysia and so many people who like to watch their games.<br><br>"This package is better for us in a commercial sense and we will strive with United to make it work for the benefit of all parties."<br><br>The immediate spin-off will be a stop-off by Sir Alex Ferguson's Red Devils as part of a planned pre-season tour of Asia next summer.<br><br>United's intended visit, their first to Kuala Lumpur since 1995, will help mark the 50th anniversary of Malaysia's independence, with chief executive David Gill admitting it should solidify United's support base within south-eastern Asia.<br><br>"We have always had a huge following in that region for main reasons; history, heritage and achievement," he said.<br><br>"The success of the Premiership has also been an important factor and it will be good to have the chance to visit the region again.<br><br>"As with all our tours, we will not just turn up, play a game and leave again. It will be a genuine attempt to project ourselves to supporters who very rarely have the opportunity to see us live."<br><br>Although discussions are ongoing over the exact tour itinerary, with negotiations hampered slightly by the calendar for next year's Asian Cup, Shanghai would seem an obvious destination, as would South Korea, particularly as Sir Alex Ferguson appears to be lining up another signing to join Park Ji-sung at Old Trafford.<br><br>"The world has changed in terms of where you get players from now and we are currently looking at another young Korean boy we are hoping to bring over quite soon," revealed Ferguson without giving away the player's identity.<br><br>The latest deal, coming just five months after signing a record Â£56million shirt sponsorship deal with American banking giant AIG, leaves United officials confident any lingering commercial negativity towards the ownership of Malcolm Glazer has completely disappeared.<br><br>High-ranking staff are also in the early stages of attempting to negotiate another sponsorship deal with a Korean company, moves which would further help the Red Devils re-establish their previously long-held position as the world's richest club.<br><br></div>
