              While early goals at the Emirates settled Unitedâ€™s Champions League destiny, one very late goal at Stamford Bridge allowed Barcelona to squeeze past Chelsea. Both games had controversy, both had great strikes and ultimately, both favourites will be in Rome. I, for one, canâ€™t wait to see it.
              
              We outmuscled and outplayed Arsene Wengerâ€™s side creating enough chances to win several matches, while Barcelona had one shot on target all night and scored.
              
              Andreas Iniesta has had a stunning season at the Nou Camp and his winning goal wasnâ€™t bad was it? Former United defender Gerard Pique also had a hand in knocking out the Blues, quite literally, seeming to palm away Nicolas Anelkaâ€™s through ball. That was just one of the decisions to send Messers Ballack, Drogba and Terry over the edge.
              
              It's no surprise that in todayâ€™s media coverage, the word â€˜respectâ€™ has been rearing its innocent head after last night's heated scenes in London. Chelseaâ€™s stars will no doubt end up in hot water for their reactions at the final whistle, their reaction contrasting heavily with the way Darren Fletcher dealt with his own personal disappointment at missing out on the final.
              
              Chelsea should have had a penalty or two, but in our game, Arsenal shouldnâ€™t have. Fletch, just like Drogba et al, had his dream of playing in a final cruelly snatched away from him. But did he rant, rave or chase the referee? No, he was graceful even in the most unjust situation. The final between two of footballâ€™s aristocratic teams will be played without one of the gameâ€™s true gentlemen.
              
              Before the heated exchanges got underway at Chelsea, Unitedâ€™s Academy side ended their season on a high, prospering 3-2 over Blackburn. The Under-18s side had a more U16s look to it with many of next seasonâ€™s new kids on the block getting a chance to impress before the summer break. Nicky Ajose scored a blockbuster winner after sumptuous approach play by Ravel Morrison.
              
              As I cover the games for MUTV, I'd like to say well done to the lads for an entertaining season and two more trophies in the cabinet (The Milk Cup and the prestigious but awkwardly-titled Torneo Calcio Memorial Claudio Sassi-Sassuolo). The young Reds go to Switzerland in a fortnight for the youth team equivalent of the Champions League â€“ The Blue Stars Tournament â€“ and look out for our coverage of all the best bits of their games there. 
              
              The long term future looks very good for United with fresh-faced, skilful youngsters aplenty, but the short-term is dominated by thoughts of a third Premier League title on the bounce and a trip to Rome. Sadly, our Scottish terrier Fletch wonâ€™t be in the United team at the Stadio Olimpico, but the rest of the cast is frighteningly good: Ronaldo, Messi, Rooney, Etoâ€™o, Berbatov, Henry, Iniesta, Giggs and those are just a few of the attackers in the mix.
              
              Passports at the ready, itâ€™s the Hollywood final the fans wanted - and no doubt the one the sponsors wanted. Now all we have to do is go and win it!
