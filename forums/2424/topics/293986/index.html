            <div class='col-md body'>Darren Fletcher believes United are on the brink of greatness, and he is desperate to play his part in helping the Reds achieve it.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson recently claimed that he now presides over the strongest squad he has ever had at Old Trafford, and Fletcher says the players are keen to live up to the United managerÂ’s expectations.<br><br>Â“The club has a great tradition of winning trophies and the players in this group want to make sure we show weÂ’re capable of doing it again,Â” Fletcher said.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s the great thing about being at United. There are huge expectations to win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup. ThatÂ’s what the players are here for, thatÂ’s certainly why IÂ’m here.Â”<br><br>The Reds went agonisingly close to adding the FA Cup to last seasonÂ’s Premiership title. United were also one step away from reaching the Champions League final, only to be stopped by the eventual winners, AC Milan, who geared all the efforts on that one competition.<br><br>Â“Last year we were very unlucky,Â” admits Fletcher. Â“We lost in the FA Cup final and against Milan in the Champions League semi final. With a little bit of luck it could have gone differently. Now weÂ’re looking to use the experience of last year Â– with the addition of some new players Â– to push on this season. There are exciting times ahead at this club.Â”<br><br>Personally, Fletcher has endured a tough season so far. His only two starts this term have come in the Champions League, and he looks set for a third against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday. In a squad game, however, patience is prerequisite.<br><br>Â“My two starts have come in the Champions League, itÂ’s a great stage to play on. I want to play in every game, but weÂ’ve got some great midfielders at this club and their form has been good. The manager has had a lot of decisions to make. You canÂ’t take out players that are in good form. IÂ’ve also had one or two injuries at the wrong time, perhaps when IÂ’d have been given chances. Fair play to the likes of Anderson, he has been fantastic for someone so young and so new to the club.<br><br>Â“But itÂ’s a long season and I just have to keep myself fit and take every chance I get. We saw last season that injuries and suspensions take their toll. We got to a point where we had 12 or 13 players in a team going for three trophies. I know my time will come. Hopefully weÂ’ll be going for those three trophies again this season and IÂ’ll play my part.Â”<br><br>It could be a daunting task trying to force your way into two central midfield positions with Owen Hargreaves, Michael Carrick, Anderson Â– and soon Â– Paul Scholes all vying for places. But itÂ’s a challenge that Darren relishes.<br><br>Â“You expect that challenge,Â” he adds. Â“ItÂ’s competitive every day in training. WeÂ’re all striving to start matches, it brings out the best in everyone. Competition is good for, you need to know thereÂ’s somebody on the bench that desperately wants to take your place. And that can only be good for Manchester United.Â”<br><br></div>
