              <p>Manchester United will make Wayne Rooney their highest-paid player on £150,000 a week to fend off interest from Spain and placate their rebel fans.</p>
              <p>Rooney, whose four-goal haul in Saturday's 4-0 win over Hull underlined his importance to United, is expected to be offered the new five-year deal within the next few weeks.</p>
              <p>Although Rooney still has two-and-a-half years on his current deal, United are ready to hand him a new contract - worth £40m - that matches his status as the club's most influential player.</p>
              <p>United are aware of interest in Rooney from Real Madrid and Barcelona, and recognise they must match the kind of wages the Spanish clubs are willing to offer the 24-year-</p>
              <p>Rooney has no desire to leave Old Trafford, but all parties agree a new agreement, to reflect his emergence as one of the world's most influential players, must now be struck.</p>
              <p>United are also conscious of growing opposition to the Glazers, and the fear among fans that Rooney may be the next big name sacrificed to service the debt, currently £716million.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for £80m last summer, and while Sir Alex Ferguson claims the money is there for him to spend, fans are not convinced that is the case.</p>
              <p>The Glazers recognise Rooney's importance in terms of preserving any semblance of harmony they have with United fans, which is why they are happy for the club to discuss a new deal.</p>
              <p>United defender Rio Ferdinand could be charged by the FA over an off-the-ball incident involving Hull striker Craig Fagan during Saturday's victory at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>TV cameras showed Ferdinand strike out at Fagan with a blow which felled the forward, but the incident was missed by match referee Steve Bennett.</p>
              <p>The FA will look at the incident and decide whether Ferdinand should face retrospective action for lashing out at Fagan, who was booked for his subsequent protests.</p>
              <p>Police have demanded United and City players do nothing that could incite the crowd at Wednesday's potentially explosive Carling Cup semi-final tie at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Carlos Tevez and Gary Neville became involved in an ugly touchline spat, while police confiscated golf balls and darts from some fans, smuggled in as offensive weapons.</p>
              <p>Assistant chief constable Ian Hopkins, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "I met with both clubs prior to the first leg and will be doing so again.</p>
              <p>"We'll discuss the general crowd behaviour and making sure they [the clubs and players] understand their responsibility not to do anything that is likely to incite the crowd.</p>
              <p>"It is going to be a very passionate game on Wednesday. There is a lot at stake for both teams and the fans."</p>
