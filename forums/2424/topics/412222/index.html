              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword">Lazio have shown a masterly sense of transfer market crafting as they agreed a deal with Manchester United for Federico Macheda.<br><em><br>La Gazzetta dello Sport</em> reports that both clubs have agreed to a loan deal in January in which 
              the Italian side will have an option to buy Macheda permanently at the 
              end of the season.<br><br>The move was born from Sir Alex Ferguson's 
              wish for Macheda to gain regular action - a similar idea which saw 
              Giuseppe Rossi move three years ago.<br><br>Ferguson was coarse but clear with the Italian, making him aware action was hard to come by at Old Trafford.<br><br>Macheda
               is said to have welcomed the move as he wants to play often and it's a 
              return to the club he left three years ago for Old Trafford.</span></p>

              <p>owen will be a good fit with berba! berba tends to hang around just behind while letting others run past him..then he can thru ball to owen who's the poacher kind..</p>
              <p>they have decent strikers but not established enough or not even promising enough..</p>

              <p>Bebe is played as winger bah... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Diouf will be sold next season and welback may join bardsley and richardson in sunderland. </p>
              <p>If Bebar couldn't be consistent for the rest of season, I reckon he will be sold as well if there is a considerable offer given his age.</p>
              <p>Owen may choose to reunite with Houllier to get regular football at a not bad club.</p>
              <p>There left Chicharito and Rooney. Hmmm... Maybe then he will get Benzema ?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I thought with the injury that Valencia got then Obertan might get his chance to prove himself but SAF chose to play Mecheda instead... hmmmm.....</p>

              <p>Sending him out on loan is a great idea cos he won't be getting much action at United currently and with Hernandez doing well and ahead of him, it would help him to go on loan.</p>
              <p>As for those young strikers some of you mentioned, they had their chances and if they can't make it, why not sell them off for a profit? Also, I doubt very much United will sell Federico Macheda. They just want to groom him by giving him a chance to play more often cos Macheda, Fabio and Rafael will be considered a home grown next season when they complete 3 yrs of service at United...</p>
              <p>I guess they are seen as the replacement for Giggs, Scholes and Neville or even Carrick if he is sold by next season. United seriously need to fill the quota once those old guys retires.</p>
              <p>As for Bebe, Personally I feel i have seen enough of him to belief he will be a good player for United within 3 yrs... Just give him time, the boy is still only 20 yrs old.</p>

              <p>hmm.. but his name is mentioned alot in recent games, even in the valencia game, he was sub ahead of MOwen.</p>
              <p>it would be a big loss, if MU pick him, developed him, and ship him back to SerieA..</p>
