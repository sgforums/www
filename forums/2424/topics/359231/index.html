              <p><strong>Zoran Tosic is happy to bide his time before making his mark at Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>The January arrival from Partizan Belgrade made a brief appearance
              against Tottenham in the FA Cup but has been overlooked since, despite
              impressing in the reserves.</p>
              <p>Lee Martin, who has been farmed out on loan on a number of
              occasions, was preferred to the Serbian on the bench on one occasion
              but Tosic is relaxed as he appreciates he will probably not be ready to
              shine until next season.</p>
              <p>"It was the best moment of my life when I came on," he told uefa.com when asked about his debut.</p>
              <p>"75,000 people. I think I did well in that game.</p>
              <p>"Now I hope we will win the championship and try to win the
              Champions League then, after that, when next season starts, I'm going
              to get the chance to play.</p>
              <p>"I'm happy here in Manchester. I haven't played a lot of games for
              the first team, but I have come to the best club in the world.</p>
              <p>"I know I have time. I have to practise, get stronger, get faster,
              be better in all aspects. I feel the [upcoming European] Under-21
              championship will help me and I can prove I'm a United player."</p>
              <p>Nemanja Vidic is helping Tosic to settle as the fellow Serbian also
              needed some time to find his feet, even though he did enjoy more
              first-team action.</p>
              <p>"He has helped me a lot, not only on the pitch but off it too," Tosic continued.</p>
              <p>"English football is a bit different to the other leagues so he told
              me some things about how I should play and different things that I
              would have to get used to.</p>
              <p>"A player that learns to play in The Premier League can play wherever he wants."</p>

              <p>Allow me to say something about Tosic (my own personal view)...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We all know he plays left winger, but for me, he is not good enough to step into United's first eleven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Cons about Tosic:</strong></p>
              <p>1. He is too short</p>
              <p>2. He does not have the pace</p>
              <p>3. He does not have the physical size needed in the EPL</p>
              <p>4. His movement off the ball is not good</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pros about Tosic:</p>
              <p>1. He is a freekick specialist (but who needs him when we got the pound for pound footballer of the year 2008?)</p>
              <p>2. Left footed naturally, can cross the ball well.</p>
              <p>3. Thats all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All this is what I made of him based on what I saw in his performace for United in the senior team. So for me at least, he is not good enough. He could be like many ex-united players who disappear quietly... think Kleberson, Veron, Manucho (on loan), Forlan, Luke Chadwick and many more.</p>

              <p>so why was he even bought? cause Vidic needs a play mate??</p>
              <p>give him some credit la.. Ronaldo wasn't the finish article when he came too.. too much flash, but now...</p>
              <p>let's see SAF's magic again...</p>
