              <p><strong>GIGGS HINTS AT SUMMER RETIREMENT </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs has conceded this season could be his last for Manchester United. </strong></p>
              <p>Giggs, who recently turned 37, is on the brink of making his 850th senior appearance for the club and has regularly viewed December as decision time regarding his future.</p>
              <p>The Welshman will mark the 20th anniversary of his United debut next March, but having just made 10 appearances this season due to a hamstring injury he admits it is by no means certain he will make it that far.</p>
              <p>Giggs told The Daily Telegraph: "For me, where I'm at right now is the thought that I've had a stop-start season, so I just want to get back playing. "I'm not going to play every week, but I want a consistent run over a couple of months to see where I'm at," he said. "But it gets closer every year, the thinking that, 'This could be my last season'.</p>
              <p>"I'm closer this season than I was last season, but that's probably because I haven't been playing regularly. "If I have a run in the team and play well, then I will probably want to carry on. If I don't, then I'll have to assess it. "But I think I have a relationship with the manager where, if I really wasn't enjoying my football or I didn't think I was being effective, I could just sit down with him and we would both be honest to each other and say, 'Right, that's it'."</p>
              <p>Giggs admits he has yet to grasp the thought of life after playing. "I've been doing this for 20 years, so it will be strange and weird when it stops," he said. "It's a scary thought, but not one that I am too worried about, although I've no doubt that I will be bored.</p>
              <p>"I'll have to find something to do because I get bored when I have a couple of days off. What I'll do, I just don't know. "You speak to players who have finished playing and they just say that you have to play as long as you can and enjoy it. That's what I'm doing at the moment."</p>

              <p><strong>Former <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> captain Gary Neville is set to follow Edwin van der Sar into retirement at the end of the season - marking the end of an era at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Neville, 35, is unlikely to be offered a new deal after being restricted by injury to just three first-team appearances this season.</p>
              <p>While Ryan Giggs, who celebrated his 37th birthday last week, and Paul Scholes are enjoying an Indian summer in their careers, Neville’s body is letting him down.</p>
              <p>All three are on one-year deals that expire at the end of the season and manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘Ryan is unbelievable at 37. His fitness has not changed.</p>
              <p>‘It is different with Gary. We will have to assess him. He has an injury again and it is difficult when you get injuries all the time in your 30s. That is the advantage Ryan has over Gary.’</p>
              <p>Neville’s 601 club games puts him fifth on United’s all-time appearances list. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I hope he doesnt muck up in March to May 2011 and ruin united chances in EPL or CL if he is called upon to play. when he plays, I am very worried, because he can do things out of the ordinary, plus his lost of pace and his tackles will usually yield a yellow card due to his rash challenges.</p></div>
