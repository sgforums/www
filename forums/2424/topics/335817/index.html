              <p>The Spurs chairman is still bitter over the protracted and somewhat
              embarrassing saga that surrounded the Bulgarian striker's move to
              Manchester United at the beginning of the season. His anger was
              deepened by the player's refusal to play in two league matches for
              Spurs, against Sunderland and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"We had a player who had refused to play two games
              for us, having a detrimental affect on the dressing-room," said Levy.
              "We'd known for a year that the player had wanted out of this club."</p>
              <p>He also revealed that Berbatov had wanted a move to
              Manchester United only a year after arrived from Bundesliga outfit
              Bayer Leverkusen. </p>
              <p>"We were very disappointed," the chairman said.</p>
              <p>"Dimitar Berbatov was a player who we brought to
              this club at a time when Man Utd were interested in him. He made a
              conscious decision to come to this club, we invested a lot of money,
              nobody had ever heard of Dimitar Berbatov when we bought him.</p>
              <p>"A year later with 10 days to go to the end of the window he tells us he wants to leave to go to Manchester United."</p>
              <p>Levy feels that Berbatov's conduct both then and a
              year later when he eventually moved for £30 million amounts to serious
              disrespect.</p>
              <p>"I don't think he treated this club with the respect that we honestly deserved," Levy added.</p>
              <p>"We put him on the map, I think he's an outstanding
              player, but he signed a long-term contract with this club and I think
              he should have stayed.</p>
              <p>"I had so many conversations with him. He kept
              saying it was about his ambition to play for Manchester United. It
              wasn't a money issue. We offered him a new contract and he wasn't even
              interested in discussing it."</p>
              <p>It remains to be seen whether new boss Harry Redknapp can curb such excesses of 'player power'.</p>
