            <div class='col-md body'>Michael Carrick said he was glad to get his first United goal Â“out of the wayÂ” after scoring the second in the RedsÂ’ 3-1 win over Aston Villa.<br><br>It has taken the Â£14million summer signing 26 games to find the net, and although he was pleased to score he said another three points is all that matters.<br><br>Â“I had hoped it would have come a bit sooner, but itÂ’s nice to score,Â” he told MUTV. Â“[Your first goal] is always something you want to get out of the way. It wasnÂ’t something that was getting me down, but hopefully I can go on and get a few more now.<br><br>Â“Saying that, once it comes you enjoy it. But the goal was more a bonus for me, I was more pleased that we got another three points. ItÂ’s another game out of the way and we can look forward to next week now against Arsenal.Â”<br><br>Carrick is content creating in midfield alongside Paul Scholes, who he has unlimited admiration for. The 32-year-old was once again in outstanding form against Villa, continuing his consistently impressive form.<br><br>Â“You just have to give him the ball and let him do his thing,Â” he said. Â“He is awesome. He has been the best for many a year now and I am learning a lot from playing alongside him.<br><br>Â“I think the thing is that he has been doing it consistently. You can play well in spells, but do it over a period of months like he has just shows the quality he has got. He has great respect off players not just at this club but elsewhere. I am sure he will continue that form for the rest of the season.Â”<br></div>
