              <p>Fraizer Campbell, the young Manchester United striker currently on loan
              to Spurs, could be back at Old Trafford in January. And United boss Sir
              Alex Ferguson has also dismissed suggestions that another highly-rated
              young striker, Danny Welbeck, could be loaned out in the near future.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i37.tinypic.com/zyef78.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Ferguson
              only reluctantly let Campbell join Tottenham on transfer deadline day,
              as part of the price United paid to bring Dimitar Berbatov to
              Manchester - in addition to a club record £30.75 million fee.<br><br>Campbell
              struggled to make an impact under former Spurs boss Juande Ramos, but
              has seized the chance given to him by new manager Harry Redknapp,
              scoring three times in two games.<br><br>The 21-year-old Yorkshireman -
              who spent last season on loan to Hull City, helping the Tigers secure
              promotion to the Premier League by contributing 15 goals -  was also on
              target for England Under-21s in midweek against the Czech Republic at
              Bramall Lane.<br><br>Redknapp has said he'd like to sign Campbell on a
              permanent basis, but Ferguson has revealed a clause in the striker's
              loan agreement that would allow United to recall him in January.<br><br>"We
              could pull him back in January," the Scot was quoted as saying by PA
              Sport. "We have the option and it is a possibility. The boy has been
              fantastic at Spurs.<br><br>"He is a good player but we needed to get him first-team experience, so we agreed to it so the deal with Berbatov went through."<br><br>Meanwhile,
              Welbeck's future is clearly at United. He will not turn 18 until next
              week, but has already made an impression on Ferguson.<br><br>Welbeck
              scored on his Premier League debut against Stoke City last week, and
              with Berbatov out for at least two games with the hamstring injury he
              sustained in Bulgaria's thrashing by Serbia on Wednesday, Welbeck will
              keep his place in the first-team squad for Saturday's trip to Aston
              Villa and the Champions League assignment next week against  Villarreal.<br><br>Ferguson
              is keen to retain day-to-day control of Welbeck's development at this
              stage of his career, and is likely to combine occasional appearances in
              the first team with involvement in next Thursday's Youth Cup tie with
              Chelsea at Old Trafford.<br><br>That means the prospect of his being loaned out are slim. <br><br>"It
              would be crazy to let Danny go out on loan," confirmed Ferguson. "He is
              too young. He is still that gangly lad who has not fully matured.  We
              can work on his physique knowing we are not playing him all the time.<br><br>"He
              trains with the first-team squad all the time now but he can also go
              and enjoy himself playing for the youth team or the reserves."<br><br>Welbeck, who has represented England's Under-19 side, is also in demand to play for Ghana.<br><br>"His parents are from Ghana so it is not a surprise," said Ferguson.<br><br>"It is the boy's choice, although I would be surprised if he didn't play for Scotland. That is my big challenge now."</p>
