              <p>Following being sent off for taking matters, literally, into his own
              hands at the City of Manchester Stadium last week, Manchester
              United's Cristiano Ronaldo left his manager bemused in the stands this
              evening at Sunderland as he appeared to substitute himself.</p>
              <p>Having missed an open goal, the player was involved in a challenge
              with Sunderland's Andy Reid on 65 minutes. Following the tackle he was
              left clutching his ribs, and shortly afterwards, clearly unable to play
              on, he put the ball into touch and walked off the field.</p>
              <p>Alex Ferguson, serving a touchline ban and not in his usual place in
              the dug-out, was immediately seen barking into his mobile phone as he
              desperately tried to find out what was happening.</p>
              <p>As a replacement was not stripped or warmed up ready to go on, the
              incident was very strange and adds to recent controversy surrounding
              the way in which Ronaldo conducts himself on and off the pitch.</p>
              <p>Two weeks ago Ronaldo was involved in a spat with Aston Villa
              supporters as he hobbled off the pitch at Villa Park during United's
              0-0 draw in the Midlands. He responded to taunts by pointing to the
              number 7 on his shorts and then indicating he was 'number one' by
              holding his finger up to the sky.</p>
              <p>A week prior to that, the <em>Ballon D'Or</em> winner was branded "a
              malicious guy" by Brazil's Thiago Silva, who was the victim of a
              spiteful tackle from Ronaldo during Brazil's 6-3 hammering of Portugal
              in Brasilia.</p>
              <p>The injury was obviously genuine, and Ferguson did not seem angry when he spoke about the issue earlier.</p>
              <p>"He got real kick on the hip-joint, just like Wayne Rooney did last
              year when he was in pain for a while and missed a couple of games,"
              said the United manager.</p>
              <p>"There was no need for him to come to the bench, though. The best
              thing is to get treatment straightaway. It was the sensible thing to
              do.</p>
              <p>"We will see what he is like, although I was going to make changes
              for the Champions League game against Aalborg on Wednesday anyway."</p>
              <p>If Nemanja Vidic hadn't popped up with a late winner for the Red
              Devils then Ferguson might not have been so even-tempered. The Scot
              does not suffer those who question his authority: just ask Jaap Stam
              and David Beckham, who were both quickly on their way out of Old
              Trafford once they'd displeased the boss.</p>
              <p>Ferguson does not take kindly to those who perceive themselves as
              being bigger than the club, and this issue is bound to fuel speculation
              that Ronaldo is planning an exit from Old Trafford.</p>
