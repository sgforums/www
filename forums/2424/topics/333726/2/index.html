              <p><strong>Gordon Strachan last night tipped <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span> to become the first club to retain the Champions League trophy after watching them beat his <span style="color: #003580;">Celtic</span> team 3-0 at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Two goals from United’s Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov and one from Wayne Rooney put Sir Alex Ferguson’s side in pole position in Group E ahead of a return visit to Celtic in a fortnight.</p>
              <p>Both Berbatov’s goals appeared to come from offside positions but Strachan was<br>in no mood to complain after seeing his team soundly beaten.</p>
              <p>Celtic manager Strachan, a former United player, said: ‘I would not bet against<br>them winning this trophy again this season. They are better than anybody we have played at any time in this competition.</p>
              <p>'The first two goals were offside but I’m not going to sit here and scream about them. ‘We were blown away at times and it’s one of the best performances I have ever come across in European football.’</p>

              <p><em>Dimitar Berbatov scores his first goal in United's 3-0 win at Old Trafford</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>Berbatov’s goals were his third and fourth in Europe for United while Rooney now has nine goals in his last seven games for club and country.</p>
              <p>Strachan added: ‘Rooney is unplayable when he is like this. He is a world class<br>player who just happens to be supported by 10 other international class players.</p>
              <p>'It will take some team to stop United this season.’</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson admitted his team had got a break in being awarded two goals from an offside position.</p>
              <p>But he added: ‘Celtic were always on the back foot.’</p>
              <p>Despite his goals, Berbatov admitted he must improve, saying: ‘You have to work<br>so hard here and that’s why I must give 100 per cent all of the time.’</p>

              <p>Berbatov's style is such a pleasing to watch... The way he

              <p>I have no doubt that he will hit their target of 15 to 20

              <p>Realistically, it is going to be extremely difficult for United to repeat. Alot of factors need to be come in place for that to happen esp a lucky draw in the QFs, and this time round,Bayern Munich, Juventus are looking strong.</p>
              <p>As we go into the round of 8, it will then be able to gauge how each team can perform lor. </p>

              <p>Actually I think the 2nd goal wasn't off side leh... If you look at the replay, you can see the Celtic defender's left leg was still level with Berba's... The full body have to be over before it can be off side right?</p>
              <p>Looking at the linesman where he is standing at the O of the Sony board, I think he could clearly see the leg that played Berba onside...</p>
              <p>Anyway, Rooney's goal should have also stand, he wasn't offside.</p>
