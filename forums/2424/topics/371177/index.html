              <p><strong>Tom Cleverley admitted he had realised a boyhood dream, by bagging his first Stretford End strike in the Reds’ friendly victory over Valencia.</strong></p>
              <p>The combative young midfielder calmly stroked home the second goal in a deserved victory, capping an impressive all-round display in style.</p>
              <p>Speaking to <strong>MUTV</strong> after the match, Tom beamed: “It’s every boy’s dream, isn’t it? I couldn’t ask for much better. When I found out I was in the squad I was delighted, and I wouldn’t have thought I’d be standing there, after I’d scored at the Stretford End!</p>
              <p>“It’s what you strive for, to get in the first team and to score at the Stretford End. I’ve seen my friend (Danny) Welbeck do it and I was jealous of him when he did it (against Stoke last season), now I’ve done it and I’m just so proud.”</p>
              <p>Naturally, Tom is already hankering for further senior involvement after his impressive outing, but he concedes that he has no idea what the coming season holds for him.</p>
              <p>“I was told last week I’d be training with the first team this week, then I got put in the squad," he said. "It’s all happened a bit fast, but obviously it’s my first game at</p>
              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p>Old Trafford for the first team but I think I did well.</p>
              <p>“When you train with the first team day in, day out it makes you work harder and see you can do it. I want to play in the first team here and get a look-in. It doesn’t come much better than playing with those sorts of players and in that sort of stadium, so now I’ve had a taste I want more now.</p>
              <p>“I’m not too sure (what the future holds), to be honest. The plan was to go on loan , but I’ll just see if I figure in the Gaffer’s plans now and just take every game as it comes.”<br>Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed that Cleverley is highly-coveted property, and admits that he is still undecided on how best to further the youngster's undoubted promise.<br>"We don’t know what to do, in fairness," he said. "A lot of clubs have been in for him, one or two Premier division teams in fact. He’s going to be a good player, the boy. He does need experience of playing, and it’s something that I’m looking at, whether we put him out on loan."</p>
