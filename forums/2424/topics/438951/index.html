              <p><strong>Phil Jones feels the hard-earned win against Norwich showed United have what it takes to become champions of England again.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds are striving for a record 20th title and second-half efforts from Anderson and Danny Welbeck keeps Sir Alex's side on top of the Barclays Premier League table going into the international break.</p>
              <p>The Canaries made life difficult for the hosts on a hot afternoon at Old Trafford and Jones needed to show his class in defence on a couple of occasions with vital interceptions.</p>
              <p>"It was a difficult game," he conceded to <em><a href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUTV</span></span></a></em>. "Norwich came here with a game-plan and stuck to it. It made it difficult for us to break them down but we showed signs of champions today in getting two goals late on. It's a big win for us.</p>
              <p>"As champions, football fans expect you to turn up and be the best every week but we know football isn't like that and it was proved today. Norwich's game-plan worked well for them before we broke them down in the end. They made it difficult and we had to be patient, that's what the manager said at half-time - move the ball quicker but be patient.</p>
              <p>"They're dangerous with a few good players up front who are sharp and lively. We had to watch out for that - perhaps I was needed too many times, when I wasn't expected to be, but that's what I'm there for.</p>
              <p>"It's been difficult not having a settled back-four all season but all the lads are capable of switching around and it again shows the sign of champions, coming into positions and still proving you're good enough."</p>
              <p>Jones is clearly relishing the move to United and looks the part in the famous red shirt.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to come to Manchester United," he stated. "Having played most games for Blackburn, week in and week out, I knew it was tough to ask for here.</p>
              <p>"But I've enjoyed it and I'm enjoying it now. I love doing what I'm doing."</p>

              <p>Manchester United starlet Phil Jones admits he is flattered by comparisons that have been drawn between him and Duncan Edwards.</p>
              <p>Edwards died aged 21 in the Munich air disaster, but despite his tender age was already considered one of the best defenders in Europe and was an England international.</p>
              <p>And since his arrival at Old Trafford, some have suggested Jones is similar in style to Edwards.</p>
              <p>"It's brilliant for me to even be considered as being a player who could become as good as Duncan Edwards was," Jones told <em>the Daily Telegraph</em>.</p>
              <p>"It is flattering and, for young lads like myself and my team-mates to be compared to great young players of the past, it is an amazing feeling.</p>
              <p>"People have told me about Duncan, facts and figures about him, but I obviously know what he means to this club.</p>
              <p>"When you come into training in the morning, knowing that people are talking about you in the same breath as players of the Busby era, it is fantastic, but I can't let it affect me. I have to play my own game and continue to do what I have been doing so far.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to come here and play. I didn't want to come from playing every week at Blackburn to becoming a bit-part player at United, but I knew I probably had to do that at the start.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to come to United because I felt that the club was right for me, so if I had to wait, I was prepared for it.</p>
              <p>"One of my strong points is that, no matter what anyone says about me, it will not affect me, it's because I believe in my ability and what I can achieve.</p>
              <p>"I know I am good enough to be here, otherwise the manager wouldn't have paid the money he spent to bring me to the club.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't matter what anyone tells me, I know that I can rely on myself. It comes from my parents. They are the same strong-minded people as I am and I just don't let anyone bring me down.</p>
              <p>"I want to be a successful player. I want to be remembered one day as a great player, good athlete, good professional. I don't want to be a player that people don't remember, but I have to work hard for that. I have to do some grafting, but it is something I am willing to do."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> This is just too much lol. How can Jones be compared to the incomparable Duncan Edwards.</p>
