              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Ryan Giggs' month-long absence with a broken arm has provided him with the rest required to be a major weapon for Manchester United in the title run-in.</p>
              <p>Giggs will sit out Sunday's Premier League encounter with Fulham but is expected to make his comeback against Liverpool at Old Trafford seven days later.</p>
              <p>As United's Champions League campaign will continue 10 days after that, it is the perfect time for Giggs to return as Ferguson's men bid for glory on two fronts.</p>
              <p>It also means the Red Devils boss does not have to worry about juggling the arduous demands of a fixture list that barely gives any time for a break, as he knows Giggs will be fresh, and, with harder pitches less stamina sapping, the 36-year-old can have a major impact in the latter weeks of the season.</p>
              <p>"Ryan will be fit for the Liverpool game," confirmed Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"His performances in training have been fantastic.</p>
              <p>"He is getting another plaster on today but we will be getting a fresh player back, which is good.</p>
              <p>"For weeks we had to try and work out the best games for him to play in, in terms of freshness and rest.</p>
              <p>"Now he has had a month's rest."</p>

              <p>Meanwhile, Ferguson insists he is ready to let <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=12654"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Owen Hargreaves</span></span></a> take the next step on his road to recovery.</p>
              <p>Hargreaves was due to play in a reserve team encounter with Manchester City and end a near-18 month absence following a double knee operation. But Manchester United officials confirmed on Wednesday night that the England star would not be involved, as it interfered with his training regime.</p>
              <p>It seemed a strange explanation. And Ferguson has clarified the situation, pointing out that Hargreaves in fact went to see a specialist for the latest update. However, as the verdict was positive, Ferguson believes an end to Hargreaves' lengthy spell on the sidelines is in sight.</p>
              <p>''Owen went to see a specialist yesterday,'' said the United boss. ''There is nothing wrong and the idea is for him to play in the next game. He has to play in the next game because he is ready to play.''</p>
              <p>United's reserve side is next due in action on Thursday, when they entertain Burnley at Altrincham's Moss Lane ground.</p>
