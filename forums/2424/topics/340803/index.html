              <p><strong>Carlos Tevez is proud to play
              for ‘the best club in the world’ and believes he will commit his future
              to Manchester United shortly. </strong></p>
              <p>The Argentina international is on loan from MSI and is keen to
              sign a permanent deal with The Red Devils in the close future, despite
              his lack of regular action under Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov appear to be the preferred
              attacking pairing for United but “The Apache”, as he is dubbed,
              understands competition is part of the game when you play for such a
              big club, and does not seem to be frustrated by his status.</p>
              <p>Tevez, who bagged a hat-trick against Blackburn, claims
              negotiations are progressing regarding a transfer to United, and told
              Ole: “I remain relaxed and so are the club.</p>
              <p>“We have been talking about it and everything is very advanced, as a consequence I think it will be sorted soon.”</p>
              <p>He added: “I feel respected by my team-mates and by the technical staff.”</p>
              <p>Tevez has been made to battle to play regularly throughout his career but remains unfazed by his situation</p>
              <p>“I think it’s part of my life,” he declared. “Everywhere I have been I had to fight and it ended up with titles.</p>
              <p>“I think that God tests me, not each year, but each month. And at the end of the day, winning league titles makes me feel great.</p>
              <p>“The only club I didn’t win any title with was West Ham, but
              people told me, regarding the way we escaped, that it was like winning
              one.</p>
              <p>“I can’t explain how happy I am when I win a title after a
              massive fight. I prefer it this way. That’s the story of my life: I
              have overcome obstacles since I was a kid.</p>
              <p>“And right now I’m not going to change: I’m at the best club in the world and fighting for your position is normal.”</p>
              <p>Winning the Club World Cup in Japan would mean a lot to Tevez,
              who said: “This is the best moment to spread my wings, just before the
              Club World Cup. We are genuine favourites for this tournament and must
              deliver.</p>
              <p>“I know what this cup means for an Argentinian and I want to
              win it again. My team-mates also understand what winning this
              tournament means for Manchester [United].”</p>
