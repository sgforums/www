The same with Real Madrid.<br><br>"But at Chelsea his role was already filled by Frank Lampard.<br><br>"Where can he move to now?<br><br>"His first transfer opportunity is during the winter, and I hardly suppose Bernd Schuster's Madrid are interested after bringing in Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder."</div>
