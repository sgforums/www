              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">EVEN in the heat of battle, Alex Ferguson managed to correct himself.</h2>
              <p>After watching the hopeless Martin Atkinson get all the big decisions wrong at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, Ferguson said: "You want a fair referee - or a strong referee, anyway - and we didn't get that."</p>
              <p>Immediately after using the word "fair" - and knowing that would imply Atkinson to be biased - the Manchester United manager promptly took a step back.</p>
              <p>We all know what he meant. That, on the night, Atkinson wasn't up to it.</p>
              <p>Anyone who saw the game could appreciate that.</p>
              <p>Except the gormless FA (who can't help themselves) who have charged Ferguson with improper conduct. And some bloke called Alan Leighton.</p>
              <p>Leighton is the national secretary of something called Prospect, a trade union that makes grandiose claims to represent "professionals" - engineers, scientists and other so-called specialists.</p>
              <p>And now Premier League referees (who, admittedly, need all the help they can get).</p>
              <p>And what did Leighton, largely unknown but aware any criticism of Ferguson would thrust him into the sort of spotlight union reps can usually only dream about, have to say? He pontificated: "Alex Ferguson should explain what he means by fairness. The game only exists on the basis it's fairly moderated.</p>
              <p>"Any suggestion a Premier league referee is unable to carry out that job without integrity is damaging the game.</p>
              <p>"Sir Alex should apologise. I would call on all managers to be more careful about what they say."</p>
              <p>What a load of pedantry and humbug. What use of semantics to back your own case.</p>
              <p>I suggest Mr Leighton be more careful himself before opening his own cavernous gob.</p>
              <p>Does he know anything about Martin Atkinson?</p>
              <p>If he does, he will know that he is backing entirely the wrong man in the battle by both the FA and referees to clip Ferguson's wings.</p>
              <p>The most effective referees are those who get on with the job quietly and without having to show they're in charge.</p>
              <p>Atkinson, on the other hand, has awarded more penalties and red cards this season than any other referee. And what exact crime has Ferguson actually committed for which he must repent? Oh, yes, he told the truth.</p>
              <p>That Atkinson failed to spot crude challenges on two of his players by David Luiz that should have earned the Chelsea defender two bookings and, with them, dismissal.</p>
              <p>Even Graham Poll, our former top match official, agreed Atkinson cocked up.</p>
              <p>And that Ferguson should not be charged for things said in the heat of the moment.</p>
              <p>Jeff Winter, another ex-ref, claimed Ferguson should have the book thrown at him. And yet even he admitted he would have sent off Luiz.</p>
              <p>Winter also took umbrage at Ferguson claiming he feared the worst when he saw Atkinson was down for the game.</p>
              <p>Yes, Ferguson is a wily old bird who knows how to influence match officials.</p>
              <p>But, who could blame him for his apprehension? Last season, Atkinson as good as cost United the title in the corresponding fixture when awarding Chelsea a dubious free-kick from which John Terry scored the winner. In an FA Cup-tie against Portsmouth in 2008, he denied United a blatant penalty for a foul on Cristiano Ronaldo in a match Pompey won 1-0.</p>
              <p>This season he didn't even book Manchester City's Nigel de Jong for a horror tackle that broke Hatem Ben Arfa's leg in a game with Newcastle.</p>
              <p>He then awarded City a penalty that wasn't but failed to award Newcastle one that was.</p>
              <p>Chris Hughton, then Geordie boss, said: "Atkinson made two horrendous decisions."</p>
              <p>Later, Stoke's Tony Pulis advocated a relegation system for referees after Atkinson missed a handball on the line by Sunderland's Lee Cattermole.</p>
              <p>Pulis said: "If he can't see that, what's he doing on a football pitch?"</p>
              <p>Neither Pulis nor Hughton was charged by the FA.</p>
              <p>Nor was Wigan boss Roberto Martinez for hammering Mark Clattenburg for missing Wayne Rooney's elbow last weekend. </p>
              <p>Nor Wigan chairman Dave Whelan for similar comments and another alleging favouritism towards United.</p>
              <p>Everton boss David Moyes <strong>DID</strong> receive an £8,000 fine for improper conduct after a run-in with a referee this season. And who might that have been? Yes, our mate Mart.</p>
              <p>Moyes, though, did confront him on the pitch. I trust the FA will bear all this in mind.</p>
