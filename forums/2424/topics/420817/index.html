              <p>Yeah, Cleverley really reminds me of our gingerhead legend - Scholes. Very clever player who threads passes and pops up with a goal every now and then despite his obvious lack in height (he's only 1.75m! Thats really short in Ang Moh Standard!) His weakness is probably being injury proned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Being a young player out on loan at Watford last season, he actually managed to win the team's Player of the Season despite not finishing the season due to an injury.</p>
              <p>And also, he proves that he is able to shine at Premier League level too at his spell with Wigan, netting 3 goals and 1 assist in 13 matches of which 3 are subsitiute appearance. He's definitely much much better than that one-trick pony Gibson whose long shots = goals percentage is &lt; 10%.</p>
              <p>I really hope Fergie give him chance to impress because I am certainly pleased at how he progresses. And who knows, Jordan Henderson might come to United and we'll see a massive clearouts with Carrick, Hargreaves and Gibson shown the door.</p>

              <p>Don't overrate the guy lah... Cleverley is a decent player but, still a long way from a good player... He need to gain more match experience. And I don't think he is doing great at Wigan at all... I think he might need another year on loan cos coming back to United will only mean occasional bench place... and not even a regular bench place. And this could set him back another year or two in his progress... So better to loan him out but to another team instead of Wigan me think... lol...</p>

              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">Ferguson had toyed with the idea of adding to his squad, knowing his side have moved top of the Premier League despite rarely hitting top form.</div>
              <p>United do have two matches in hand on nearest rivals Manchester City, the first of which will be played at Blackpool on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>But with City hitting a rich vein of form, Arsenal looking less vulnerable that before and Chelsea starting to put a sequence of wins together, Ferguson understandably checked the strength of the players at his disposal.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson, who has repeatedly stated there is "no value'' in the market, has opted not to make a move, in the knowledge long-term injury victim Antonio Valencia is scheduled to return from an ankle injury at the end of February.</p>
              <p>"I won't be going into the transfer market during the present mid-winter window,'' Ferguson told <em>United Review</em>.</p>
              <p>"I thought at one time that I would like to bring in just one player, but that has not worked out. I don't feel that it is necessary to buy just for the sake of it because, as I say, I am more than happy with my squad.''</p>

              <p>true but just worried about his injury record. Normally, we don't hear much about injury from those stars during their youths like Scholes/Giggs/Beckham or etc.</p>
              <p>so maybe a concern for MUFC regarding this poor record.</p>
              <p>but looking @ cahill, no need to be big to sneak in to score the odd goals, Scholey did it well even he is not heskey-type.</p>

              <p>But with City hitting a rich vein of form, Arsenal looking less
              vulnerable that before and Chelsea starting to put a sequence of
              wins together, Ferguson understandably checked the strength of the
              players at his disposal.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson, who has repeatedly stated there is "no
              value'' in the market, has opted not to make a move, in the
              knowledge long-term injury victim Antonio Valencia is scheduled to
              return from an ankle injury at the end of February.</p>
              <p>"I won't be going into the transfer market during the present
              mid-winter window,'' Ferguson told <em>United Review</em>.</p>
              <p>"I thought at one time that I would like to bring in just one
              player, but that has not worked out. I don't feel that it is
              necessary to buy just for the sake of it because, as I say, I am
              more than happy with my squad.''</p>
