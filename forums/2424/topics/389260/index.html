              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Rio Ferdinand is facing a three-match ban after being charged with violent conduct by the Football Association.</strong></p>
              <p>The FA took the action after viewing video footage of the Manchester United defender's clash with Hull forward Craig Fagan during the second-half of Saturday's 4-0 win at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand has until Wednesday evening to respond.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the case is being dealt with under the FA's fast-track system, Ferdinand could either plead guilty and accept the three-match suspension or challenge the decision, in which case a disciplinary hearing will be held on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Even if Ferdinand does admit his guilt, he could still figure in Wednesday night's Carling Cup semi-final with Manchester City at Old Trafford and begin his punishment on Sunday, when the Red Devils visit Arsenal.</p>
              <p>That seems a more logical move that beginning the suspension immediately, as United also have the option to do, a move that would rule Ferdinand out of the games against City, Arsenal and Portsmouth at Old Trafford on February 6.</p>
              <p>If Ferdinand plays against City the third match of any suspension would be at Aston Villa on February 10.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The danger with appealing would be that the FA might regard it as frivolous and increase the 31-year-old's punishment.</p>
              <p>Losing Ferdinand would be a bitter blow for Ferguson considering the defender has only just returned from three months out with a back injury.</p>
              <p>Although Ferguson felt the £29.1million centre-half was not unduly tested against Hull, he accepted Ferdinand's presence had a galvanising effect on his back four, which he was hoping would continue against City tomorrow night.</p>
              <p>"Rio's performance level is important," said Ferguson. "It is important to have him back because getting the centre-halves fit is key to our progress this season."</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sir Alex Ferguson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a>'s insistence that the behaviour of his players "has always been perfect" has been undermined by the news that <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Rio Ferdinand" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rio-ferdinand"><span style="color: #005689;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a> is facing a three-match ban for violent conduct. The defender could miss the second leg of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s Carling Cup semi-final against Manchester City tonight, the match against Arsenal on Sunday and the home game against Portsmouth the ­following weekend after knocking the Hull City striker Craig Fagan to the ground ­during the 4-0 victory last Saturday.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has banned Sky's cameras from his press conferences at the club's training ground after he learned that the television company – at the Football Association's request – ­produced the pictures that have led to Ferdinand being charged. The United manager also believes Sky is partly to blame for the bad feeling surrounding tonight's match, after repeatedly broadcasting pictures of Gary Neville showing his middle finger to Carlos Tevez in last week's first leg.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand's charge came a few hours after Ferguson said his players' behaviour "has always been perfect" and expressed irritation about the way their conduct was under scrutiny this week. The FA has written to United and City, after being contacted by Greater Manchester police, to stress the importance of the ­players not adding to an incendiary atmosphere.</p>
              <p>Ferguson rounded on Sky's reporter. "You try to promote yourself – just leave the football to us, OK?" he said. "You come out with some nonsense. I don't pay any attention to a lot of that. The players' behaviour has always been perfect. They play within the rules of the game. We've never had any issues with big games."</p>
              <p>Ferguson's defence of his players omits previous incidents in Manchester derbies, including Roy Keane's infamous challenge on Alfie Haaland and Neville being sent off for headbutting Steve McManaman. The United manager said: "I don't know why you are going on about it. Look at the record. Unbelievable!"</p>
              <p>United yesterday announced a £10m deal to sign the 20-year-old Fulham centre-half Chris Smallingat the end of the season. Arsenal had made the first approach for a player who was at Maidstone United in the Isthmian League three years ago and who has made only four Premier League appearances. Smalling's move is subject to a medical – due today, according to Fulham's manager, Roy Hodgson – and personal terms and Arsenal will not give up. "As long as the player has not signed anywhere, it is not the end of it," said their manager, Arsène Wenger. Smalling is regarded by United as a successor to Nemanja Vidic, who is keen to leave Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>If Ferdinand pleads not guilty to his charge, he could face City, with a hearing to be held on Thursday, but, if the FA considers the appeal to be "frivolous" and finds him guilty, the ban could be extended to a fourth game, at Aston Villa on 10 February. Ferdinand has until 6pm today to respond. If he accepts the charge, the three-match ban starts immediately.</p>
              <p>The match against City has been preceded by Tevez calling Neville a "moron" and a "boot-licker" on Argentinian radio. "There isn't a problem with Carlos or any of the other players," Roberto Mancini, the City manager, said. "Everybody must stay calm and think only about the match. If we don't stay calm, we could have a problem. We must stay calm because it's important we think about the game, about tactics, about corners. We must keep our concentration. If you can stay calm, we will play better."</p>
              <p>Mancini went on to quote "the fantastic Oasis", saying his message was "don't look back in anger". However, the City chief executive Garry Cook's comments that his employers will supersede United as England's biggest club and that it is a case of "when not if" they will reach Wembley have not helped to calm the situation.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes people can get carried away," Ferguson said.</p>
              <p>Zoran Tosic is close to agreeing a loan deal with FC Cologne after a miserable year at Old Trafford.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div><a rel="lightbox" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00678/RF-585_678503a.jpg"><img title="Manchester United's English Defender Rio Ferdinand" src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00678/RF-585_678503a.jpg" alt="Manchester United's English Defender Rio Ferdinand" width="288" height="172"></a></div>
              <p><em>Ferdinand's decision to appeal against his suspension backfired when it was increased to four games</em></p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson believes that the FA has been guilty of double standards over the decision yesterday to ban Rio Ferdinand for four matches.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferdinand’s decision to contest a charge of violent conduct backfired when an independent regulatory commission handed the Manchester United defender an additional one-match ban on top of the mandatory three-game suspension after judging his appeal to be “frivolous”.</p>
              <p>The charge related to an incident during the second half of United’s 4-0 Barclays Premier League win against Hull City at Old Trafford on Saturday when Ferdinand was judged deliberately to have struck Craig Fagan, the Hull striker, in the face with an arm.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson cannot understand why Ferdinand has been punished when William Gallas, the Arsenal defender, is free to play against United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday after escaping disciplinary action for a challenge that was described as “akin to assault” last week. Owen Coyle, the Bolton Wanderers manager, claimed that Gallas was lucky not to be sent off for his challenge on Mark Davies that resulted in the midfield player being taken off on a stretcher during Arsenal’s 4-2 win.</p>
              <p>The United manager has also questioned how the Ferdinand incident differs from that involving Javier Mascherano, the Liverpool midfield player, during a Carling Cup tie against Leeds United at Elland Road in September, when the Argentinian escaped a ban despite appearing to strike Jermaine Beckford, the Leeds striker, with his right arm.</p>
              <p>Ferguson also claimed that Ferdinand had been punched by Fagan in the build-up to the incident. “I think if it’s a fair hearing, then he’s [Ferdinand] got a good chance because he was wrestled and punched, there was all sorts of things happening and he just tried to wrestle free of it and unfortunately for us he’s caught him in the back of the neck or something,” the United manager said.</p>
              <p>Ferguson’s belief that United have been victimised is unlikely to concern him as much as being without Ferdinand for the Arsenal game, the match at home to Portsmouth six days later, the trip to Aston Villa on February 10 and another away game against Everton on February 20.</p>
              <p>United have until Monday to notify the FA whether they intend to appeal against the additional one-match ban — they cannot contest the statutory three-match suspension — although if they decide to fight the case, there is the danger that the punishment could be increased further. United are understood to be giving serious thought to this despite the possibility that an increased ban could rule Ferdinand out of the Carling Cup final.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand’s appearance against Hull marked his return to action after three months out with a back injury, but he will now be ineligible to play in the league until February 27, when West Ham United visit Old Trafford. Had he pleaded guilty, Ferdinand would have missed only the league matches against Arsenal and Portsmouth, in addition to the City game.</p>
