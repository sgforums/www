              <p>hi, IMHO, we made sunderland look good. And that should give SAF sleepless night.</p>
              <p>yes, we got the 3 pts, another from our wondersub.. </p>
              <p>And if we play like this from now till end of season, we won't win anything.</p>
              <p>I am puzzled by our last formation, there is simply no pace in the attack. Without our counter, things just got jammed up in the middle. </p>
              <p>Honestly, Scholes redeemed with his goal, but his performance was sub-standard. His passes to the sides are still okay, but increasingly, more of his passes seems to miss their mark and opposing players seems to get more out of him than any other united player, and this is worrying.</p>
              <p>Carrick seems to "disappear" for large part of the game.  </p>
              <p>And the defence just short of confidence. Even with Carrick, Park, &amp; Rooney tracking back, it seems MUFC's defence will fall to pieces whenever Sunderland launches their attacks. </p>
              <p>For Sunderland's goal, GVN was found wanting, he simply lack the acceleration to challenge the cross which resulted in the goal. And the goal was headed, so where was vidic? Wasn't he suppose to cover Sunderland's only aerial threat? Nope..</p>
              <p>Tevez ran &amp; ran, but simply, he lacks the creativity as per Rooney (our brightest player). Berba is just useless. Did he had a single shot that threaten the goal?</p>
              <p>Sorry for the harsh comments, but if I were in the dressing room, I would tear into them. We are United, the current European and English Champions, but the way we play this match, we are going to be murdered by Porto..</p>
              <p>And Man, for those who watched, I hate the commentators, I tot one of them was Bentiez cause he was running MU to the ground with his senseless remarks..</p>
              <p>Brown, Rafael, and Rio, come back fast!!! </p>

              Barcelona would thrashed Man Utd 5-0 easily if they were to play tommorrow, no doubt. Messi would have no problems getting pass the whole defence to score a goal.
              
              At the moment, the defence is leaking goals.

              erm.. they are United. Not we. Stop referring to yourself as them. lol..
              
              
              anyway. GN is really weak. In fact ever since I started watching Man Utd (1995) he has never been good. In fact he is bad, worst than average.
              
              Macheda's goal was brilliant and it did not simply deflect off him. In fact he put his foot down to change the direction. From what I saw I think Carrick's shot may not have gone in if Macheda did not deflect it.
              
              To say CR sucks and Macheda is better wouldn't be right. He was rather good during the Sunderland game. He tracked back, got up after going down and played a central role in passing. I think defensively Man Utd is shaky. Previously when the other team had the ball in Man Utd's side, no one was afraid because no one believes that the other team will score. However when I sunderland had the ball it seemed like there was a threat that they might net a goal.
              
              Hope Man U does the impossible against Porto and Everton

              <p>sadly, i disagrees, ever since GN and Beckham paired up, the right flank of United has been quite solid. The crosses from there has been superb. of course, Beckham tracks back a lot.</p>
              <p>Only since his last injury, and age catching up with him, has he lost his speed. Rem, Laurent Blanc, he was good, but without pace, even with good reading, you do suffer, agree?</p>
