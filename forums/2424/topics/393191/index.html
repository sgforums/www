              <p> </p>
              <p>Rooney, who overcame a knee injury in time to face the Italians, produced another stunning display as <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Manchester United</span></span></a></strong> joined Arsenal in the <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/championsleague/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Champions League</span></span></a></strong> quarter-finals.</p>
              <p>And with United possibly having up to 14 games left to play this season, manager Ferguson insists that Rooney is capable of surpassing even Ronaldo’s mark.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: “It’s a challenge [for Rooney to get 42 goals]. I was just happy for him to reach 30, to be honest with you.</p>
              <p>“But he keeps on improving and he was sensational again tonight.</p>
              <p>“He is still carrying an injury, nothing serious, but with a game on Sunday (against Fulham) we wanted him off early.</p>
              <p>"His performance was a continuation of his form over the last two or three months, just sensational, unbelievable. I’m very pleased with him.</p>
              <p>"What’s improved is his movement in the penalty box. He’s also practiced a lot more than he has ever done.</p>
              <p>“After training, he puts extra work in and that’s what we’re seeing now - he’s reaping the rewards of that.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who has shelved plans for midfielder Owen Hargreaves to end his 18-month injury absence in the reserves on Thursday night, claims that United’s victory should not be under-estimated.</p>
              <p>He said: “We beat Milan 4-0 and not many teams have done that. I don’t know if anyone has done that.</p>
              <p>“The deciding factor was Rooney’s goal just after half time. That finished the tie.</p>
              <p>“We were able to relax, play good football and keep our concentration after that.</p>
              <p>"Milan had to force it and that made it difficult for them.” David Beckham, making his first appearance against United at Old Trafford, was afforded a rapturous welcome when he entered the fray as a second-half substitute.</p>
              <p>Beckham said: “I have to say thank-you to all of the fans because they were incredible.</p>
              <p>“It was nice to be back. It was obviously a disappointing night, but nice to be back.”</p>

              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson feels Wayne Rooney can match Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 42 goals in a season after seeing the in-form striker bag a double in the 3-0 win over Fulham.</p>
              <p>The Cottagers held United out during a goalless first half but Rooney slotted home from Nani's pass less than 30 seconds after the break before racking up his 32nd goal of the season with six minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov made sure of the points by heading in Park Ji-sung's excellent cross as the Red Devils went back to the top of the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Ferguson told Sky Sports News: "I said a while ago it's impossible for a player to get 42 but he is on 32 and there is a challenge there for him.</p>
              <p>"He is capable of scoring in the next eight league games and five possible European games, so he has 13 possible games and you never know, I wouldn't put it beyond him. I was just glad he got to the 30 mark, but we are enjoying his goalscoring."</p>
              <p>Rooney is keeping his focus on scoring goals but isn't looking to match Ronaldo's record.</p>
              <p>"If I am being honest, getting to 42 goals wouldn't mean a lot to me," he said. "It is not something I have looked at.</p>
              <p>"Obviously it is nice to score goals. I want to score goals in every game and what Cristiano Ronaldo achieved was unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"But I am a different player and a different person. I am not comparing myself to Cristiano."</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/10/03/330/Wayne-Rooney-Dimitar-Berbatov-celebrate-Manch_2431074.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="258"></p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov has hailed Wayne Rooney as the best player in the world.</p>
              <p>Rooney has been in phenomenal form for Manchester United this season and took his tally to 32 goals with another brace in Sunday's 3-0 win over Fulham at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>It took United back to the Premier League summit and once again led to a glut of plaudits for the 24-year-old, who it is now generally accepted has gatecrashed the trio of Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka who were regarded as the best three players on the planet.</p>
              <p>Having worked alongside him at close quarters since his own club record £30.75million move from Tottenham in 2008, Berbatov knows exactly how good Rooney is.</p>
              <p>And the Bulgarian has no hesitation in declaring the striker his number one.</p>
              <p>"At the moment he is the best in the world," said Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"He is still so young and has the chance to be even greater.</p>
              <p>"Like I have told him many times, he just needs to stay healthy and he can achieve everything."</p>
              <p>Berbatov certainly sees no reason why Rooney should fail to crash through the 40-goal barrier given United have eight league games and up to five Champions League matches left this season.</p>
              <p>"Wayne can go over 40 because there are plenty of games left in the season," said Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"I wish him luck and we are all going to help him to over the 40 mark."</p>
              <p>Berbatov took his own tally to 10, all of which have come in the Premier League, which makes him United's second highest scorer, even if he is way adrift of Rooney.</p>
              <p>Not that the 29-year-old is bothered about that.</p>
              <p>He got as much satisfaction from the goal he created for Rooney as the one he scored himself.</p>
              <p>"If we win it doesn't matter who scores for me as long as we are champions in the end," said Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"I try to assist more. In fact I preferred the second assist I gave to Wayne. That is sometimes better than scoring."</p>
              <p>Berbatov also expects United to complete an unprecedented championship four-timer this term.</p>
              <p>The win against Fulham took United two points clear of Chelsea and Arsenal in what is turning into a fascinating title race given Carlo Ancelotti's men have a game in hand, with all three sides boasting similar goal differences.</p>
              <p>Yet Berbatov is confident the ultimate domestic prize will end up at Old Trafford, just as it did in his first season following a club record £30.75million move from Tottenham.</p>
              <p>"There can only be one winner and I think it is going to be us," said Berbatov.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal and Chelsea are great teams and we have difficult games ahead of us but the good thing is we play at home at Old Trafford against Chelsea and that will be an advantage for us.</p>
              <p>"I am optimistic that in the end we will be champions."</p>
              <p>Although his manager doubtless hopes Berbatov is correct, Sir Alex Ferguson has been involved in enough of these scraps to know this one looks among the most intriguing, with Arsenal looking to have the easier run-in, even though United and Chelsea both know if they win all their games, including the crunch meeting between the pair at Old Trafford on April 3, they cannot be caught.</p>
              <p>"At the moment it is looking like the tightest Premier League we have had," said the United chief.</p>
              <p>"It is very tight. We only have eight games left. Chelsea have nine. We are all involved in Europe. Chelsea also have the FA Cup.</p>
              <p>"I suppose the simple way for us and Chelsea to look at it is just to win all our games. But life is never that simple."</p>
              <p>United will feel they have a good chance as long as Rooney stays fit.</p>
              <p>It took him just 29 seconds of the second half to break the deadlock and it was Rooney's goal seven minutes from time that settled home nerves after the Red Devils had spurned a succession of chances.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old is now just 10 goals adrift of the mammoth number Cristiano Ronaldo scored two seasons ago, although Rooney would prefer to avoid the comparison.</p>
              <p>"If I am being honest, getting to 42 goals wouldn't mean a lot to me," he said. "It is not something I have looked at.</p>
              <p>"Obviously it is nice to score goals. I want to score goals in every game and what Cristiano Ronaldo achieved was unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"But I am a different player and a different person. I am not comparing myself to Cristiano."</p>

              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7971"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Michael Carrick</span></span></a> believes <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=12724"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></span></a> is "hitting top form at the right time" as Manchester United seek Premier League and Champions League glory.</p>
              <p>Berbatov has faced plenty of criticism since his £30.75 million move from Tottenham, but he has been much improved in recent weeks and scored a goal to cap an impressive overall display in the 3-0 win over Fulham at the weekend.</p>
              <p>"Berba was terrific against Fulham," Carrick said in the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>. "He has been excellent for a number of weeks now.</p>
              <p>"At Wolves, it was a big performance from him as he was up-front on his own, and on Sunday he really deserved his goal after all his work and endeavour. He did terrifically for Wayne's second goal and his overall play was very good. He is hitting top form at the right time."</p>
              <p>Berbatov, meanwhile, says he is happy to allow <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> to take the headlines as they close in on further silverware. Rooney has scored 32 goals this season and is now closing in on Cristiano Ronaldo's personal record of 42.</p>
              <p>"If we win it doesn't matter who scores for me as long as we are champions in the end," Berbatov said. "I try to assist more. In fact, I preferred the second assist I gave to Wayne [against Fulham]. That is sometimes better than scoring.</p>
              <p>"Wayne can go over 40 goals because there are plenty of games left in the season. I wish him luck and we are all going to help him to get over that mark.</p>
              <p>"Like I have told him many times, he just needs to stay healthy and he can achieve everything."</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Michael Carrick has urged Manchester United to hit the accelerator pedal as the Premier League finishing line comes into view.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>United entertain old rivals Liverpool on Sunday knowing if they win all eight remaining games, an unprecedented fourth successive title - and a record 19th overall - will be theirs.</p>
              <p>It is easier said than done of course.</p>
              <p>And given Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham all still have to be encountered in addition to Rafael Benitez's team, United cannot afford to take anything for granted.</p>
              <p>But, after demolishing AC Milan in the Champions League and - the defeat to Everton at Goodison Park aside - with their form on the rise since Christmas, Carrick believes his team-mates have every reason to look forward with optimism to the weeks ahead.</p>
              <p>"The confidence is there," he said. "We are playing some good stuff and have been on quite a good run lately.</p>
              <p>"It is a good time to be doing it but we have no intention of finishing that now.</p>
              <p>"There are still eight games to go in the league and we need to carry our present run of results right to the very last game.</p>
              <p>"I am sure it is going to go right down to the wire, so there is no way we will be taking our foot off the gas just yet."</p>
              <p>Along with most of the United squad, Carrick has played a part in the previous three successful championship quests.</p>
              <p>On the road to them all there have been tricky moments, or days when games have not gone quite to plan.</p>
              <p>The key to emerging with the ultimate prize is to react positively in times of strife, knowing games can still be changed right down to the last seconds.</p>
              <p>It is a lesson Arsenal seem to be learning, judging by their recent results. And United's history is peppered with last-gasp victories, pulled out of the ashes of potential defeat.</p>
              <p>"You have to be patient during matches," added Carrick. "Traditionally this club has always played to the last few minutes. We have always believed we will score goals.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes it is harder than others but the knowledge of doing it in the past does help."</p>
              <p>United have to end a three-match losing streak against Liverpool if they are to retain leadership of the Premier League this weekend. On each of those occasions, Nemanja Vidic has been sent off.</p>
              <p>The odds favour a home win given the struggles Rafael Benitez's men have endured during a campaign in which they were expected to launch a concerted title bid, only to end up battling against the odds to preserve their top-four status.</p>
              <p>However, as Park Ji-sung is acutely aware, victory will not come easily for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>"We are looking forward to the game against Liverpool. You can feel the atmosphere is different for a game against Liverpool than for other games," said the South Korea midfielder. "You know the history and the rivalry.</p>
              <p>"There have been some great games between the two teams and we lost at Anfield earlier this season so there is an element of revenge.</p>
              <p>"But we are ready to play against them and this time I hope we show our strength."</p>

              <p>well, carrick does track back and do the "dirty" work. And now, he is adding long range shots.</p>
              <p>In a team, some will grap the headlines, some won't lor.</p>
              <p>Despite #16, he is not another Keano or Fletcher..</p>

              <p>well, he does track back, good work rate of cos but he is hardly a tackler, though better than scholes lol. Long range shots....when was the last time he scored? Scholes, lampard, rijkaard, gascoigne were all great midfielders who scored many goals, what about him?</p>
              <p>It's not just who grabs the headlines or not, it's rather evident on the pitch really.</p>
