            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, just my thought on their future. The way i see it is Chelsea FC cannot last as a top club in time to come. Reason is unlike other top clubs, they are not self sustainable. They depend on Abramovich $10.8b pounds to maintain their club. If anything happens to Abramovich or if he loses interest in Chelsea, then everything will be over in a short time.<br><br>Though Kenyon has said they plan to be a profitable club in time to come, i find that very difficult cos every year Chelsea's expenses in the transfer market is getting bigger and bigger without much return when they release them, and even their players salaries is enough to make the club bankrupt let alone their highest paid Manager, $6m a yr, double the amount McClaren gets managing England and even more... Super CEO P Kenyon line himself up with a fat pay cheque.<br><br>I think Chelsea is the only club that has 4 players on more than 100,000 pounds a wk salary and about 6 to 7 players between 70 to 90 thousand pounds weekly salaries each. No other clubs can afford this kind of salaries.<br><br>Top clubs like Liverpool, Man u, Arsenal and even Spurs &amp; Newcastle will and has last longer over the years. They won't come a time when they will be burden by huge... players, manager &amp; managements and Directors salaries... Abramovich will also not be getting any richer after he sold his main money making business, the oil production company Sibneft to the Russian gov to get into Russian President Vladimir Putin good books.<br><br>Maybe in 10 to 15yrs time, Chelsea will be over. Just my take on things...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Like i said earlier, if anything happens to Abramovich or if he loses interest in Chelsea, then everything will be over in a very short time Cos how will they be able to pay the salaries of the Players? They are the highest paid in terms of team wise. The weekly gate collections is not even enough to cover their huge salaries... How about their super paid Managements staffs &amp; CEO? All these are currently coming from Abramovich pocket, they cannot self sustain.<br><br>Anyway, Abramovich also don't have a bottomless pit, he has an ex-wife, a wife and 5 children to think for also... and now without an easy money making oil production company to give him a regular income, he may have to think twice about the kind of money he throws into Chelsea in a few years time.<br></div>
