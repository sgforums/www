              finance expert Keith Harris has offered a lifeline to Manchester
              United's mounting debt by confirming he is trying to broker a takeover
              of the club.</p>
              <p>United fan <a class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Keith+Harris/?section=football">Harris</a><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> has been labelled as football's 'Mr Fixit' after being involved in several Premier League takeovers, such as welcoming <a class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Roman+Abramovich/?section=football">Roman Abramovich</a><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon  lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> to Chelsea and helping Eggert Magnusson take control of West Ham.</p>
              <p>And
              with the Red Devils holding growing debts of more than £700million
              since the Glazer family took over in 2005, Harris said members of the
              Manchester United Supporters Trust went to him as a glimmer of hope to
              help turn around the club's financial fortunes.</p>
              <p>"Yes, we have been approached," Harris said.</p>
              <p>"We
              can lend our weight to doing something for the good of United and for
              the good of football - none of the takeovers that I have been involved
              in have involved any debt.</p>
              <p>"They've been takeovers by people who've wanted to be involved for reasons other than money."</p>
              <p>The
              Seymour Pierce investment bank chief executive declined to name any of
              the people who have approached him, identifying them only as 'The Red
              Knights'.</p>
              <p>"A number of people have been to see me and I've had long chats with them," he said.</p>
              <p>"I know there are one or two people in senior positions in the financial services that have access to the capital.</p>
              <p>"We
              don't know if the Glazers can be made to listen, but there is serious
              intent on the part of people who have support in their hearts. The time
              feels right."</p>
              <p>Earlier it was revealed that the club issued
              £500million worth of bonds in a re-financing effort. However Harris
              shares the anger displayed by fellow United supporters.</p>
              <p>"(The
              Glazers) are playing with an icon of football, one of the most
              respected brands in the world, and it is in danger," he said.</p>
              <p>"Seventy five pence of every pound (fans) are spending is now going to the Galzers either for themselves or to pay debts."</p>
              <p>United have since issued a statement to deny there are problems.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Glazer family insisted they have no interest in selling.</p>

              <p>Say what you like it, don't be too surprise if this guy is also in for the money as well and making used of the fans unhappiness with the Glazers to advanced his own plans... He isn't called a finance expert for nothing...</p>
              <p>I personally rather have the Glazer in charge than him... At least they leave Fergie and the team affairs to the football people and not try to get in the act... It has been rather successful these last 3.5 years, so why look for something else? For all we know, something else might just turn out to be worse. Like Portsmouth got their new Arab owners and see what it got them? Be careful what you wish for as it might turn out to be a lot worse than what you have now.</p>

              <p>as shared, this is something that may escalate and there is some fears that it may over-run the club in future. So it is no harm to talk about minimising the risks.</p>
