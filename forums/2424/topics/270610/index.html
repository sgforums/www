Green specialises in working on legal cases for Liverpool and, acting on behalf of Heinze, he has instructed Andrew Green of the London-based Blackstone Chambers. It represents a hostile move on Heinze's part and United have indicated they are willing to fight him all the way, bringing in their own solicitors, Brabners Chaffe Street, to fight their case.<br><br>The latest development in what is becoming a major political dispute effectively makes Heinze's position at Old Trafford untenable, even if he does not get the transfer he craves, and will seriously damage his standing among United's supporters. On Wednesday Ferguson appealed for the Argentina international to show some loyalty to the club, pointing out the favourable treatment he received when recovering from a serious knee injury in the 2005-06 season. Instead Heinze has made it clear he wants to join their most despised rivals and that he will not tolerate staying at a club where Patrice Evra is now regarded as the first-choice left-back.<br><br>His action is on the grounds that United had allegedly agreed in writing to sell him to any club that matched their valuation of Â£6m. Liverpool submitted that bid last week but United refused to do business with their old foes. Heinze has two years remaining on his contract and United's lawyers will argue that he must honour his present deal.<br></div>

United ended their tour of the Far East yesterday having been informed that Heinze has instructed lawyers to investigate whether the champions are within their rights to block a transfer to Anfield in the wake of Liverpool meeting a set asking price of Â£6.8million.</strong><br><br>But United manager Ferguson met fire with fire after his team's 3-0 win over Guangzhou Pharmaceutical and warned Heinze he simply will not be allowed to leave. Ferguson said: "We are aware Gaby is taking legal advice. That's good. I hope it's good advice because we're confident of our position. "He's due back in training on August 6, which gives him three clear weeks' rest after the Copa America. And we expect him back in training."<br><br>Heinze, 29, believes he should be allowed to leave Â— even though he has two years left on his contract Â— because his agent has a letter from the club stating the player could leave if an asking price was met. United, however, had no idea rivals and neighbours Liverpool were interested and are now refusing to sell, confident that a player's legal contract takes precedence over a letter.<br><br>Heinze's lawyers have effectively a week to find out if the former Argentina defender has a case. United chief executive David Gill claims he informed Heinze's agent Roberto Rodriguez verbally, prior to Liverpool revealing their interest, that the club would not be prepared to sell him to any of their three major domestic rivals Â— a discussion which is thought to have been taped and could therefore, in theory, be used as part of any defence in court.<br><br>But the extraordinary prospect of United being sued by one of their own players has added a dramatic twist at the end of what has been a largely productive four-game Far East tour. United flew home last night with injury concerns over Paul Scholes (knee), Owen Hargreaves (knee) and Cristiano Ronaldo (toe) to contend with but buoyed by another star showing from new signing Nani in China yesterday.<br><br>It appears the 20-year-old can now add obedience and common sense to his other more exciting attributes after the Portugal winger followed Ferguson's instructions to tone down his goal celebrations. As Sportsmail reported yesterday, Ferguson was alarmed to discover that his Â£20m summer signing from Sporting Lisbon had arrived at his new club complete with a set of acrobatics to follow each goal he scored.<br><br>But after receiving a quiet word about the dangers of behaving like a circus act in the Premiership, Nani clearly took heed and followed his latest strike with a simple high five.<br><br>In scoring United's second goal in the champions' 3-0 win, Nani certainly brought a touch of class to his club's final match of their twoweek Asian tour. With United leading 1-0 through a Wayne Rooney penalty, Nani dispatched a sublime chip over the goalkeeper's head which bounced in off the far post. It was perhaps the best of United's 15 goals on this tour and was followed by a 25-yard rocket from Lee Martin.<br><br>Ferguson said: "There's no problem for Nani. He needs a lot of work as he has not had a lot of endurance work. But there will be plenty of games before the season starts. I'm very happy with him. This was a good work-out for us. It was very, very hot. At half-time a lot of fluid was taken. We won 3-0 and it was a very good tournament for us.<br><br>"I've been pleased with all the goals. It's confidence-building for the new campaign when you go into a preseason game and get that tempo and rhythm." United striker Alan Smith will speak to Middlesbrough about move to Teesside next week after the clubs agreed a Â£6m fee.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Heinze's solicitor calls for arbitration to settle dispute</span><br><br>Gabriel Heinze's solicitor is to ask the Premier League to intervene in the row that is threatening significant damage to the precarious relationship between Manchester United and Liverpool. Richard Green will contact the league asking for an arbitration panel to be set up to decide whether Sir Alex Ferguson is wrong to prevent the Argentinian from becoming the first player to move from Old Trafford to Anfield since Phil Chisnall 1964.</strong><br><br>Green, a senior partner at the Liverpool office of Hill Dickinson, has been appointed after Ferguson instructed United's board not to do business with Liverpool. United had informed Heinze's adviser, via fax, that the defender could leave if they received a bid of around Â£6m but when Liverpool made that offer last week it was dismissed. The row has escalated to the point that Heinze is unlikely to be considered for first-team action when he reports for training , having had an extended break because of the Copa America.<br>He can expect a hostile reaction from Ferguson, who is shocked to discover the extent to which his player seems determined to join United's rivals, the 29-year-old having employed solicitors who specialise in legal matters for Liverpool. "We're aware that he is taking legal advice," a bullish Ferguson said last night. "I just hope it's good advice because we are confident about our position."<br><br>United have employed a Manchester-based firm to fight their case, and the club's ir solicitor Maurice Watkins will inform the Premier League that the player has two years remaining on his contract and must honour the agreement. However, Heinze's solicitors are confident they can prove United broke a written agreement. "It has been reported that the dispute is heading towards a court case, but that is not true," said a source close to Heinze. "The Premier League will make a ruling and we hope this matter will be sorted before the transfer window closes."<br><br>Whatever happens, Heinze's position at Old Trafford is virtually untenable. United claims they will not budge and Heinze's aggressive stance has been of intense dismay to the club's supporters. "This guy will go from hero to zero if he goes ahead with this transfer," was a typical comment on the fans' websites yesterday, and a poll on the Manchester Evening News's had 82% of supporters saying Manchester United should dig in their heels.<br><br>When it was pointed out to Ferguson that Heinze had employed solicitors with close links to the Anfield club, the United manager said: "It doesn't worry me because he has either got a case or he hasn't." Heinze has been the subject of interest from overseas, with Real Madrid and Internazionale among the clubs to express an interest. But, the huge Spanish-speaking influence at Liverpool, plus an opportunity to remain in the north-west of England, appears to have an irresistible lure for him.<br></div>

So far, only Liverpool has offered him a chance to bail him out.<br><br>Note that Deschamps of Juventus offered him a deal to play in Serie A but he has so far not responded positively to the offer.<br><br>What remains to be seen is if he joins Liverpool, whether he would be getting the first team action that he truly craves, or did he leaped out of a hole just to find himself landing into a deeper one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If Liverpool can indeed offer him regular action, I don't see why Man United must ngie ngie hold on to him. The Devils could always use the proceeds from Heinze's sale and bring in a better player.</div>

Informed that Liverpool chiefs had contacted the Premier League with a request to intervene over United's refusal to let Heinze move to Anfield, Ferguson smiled broadly and said: "That will take years." </strong><br><br>The United manager was just as dismissive of Liverpool's chances of winning an increasingly acrimonious battle for the Argentina left-back as he added: "They can do what they like. We are confident about the situation and what the outcome will be." Heinze, 29, due back in training on Monday, will be told by Ferguson that United have no intention of backing down over Liverpool's interest and that if he wants to leave Old Trafford, he should speak to would-be buyers abroad such as Juventus or Real Madrid.<br><br>Anfield boss Rafa Benitez was aware there would be a marked reluctance to let the experienced defender bolster Liverpool's title bid. But he was convinced that when Liverpool matched United's asking price, an escape clause in Heinze's contract would force their hand. When United countered that there was a verbal agreement forbidding Heinze to join any of United's Premiership rivals, Anfield officials turned to the Premier League for a final ruling earlier this week.<br><br>But Ferguson said: "Heinze is due back here on Monday and I will speak to him about where we go from here. I want to be sure about his intentions because that is not absolutely clear at the moment." United have an injury doubt over Nani and will be without Paul Scholes, Owen Hargreaves and Anderson for a friendly against Inter Milan at Old Trafford tonight which Ferguson believes will prove an ideal prelude to Sunday's Wembley date with Chelsea for the Commumity Shield and the start of their Premiership title defence.<br><br>"This is just the kind of game we need at this stage of our preparations, he said. "It will be competitive and the fact that Inter are in the Champions League with us will add an extra edge."<br><br></div>
