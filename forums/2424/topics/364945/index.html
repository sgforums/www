              <p><strong>As well as claiming to have been a Manchester United fan for the past years, new boy Zoran Tosic reckons the players have known for some time that Cristiano Ronaldo was off this summer, after he admitted he needed a new challenge after winning everything here. Fair enough.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">“Yeh, I spoke with him,”</span></em> said Tosic. <em><span style="color: #333333;">“He told us that it’s enough to be here. He’d won all the awards in England and he wanted to try something else. I think he’s going to be again the best player in the world at Real. This season was not the best because last season he scored 42 goals, this time 25, and they all said it’s the worst season. He scored 25 goals and it’s not enough! I think that in Madrid he will be again the best. It may be good for me Cristiano has left but I think someone will come in his place. These games here are very important for me and then when we go on tour to Asia next month I hope I get a chance and I’m ready for it.”</span></em></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya everyone knows he is set on joining RM. I bet alot of senior players tried talking him from joining RM, but to no avail. he has his mind set joining RM in the aftermath of the world cup, due to the threat he received from those mindless england fans.</div>

              <p>I think United fans shouldn't  blame Ronaldo at all... He has done well for United over the years... In terms of personal, he has never said he will stay for live, We are all aware that 3 yrs ago he already said he wanted to play for Real one day... It was his father's dream, his mother's wish and his own dream since he was a little boy...</p>
              <p>He has never mentioned going to Barcelona, AC Milan, City or other big clubs, only Real Madrid... Fergie has manage to delay his move and he has played his heart out these last few years...</p>
              <p>In terms of contract, his contract is probably the biggest in football... Real is offering him 6 yrs, $200k per week with a 25% increment every year... Meaning 1st yr $200k, 2nd yr $250k, 3rd yr $312.5k...until 6th yr over $500k per week... He is made for live... United could never offer him such a deal... He has been on $120k less 40% tax around $72k these last 2 years when he could have earn more had he left earlier... Over at Real, its all after tax amount... He is made for life... Even if he gets seriously injured, lose form or any other thing, he will be paid that amazing sum for the next 6 yrs...</p>
              <p>So I feel its time to let him fulfil his dream and not blame him...</p>
              <p>Personally, I find Tevez much worse... Said he love the fans, want to stay, love the place... Then a better offer, only a very little better arrive and he jump ship... At least with Ronny, he never said all these rubbish...</p>
              <p>So I am happy Ronny is leaving, he help the club with an $80m transfer fee... And we should see it like what Bobby Charlton said...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>UNITED legend Sir Bobby Charlton</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"Ronaldo leaves us because as a young boy he always dreamt about playing for Real Madrid, so if he leaves us it is with our blessing.<br><br>"We are very grateful that he has scored goals, that he has played well, that he's contributed to the fame of United.<br><br>"He is a great player. He's been with us for five or six years and in that time he has improved beyond all recognition. But we have no divine rights, we talked him out of it for one year but he's gone and we move on."</p>
