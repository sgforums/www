            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Foster offered taste of Wembley trip<br><br>Ben Foster has been asked by Manchester United to be part of their FA Cup final build-up in preparation for his return to Old Trafford.</strong><br><br><span style="color: green;"><br>The 24-year-old has been loaned to Watford from United for the last two seasons and such is his attachment to the Hornets, he did not know who to cheer for when the teams met in the semi-final on Saturday.<br><br>Watford were not allowed to play the England goalkeeper against his parent club, so he was a frustrated spectator at Villa Park - but they may not have been there at all had he not produced save after save against Plymouth in the previous round.<br><br>Foster will be watching again at Wembley next month but United want him involved in preparations to get him used to the atmosphere at the club.<br><br>"I spoke to Tony Coton (United goalkeeper coach) after the game and he said 'you will be coming with us as part of the squad' even though I won't be involved," said Foster.<br><br>"He wants me to taste what it would be like to be involved in a cup final and things like that which will be good for me. He wants me to be suited and booted.<br><br>"It will be good to be there and experience it. It would have been a bit of a bonus if I was involved but it's been a good season anyway so I can't complain."<br><br>Foster will get the traditional cup final suit and joked that he might gatecrash the winners' photos should United get the better of Chelsea.<br><br>But the hard work will then start as he looks to replace Edwin van der Sar as boss Sir Alex Ferguson's first-choice goalkeeper.<br><br>He has staked his claim with his performances for Adrian Boothroyd's side this season and has already impressed at international level, while Van der Sar has proved himself as a vital part of United's title challenge.<br><br>"I was there in the summer for a couple of months but other than that it will be like starting afresh," added Foster, who will return to United at the end of the Premiership season.<br><br>Ferguson will inevitably be faced with the conundrum of having England's finest young goalkeeper in his squad as well as a proven veteran who remains a vital component of his successful squad.<br><br>Foster even voted for Van der Sar in his PFA team of the year, along with other star performers in United's squad such as Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>"The way Ronaldo is playing is ridiculous. He is untouchable, he's unplayable," added Foster. "They have definitely got the best player in the world at the moment.<br><br>"The team they have got at the moment they have definitely got to be the one of the best in Europe."<br><br>Foster, however, would not be content with being back-up to the first team at Old Trafford and admits his England chances could suffer if he does not edge ahead of Dutchman Van der Sar.<br><br>"Obviously it would be massively frustrating as the last two years I have been first choice week-in week-out," he added. "But I don't think there are any more loans.<br><br>"If I don't play it will be a case of grinding another season out, sitting on the bench and hoping to kick-on the season after.<br><br>"All my career I have been second, third, fourth choice and I hate it. It's horrible. It's not what I am in football to be - a benchwarmer. I want to be out there playing to big crowds.<br><br>"You can't expect to get picked (for England) if you are not playing week in week out."<br><br>Foster will return to action in Watford's Premiership clash against Blackburn on Wednesday. Gareth Williams is unavailable after suffering anterior cruciate ligament damage in training last week.<br><br>Moses Ashikodi has returned from his loan at Bradford after sustaining a broken leg.<br></span></div>
