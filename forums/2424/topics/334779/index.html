              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">REAL MADRID insist they will not make a renewed bid to sign Cristiano Ronaldo until Manchester United agree to sell the star. The Spanish giants launched an unsuccessful bid to sign the £75million-rated forward in the summer.</h2>
              <p class="article">United have always insisted Ronaldo, 23, is not for sale but the player still harbours dreams of playing for Real. Yet, Madrid president Ramon Calderon reckons they will now wait for the green light from United before making a fresh move.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “It is forgotten, not only for January but forever. “We would only talk about it if Manchester decide they want to sell him. “But the matter is over. We talked about it last season. "Manchester decided not to sell the player and we don’t want to do anything against a club like Manchester.</p>
              <p class="article">“The player decided to stay in Manchester and we accept it. Madrid is not doing anything to disturb a ’friend club’ like Manchester. “We are two very big clubs. We want to be good friends forever. We are in the same market.</p>
              <p class="article">"I have a lot of respect for Manchester. I have a good relationship with David Gill and I want it to be like that for a long time.”</p>
              <p>However, Calderon admits that, if United decided to put the 23-year-old up for sale, Real would consider an offer. "Only if Manchester decided to sell will we be talking about it," he continued. "But I would like to say clearly that Madrid is not doing anything to disturb a nice and friendly club like Manchester. "That is the final word and we are happy."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo now has his sights set on making history by helping United become the first team to successfully defend the Champions League. "The summer has passed and what I had to say I said it," he told Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
              <p>"I am at Manchester and I want to win again with Manchester. "It was a fantastic season but what is more important is the trophies I won with Manchester United, the Premier League and the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"Manchester have the potential, players, motivation to win the Champions League twice in a row. "The team is more mature, has more experience and (Dimitar) Berbatov has arrived.</p>
              <p>"We have to believe in ourselves. I hope to soon find the form that I had last season in order to do better than in the 2007-08 campaign."</p>
