            <div class='col-md body'>United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz has praised Cristiano Ronaldo for his growing maturity and strength of character following the fall-out from this summerÂ’s World Cup.<br><br>He is in no doubt that the 21-year-old Portuguese winger can be the best player in the world if he continues his development at Old Trafford.<br><br>Queiroz has been a mentor to Ronaldo during his time at Old Trafford, and was instrumental over the summer in helping the United youngster overcome the reaction from the English press and opposition fans following Wayne RooneyÂ’s red card for England against Portugal in Germany.<br><br>Since then, Ronaldo has been in scintillating form for the Reds, and Queiroz is excited about the future that lies ahead of the Madeiran.<br><br>Â“He is showing to the world that he is not a player that can be affected by mistakes or adversity,Â” Carlos said. Â“He has shown such a strong personality and is playing with great authority. I must say, as a compliment to him, he has grown up a lot in the last few months, especially since the World Cup.<br><br>Â“For me, it is important you donÂ’t approach players and say Â‘do thisÂ’ or Â‘do thatÂ’. You have to help them think about life, principles and values and teach them to think for themselves and come up with the right answers.<br><br>Â“When I talked to Cristiano, I tried to get him to create that special desire and ambition to be, not one of the best<br><br>players in the world, but the best player in the world. He can do it, he can be the best in the world.<br><br>Â“We have a couple of players that have that possibility here. They learn from the game and learn from life. ItÂ’s about creating the balance of how they play, what they say, the friends they haveÂ… everything. It is part of our job to help them construct the right thoughts and come to the right decisions on the pitch and away from it.Â”<br><br>There is another test for the skilful winger in the form of Benfica on Tuesday. Ronaldo got himself in trouble and received a one match-ban Â– which he served against Celtic Â– last season in Estadio da Luz for a gesture to the Benfica fans. Asked if he thought Ronaldo would pass the test, Queiroz is adamant in his response.<br><br>Â“I have no doubts about it,Â” he said. Â“It is a special opportunity for Ronaldo because he was punished in Benfica and he starts afresh in Benfica. He can reverse what happened last season.<br><br>Â“We donÂ’t need to talk to him about it, we talked enough about what happened after the game, so we donÂ’t need to do it again. I am sure he will play well.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Graeme Murty feels supporters' jeering of Cristiano Ronaldo is like waving a red rag to a bull.<br><br>Manchester United winger Ronaldo has emerged as a target for away fans in The Premiership following his antics at the World Cup.<br><br>But taunts by Reading fans on Saturday only served to inflame Ronaldo, who hammered home United's equaliser in the 1-1 draw.<br><br>Royals skipper Murty relished his duel with the wide man, but feels fans should stop abusing Ronaldo due to the effect it has on the United ace.<br><br>"It's great to play against someone like Ronaldo because he's just so good and you like to see it and put yourself against it," said Murty.<br><br>"Would I know what he was going to do with the ball if I played against him again? Would I hell!<br><br>"You've got no chance because he can go both ways, flick it over your head, nutmeg you and still start laughing.<br><br>"You've just got to dig in and do your best and hope that your team-mates can help you out.<br><br>"I went back to the changing room a little bit disappointed with myself because Ronaldo was my man and he scored.<br><br>"The crowd gave Ronaldo some stick, but my advice would be to leave him alone, for God's sake. You'll make him angry and you don't want to make him angry."<br></div>
