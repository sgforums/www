            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><strong>Scholes has proved that you don't have to be flash to be a legend in the Premiership</strong></span></span><br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/01/scholesR020107_228x377.jpg"><br><br>Asked during a rare media appearance this season whether he thought he was playing some of the best football of his career, Paul Scholes looked a little bemused and said: "No. How can I think that when I am not scoring enough goals?"<br><br>After a Christmas and New Year period that has seen him contribute three times Â— to bring his mid-term total to five Â— the 32-year-old may now wish to reconsider, although that is unlikely.<br><br>One of footballÂ’s most modest, unassuming men, Scholes hates being talked about only slightly less than he likes talking about himself. So the Manchester United midfielder is unlikely to be adding to a debate that suggests he is, indeed, back to his very best.<br><br>Scholes said recently: "I just donÂ’t really like talking about myself or being talked about. I would rather people talked about something else. ItÂ’s nice, I suppose, but if I am honest, I would rather not be spoken about." ScholesÂ’ dilemma is clear. Those who do not wish to come under the spotlight do not usually spend a decade at the worldÂ’s most famous football club.<br><br>His comfortable but under-stated house near LancashireÂ’s Saddleworth moors and his family Audi saloon car may reflect a longing for anonymity, but the former England starÂ’s desire to be the PremiershipÂ’s invisible man has been undermined by the renewed brilliance of his football.<br><br>This time last year, Scholes was closer than he surely would have wished to a permanent residence in lifeÂ’s quiet zone. Hampered by poor form and Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s peculiar tactics, an eye condition then condemned him to a seven month lay off. With United paying Â£18million for Michael Carrick in the summer and chasing Bayern MunichÂ’s Owen Hargreaves, his future appeared as hazy as his vision. It all goes to make ScholesÂ’ impact this season little less than astonishing.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo may rightly lay claim to being UnitedÂ’s player of the season so far, while defenders Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have also been integral to the resurgence of FergusonÂ’s team.<br><br>Scholes, though, has been right at the heart of it, too. Overshadowing the developing Carrick, Scholes has offered a brand of intelligent, intuitive football unlike anything he had produced since scoring 14 goals in UnitedÂ’s Premiership winning campaign of 2002-2003.<br><br>Paddy Crerand, a member of UnitedÂ’s 1968 European Cup winning side and a summariser for the clubÂ’s MUTV station, said: "PaulÂ’s form this season has been exceptional and I think he is back to his very best. He has played the kind of football that we have not seen from him for quite a while and he has been an inspiration. It has always been the case that when Paul plays well, United play well and that is how it has been this season."<br><br>Ferguson once described Scholes as Â‘one of the best football brains United have ever hadÂ’ but, for two seasons prior to this, he appeared to have lost some of his sharpness. The managerÂ’s reluctance to offer Scholes his favoured slot in the centre of midfield certainly affected the side, as United flooded that area with players not fit to lace the boots of a man listed among the clubÂ’s top 10 players in the recently-published Opus.<br><br>For all his natural talent, Scholes could not have his desired impact on games from the left or right of midfield. He certainly couldnÂ’t do it from the bench. Yet, such has been his return to form this season, Scholes has already rejected two requests from England coach Steve McClaren to return to the international stage he left after Euro 2004.<br><br>Travelling the world in search of footballing glory is, he said recently, no longer a priority. An Oldham fan as a boy Â— former Old Trafford and Boundary Park striker Andy Ritchie was his hero Â— it might suit Scholes if United played their home games away from the glare of big city Manchester.<br><br>But what remains uppermost in his mind is the reclaiming of the Premiership trophy and another tilt at the Champions League.<br><br>Much has been made of Roy KeaneÂ’s absence from the 1999 final in Barcelona, but Scholes missed out, too. As uncomfortable in his grey club suit that night as Keane was in his, Scholes is driven by the desire to represent United on club footballÂ’s grandest stage. He has been at the forefront of UnitedÂ’s return to eminence and there would be no more popular contender for the PFA player of the year award.<br><br>Just donÂ’t expect him to make an acceptance speech.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he is my 2nd favourite after Keano.<br>Like what SAF once said, if he has 12 keanos, he would have won everything.<br><br>What I admire about Keano is his spirit. His whole existence is MUFC.<br>The way he fought back in Juventus even when he is out of the UCL Finals.<br><br>I once recalled a joke from one of my closest friends.<br>We were predicting the game between Spurs and MUFC.<br>And he said " Siao boh, MUFC's keane is the real "KING", not robbie keane", when I asked which team will win.<br><br>Like what PVieira once said, "scholes gives as much as he gets, he just gets up and walk away. To me, he is the best respected player in MUFC".<br><br>Scholes belong to the old school of soccer. He gives as much as he takes, and he is not one who will do the theatric dive or tumbles or whinces.<br>He is not one of the best tacklers,<br>but sometimes, he does it to make a point -&gt;" Don't mess with us".<br><br>And England was so much better with him in the middle... Unlike now, where stardom seems to cover up their inadequates.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>scholes is the "model" player that I think all players shld emulate.  He let his feet do the talking and not try to "shine" and "glitter" in public and creating news for the wrong reasons.<br><br>And he is not afraid to give a nasty tackle as well to pick up cards.<br><br></div>

His powerful shots resulting from intelligent late runs towards the opponent's penalty box and his eye for key passes, wonderful, glorious passes, his composure, his high work-rate, his passion grit, and commitment, and not to forget; despite often being the smallest man on the pitch standing at only 170cm, he is a good header of the ball.<br><br>He is so humble, so modest. He is really a role model for the younger players. Take note of Magnus Wolff Eikrem; the young norwegian playmaker in Man U's U18s; he is one to replace Paul Scholes.</div>
