United's manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, said: "We will wait to see the extent of Rio's injury but Ryan will be OK. Heinze is training well and has an outside chance. We have also wanted to give Gary Neville a full week's training before the Liverpool match."<br><br><span class="small">Moderator's note : Added time and date.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Experience trio vital on Sunday</strong><br><br>Reds trio Paul Scholes, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ryan Giggs have made all the difference to United this season, according to Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br><strong>Scholes</strong><br>Scored and orchestrated play in the 3-0 victory over Copenhagen on Tuesday. He missed most of the second half of last season with a serious eye problem that only rest could cure.<br><br>His return to action has prompted the football clichÃ© that Scholes is like a new signing. But, Sir Alex says he has witnessed a hunger to perform in the 31-year-oldÂ’s play.<br><br>Scholes was missing for six months last year. Â“He was keen to get back, because he had a worrying injury that nobody knew the cause of and nobody knew the recovery or remedy for. But heÂ’s back and I think the boyÂ’s relishing being back.Â”<br><br><strong>Solksjaer</strong><br>Â“Then thereÂ’s Solksjaer,Â” added the Reds boss. Â“Out for over two years at 31 and youÂ’re saying to yourself Â‘well this is going to be very difficult for the boyÂ’. But heÂ’s been fantastic.<br><br>"So when you get that sort of boost or bonus, added to the younger ones that have been emerging over the last couple of years, there was every reason to be confident.Â”<br><br><strong>Ryan Giggs</strong><br>who pulled out of TuesdayÂ’s Champions League Group F clash with Copenhagen due to illness, is set to return against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday. His form this season is another reason why the Reds currently sit top of the Premiership and remain unbeaten in Europe.<br><br>Â“Ryan Giggs is at a fantastic age,Â” added Sir Alex. Â“HeÂ’s showing his maturity and experience and itÂ’s helping everyone in the team.Â”</div>
