              Cristiano Ronaldo believes Manchester United will go on to become history-makers in Rome on May 27. 
              
              No side has retained the European Cup since it was revamped as the Champions League in 1992.
              
              Now United are just one win away after a dazzling 3-1 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium that completed a comfortable aggregate triumph to seal a meeting with either Chelsea or Barcelona.
              
              As usual, Ronaldo was in the thick of the action, smashing home an incredible 40-yard free-kick after Park Ji-sung had seized on Kieran Gibbs' slip to give United an eighth minute lead.
              
              Ronaldo was not finished either, taking his seasonal tally to 25 by finishing off a flowing second-half counter-attack to render Robin van Persie's late consolation as totally meaningless.
              
              "I have always believed we were going to win it again," said Ronaldo.
              
              "That is what we have been trying to do and now we are in the final, so we have a great opportunity.
              
              "It was not an easy match. Arsenal are a good team, so to score three goals at their own ground is just amazing.
              
              "The whole team were superb and we deserve to be in the final."
              
              Ronaldo was able to spare a thought for Darren Fletcher, who looks set to miss the final after the red card he was shown for a tackle on Cesc Fabregas.
              
              TV replays showed the Scotland international touched the ball before he made contact with the Gunners skipper, raising some hope that Italian referee Roberto Rosetti will ask for the decision to be overturned.
              
              "I am tremendously disappointed for Darren," said the world player of the year.
              
              "He has played in most of the games and now he cannot play in the final. He deserves to - but that is football."
              
              Ronaldo's amazing first goal was even further out than his 39.1 yard effort against FC Porto in the last round.
              
              Even Ferguson was caught by the surprise when he saw the ferocity of the shot, although Ronaldo could not pick a favourite between the pair.
              
              "It is difficult to say which one was the best," he said.
              
              "They were both very good. I just tried to hit the ball hard. It makes it a very difficult shot to save."
