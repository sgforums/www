            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson is predicting more European success for English teams in the coming seasons.<br><br>The Reds are currently top of their Champions League group, while the other three British representatives of Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool are all progressing well.<br><br>Sir Alex believes there has been a vast improvement in the performances of English sides since United were victorious in 1999. Liverpool's heroic triumph over AC Milan in 2005 and Arsenal's runners-up spot last time round are further proof of that, and the United boss fully expects to see a British name on the trophy in the near future.<br><br>"We're certainly closer as a unit in terms of influencing the outcome of the Cup," he told Manchester United Radio. "I think one of the British clubs will win it regularly now.<br><br>"When I first came down here we were banned from Europe after the Heysel disaster. We didn't get back in until 1990 and of course we managed to win the Cup Winners' Cup in our first season which was a great boost at the time and it brought back the importance of European football.<br><br>"The format of the Champions League makes it a very exciting tournament. I think as a nation we can go from strength to strength - English teams are definitely getting stronger in Europe."<br><br>Success in Europe is something that Sir Alex continues to crave having experienced the joy of winning it so dramatically in Barcelona seven-and-a-half years ago.<br><br>"The European Cup is always a motivation and a priority at this club - that will never change," he insisted. "But the fact is that we haven't done as well as we should have in my years here. Sometimes we've been unlucky, some years we've thrown it away, and some years we just haven't been good enough.<br><br>"We've also been to the semi-finals twice and on both occasions I thought we were unlucky. But the bottom line is that we should have won at least one more European Cup while I've been manager.<br><br>"It could still happen," he insisted. "And it would be nice to win it one more time before I ride off into the sunset."<br><br>The Reds next European encounter takes place on Wednesday night in Denmark. There, United will face FC Copenhagen, the team they overcame so convincingly at Old Trafford two weeks ago.<br><br>"They are a good technical team but they didn't have the firepower to kill us off," explained Sir Alex. "Our attacking play was always a great threat and the speed of our play was very good. The players also showed good authority when they were in possession.<br><br>"Playing in Europe gives you that challenge to improve yourself and I think we've done that this season," he added.<br></div>
