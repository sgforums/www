              <p><strong>We chat to Dave Bushell and Tony Whelan who help develop the club’s youngsters on and off the pitch…<br><br>So how long have you both been involved in the game?<br>TW)</strong>: A long time! I joined United as an apprentice in 1968 and spent five years there, before I moved to City. I later joined Rochdale and played in America for six years. I started coaching part-time at the club’s then Centre of Excellence in 1990 with Nobby Stiles and Brian Kidd and then joined full-time when the Academy system was formed in 1998.<br><strong>(DB):</strong> I was a school teacher for 25 years and was England Schoolboys manager for five – Ryan Giggs was one of my captains! I joined United to manage the U16s in the mid-90s and I’m now Head of Education and Welfare.<br><br><strong>What do your current roles entail?<br>TW</strong>: Our Academy is split into two sections – 9-16-year-olds and 16-18s. Paul McGuinness, who managers the U18s team, looks after the older section, while I’m responsible for the younger groups. Paul and I work closely with Dave who looks after the education and child protection side of things.<br><strong>DB</strong>: Before the lads turn 16 we liaise with their schools and make sure they know they’re with our Academy and are potentially elite sportspeople. We work in partnership to try and get the best out of a player football-wise without damaging their education. If they’re good enough they’re offered a scholarship at 16. From there we help them find accommodation and manage their education via the club’s partner school in Ashton-On-Mersey. The flipside of my job is helping those who don’t make it here either find another club or another career.<br><br><strong>Presumably, you get great satisfaction from seeing a player progress through the system and into the first team…<br>TW</strong>: Yes, absolutely.</p>
              <p>The club have always had a history and tradition of developing youngsters and seeing a young lad mature, not just as a footballer, but as a person is fantastic. It’s our job to give players the best opportunity to make the most of their talent, whilst ensuring they enjoy the experience.<br><strong>DB</strong>: We get great satisfaction at both ends of the scale. You’ve got the likes of Wes Brown, John O’Shea and Jonny Evans who have come through to become first team regulars, while players like Ryan Shawcross and Phil Bardsley haven’t quite made it here, but have made careers elsewhere. And then there are those who are no longer in the game for one reason or another but have carved out successful careers in other fields.<br><strong>TW</strong>: An audit we did last year showed there are 70 players who have come through our youth system and are currently playing professionally here or around the world.<br><br><strong>How much input does the manager have on what you do?<br>DB</strong>: The boss always gives us his backing. Despite the huge amount he has on his plate, he always wants to know about the young players. If he doesn’t he’s after us!<br><strong>TW</strong>: He always has time for everyone at the club. He’s immensely supportive and we’re very blessed and privileged to have that.<br><br><strong>There must be no better example for the youngsters than Ryan Giggs…<br>DB</strong>: I’ve known Ryan since he was 12 and he was a superb player even then. In my opinion, he’s the best this club has ever had in terms of his individual play, his team play, his ability, his conduct off the pitch and, of course, his medal haul.<br><strong>TW</strong>: He’s the example par excellence and I use him a lot as a model for our players. His achievements are just extraordinary, but it’s the way he’s managed his body and his lifestyle which is so impressive.</p>
