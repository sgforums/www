              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson thinks Carlos Tevez is trying too hard to impress at Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>The Argentina international has been the odd man out since the
              arrival of Dimitar Berbatov and Ferguson felt the former West Ham
              striker did not gel with the Bulgarian when given a chance to forge a
              partnership against The Hammers on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Although United won 2-0, Ferguson was disappointed his side did not
              push on and is still adamant his team is not bringing the best out of
              Berbatov, who produced a sublime piece of skill to tee up Cristiano
              Ronaldo's second goal.</p>
              <p>Ahead of the clash with Hull City, the Red Devils boss has hinted he
              will give Tevez and Berbatov another chance to work together although
              Wayne Rooney is champing at the bit.</p>
              <p>"Berbatov has got five goals already this season and some of his
              awareness and passing ability in the last third of the field is
              absolutely outstanding," explained Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"I still don't think we're using him enough, I really don't. More so on Wednesday, in fact.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to see how the combination of Berbatov and Tevez was
              together but Carlos was so wound up to do well himself they became two
              different parts.</p>
              <p>"I think they'll be far better tomorrow, if I pick them, but Carlos
              is so keen to do well as he's been out for a few games and he used up
              so much energy trying to do well.</p>
              <p>"It's not a bad thing to try too hard."</p>
              <p>Ferguson refuted the suggestion that Berbatov does not have a good
              work-rate and is convinced there is plenty more to come from the
              big-money signing from Tottenham.</p>
              <p>"The stats don't show that," asserted the Scot. "His stats are good.</p>
              <p>"I think, like a lot of talented players like that, he's economic with his running ability.</p>
              <p>"He's got very economical movement in finding spaces and he pops up
              where defenders don't like you to pop up. I always thought that about
              him when he played against us with Tottenham. Why is he in that
              position and why has nobody picked him up? Things like that.</p>
              <p>"He has great awareness for getting into good spaces in the penalty box."</p>
