            <div class='col-md body'>Henrik Larsson is determined not to get swept up in the media hype surrounding his arrival at Old Trafford, despite scoring on his United debut in last weekendÂ’s FA Cup victory.<br><br>Sir Alex likened on-loan Larsson to Eric Cantona after the 35-year-oldÂ’s masterful display against Aston Villa, however the Swedish international played down the comments on his official website, <a href="http://www.HenrikLarsson.com" rel="nofollow">www.HenrikLarsson.com</a>.<br><br>Â“I was happy with my fitness and sharpness but I canÂ’t get carried away because this was just one game,Â” he said. Â“One swallow doesnÂ’t make a summer and I know I need to keep working hard and improving to ensure I do everything I can for United.Â”<br><br>Larsson has played on the worldÂ’s biggest stages Â– from Parkhead to Parc des Princes via the Nou Camp Â– but admits he was still nervous before his Old Trafford debut. Â“I was told by the boss the day before the match that I would be starting," he said. "I was a bit nervous, but that's a good thing. The atmosphere in the ground was fantastic and the supporters gave me a tremendous reception, which I was very grateful for.Â”<br><br>Larsson singled out Wayne Rooney for special mention and described their partnership as Â“very satisfyingÂ”. Â“I really enjoyed linking up with Wayne," he said. "I think we had some nice little combinations and we were able to find each other at important moments.<br><br>Â“The goal was one of those. Wayne received the ball and at first I nearly ran into him. But I made some space so when the ball came to me I touched it and shot more or less in one movement. It was a lovely feeling as it hit the net.Â”<br><br>While LarssonÂ’s FA Cup performance gives him every chance of starting this weekend in the Premiership, heÂ’s taking nothing for granted. Â“When I play next is up to the boss, but whether I come on as a sub or play from the start, I will be doing my best. This is very exciting. I just want to be able to play as big a part as possible while IÂ’m with this great team.Â”<br></div>
