              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>David de Gea might earn £35,000 a week but that didn't stop the Manchester United keeper allegedly stealing a £1.19 doughnut from Tesco.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Spaniard waltzed into the store in Atrincham, Greater Manchester with two friends before wolfing down the tasty treat, it is being claimed.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>De Gea apparently tried to make a speedy exit but was spotted on CCTV and quizzed by security staff - one of whom spoke Spanish.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>They left the star in no doubt that he had made a howler but stopped short of taking any further action or calling the police.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'The security guards who monitor the CCTV watched two of them take a doughnut each out of the Krispy Kreme cabinet,' a source claimed in The Sun.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'They weren’t very subtle. They swaggered in chatting loudly in Spanish. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Incredibly, they then appeared to try to leave without paying — or buying anything else for that matter.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The source said that when challenged and ushered into the search room, de Gea did not seem to know what was going on and 'looked pretty embarrassed'.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A Tesco spokesman said: 'A customer was spoken to by our security team and the issue was resolved.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The store has a strict policy of a three-month store ban for alleged shoplifters.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At training on Friday, De Gea was reportedly ribbed by his United team-mates who offered to buy the hard-up keeper another round of doughnuts.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The young goalkeeper is regarded as one of the best in the world and commanded a fee of £17.8 million when United signed him from Athletico Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But his Old Trafford career got off to a shaky start before he began to find his feet between the posts.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>His boss Sir Alex Ferguson is fully behind his No 1 keeper. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He said of de Gea earlier this month: 'He’s 20 years of age and doesn’t know the culture of the country.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'That’s a lot to deal with but he has shown great composure about the whole thing.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'He’s not got himself flapping about the goalmouth. I think he’s absolutely outstanding. The boy is tremendous.'</span></p>

              <p><strong>De Gea was stopped by security at Tesco Express in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, after CCTV caught him eating a £1.19 doughnut and then walking towards the exit without paying. It even made the front page of <em>The Sun</em>. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>But De Gea, who reportedly earns around £70,000 a week, has revealed it was nothing more sinister than he'd left his money in the car and was going back out to get it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>He said: "Nothing really happened. Me, my cousin and a friend from Spain went to the shop, we were hungry and took the doughnuts.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>"We were going to buy more things. I realised I didn't have my wallet so I went out to the car to get it. Nothing more.</p>

              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>"They thought that I was leaving without paying so I tried to explain to them but my English is still not very good and we were there for a while.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>"In the end a Spanish girl arrived and we understood each other and in the end they ended up apologising to us.</p>
              <p>"They made a big thing out of nothing but I took the whole thing as something funny."</p>
              <p>And the £18 million signing from Atletico Madrid has revealed that doughnut-gate has made him the butt of many a joke on the <span style="color: #000000;">United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>training ground.</p>
              <p>"A few of my team-mates gave me a few doughnuts as a joke," he added. "But I took it in good humour and thought the whole thing was funny."</p>
              <p>De Gea, who has had mixed reviews following his arrival from Spain, denied he was dropped by manager Sir Alex Ferguson for Saturday's defeat of Norwich City following the incident.</p>
              <p>"Absolutely not true," he said. "Yes, people were joking about it in the club but it was his decision to rest me."</p>

He may be as forgetful when it comes to paying for stuff as he is suspect at crosses, long shots and what not, but he also knows how to laugh at himself. As this clip from Spanish TV - referencing the recent episode in Tescos when the Man United keeper reportedly eat a doughnut without paying for it

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">At first glance you may think it’s video footage of David De Gea feasting on some doughnuts swiped from a supermarket.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But there was no danger of the Manchester United stopper getting into a sticky situation this time around, as the clip instead shows the Spaniard telling Spanish TV his version of doughnutgate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">De Gea allegedly stole a £1.19 doughnut from a Tesco store in Altrincham after being spotted by store staff on CCTV.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 20-year-old, on duty with the Spain Under 21s, explained that the incident was a misunderstanding due to his little spoken English, before happily munching on the doughnut placed next to him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">De Gea then offers international team mate Iker Muniain a bite, proclaiming that ‘sharing is living’, clearly happy to make light of last week’s incident.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">No further action was taken by the store on the keeper who earns £35,000-a-week at Old Trafford.</span></p>
