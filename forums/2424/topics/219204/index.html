            <div class='col-md body'>Southend boss Steve Tilson wants their stunning 1-0 Carling Cup victory over Premiership leaders Manchester United to kick-start their season.<br>Freddy Eastwood's free-kick knocked out the holders for the Championship's bottom club and Tilson said: "We need this result to get our season going.<br><br>"We wanted a good display but we just wanted to keep the score down.<br><br>"I've told the players to enjoy the moment and I'm sure they will. It does not come any bigger than this."<br><br>Tilson reserved special praise for Eastwood and hailed the rest of his players for a fantastic performance to dump United out of the cup.<br><br>"It was a great goal by Freddy, no-one is going to save that," added Tilson.<br><br>"He's scored something like 68 goals in 115 games for this club, it's a tremendous record. We don't want to lose him in January but we'll see what happens.<br><br>"I've just told the players to enjoy the moment and I'm sure they will.<br><br>"Getting promoted to the Championship at Swansea last season was the best moment of my managerial career so far, but this is massive."<br><br>Goalscorer Eastwood admitted he was in dreamland after his wonder goal sent the Shrimpers into the last eight.<br><br>"I'm a Manchester United fan and just to play them is unbelievable," said the 23-year-old.<br><br>"We really didn't think we would beat them, but cup games are hard and I guess that's what they've found out.<br><br>"I fancied my chances from the free-kick and as soon as I hit it I knew it was in. I'm delighted with it."<br><br>Goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan made a series of sensational saves as the Roots Hall club held on for a famous victory.<br><br>"I knew it'd be a busy night and I knew I had to make the saves, but I'm still really pleased with them," said Flahavan.<br><br>"We stood up to the pressure, threw bodies in the way when it really counted and the lads defended brilliantly.<br><br>"It is a great achievement and once we saw their starting team we knew it would be a real challenge.<br><br>"We need to start picking up results in the league and hopefully this could prove to be a real confidence-booster."<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said he had "no complaints" after watching his team lose their first game since he celebrated 20 years in charge at Old Trafford.<br><br>"Games like this are a great reminder as to what can happen in football sometimes," said Ferguson.<br><br>"With all the celebrations going on this week it's a very good reminder to myself. Tomorrow, we will start again."<br></div>
