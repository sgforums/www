              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester United identified Phil Jones as a transfer target long before they were crushed by Barcelona in last season's Champions League final. But the majesty of Barça's play from the rear of the pitch made it seem an especially smart move to hand Blackburn Rovers £17m for a young defender who might match the mobility and elegance of Gerard Piqué.</p>
              <p>Europe's champions start forward plays not from the front but the back, where Piqué, who had spent four years on United's books, and the goalkeeper are assigned to always use the ball constructively in a sequence that invites Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and now Cesc Fábregas to do the rest. United are among the great powers seeking answers to Barcelona's dominance. Agile and audacious in his forward moves, Jones offers United an alternative in Europe to two centreâ€‘backs who confine themselves to marking men or space.</p>
              <p>Jones is on the continent this week, but not in one of the great Champions League citadels. He is in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on England" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england"><span style="color: #005689;">England</span></a> camp where Rio Ferdinand has already lost his place and John Terry is in his autumn years.</p>
              <p>For <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Fabio Capello" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fabio-capello"><span style="color: #005689;">Fabio Capello</span></a> the clock stops when England's involvement in Euro 2012 ceases. Though he makes the right noises about youth – and his own role in its development – Capello remains active in the self-preservation society. Repairing the damage to his reputation from the World Cup is a more pressing task than sprinkling the rose of English youth.</p>
              <p>So the choice of England's defensive line against Montenegro is no straightforwardly meritocratic debate. Kevin Keegan would have thrown Jones into England's last Euro 2012 qualifier. In training Glenn Hoddle would have shown him how to pass the ball 40 yards and found some clever role for "the boy Jones". Svenâ€‘Goran Eriksson would have asked David Beckham whether he thought Manchester United's new star was ready and acted on the answer. Capello, the pragmatist, will simply have weighed up the risks, to the campaign and to himself.</p>
              <p>They said Eriksson was a "lucky coach" but fortune has dropped a windfall on Capello's last months in charge. Jones and Chris Smalling have transformed England's defensive potential, at centre-half and rightâ€‘back, where both can play. The coach's alternatives, in Podgorica, are to play safe with the gritty Premier League nous of Phil Jagielka or the mid-range experience of Gary Cahill, the defensive leader in a collapsing Bolton Wanderers side.</p>
              <p>Of course the Jones-Piqué analogy is imperfect. Piqué passes the ball from the back whereas Jones, 19, tends to carry it downfield. The point is that both are starters and not merely stoppers. Montenegro is no place for centre-backs to be galloping into hostile territory. But it's a good a place as any to issue a declaration about England's future and offer Jones his debut in the last competitive fixture before Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>A victim, sometimes, of his own exuberance, Jones was advised by Martin Keown on the radio this week to always take care of his defensive responsibilities before trying to wreak havoc on the opposition. Keown supports the widespread view that the prodigy needs to stay "close to his partner" against good opposition. With Nemanja Vidic injured, and Ferdinand out of sorts, Jones is missing a colleague to administer that lesson during United's games. But Terry would not be slow to recite it in Podgorica.</p>
              <p>In an interview in these pages Micah Richards revealed that Jones was "disappointed" not to feature in the Bulgaria and Wales games. "But he's only 19 and he's got another 10 years ahead of him with England," Richards said, conservatively. He also called his Manchester rival "a future England captain".</p>
              <p>Teenage terrors are rare in this country's colours. Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Richards himself (debut at 18) required exceptional precocity to break the door down. Jones brings another question: where should he play, given his versatility? If centre-back is the answer, England might as well proceed with the task of teaching him when to stick or twist in international football. The alternative is to arrive in Poland and Ukraine with the country's best young defender since  Ferdinand still a virgin in competitive fixtures.</p>
              <p>The "incredible talent" Capello says he sees enters the picture at the perfect moment to test his manager's boldness/conservatism ratio. His admirers will point out that neither Cahill nor Jagielka is a proven tournament-class defender. So why play safe with a replacement for Ferdinand who may fill only a back-up role next summer? Why not make the leap now and display Jones's talent to the nations England will face in a competition where the semi-finals are their furthest point of advance?</p>
              <p>Below the surface of steady integration many of these England players are biding time until Capello passes through the system and a new, younger side forms, post-2012. Jones needs coaching, guiding, educating in the brutal realities of international action. Montenegro looks a good place to start.</p>
