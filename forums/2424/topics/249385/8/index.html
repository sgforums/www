But majority of Utd's fans goes back to before their glory days. Similarly, I have friends who started supporting Liverpool ardently during the 90s, during Utd's time.<br><br>I know of people who are die-hard Chelsea fans when the club was still fighting for a decent position in the league. These are the real fans, and I fully respect them. But it's irritating when some young punks who probably wasn't even born when Chelsea was still a struggling club to come to other club's forum and shoot their mouth off. They can start picking their fav club now, be it a glory club or a struggling club, and start buliding their loyalty from now. But do respect other clubs. Same goes for Utd fans who dun show respect for other clubs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>No offence, but I'm sure you know what I mean... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
