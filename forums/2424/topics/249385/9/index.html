The Chelsea boss said on Sunday the FA must have changed the rules so that United never have spot-kicks given against them . . . and the Blues are never awarded one.</strong><br><br>But Ferguson said: Â“I have looked at SaturdayÂ’s incident and John OÂ’Shea definitely got the ball.Â” The incident came in the final minute of UnitedÂ’s 1-1 home draw with Middlesbrough when OÂ’Shea felled Lee Dong Gook.<br><br>After seeing his own side held 0-0 at Newcastle on Sunday, Mourinho said: Â“With the new football rules, we are doing well. Â“It is not possible for penalties against Man United. It is not possible for penalties in favour of Chelsea.Â”<br><br>He says he should not face an FA charge for the outburst as it would represent Â“the end of democracyÂ”. But an FA spokesman said: Â“It is under consideration and a decision will be made tomorrow (Tuesday).Â” Mourinho was also angry Stephen Carr got away with a handball for Newcastle in SundayÂ’s draw.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Someone should ask jose why Watford didn't get a penalty when Terry handled the ball in the box? Had Watford got that penalty, Chelsea may not have won that match with an injury time goal from kalou... And also against Man City, Richards didn't touch Kalou as well, he went down and the referee gave chelsea a penalty... Moanrinho seems to be talking nonsense again now that Kenyon says he can stay... What a loser...</span><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJVvmGCARBU&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJVvmGCARBU&amp;mode=related&amp;search=</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>When Nicky Butt emerged from the Newcastle showers to switch on his phone, it leapt into life and revealed a string of texts. The first was a thank-you from Ryan Giggs and no doubt there were more to follow from former teammates and manager at Old Trafford after Newcastle stole two points from Chelsea at St JamesÂ’ Park.</strong><br><br>The Chelsea manager admitted: "Newcastle deserved their point. They defended very well, they were very fast in attack." Newcastle supporters may rightly ask why a side unbeaten at home by the top four are struggling to even chase down the outside chance of an InterToto Cup place.<br><br>They annoyed the life out of Chelsea. Mourinho arrived bemoaning the failure of referees to award penalties against his title rivals at Old Trafford. And he left the northeast desperately claiming his team should have been awarded a 10thminute penalty when a weak shot brushed Stephen CarrÂ’s arm.<br><br>Later John Terry was on a one-man mission to contest every decision and challenge against a Chelsea player. Mourinho has described his players as Â‘untouchablesÂ’, now they are starting to play as if they believe it. His late reaction to one robust challenge from Steve Taylor surprised even Halsey, who threatened him with a caution. By then Terry had started to lose the plot, too, with Andy Carroll, a 19-year-old in only his third top-level appearance. It was not a good afternoon for the champions, who had known victory would take them to within a point of Manchester United.<br><br>The game came to life just before the hour when Newcastle should have scored. Stand-in captain Butt played the best pass of the game to release Dyer beyond the Chelsea back four. However, Cech was equal to DyerÂ’s rare sprint, racing from his line and blocking the low shot with his feet.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson and Giggs might have been texting Butt with an entirely different message if that had flown in.</div>
