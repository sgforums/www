              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has
              rubbished suggestions Manchester United are a one-man team and says it
              is a privilege to have become a part of the club’s history.</p>
              <p>The Portugal star was the driving force behind United’s Premier
              League and Champions League double last season and, while he has not
              quite been able to recapture that form in the current campaign, he has
              been a key figure in the club’s quintuple drive.</p>
              <p>However, Ronaldo insists there are many other great players at Old Trafford and says he is delighted to be a part of the club.</p>
              <p>“I don’t agree with those people who say that if you can stop Cristiano you can stop Manchester United,” he told Ole.</p>
              <p>“We have a great team here.</p>
              <p>“We have excellent players. Manchester United is not just about Cristiano.”</p>
              <p>He added: “It is genuinely a privilege that I am compared to players like Eric Cantona.</p>
              <p>“It is wonderful, being so young, that I am already part of the history of such a great club.</p>
              <p>“It makes me very happy.”</p>
              <p>Ronaldo admits that he did struggle to adapt to life in
              Manchester early on, but feels his time at the club has helped him to
              develop.</p>
              <p>“There were moments when it was very, very difficult for me,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Because I always had much support from my mother and my family, to move away was difficult.</p>
              <p>“I had to travel a lot to lots of different countries, but it was then that I grew as a person and a player.”</p>
              <p>Now seemingly settled at the club, Ronaldo is desperate for a
              clean sweep of trophies this season, but he knows it will be difficult
              to remain European champions.</p>
              <p>“The Champions League is much more competitive than the league
              because you come up against the best teams in Europe, but you have to
              respect all teams in The Premier League as well,” he said.</p>
              <p>“We want to win every competition we enter.</p>
              <p>“Last year, we won lots of competitions and now we can repeat that success. We have to continue to work as we have been doing.”</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old says it is ‘an incredible feeling’ to be
              considered the best player in the world, but he does not want to be
              compared with Lionel Messi.</p>
              <p>“I do not compare myself with Messi,” he said.</p>
              <p>“He is a very good player, but the comparisons are not helpful. I don't like them.</p>
              <p>“I must think about myself and my form – nothing else.”</p>
