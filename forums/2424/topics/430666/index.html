              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>David Beckham looks set to play at Old Trafford next week in Gary Neville's testimonial.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Neville has been in touch with old friend Beckham about an appearance in the match against Juventus next Tuesday, and is confident the former England skipper will help re-unite </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Manchester United</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">'s famous 'Class of 92'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Nicky Butt and Phil Neville are already confirmed, along with Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, who will also be involved despite the proximity of the Champions League final at Wembley on May 28. </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>'I am in contact with David,' said Neville. 'It is looking positive but we still have a couple of things to sort out.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Hopefully it will be an enjoyable game for the fans and, four days before Wembley, it will be like a celebration and send-off for the lads who have done so well this season.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Neville admitted a cynicism about footballers' testimonials has emerged over the past few years, just days ahead of his own.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Neville confirmed that he plans to build a 1500-capacity supporters' club close to Old Trafford with part of the money he receives from the match.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He is also planning a project in Malta, where he has had long-time links, ensuring supporters buying tickets for next week's game know the money is not going straight to a player who has been well-paid throughout his career. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>'A cynical attitude has developed in the last 10 to 15 years about the amount of money that footballers earn,' admitted Neville. 'But look across all sport; tennis, golf, Formula One. It is huge. It connects everybody all over the world. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'And football is a huge business. So much money being poured into the game and it is the people out there on the pitch who provide the spectacle. Ultimately, the players are going to be well paid. That is an inevitability. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'But the reality is that the lads at this club came into football because they love playing football. They didn't start kicking a football around in the hallway at home when they were three because they thought of money. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'That is why football players should never forget their roots. If they continue that love of the game throughout, I don't think anyone would begrudge them money.'</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A detailed planning application will be submitted later this year with a target to open prior to the start of the 2013/2014 season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Although Neville is due to begin work as a Sky Sports pundit, the 36-year-old clearly has no intention of stepping back from his barely concealed love of all things United. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I am a fan. I have always been a fan,' he said. 'I wanted to do something for the fans and have said that publicly for the last 15 years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'This is something I know will give me satisfaction and fulfil what I believe to be a thank you, so the fans can go and enjoy it.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Amid that maelstrom, Giggs probably found the football pitch a place of peace.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">It certainly appeared so as he drove the low cross into Wayne Rooney's path that put United ahead in Neville's testimonial against Juventus.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Rooney had been a surprise inclusion and the striker lasted half an hour before he was replaced, along with Giggs and Paul Scholes.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">The latter duo are members of the famed 'Class of 92', of which Neville was also an integral part.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">With Nicky Butt, Phil Neville and David Beckham also reporting for duty, the sextet boasted an impressive 3,323 United appearances between them.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">For Beckham in particular, it was an emotional night as he pulled on the famous red jersey for the first time since he left for Real Madrid in 2003.</span></div>
