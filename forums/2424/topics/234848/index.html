The figures were achieved despite United last season failing to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League for the first time in a decade.<br><br>United chief executive David Gill said the new Premier League TV rights deal, the record shirt-sponsorship deal with insurance firm AIG and the increase of the Old Trafford capacity to 76,000 seats will lead to a major cash injection with well over Â£2million in ticket sales every home game.<br><br>Gill said in the report, which will be published in full on Wednesday: "In the course of the next two years, I expect the club's revenues to show dramatic growth, due to a combination of increased stadium capacity and greater sponsorship and television income.<br><br>"The club are in a very healthy position. Our attendances are now the envy of European, not just UK football and with a burgeoning season ticket waiting list, watching United at Old Trafford is still in great demand.<br><br>"The future is promising for the club. We continue to operate by budgeting sensibly and managing our affairs through stable business practices. "Success on the pitch will always be a driver for success off it and from this base, the club are healthily placed to begin a period of renewed growth."<br><br>Gill insisted United would not fleece fans despite the demand for season tickets. He added: "The club remain committed to making top-class football affordable and structures its prices accordingly."<br><br>The Â£12million that Chelsea had to pay United in compensation for Mikel Jon Obi helped swell United's coffers last year, but the income streams for the next year look staggering.<br><br>The AIG deal is worth Â£18million a year, TV money from the Premier League will be around Â£50million, the Champions League should see income of around Â£20million while the average crowd at Premier League matches this season has been 75,776, bringing in around Â£2million in ticket sales for every home match.<br><br>The report reveals United paid Â£1.8million to agents compared to the Â£2.6million the previous year. They are not compelled to reveal such payments but Gill added: "The club remains committed to disclosure of the amount it spends on agents' fees and has adopted the Football League's guidelines on this issue.<br><br>"The club fully supports the new agents' regulations which come into effect this summer and will see players being responsible for paying their own agents."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Glazers' United give loyal Gill Â£200,000 rise</strong></span><br><br>David Gill's loyalty to the Glazer family was richly rewarded last year with a pay rise of almost Â£200,000. Manchester United's accounts for the year ending June 2006, lodged today at Companies House, reveal that the chief executive received Â£1,138,000 in salary for the year with a pension top-up of Â£142,000, a total of Â£1,280,000. This represents a significant increase on his package for the previous year, when he received around Â£1.1m in salary and pension.<br><br>The handsome rise puts Gill on a par with Chelsea's Peter Kenyon in football's executive pay scale, though it is more modest than some had predicted. Gill defied predictions that he would be forced out by the new owners and has been a crucial figure in stabilising the club following the June 2005 takeover. He has an amicable working relationship with Joel Glazer, acting as a bridge to the manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, a relationship cited by sources at the club as a contributory factor in their current good form.<br><br>Gill will focus almost entirely on football issues when the current executive recruitment round is complete. The commercial director, Andy Anson, and finance director, Nick Humby, leave the club today, and Humby will be replaced by a chief operating officer who will take over all of Gill's current responsibilities save for governance and football matters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>UNITED DON'T WANT TV BREAKAWAY<br><br>Manchester United remain totally behind the Premier League's collective bargaining agreement even though their European rivals are reaping handsome rewards for going it alone. </strong><br><br>The Red Devils have slumped to fourth spot in the annual Deloitte 'Rich List', falling behind Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona, plus disgraced Italian outfit Juventus.<br><br>While no-one at Old Trafford is too concerned about the fall, based on individual turnover rather than profitability, it has been pointed out the major reason why clubs on the continent are generating more money is because they are now allowed to negotiate their own television deals.<br><br>The policy has been spurned by the Premier League, with some justification given the massive Â£2.7billion TV deal chief executive Richard Scudamore has negotiated, ensuring the average payout among the 20 top-flight clubs is Â£45million.<br><br>Nevertheless, United could still probably get more should they mount a successful challenge to the rules, which many felt they would do once new owner Malcolm Glazer completed his takeover last year. Yet such a move has not materialised and United sources insist it is not on the agenda.<br><br>"Manchester United is committed to a policy of collective media rights negotiation within the Premier League," said a club spokesman. "(Chief executive) David Gill has made this perfectly clear and the Glazer family are unequivocal in backing him on this matter."<br><br>In truth, United have little to worry about given the massive rise in TV revenues has been accompanied by a stadium expansion which generates in excess of Â£4million extra in gate receipts per season, plus an increased shirt sponsorship deal with American banking giant AIG now worth an incredible Â£18million per year.<br><br>"Our projections for the coming year suggest we will bounce back up the table again, but in any case turnover is just one factor in managing a football club," added the spokesman. "We still believe Manchester United to be by far the most profitable club and we look forward to continued success, on and off the field."<br></div>
