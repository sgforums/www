            <div class='col-md body'>A year to the day since Roy Keane went on MUTV to "nail certain players", Sir Alex Ferguson has said the club have come a long way since Keane's tirade, but Ferguson still craves a midfielder to replace his former captain, and he confirmed for the first time that he planned to resurrect a deal for Owen Hargreaves.<br><br>Ferguson had to choose his words carefully given Bayern Munich's threats to report him for making clandestine approaches, but the manager must be confident of finally getting his man considering that his normal modus operandi is to deflect any questions about potential transfer business.<br><br>"We are interested," he declared, in what may have been a deliberate attempt to lift Hargreaves's spirits as he recovers from a broken leg. United are aware that the England international has pinned his hopes on a move during the January transfer window and Ferguson made it clear the club would try to succeed where they failed in August. Pressed further, he said: "I can't give you anything more in terms of an update because we haven't spoken to Bayern."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The obvious question would then be how Ferguson, if successful, plans to fit three into two in the centre of midfield. Paul Scholes, arguably, is playing as well as at any stage of his career, an amazing feat given that Ferguson revealed that the player, who will be 32 this month, still had "slight haziness" affecting his vision after 10 months of eye problems. Carrick, the Â£18m acquisition now wearing Keane's No16 shirt, had an ordinary start after joining from Tottenham, but his form has improved and there were words of encouragement from his manager.<br><br>"He's a fantastic passer of the ball and he will excel for this club, particularly in Europe when it's so vital to keep the ball," said Ferguson. "His performances have been good but Scholes has been absolutely superb and, because of that, Carrick has had a cameo role. All the focus has been on Scholes and maybe that's been good for Carrick. It's enabled him to settle at the club, take his time and he's producing some good football for us now."<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Carrick is seen by Ferguson as the long-term replacement for Scholes, with Hargreaves playing a more defensive role. At present, however, Scholes looks as though he could play for another five years and United's prime deal-maker, the chief executive David Gill, will not need to point out to Ferguson that Bayern may provide challenging opposition when it comes to thrashing out Hargreaves's future.<br><br>Far less complicated, on the list of Gill's jobs for the new year, will be tieing Ryan Giggs to a new contract. United are to offer their longest-serving player a one- or two-year extension in January when, theoretically, he would be free to speak to other clubs. Giggs, who will be 33 this month, has been outstanding so far this season and has already indicated he wants to stay at Old Trafford for the remainder of his career.<br></div>
