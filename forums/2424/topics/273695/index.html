However, as he watched Tevez inspire West Ham's late-season survival surge, just as his own side were struggling to sustain a Treble challenge with an injury-ravaged squad, Ferguson could not help thinking what might have been.<br><br>"In his year at West Ham, Tevez proved himself to be an absolutely top player," reflected Ferguson.<br><br>"Every time I saw him playing for West Ham last year, I thought to myself, I just wish we had done it last year.<br><br>"But there were too many complications at the time."<br><br>Instead, Ferguson made Tevez one of four summer signings, splashing out Â£50million on Owen Hargreaves, Nani and Anderson within weeks of United clinching their ninth Premier League title.<br><br>His rapid recruiting mission meant Ferguson could enjoy a worry-free summer holiday for once, convinced he had got the right men at the right time.<br><br>"I think the four signings will be good ones," he said.<br><br>"We knew Hargreaves was going to happen for a long time. We hoped it would be last June, then January but we finally got it done in May.<br><br>"Nani and Anderson were quick decisions.<br><br>"We saw an opening regarding their contracts and weren't prepared to wait.<br><br>"Anderson broke his leg last year but if we had let him start the season after his broken leg, everyone would have been after him."</div>
