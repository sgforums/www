              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United manager </span><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has confirmed that injury-plagued defender </span><span style="color: #000000;">Rio Ferdinand</span><span style="color: #000000;"> could miss the rest of the season because of an ongoing calf problem.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ferdinand, 32, has been struggling with a back complaint throughout the campaign, but a calf injury picked up in the warm-up prior to the loss at Wolves in early February has meant he has been unable to help United in their quest for the Treble. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Rio has been out for a few weeks now,'' said Ferguson. "We are not looking at this as a short-term situation. He has not started training yet. We will be lucky to get him back for some part of the season.''</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The loss of such an experienced player will come as a huge blow to United as they battle on in the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup with a seriously depleted rearguard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Versatile defender </span><span style="color: #000000;">John O'Shea</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has been ruled out for five weeks with the hamstring injury he picked up against Marseille in midweek and full-back Rafael is out for at least two weeks with a similar injury. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Skipper </span><span style="color: #000000;">Nemanja Vidic</span><span style="color: #000000;"> will miss this weekend's Premier League match at home to Bolton with a calf injury, but Ferguson hopes centre-back </span><span style="color: #000000;">Jonny Evans</span><span style="color: #000000;"> will be fit after resuming training this week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Vidic won't make it,'' confirmed Ferguson. "He is showing good recovery for this week and should be OK after the international break but not enough for Saturday.''</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">He added: "It has been a bad spell for us. Only a few weeks ago we had every defender fit and things were looking great. It has all just fallen apart in the last week or so.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Hopefully Jonny Evans may be fit for Saturday, even if it is a bit of a risk. He has trained all week but he has been out for such a long time.''</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ferdinand has struggled with a series of injury problems in recent seasons and lost the United captaincy to Nemanja Vidic at the start of the season due to his ongoing fitness issues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The England centre-back's absences have also had a costly effect at international level. After being handed the armband by manager </span><span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Capello</span><span style="color: #000000;"> it now appears he may have to give it back to </span><span style="color: #000000;">John Terry</span><span style="color: #000000;"> on a long-term basis.</span></p>

              <p>fergie did, he bought smalling. the plan was to partner smalling with evans, the new centrebacks, but evans had had a confidence crisis, and now, this plan is waywired.</p>
