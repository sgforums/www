So if what you said above is true, you mean during the save made by Ferdinard, for instance, Berbatov had to time his shot such that there was time for Ferdinard to rush back to the line and clear it???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Pardon me, but sounds a bit far-fetched.<br><br>I don't know about other teams, but I know Utd will never fix a match.
