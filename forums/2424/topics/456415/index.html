              <p class="art-txt-first">Paul Scholes needed no persuading to extend his career by another season after admitting he handled his initial retirement badly.</p>
              <p>The 37-year-old called time on his stellar career following the 2011 Champions League final defeat to Barcelona at Wembley.</p>
              <p>Six months later, he was turning out for Manchester United in their FA Cup third round tie at Manchester City, having asked Sir Alex Ferguson if he could make the most dramatic of comebacks.</p>
              <p>Scholes has since signed on for another season, which Ferguson does expect to be the former England midfielder's last.</p>
              <p>It was not that Scholes thought his first decision was necessarily wrong.</p>
              <p>More than by accepting a coaching role, he was forced to watch old team-mates train every day at Carrington, which meant his own desire to play never completely went away.</p>
              <p>"I was all right for the first couple of months after retiring and didn't really miss anything," Scholes told reporters on Manchester United's recent pre-season tour of South Africa.</p>
              <p>"But once I got back into going to Carrington and coaching the reserves, as well as being with the lads, it was difficult, especially when there were so many injuries to the team.</p>
              <p>"If I'd stayed away from the reserves and the club I'd probably have been OK. But every day that I was going in I just wanted to train and be involved.</p>
              <p>"The manager didn't have to twist my arm to play this season."</p>
              <p>Scholes had a positive impact too, so much so that it was suggested he might earn a shock call-up to Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 squad, eight years after his last international.</p>
              <p>In the end, Hodgson never even made the call, which is a shame, because Scholes might just have said yes.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't offered the chance," said Scholes.</p>
              <p>"It was flattering to be talked about. But I wasn't asked, so it means nothing."</p>
              <p>Ferguson was doubtless pleased Hodgson kept his mouth shut as it meant Scholes was one of the few senior figures within the United squad who was available for the entire pre-season campaign.</p>
              <p>Scholes wanted to get back too, after spending the summer reflecting on what might have been after that out-of-character late-season collapse that gifted the Barclays Premier League to Manchester City.</p>
              <p>"It's always a motivating force when you lose the league," he said.</p>
              <p>"It's not nice to see another team celebrate winning the title on the last day of the season. That picture stays with you."</p>

              <p>Scholes looking over his shoulder</p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2012/0905/paulscholesmanchesterunited_275x155.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="155"></p>
              <p>Paul Scholes has hailed the impact of Manchester United's new signings and admitted he is wary of the competition for places in the side.</p>
              <p>Scholes, 37, came out of retirement mid-way through last season to play an important role for United as they pushed rivals Manchester City all the way in the title race, only to miss out on goal difference.</p>
              <p>The midfielder signed a new one-year contract at Old Trafford in May, and he has reiterated his importance to Sir Alex Ferguson's team already this season, most recently helping to inspire a 3-2 comeback at Southampton.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has brought in Robin van Persie, Shinji Kagawa, Nick Powell, Alexander Buttner and Angelo Henriquez this summer, and Scholes has welcomed the competition for places.</p>
              <p>He said in the<em> Daily Star</em>: "You always like to see new players come in, even if they're in your position. It's healthy for the team and exciting to play with the new players. We have got strength everywhere in the squad.</p>
              <p>"We've struggled with injuries to defenders, but when we have everyone fit, I think there are two teams the manager has available to him that could compete in the Premier League and cup competitions.</p>
              <p>"It all looks very healthy and, as players, we know when we get given our chance, we have to take it. If you don't, you'll be out of the team. Simple as that."</p>
              <p>Scholes went on to hail the new recruits, adding: "All the new signings have settled in well. Shinji has been with us since the start of pre-season, so he's had a good amount of time. He's a top-class player who did great in Germany and we're lucky to have him.</p>
              <p>"Shinji is just a clever footballer who gets into those great positions where it's difficult for other teams to pick him up. He's always on the move, which makes it easier for the midfielders to find him.</p>
              <p>"He fits in with the way we play. It's important he links up well with the midfielders and centre-forwards and he's shown he's clever enough to do that. He's intelligent and someone we all really enjoy playing with.</p>
              <p>"Nick Powell has done well. He hasn't had much first-team aÂ­ction yet but there's plenty of time.</p>
              <p>"Robin is a top signing and we hope to form a good understanding with him as the season goes on.</p>
              <p>"Alex played his first game for the Under-21s last week and did well. There's competition for places, with so many good players."</p>
