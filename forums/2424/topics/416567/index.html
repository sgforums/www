              <p><strong>Neuer, under contract until 2012 and valued at around £16million, refused to discuss his future after Saturday's mauling at Kaiserslautern, but said: 'That was a catastrophe and I have no explanation for such a disastrous performance. </strong></p>
              <p>'I can understand why the fans were so angry because if we keep playing like that, we will be relegated.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson is keen to sign an experienced stopper to take the gloves from Dutchman Edwin van der Sar, who is approaching the end of a brilliant career, having celebrated his 40th birthday last month.</p>
              <p>The United manager is already building for the future, after paying Aalesunds £3.5m for Denmark keeper Anders Lingegaard.</p>

              <p class="art-txt-first">Schalke coach Felix Magath has warned Manchester United and other clubs off Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his weekend heroics.</p>
              <p>Neuer turned in another impressive display as he helped the Royal Blues beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in the Bundesliga on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Bayern have made no secret of their wish to sign Neuer, while United are also believed to be taking an interest in the 24-year-old.</p>
              <p>However, Magath, who on Saturday hailed Neuer as "the best goalkeeper in the world", is not interested in selling.</p>
              <p>"A year ago, we would maybe have had to think about a transfer in the situation we were in, but not now," he told Kicker magazine.</p>
              <p>"We are now far better off financially and do not have to sell Manuel Neuer at all."</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Bayern are still monitoring the situation in view of making a bid in the summer.</p>
              <p>"My colleague Magath will not sell Neuer, but I will discuss this issue with my board," said Bayern coach Louis van Gaal at the weekend.</p>
              <p>He is currently looking for a replacement for Hans-Jorg Butt, whose career is coming to an end.</p>
              <p>Neuer's contract with Schalke expires in 2012 and, should he not commit to a new deal, his valuation will drop in June.</p>
              <p>And the chances of him staying in Gelsenkirchen would reduce if they cannot offer him Champions League football next season, which is looking unlikely at present with the team 15th in the standings.</p>
