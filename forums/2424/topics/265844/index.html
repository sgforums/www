            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00179/tevez_179458a.jpg"><br><br><strong>Manchester United last night appeared to have won the race to sign Carlos TÃ©vez. The West Ham United forward, who is playing in the Copa America in Venezuela, has told his Argentina teammates that a deal has been agreed for him to play at Old Trafford next season. </strong><br><br>TÃ©vez has been coveted by some of the top European clubs this summer, including Inter Milan, Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid, after his rousing performances and seven goals were largely responsible for keeping West Ham in the Premiership last season. Their survival was ensured when his perseverance allowed him to score the only goal in the defeat of United at Old Trafford on a dramatic final day of the season in May.<br><br>It is likely that TÃ©vez will move to United initially on a 12-month loan deal, with a fee of about Â£4 million payable to Kia Joorabchian, the businessman who owns the economic rights to the player, and wages in excess of Â£3 million. Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, would also want the option of making the move permanent at the end of next season.<br><br>On the day that Liverpool broke their transfer record by completing the Â£20.2 million signing of Fernando Torres, the Spain striker, from AtlÃ©tico Madrid, the capture of TÃ©vez, 23, would be a resounding signal of intent from United that they intend resolutely to defend their title and make a concerted attempt to win the Champions League.<br><br>United have already committed more than Â£50 million this summer on an England midfield player and two of the best young attacking talents in Europe. Owen Hargreaves arrived for Â£17 million from Bayern Munich and was joined by Nani, the 20-year-old Sporting Lisbon winger, and Anderson, the 19-year-old FC Porto playmaker, with the two deals understood to be worth projected figures of Â£17.3 million and Â£20.4 million respectively. Even Chelsea have had no answer to the speed and extravagance with which United have gone about their business this summer.<br><br>With Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo already in their ranks, the addition of TÃ©vez would give Ferguson a formidable array of firepower. Despite the problems that West Ham encountered after signing TÃ©vez Â– they were fined Â£5.5 million in April for breaching third-party agreements Â– it would be possible to structure a contract that was acceptable to the Premier League. Javier Mascherano, the Argentina midfield player, moved from West Ham to Liverpool in January under similar circumstances.<br><br>Should United sign TÃ©vez on a permanent deal, they are likely to have to pay in the region of Â£35 million. Inter had offered about Â£30 million before they pulled out of negotiations. Ferguson has been looking for a reliable goalscorer and had considered Samuel EtoÂ’o, of Barcelona, Dimitar Berbatov, the Bulgarian who made such an impression last season with Tottenham Hotspur, and Nicolas Anelka, of Bolton Wanderers. The arrival of TÃ©vez could hasten the sale of Alan Smith, who has been made surplus to requirements.<br><br></div>

This is massive news."<br><br>Tevez is best friends with United's Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze and was a guest at their end-of-season title party in a London club.<br><br>Days later, Tevez scored at Old Trafford on the final day of the season to give West Ham the 1-0 win that kept them in the Premiership, but his controversial transfer has been the subject of a Premier League investigation, which was concluded on Tuesday.<br><br>United were hoping to keep the confirmation of the transfer quiet until the furore died down and the deal will not be officially declared until the middle of next week. The official transfer fee Â— and wages Â— are still to be confirmed.<br><br>United have already signed Portuguese winger Nani and Brazilian midfielder Anderson on expensive five-year contracts.<br><br>The pair join the Premier League champions from Sporting Lisbon and Porto respectively, while England midfielder Owen Hargreaves completed his move from Bayern Munich. The total cost of those deals is Â£50m.<br><br>United have also made Polish keeper Tomasz Kuszczak a full signing after he played last season on loan from second division West Bromwich.<br><br>With multi-million pound backing from their American investors, United have been flexing their financial muscle, but the signing of Tevez is their most ambitious.<br><br>The little striker has told friends that he is "very excited" about his future, though he has refused to confirm his next destination. Tevez has also been linked with Inter Milan and Arsenal, although West Ham had been hoping to keep him.<br><br>Tevez told Sportsmail in an exclusive interview last season: "If I can play at West Ham in such a difficult position, then it's easier to play for a bigger club, with players such as Rooney, Ronaldo or Drogba.<br><br>"I would be capable of playing at any English team, because the English game is no longer a problem for me." He then went on to save West Ham, following his controversial "loan" move from Corinthians, a club he joined in a South American transfer record of $22m.<br><br>As well as being fined for turning up in an official press conference wearing a United shirt, he was also punished for turning up for a game in Bermuda shorts Â— and for fighting with team-mates.<br><br>Then the goals started and he was branded a hero. The fans copied his braided hair cut, followed his celebration dance craze and bought the replica shirts.<br><br>It was claimed that 4,000 were sold at every home game. He was elected captain by his team-mates and he would lead out his team with his baby daughter, Florencia, in his arms, producing a dummy from his sock when he scored a goal.<br><br>Then, when a website opened in his name, it broke the previous record held by Ronaldinho by 4,000 hits.<br><br>Tevez received 16,000 hits and the local newspapers called it "the birth of Tevezmania". It sounds like a marketing dream for Manchester United.<br><br>West Ham last night confirmed the free transfer signing of former England goalkeeper Richard Wright, who left Everton at the end of last season.<br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=466284&amp;in_page_id=1779&amp;ct=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=466284&amp;in_page_id=1779&amp;ct=5</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that according to some reports, Tevez is being signed due to his marketability as much as his playing ability. Whatever it is, he does seem to be a pretty similar player to Rooney, but seemingly less hot-headed and slightly better at staying upfront.<br><br>If the rumors turn out to be true, then United are truly shifting from the traditional mould of formations to one with more fluency in attack. Tevez has proven that he can score goals in the Prem. He is also willing to drift out wide and provide support to attacks.<br><br>It seems that Tevez is unlikely to be played as an out and out striker. He'll be one who might swap places with Rooney during attacks, shifting things around a bit, making it difficult for him to be marked. A plus point if he does come is that he's a set-piece specialist who's a tad bit more consistent than Ronaldo.<br><br>Still, the blud hasn't declared it officially, yet.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>United close in on Tevez as Fergie leaves rivals in the shade</strong><br><br>Manchester United last night appeared to have won the race to sign Carlos TÃ©vez. The West Ham United forward, who is playing in the Copa America in Venezuela, has told his Argentina teammates that a deal has been agreed for him to play at Old Trafford next season.<br><br>TÃ©vez has been coveted by some of the top European clubs this summer, including Inter Milan, Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid, after his rousing performances and seven goals were largely responsible for keeping West Ham in the Premiership last season. Their survival was ensured when his perseverance allowed him to score the only goal in the defeat of United at Old Trafford on a dramatic final day of the season in May.<br><br>It is likely that TÃ©vez will move to United initially on a 12-month loan deal, with a fee of about Â£4 million payable to Kia Joorabchian, the businessman who owns the economic rights to the player, and wages in excess of Â£3 million.<br>Gary Jacob, The Times<br><br>Meanwhile, The Daily Mail claim Sir Alex has told Alan Smith he has no future at Old Trafford. Smith has recently been linked with moves to Everton and Sunderland.<br><br>The same paper report Real Madrid could poach United fitness coach Valter di Salvo. The Italian previously worked at the Bernabeu alongside the Reds' assistant manager, Carlos Queiroz.<br><br>Elsewhere, The Sun claim Sir Alex has been told he must sell before he can buy any more players. United have already splashed out on Nani, Anderson and Owen Hargreaves and the paper say it's essential the Reds boss now cashes in on some of the squad's fringe players.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=441645" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=441645</a></div>
