              <div class="KonaBody">It now seems increasingly likely that the former Tottenham striker will leave Old Trafford at the end of the season following an often difficult three-year spell at the club.<br><br>Despite his age, he will not be short of suitors, although United will want to recoup at least half of the club record £30.75 million fee they paid Spurs for the player in August 2008. Sir Alex Ferguson will then turn his attention to securing a younger replacement for the Bulgarian.<br><br>Although talks have reached a stalemate with Berbatov, United are confident they can soon tie Hernandez to an improved five-year deal following his brilliant debut campaign.<br><br>The club’s hierarchy have been working tirelessly behind the scenes in recent months to protect themselves from predators by extending the contracts of key players.<br><br>Hernandez is set to follow in the footsteps of Patrice Evra, Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Ryan Giggs, who have all signed new deals in recent months. Paul Scholes has still not decided whether to accept the club’s offer of a one-year contract extension.<br></div>

              <p>I genuinely hope that he is sold.</p>
              <p>Reasons:</p>
              <p>1. Although he is the top scorer this season, his goals have been in start-stop motion. One moment he scores 5 goals, the next 5 matches he failed to find the net. Inconsistencies.</p>
              <p>2. He's 30, definitely not much resale value left after this so why not let him go off earlier?</p>
              <p>3. We're gonna have Macheda + Welbeck + Diouf back next season baring any departures.</p>
              <p>Macheda cannot be looked upon as a young, raw striker any more after playing top flight football for 4 seasons already. Welbeck has developed over at his loan spell at Sunderland. Diouf may be sold but heck, United will still have Rooney and Chicharito to depend on as Owen is likely to move on too.</p>
              <p>Reserves like Nicky Ajose (he did well at his loan spell at Bury) and Joshua King (Reserves top scorer if i'm not wrong) are also on the rise so why not take the risk and offload him? For all you know, he may only be a 1 season wonder.</p>

              <p>well, I always think that Berba gives MU another dimension to their play, a holding fwd who can outlet the ball to the sides or wait for the team to arrive to support the attack, but it seems to kill the pace and counter plays that MU thrives on.</p>
              <p>not sure how much he can command on the transfer market, but hopefully, he can be used to get someone in return.</p>
              <p>both ownes have to go, sadly, but in order to move fwd, MU needs to find fitter and healthier players.</p>
              <p>Kiko on loan in SerieA, but he is not creating waves as per  welbeck. And not sure whether MU can really depends on them as 2nd option if Rooney/Chirharito aren't firing on their cylinder as per an Ole or Terry as per the 99 UCL.</p>
