              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Nemanja Vidic</span> has pledged his immediate future to Manchester United, insisting he'll resist the overtures of Europe's biggest clubs if they come calling over the summer.</strong></p>

              <p class="photoCredit">Constant rumours hinting at the commanding defender's departure from Old Trafford have circulated this season, citing reasons from Vidic's wife being unhappy in England to an alleged falling out between the Serb and <span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span>.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Barcelona, Real Madrid and AC Milan are among those linked to a swoop for Vidic, but he said he is sick of answering questions about his future and insists the commitment he shows on the pitch should be proof enough of his happiness at the Premier League champions.</p>
              <p>"Tell me the club where I can go that is better than Manchester United?'' Vidic told the <em>Daily Mirror</em>. "There aren't many clubs in the world where you can go to that are better. I'm happy here. United has been a big part in my development. Everything I have done here I respect. I will try and give my best on the pitch for as long as I can.</p>
              <p>"I'm tired of speaking about my future. I give my best at United and always try to do that. I think that commitment shows how I think. I can't stop people speaking about my future but I have two years left on my contract and I'm happy. I need to think about next season, prepare myself, be focused and make sure I prevent injuries.''</p>
              <p>United still have faint hopes of retaining their Premier League crown and will do so if they beat Stoke on Sunday and Wigan can get a result at Chelsea. However, Vidic believes their season should not be regarded as a failure if they end the campaign with only the the Carling Cup.</p>
              <p>"In the last two weeks we didn't play well when we needed to. It's out of our hands now but we still hope. We must remember we have won the title in the last three years and been in the Champions League final twice. So we have had success. But to win the title four times in a row was always going to be difficult. We always knew that.</p>
              <p>"This is life. You cannot win all the trophies all the time. You cannot be on the top every year. Even though we want to and have pushed very hard, sometimes you need to be strong, take those bad moments and learn from them.''</p>
