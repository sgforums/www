            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson says it will be harder to win his ninth Premier League title than any of the previous eight.<br><br>Ferguson celebrates his 65th birthday at the top of the table, with only one rival realistically capable of preventing Manchester United remaining in that position next May.<br><br>However, as Ferguson readily acknowledges, the threat is a fairly formidable one in the form of back-to-back champions Chelsea.<br><br>Although the Scot is refusing to enter a debate over whether winning the title this year would be his greatest achievement, believing it is far too early in the campaign to even consider such a prospect, he does accept it represents a harder task because of the vast resources available to Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"The influence of Chelsea and the big players they have been able to buy has made winning the league harder, there is no doubt about it," he said.<br><br>"It has not been easy for us because they have won the league quite comfortably in the last two years. That is why we wanted to make a good start this season.<br><br>"We have achieved that now. Hopefully, we can cash in on it."<br><br>Having reached the halfway stage of the campaign dropping points in just four games, United have already proved their durability.<br><br>But what Ferguson really wants now is for his side to keep their focus and keep gathering points to ensure Chelsea are pushed to an extent they have never been since Mourinho arrived in England.<br><br>"They have not been tested like that before but if we can maintain our consistency, we will do it," said the Scot.<br><br>On paper, United do have a tougher run-in, which not only takes them to Stamford Bridge on April 14, but also Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham, as well as Newcastle, who provide the Red Devils with their first opposition of 2007 at St James' Park on Monday night .<br><br>However, despite the demanding nature of the fixtures that lie ahead, United do appear well placed to meet the challenge.<br><br>Although skipper Gary Neville seems set for a short spell on the sidelines, the Red Devils have been largely injury-free this season and even if a still-touted move for Owen Hargreaves does not reach a positive conclusion, the arrival of Henrik Larsson for a 10-game spell has provided the Old Trafford camp with a timely boost.<br><br>In addition, they also have Cristiano Ronaldo on form, putting him in line for a startling 12-month transformation from public enemy number one to Premiership player of the year.<br><br>"We think Cristiano is the best in this league and have done so for a while," admitted Ferguson.<br><br>"The important thing for him is to be accepted.<br><br>"They still boo him away from home, like they did at Aston Villa last week. But those same fans are petrified whenever he gets the ball."<br><br>And, Ferguson is pleased to report, Ronaldo's relationship with Rooney is getting stronger by the day, to the extent where the World Cup adversaries are men to be feared, not just outside the United camp, but inside it too.<br><br>"There is no battle between the two of them, they are the jokers in the dressing room and we have all been subject to their pranks," reflected Ferguson.<br><br>"I don't think Cristiano's form matters to Wayne because he has quite a laid-back, carefree attitude to life. He just gets on with it and enjoys himself."<br><br></div>
