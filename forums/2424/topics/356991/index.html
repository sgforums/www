              "The manager realises who needs a rest. We need everyone ready for this stage." - Darren Fletcher
              
              Darren Fletcher feels Sir Alex Ferguson did the right thing by leaving a number of senior squad members out of Sunday's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Everton.
              
              At a stage of the season where high-pressure games continue to come thick and fast, Fletcher admits the United manager has bought some potentially vital freshness for members of his squad - even if they would have rather featured at Wembley.
              
              "They wonâ€™t appreciate it, but deep down theyâ€™ll know itâ€™s the best thing," Fletcher told ManUtd.com. "The manager knows whatâ€™s best, heâ€™s had years of experience.
              
              "The lads want to play in every game, and thatâ€™s the good thing about the squad â€“ everyone wants to keep playing. As a player you donâ€™t like to admit tiredness, you just want to battle through it, but the manager realises these things. He and the coaches will look at the stats and know whoâ€™s ready for a rest."
              
              Fletcher missed Sunday's penalty shoot-out defeat through injury, but is back in contention for Wednesday's Barclays Premier League visit of Portsmouth - and the energetic midfielder admits United's squad cannot be too large for a packed run-in.
              
              "We need everyone ready for this stage of the season now," he said. "Weâ€™re fighting for the league and the Champions League â€“ you canâ€™t play the same team in every game. If you did, the freshness wouldnâ€™t be there because you play too many games.
              
              "Nobody likes to be rested, they want to play in every game, but you do realise now that itâ€™s part and parcel of being at United, and really of being a professional these days. Itâ€™s a squad game."
              
              Sir Alex will inevitably freshen up his side again for tonight's visit of Portsmouth, and Fletcher - who may return after recovering from his minor hamstring injury - is prepared for a difficult encounter against a side which shocked Old Trafford last season.
              
              "Portsmouth are quite a physical team, theyâ€™ve had a lot of changes in management and theyâ€™re just settling down now," he said. "They beat us in the FA Cup at Old Trafford last year, and weâ€™ll have to bear that in mind. 
              
              "But we know itâ€™s going to be difficult, because at this stage of the season teams are fighting for different things: championships, Europe and avoiding relegation â€“ so there are no easy games."
