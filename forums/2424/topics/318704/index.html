              <h2><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/25297_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="178"></h2>
              <h2>Manchester United midfielder Anderson has hailed an incredible
              maiden Premier League season as “enormous” and described his team as
              “the kings of Europe.”</h2>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p>The Brazilian playmaker joined Manchester United last
              summer from Porto and drastically altered his game in order to provide
              Alex Ferguson with a ready-made replacement for Paul Scholes.</p>
              <p>Originally intended to be phased in throughout the season, the
              20-year old immediately grasped his first-team opportunities to become
              one of United’s most consistent performers with a host of tenacious and
              vibrant displays.</p>
              <p>Anderson admits that he did not expect to be such a prominent member
              of the first team this year but is delighted that he has finished his
              first Premier League season with two winners medals - the domestic
              championship and the Champions League.</p>
              <p>He told the Brazilian press: "The season was enormous for me, I
              never believed I would play in so many matches and win the two titles.</p>
              <p>"To be a European champion so young is not easy for a man like me.
              Now I need to continue working for next season to improve my level in
              this club.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United is the best club in the world and I want to be in
              the XI in every match. We are the kings in Europe and England without
              doubt."</p>
              <p>Of his late contribution in Wednesday’s epic showdown, in which he
              scored a penalty, Anderson said: "My mission in the final was to score
              the penalty and I have fulfilled it.</p>
              <p>"It was not easy because at that moment the tension on the pitch was
              enormous. But I am a calm player and I was convinced that my shot would
              beat Cech.</p>
              <p>"Cristiano Ronaldo was very hurt after missing his penalty.</p>
              <p>"I always had confidence in (Edwin) Van der Sar because in training
              he does a lot of work on penalties. I was optimistic and finally our
              keeper was a hero against Anelka."</p>
