              <p><br><strong>United winger Ryan Giggs admits winning isn’t everything during
                  pre-season, although he’d love to put one over Orlando Pirates in
                  Durban on Tuesday.<br><br></strong>The Reds’ first match in the Vodacom
                  Challenge, against Kaizer Chiefs in Cape Town, ended 1-1 after Chris
                  Eagles cancelled out Jonathan Quartey’s opener.<br><br>And although Sir
                  Alex’s side are guaranteed a spot in the competition’s final even if
                  they lose to Orlando Pirates, Giggs would much prefer to get there on
                  merit.<br><br>“The results here in South Africa aren’t the be all and end all,” he told <em><strong>MUTV</strong></em>. “Generally, the idea is to get fit and come through the games with no injuries. <br><br>“But
                  winning is still important. We didn’t win the tournament last time we
                  were here in 2006 [so we’d like to make up for that]. Besides, you want
                  to get into the habit of winning games as soon as possible.”<br><br>The 34-year-old is enjoying his time in South Africa, largely due to the supporters’ hospitality.<br><br>“South
                  Africa’s great. The fans are brilliant, just like anywhere else in the
                  world where United go. I’ve experienced it before so I know what to
                  expect, but it’s still special to arrive at the airport at 8am and see
                  fans waiting for you. <br><br>“They were dancing and singing and put on a real South African welcome [when we touched down in Cape Town on Friday].<br><br>“It’s definitely good to be here and we’ll have some more tough games to play – it will be a real test.”</p>

              <p><strong>Rio Ferdinand is in line for his first appearance of the
                  pre-season campaign against Orlando Pirates in Durban after recovering
                  from a back problem.</strong><br><br>The 29-year-old defender did not
                  take part in United’s opening summer friendly against Aberdeen and
                  then suffered a back spasm during the warm-up for the first Vodacom
                  Challenge match against Kaizer Chiefs in Cape Town on Saturday.<br><br>But
                  the influential centre-back took part in a light training session on
                  Sunday and was involved with the squad’s full work-out in Durban on
                  Monday afternoon.<br><br>“Rio trained yesterday,” confirmed Sir Alex.
                  “He wasn’t so stiff, and if he trains well today (Monday) he will
                  certainly start on Tuesday.<br><br>“He’s missed two games now and he’ll want to get back into the action. I think it’s important that he starts.”<br><br>Sir
                  Alex also confirmed that Rio’s defensive team-mate, Wes Brown, will
                  return to Manchester on Wednesday following the sad news that his
                  half-sister Amanda died at the weekend.</p>

              <h1>Fergie Satisfied With Orlando Win</h1>
              <p>The Red Devils triumphed 1-0 thanks to Lee Martin’s first-half strike
              in another intense encounter as United continue their pre-season tour
              of South Africa.<br><br>It was a decidedly different United side from
              that which drew 1-1 with Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend, with the likes
              of Ben Foster, Fraizer Campbell and Jonny Evans given the opportunity
              to stake their claim for a spot in the senior squad come the season
              proper.<br><br>Despite the narrowness of the win, Ferguson was pleased
              with the way his men achieved it, insisting the home side’s pressure
              contributed greatly to the spectacle.<br><br>"I’m satisfied with the
              result," he told United’s official website. "Some of the football we
              played in the first half hour was very satisfying: there was a lot of
              vision, movement and quick passing in our game, and we didn’t dwell on
              the ball.<br><br>"The Pirates were very aggressive in terms of pressing the ball and we had to be quick on it, which can only help us."<br><br>However,
              Sir Alex did admit that the some of his youngsters ran out of puff
              towards the end of the first half, although Orlando’s forwards failed
              to capitalise on the resulting concentration lapses.<br><br>"After 30
              minutes we lost our momentum a little bit, which happens with young
              players. They start to lose concentration," Ferguson continued. <br><br>"Defensively
              we were caught one or two times on the counter-attack but they had a
              lot of pace, although they weren't great finishers."</p>
