              <p>Manchester United midfielder <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8871/Darren-Fletcher"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Darren Fletcher</span></span></a> believes the club's hopes of regaining the Premier League crown from Chelsea will be in tatters if they continue to concede late goals.</p>
              <p>Everton scored twice in injury time on Saturday <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=293006&amp;league=ENG.1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">to snatch a 3-3 draw</span></span></a> against United at Goodison Park. And that came just a few weeks after Fulham scored late to claim a 2-2 draw against Sir Alex Ferguson's men at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Fletcher, who scored against Everton, admits that dropping such points could prove to be the difference between success and failure.</p>
              <p>"We should have learned from the Fulham game and we didn't,'' said Fletcher. "We really have to learn from this game if we want to take it forward this season and win the league. We can't afford to throw away points as we have done in the two away games so far.</p>
              <p>"It just shows you that you think you are winning 3-1 and can take it easy but you've got to keep taking your chances and really finish the game off. These are moments you can look back on and say 'That should have been three points' but it is a long season and there are many twists and turns to come.</p>
              <p>"It just shows you that you have to play right to the final whistle in this league because teams don't give up, especially when they are at home. The more confidence you give to teams, showing them things like that, the more confidence they will get to say 'Keep on right till the end against Manchester United'.</p>
              <p>"We need to put that to bed and get away from it as soon as possible. There is no vulnerability, it is just simple mistakes which we need to eradicate it quickly. The game was fizzling out but once you give a team like Everton a bit of hope with the second goal - which came out of nothing - it lifted the whole place.</p>
              <p>"They found that extra bit of energy and threw men into the box in the last minute. You can't afford to give teams at their home ground any sort of momentum or confidence, a half-chance or a goal, because in the end you suffer for it. The manager was really disappointed and made it clear in no uncertain terms of what is expected at this club.''</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/10/08/330/Darren-Fletcher-Manchester-United-Premier-Lea_2488824.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher is certain Liverpool will not come to Manchester United with the same safety-first attitude Rangers used to such smothering effect earlier this week.</p>
              <p>The battles between the north-west giants are always highlights in the Premier League fixture calendar no matter what their respective positions in the league.</p>
              <p>That Liverpool have now gone 20 years without a title and are trying to rebuild under Roy Hodgson has not lessened United's desire for victory, a need made all the more acute because of disappointing away draws at Fulham and Everton.</p>
              <p>Paul Scholes is virtually certain to return, which should at least provide the Red Devils midfield with some of the inventiveness it was so badly lacking on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>And Fletcher feels United can also profit from the more expansive approach he expects Liverpool to adopt.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool's history will not allow them to put nine men behind the ball," he said, reflecting on how Rangers were so successful in stifling United this week.</p>
              <p>"That is not their style.</p>
              <p>"Under Roy Hodgson I am sure they will be disciplined and well drilled. But they will look to win the match as well."</p>
              <p>In making 10 changes to his starting line-up in midweek, Ferguson seemed to be emphasising the importance of Sunday's clash.</p>
              <p>He quickly learned the importance of beating Liverpool at the start of his staggering 24-year reign at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>And while United's success has left their fellow north-west giants in the shade over the past two decades, they remain a foe to be beaten with relish.</p>
              <p>"It is the biggest game because of the history and the success the two clubs have had," reflected Fletcher.</p>
              <p>"We have had a lot of battles over the years. There is a great history between the two clubs and we have equalled their number of league titles now, so a lot is looked into that.</p>
              <p>"It is a massive occasion, when form goes out of the window.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool will be looking to kick-start their season but to have them at Old Trafford so early just emphasises the importance of getting the right result."</p>
              <p>The side issues include the injury to Antonio Valencia that United have confirmed will keep him out for "a good portion" of the season.</p>
              <p>Valencia had an operation on Wednesday night on the horrific ankle injury he suffered against Rangers and was examined by United medical staff on Thursday morning after which it was confirmed Valencia has also suffered ligament damage.</p>
              <p>"The operation went well, a plate has been inserted to stabilise the fracture but there is obviously significant ligament damage that follows a dislocation," read a United statement.</p>
              <p>"Antonio is perfectly fine, very positive and very determined."</p>
              <p>Michael Owen's future is also a hot topic.</p>
              <p>Now in the final season of a two-year contract that has brought more appearances on the substitutes' bench than on the pitch, Owen does not cut a happy figure.</p>
              <p>Once old boss Gerard Houllier is free of his commitments to the French Football Federation and can concentrate fully on Aston Villa, there has to be a decent chance a deal will be struck for the former England forward to move on.</p>
              <p>Although Owen will expect to be involved in the Carling Cup trip to Scunthorpe next Wednesday, it is fanciful to believe he will start against Liverpool, especially after Sir Alex Ferguson spoke so glowingly of Dimitar Berbatov in the wake of that Rangers' stalemate.</p>
              <p>Berbatov has already scored four goals this term, which is a pretty good effort considering his combined total in his first two years at Old Trafford was 26.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian is part of a United strike force that has plundered 11 goals in its opening four Premier League games.</p>
              <p>Problems have been evident at the back though, where Ferguson's side have conceded late goals - and dropped points - in both their away games.</p>
              <p>It is a problem that Fletcher recognises must be stopped.</p>
              <p>"There has been nothing wrong with our overall performances," said the Scotland skipper.</p>
              <p>"We are playing some good stuff at times.</p>
              <p>"What we are missing just now is the killer instinct. We need to change that as soon as possible."</p>
