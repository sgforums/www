              <p>Villarreal youngster Javier Matilla insists he has not been contacted by Manchester United ahead of the transfer window, but acknowledges he is being watched.</p>
              <p>It has been reported that United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has sent his scouts to watch the Spain Under 21 international, who has been described as the next Xavi.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Matilla is currently under contract with Villarreal's B team, but rumours suggest that a number of clubs are planning a €3million (£2.7m) bid in January.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old is adamant that he has not been approached and that he is happy with Villarreal, however, he recognises that up-and-coming Spaniards will attract transfer interest.</p>
              <p>Matilla told Spanish media: "I know about the rumours, but they are not rare. The members of Spain's U21 team are watched by lots of scouts.</p>
              <p>"I am happy with Villarreal and my dream is to be in the first-team squad.</p>
              <p>"Nobody has contacted me and my challenge is to work hard every day."</p>
              <p>A statement from Villarreal's directors on the subject of Matilla read: "We have not received any formal offer, but we know that there are scouts at our matches."</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Wayne Rooney says he would be stunned if he failed to eclipse his best seasonal tally of 23 following Manchester United's 5-0 win over Wigan.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Rooney found the net for the 15th time this season as he scored the first goal in Manchester United's 5-0 hammering of Wigan at Old Trafford tonight.</p>
              <p>The result took the Red Devils to within two points of Premier League leaders Chelsea heading into 2010, just as Sir Alex Ferguson demanded.</p>
              <p>In addition, United have clawed back Chelsea's massive goal difference advantage.</p>
              <p>Now they trail by just two, with Rooney certain he is going to get a few more.</p>
              <p>"I would hope to beat my best total," he said. "If I don't get another eight goals from now until the end of the season there is something seriously wrong.</p>
              <p>"I hit the post before I scored and the bar afterwards. I am doing well and I feel fit. Hopefully that will continue."</p>
              <p>Following on from his superb performance at Hull on Sunday, it was another masterclass from Rooney, which drew warm praise from Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Wayne was absolutely fantastic again, just like Sunday," said the United boss. "The energy he showed in his game and his desire is marvellous."</p>
              <p>Even Wigan boss Roberto Martinez was purring.</p>
              <p>"Wayne Rooney has been showing great maturity for the whole season," he said.</p>
              <p>"He is among that elite group of players in the Premier League who are truly world class."</p>
              <p>However, Rooney was not alone in excelling.</p>
              <p>Antonio Valencia in particular had a productive night against his old club, taking his own tally to seven by netting the final goal of the year after Michael Carrick, Rafael Da Silva and Dimitar Berbatov had found the net.</p>
              <p>"Valencia is doing really well," said Rooney. "He is really quick and is aggressive getting to the ball and his crosses are brilliant.</p>
              <p>"To score seven goals already is a great achievement."</p>
              <p>Ferguson believes the Ecuador winger will get even more as the season goes on, and they will be needed too as United chase a record fourth consecutive Premier League title.</p>
              <p>Aston Villa's stumble over the Christmas period seems to have turned the title battle into a three-horse race between United, Chelsea and Arsenal, who have a match in hand.</p>
              <p>"It is fairly close at the top," Rooney added. "Arsenal are up there as well and the team who is most consistent from now on will win the league."</p>
