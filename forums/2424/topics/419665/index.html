              <p>Manchester United's latest goalscoring sensation has revealed that the power of prayer is behind his dramatic rise to fame.</p>
              <p>Javier
                   Hernandez is a committed Christian who prays on the pitch before every 
                  game, to thank God for the helping realise his dreams.</p>
              <div>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">But the deep-thinking Mexican centre-forward is far from selfish in his demands on the almighty.</div>
              </div>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><br></div>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">
              <div>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">
              <p>Hernandez,
                   or Chico as he is known at Old Trafford, also asks before every match 
                  for God to look out for his team mates and the opposition, and keep them
                   from serious injury on the pitch.</p>
              <p>It certainly seems to work.</p>
              <p>The
                   20-year-old has burst on the scene with a remarkable nine goals already
                   in his debut season, the latest coming through a fine strike against 
                  Stoke on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>And the talented striker is not afraid to admit that his faith is a large part of his game.</p>
              <p>“I always pray on the pitch before a game. It is an important routine for me but it is not superstition,” he explained.</p>
              <p>“I
                   like to pray. I talk to God and I tell him to take care of the health 
                  of both teams because the worse thing for a sportsman are injuries and 
                  there are a lot of accidents on the pitch that nobody wants.</p>
              <p>“I like to ask God to take care of me, because he gave me the opportunity to play.”</p>
              <p>The
                   approach of Hernandez is refreshing in the cynical modern era of 
                  football. He seems unaffected by fame, despite his elevated status at 
                  Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>But he comes from good football stock. Both his 
                  father and grandfather played professional football in Mexico, and he 
                  admits that their experience has given him a perfect grounding to deal 
                  with the attention.</p>
              <p>United fans are already calling him the new 
                  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and while he admits that is massively flattering, 
                  he is not about to get carried away just yet.</p>
              <p>“Of course it is 
                  flattering, because Ole is is a legend at Manchester United. Usually 
                  people compare me to my dad or grandad,” he said. “I’m only 10 per cent 
                  of what Ole was. I need to work harder and keep improving to became like
                   him.</p>
              <p>“Obviously my dad and grandpa were both former players in 
                  Mexico but the biggest advice they give me is away from the pitch - to 
                  be careful of bad influences and bad people. I am their son and grandson
                   so naturally they want the best for me.</p>
              <p>“I am enjoying my life in
                   Manchester. My family have told me the fans have a new song about me 
                  [‘Chico is the man and he scores goals from anywhere’] I need to listen 
                  to the song and I need to thank the guy who wrote it.”</p>
              <p>While Hernandez refuses to get carried away by the inevitable hype surrounding him, United's manager is also impressed by him.</p>
              <p>Alex
                   Ferguson said: “The kid is a fantastic talent, and he is also very 
                  hungry to learn, which is impressive. He works hard in training and he 
                  picks things up quickly.</p>
              <p>“We have worked hard with him this 
                  season, and he has progressed. We keep saying to the strikers to get 
                  across the front post and Chici did that against Stoke, and got a reward
                   for it.</p>
              <p>“He picked up what we were working on, and he’s already 
                  good at doing that now, getting across the front post - and for all of 
                  us it was a pleasing finish.”</p>
              <p>Team-mate Nani, who returned to 
                  action for United on Tuesday after injury with a fine match-winning 
                  goal, insisted that the talent of the Mexican can help inspire the Red 
                  Devils towards an unbeaten season.</p>
              <p>United have still to lose in 
                  the Premier League after 20 matches, and the confident winger believes 
                  he and his team-mates have a chance to emulate Arsenal and become the 
                  new 'Invincibles' by going through the entire league campaign unbeaten.</p>
              <p>"“I hope we can," he said. "We are in a great position. We have been doing so well.</p>
              <p>“We
                   have to keep working hard and doing the same things. Providing we stay 
                  together I feel we will finish the season with something very special.</p>
              <p>“We
                   have some fine players, and Javier has had a great start to his 
                  Manchester United career.He always scores at the right moment, when we 
                  need it. He has been a key player this season.”</p>
