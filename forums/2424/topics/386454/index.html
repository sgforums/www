              <p><strong>Wes Brown feels Sunday's victory at Hull will give United the impetus to overcome Wigan this evening, and embark on a winning run over the coming weeks and months.</strong></p>
              <p>Amid an injury crisis which has, at one time or another, claimed almost every defensive member of the squad, the Reds have undergone patchy form in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>However, the return of a recognisable back four at the KC Stadium coincided with an important victory over the weekend, and Brown is keen for the champions to round off the year with three more points against Roberto Martinez's side.</p>
              <p>"We're in a confident mood now and hopefully we can keep that going against Wigan," he told <strong>MUTV</strong>. "We've got a good squad, me and Vida (Nemanja Vidic) are back now and we can hopefully go on a nice little run and keep winning."</p>
              <p>In an increasingly unpredictable season, the Reds are in touching distance of league leaders Chelsea, despite suffering five defeats in the opening half of the campaign.</p>
              <p>While Brown concedes that the number of twists and turns thus far have been unforseen, some rhythm and momentum can put the Reds on the road to a fourth straight title.</p>
              <p>"It's been a funny old season," he admitted. "Teams are losing games to everyone. Everyone's beating each other and now we've got to start winning and keep going."</p>

              <p>Michael Carrick is expecting far more convincing displays from <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> during the second half of the season.</p>
              <p>"We have not hit top form all season, especially at home," said Carrick. "We have just been doing enough to get through. We know we are better than that and now is the time to do it.</p>
              <p>"It is a busy time until the end of the season. We need to get a run going and start playing some good football.</p>
              <p>"We are in a good position in the league, we have the FA Cup coming up, we are through to the Champions League last 16 and reached the Carling Cup semi-finals. We have done as much as we can so far. Now is the time to really drive on and achieve things again. That is why we are here."</p>
              <p>Carrick is also relishing Manchester United's FA Cup tie with Leeds this weekend. "Experiencing those types of feisty atmospheres are why you play football," he said. "Rivalries like that add extra spice. It is great for the fans and good for the players.</p>
              <p>"No matter where you play, or whether the atmosphere is for or against you, it is a great feeling to play. Leeds are bringing a lot of fans and we are looking forward to it. It should be a cracking game."</p>
