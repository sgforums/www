              <p><strong>United may have beaten Wigan Athletic 4-0 on Saturday afternoon, but Sir Alex’s men won't spend too long reveling in the victory.</strong></p>
              <p>Instead, Darren Fletcher says attentions will turn immediately to games against Chelsea and Liverpool in a week the Scot admits could prove pivotal in the title race.</p>
              <p>“It’s a massive week,” he told <strong>MUTV</strong>. “We’ve already been away to Marseille and Wigan – we have four away games in a row – and now we’re down to two.</p>
              <p>“We know it’s going to be difficult because Chelsea and Liverpool are two big rivals of Manchester United. But we’ll prepare mentally and physically for those games.”</p>
              <p>On Saturday, the Reds weathered an early Wigan storm to lead at half-time before three goals in the final 16 minutes secured the three points. The scoreline, though, didn’t reflect the game’s true nature.</p>
              <p>“It was a difficult game and we knew it would be,” Fletcher said. “Wigan play open, expansive football. They have a go at you and have a lot of pace in attacking areas. Edwin van der Sar had to make three fantastic saves in the first half to keep us in the game.</p>
              <p>“We knew the longer the game went on our quality would shine through. We were endeavouring to get Chicharito in behind the defence so he could use his pace and that’s what happened. Wigan always attack, from the first minute to the last minute, and maybe that’s their downfall sometimes. But that’s the way their manager believes they should play and it means when you play against them you have to be wary at the back. But you also know that if you defend well then you can get chances on the counter-attack.”</p>
              <p>The win sent the Reds four points clear of Arsenal, who don’t have a Premier League fixture this weekend due to their involvement in the Carling Cup final. It’s a position Fletcher’s delighted with, and he says the league title is now United’s to lose.</p>
              <p>“There are 11 games left in the league and it’s in our hands. That’s all you can ask for at this stage of the season. You want to be up at the top of the league. When you’re behind you have to hope for other people to do you favours.”</p>
