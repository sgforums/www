            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Black night for Keane as Sunderland humiliated by Luton</span><br><br>The timing could not have been worse. Four days before his long-anticipated return to Manchester United, Roy Keane suffered his worst night as the manager of Sunderland. The Black Cats lost 3-0 away to League One side Luton and thus exited the League Cup at the second round stage, and Keane admitted this defeat hurt him. "This is my biggest disappointment since I arrived here," said the Irishman, who has been in charge at Sunderland exactly one year, but won't be celebrating this particular first anniversary. </strong><br><br>Keane took Sunderland to Premier League promotion in May and added: "Last year I was the best thing since sliced bread but I've only been a manager two minutes. It's how you respond to these things and I take full responsibility for this defeat."<br><br>The Irishman claimed he had not thought about his return to Manchester United, where he spent 12 successful years before leaving after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson in 2005. He would have loved to take his Sunderland side there in good form, but instead they have now only won once this term.<br><br>More worryingly, he pointed out: "We didn't do the basics right. But I pick the team and have to take responsibility for how they play. It's not a night to point fingers. We will have a look at this again."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sunderland manager Roy Keane continues to surround himself with familiar faces at the Stadium of Light, with former team-mates Danny Higginbotham and Ian Harte both joining the club alongside new Â£6million striker Kenwyne Jones today.<br><br>In a busy day of transfer of activity at the club, forward Stern John has gone in the opposite direction as Jones, joining Southampton. The trio of signings represent decisive action from the Black Cats boss as he pores over his team's 3-0 reverse at the hands of Championship side Luton in the Carling Cup second-round last night and take his tally of summer arrivals to 12.</strong><br><br>Jones, a 22-year-old Trinidad &amp; Tobago international, effectively went on strike last week after declaring he no longer wanted to play for the Saints and - although fellow Premiership newcomers Derby were reported to be interested - Sunderland made their move.<br><br>Keane told the club's website: 'I'm delighted that Kenwyne is a Sunderland player. He was very keen to join this club and that is always a good thing. 'He is a big strong boy who is quick and athletic too. He has real physical presence and is the type of player we've been missing.''<br><br>Defensive pair Higginbotham and Harte both played alongside their new manager before his retirement and join a growing number of former colleagues signed by the 36-year-old since his appointment a year ago.<br><br>Former Leeds full-back Harte, who has moved to Wearside on a free transfer after a successful trial, was a Republic of Ireland team-mate of Keane, who was at Manchester United at the same time as Higginbotham. The 28-year-old centre-half, who will cost Â£3million from Stoke, started his career at Old Trafford but made just seven senior appearances before leaving for Derby.<br><br>Manchester United alumni Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole, Liam Miller and Kieran Richardson have been united on Wearside, while defensive pair Stanislav Varga and Ross Wallace shared a pitch with their boss during his time with Celtic. Striker David Connolly and midfielder Graham Kavanagh, like Miller and Harte, played with Keane at international level. Keane has expressed his delight at agreeing terms with players he knows and trusts, with Harte signing a one-year deal and Higginbotham agreeing terms on a four-year contract.<br><br>Harte, 29, said: 'It's great to be back in the Premier League and I'm raring to go. I want to get playing as soon as possible. 'This is a good opportunity for me at a massive club like Sunderland and there are plenty of Irish lads here to make me feel welcome.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saturday's match will be the 122nd between United and Sunderland. Historically, the Reds have the upper hand, especially in recent years. Since the Premier League's inception, the Black Cats have yet to register a win at Old Trafford.</strong><br><br><strong>Form guide</strong>: After a dramatic opening-day win over Tottenham, Roy Keane's men have managed just one further point. Their last two league games have yielded nothing at all. Meanwhile, United registered a first win of the season last weekend. Luck may have smiled on the Reds, but after three games of total domination and little to show for it, a little luck was certainly due...<br><br><strong>Ins and outs</strong>: Sunderland will be without Dean Whitehead (knee) and Carlos Edwards (hamstring), while Kieran Richardson (back) is also a doubt. New signing Andrew Cole isn't match-fit yet but defender Paul McShane (head) should start, despite not featuring in the Black Cats' midweek Carling Cup tie. United fans may see Brazilian midfielder Anderson for the first time, while Louis Saha is tipped for a spot on the bench. Cristiano Ronaldo (suspended) and Wayne Rooney (foot) are still out, as is skipper Gary Neville (thigh).<br><br><strong>Star men</strong>: Owen Hargreaves is already showing signs that he'll flourish in the Reds' midfield, while Sunderland goalkeeper and record signing Craig Gordon will need to continue his recent good form if the visitors are to cause an Old Trafford upset.</div>

Having worked in tandem for so long, the pair will meet as touchline rivals for the first time tomorrow when Keane takes promoted Sunderland to Old Trafford.</strong><br><br>He returns with a rapidly growing reputation, but after helping guide his former charge during the difficult first few months of his new job, Sir Alex has told Keane he must learn to adapt to a fast-changing game if he is to survive. "Roy and I have a good relationship and I still get plenty of texts off him," Ferguson said. "He has done great at Sunderland. "He has the basic ingredients to succeed. He's intelligent, strong-minded and can make a decision, which is a great start. What he does not have is experience and the time factor that would allow him to settle into the job. He did a fantastic job getting them up but he's in the big pool now, swimming with sharks.<br><br>"I spoke to him several times about becoming a manager and he started taking his coaching badges while he was a player here. He asked me for advice once or twice when he first started. "But I gave him the best advice before he left here. In this game there are a lot of things you can't accept but you have to find a way around it because things change and it's an emotional game. "It's important to understand the new money coming into football and the new type of owners and chairmen. New managers are integrated into all that but over the last few years I've seen things that, as a young man, I would have exploded at. "I wouldn't have accepted some of the things going on today but somehow you must have the patience to wait and use your experience at the right time. Jumping in as I would have done a few years ago would have created even more problems."<br><br>Ferguson, 65, accepts he was forced to change once he decided to remain in charge at United after initially planning to retire at 60. "I was getting a bit obsessed at that time and developed my interest in horses," he added. "If I hadn't done that I don't think I could have carried on. I had to learn to delegate. "Roy said to me: 'You've changed', but I told him you have to change or you'll kill yourself. I've definitely softened but I'll still react if someone gets my back up."<br><br>Notoriously dismissive of the high-profile lifestyle of some modern players, Ferguson admits even he got sucked into flaunting the trappings of wealth when he went to watch son Darren's Peterborough side last week. "I got a helicopter the other day," he added. "Mick Phelan (the United coach) reminded me I was the one who used to go off my head when anyone else used helicopters and private planes. "But I told him: 'Mick, when you get to my age, you're not going to drive to Peterborough when you're in a hurry'."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saha should face Black Cats</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson expects Louis Saha to be involved in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Sunderland at Old Trafford.<br><br>The French striker was pencilled in to play some part against Tottenham last weekend, only to be left out of the final 16-man squad. After another intensive week of training, however, Sir Alex has revealed that he should feature against Roy Keane's Black Cats.<br><br>"Louis is such an important player for us," Sir Alex told his pre-match press conference. "I don't think he'll start, but he can be a very important player if he comes on. He gives us another option, there needs to be more of a cutting edge about our game."<br><br>The 29-year-old striker has not appeared for United since a substitute cameo in May's defeat to AC Milan, and has been recuperating from a knee injury all summer.<br><br>Fellow injury victim Anderson could also feature on Saturday, having trained after suffering a hamstring strain earlier this month.<br><br>The Brazilian could make his United debut after arriving in a summer transfer from Porto, and he has impressed his new manager with his commitment to succeeding in England.<br><br>"I'm really pleased with Anderson's development over the last couple of weeks in terms of his training," said Sir Alex, who also confirmed that Gary Neville will not be fit in time for Saturday's match.<br><br>It'll be Roy Keane's first visit to Old Trafford as a manager having steered the Black Cats to the Championship crown last season. Still worshipped by United fans following his 12-year career with the Reds, Sir Alex fully expects the former skipper to be granted a special welcome on Saturday.<br><br>"He'll get a great reception," insisted the boss. "That's one of the things that makes me so proud to be manager of this football club. The reception our fans give to former players who come back to Old Trafford, both as a player and a manager, tells you what a great club we are.<br><br>"You only need to look at the ovations they've given Bryan Robson, Andy Cole, Teddy Sheringham, Mark Hughes and Steve Bruce, it'll be the same for Roy on Saturday."<br><br></div>
