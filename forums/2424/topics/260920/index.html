The Manchester United chiefÂ’s chilling warning comes as the fixtures for the next campaign are revealed today.<br><br>Every manager outside Old Trafford will have a bead of sweat when they see their names etched next to UnitedÂ’s. Last season, FergieÂ’s men blew away all before them and he came desperately close to another Treble.<br><br>Right now, the Scot is shuffling his pack to produce another season flushed with success. And he has the confidence in his United aces to know they will come up trumps once more.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“This United team is growing together. It is young enough to improve.<br><br>Â“There is a great appetite and enthusiasm among this group of players.<br><br>Â“They are growing together, they trust each other and I trust in what they can do.<br><br>Â“I trust them, especially when they have had a setback. They have the character to pick themselves up and deliver the right response.Â”<br><br>Ferguson was full of praise for Alan Smith last season. But in an interview in yesterdayÂ’s SunSport, it was clear Smith was growing impatient over what the future holds for him. The United striker snapped after being told he will not be getting a new four-year contract. Smith, who has two years left on his current deal, said: Â“If they are going to sell me, IÂ’d like to know.Â”<br><br>Ferguson got 23 goals each out of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo last season. But he is still looking for a new out-and-out striker as Smith does not appear to be that man.<br><br>He is more likely to be used as a bargaining tool as Fergie bids to get the men he really wants.<br><br>United are eyeing TottenhamÂ’s Dimitar Berbatov and are also considering Inter MilanÂ’s Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic.<br><br>That desire to land a new top- quality striker is by no means bordering on panic.<br><br>Particularly as Ferguson heard good news yesterday about hitman Louis SahaÂ’s condition.<br><br>The Frenchman has been plagued by injuries and another knee problem looked like ruling him out of the start of next season.<br><br>But his representatives, The Stellar Group, last night assured United fans he was well on the mend.<br><br>A statement read: Â“Louis had an exploratory operation and that went very well.<br><br>Â“It wasnÂ’t surgery as such and they didnÂ’t go into the knee fully. It was more than successful.<br><br>Â“He has been in rehab in the South of France for two weeks now and has been having treatment every day.<br><br>Â“Louis is getting his head down and working to be fit for the start of the season.<br><br>Â“In his mind, he is looking to be starting like everyone else for the opening to the new term.<br><br>Â“He expects to be ready when UnitedÂ’s campaign begins.Â”<br><br>A fit and firing Saha can only add to the armoury already at FergusonÂ’s disposal.<br>Ferguson again has the perfect blend of youth, experience and seasoned professionals.<br><br>United have added to that mixture with a Â£50million outlay this summer.<br><br>The youth has come in the form of Brazilian midfielder Anderson, 19, from Porto and Portuguese winger Nani, 20, from Sporting Lisbon.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“I think with young players looking to achieve something, youÂ’ve got an energy and desire.Â”<br><br>There will certainly be no lack of desire in his other summer signing.<br><br>Holding midfielder Owen Hargreaves finally arrived from German giants Bayern Munich for Â£17m.<br><br>And he brings plenty of know-how after winning a Champions League medal and his international experience with England.<br><br>But, despite welcoming in the new, Fergie is not about to cast out the old.<br><br>Indeed, he sees his two 34-year-old multi-medalled campaigners as the key to knitting everything together again at Old Trafford.<br><br>Winger Ryan Giggs and midfielder Paul Scholes enjoyed a red-hot Indian summer last season.<br><br>And Ferguson believes there is plenty of football left in the old dogs yet to help in the transition of this scorching side.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“The experience of Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs will be vital over the next two seasons.Â”<br><br>Comparisons will be made again next season as to how this latest group will rank in the pantheon of Fergie footballing armies. The United manager reckons comparison should not be made due to the cosmopolitan nature of the current side.<br><br>He said: Â“I donÂ’t think this set of players is like the previous two teams at all.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s different altogether. There are a lot of foreign players in the side now and, in that sense, the make-up is so different. It is a real mix of nationalities.<br><br>Â“Football has changed in that way and the Premiership has gone down that route.<br><br>Â“So, when building a new team, youÂ’ve got more work to do in terms of getting the side to gel, getting that understanding and spirit of Manchester United.<br><br>Â“I think once the foreign players get inside the club and they understand the history, it seeps through to them and they become Manchester United players.<br><br>Â“The make-up of the side makes this one different to the previous two but all three had that same desire and winning mentality.Â”<br><br>That winning mentality is set to be in evidence again next season.<br><br>The Manchester United date is one all fans look forward to.<br><br>But for the other Premiership managers, it is a different matter altogether.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Long live SAF, born a legend always a legend!</span></div>
