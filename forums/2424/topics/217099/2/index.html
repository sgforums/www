I know his Man u career didn't start too well since he came in mid-season and from another country but he, like Fletcher... they seem to be playing their best football for united lately. He is faster and he add speed into their attack... Found Heinze a bit slow when he came on...

Carrick was never bought as a replacement for keane... that job was probably meant for hargreaves. Carrick was probably bought for his passing skills. Man u play a game with lots of passing so a player like him is invaluable, although i think he still needs to improve on his speed alittle. Looking at Evra and Vidic, i guess he also needed a little time to settle into fergie's style of play.<br><br>Last season was really bad for united... too many injuries for them. Heinze was out from Sep and never played again that season, G Neville also injured, Brown also couldn't play in the earlier half until Keane had to play as a central defender as Vidic &amp; Evra wasn't in yet remember? And to make matters worst, Scholes had an eye problem that prevented him from playing his usual game...

            <div class='col-md body'>the key was that SAF recognised MUFC strength and played to that  -&gt; fast, one-touch passing to open up Bolton. As seen, in the first 20mins, Bolton just were sitting ducks..<br><br>Like per all said, Scholes is like a new signing. He doesn't need to say much. But you know he will be charging at enemies taking indirect free kicks. You know his temper will boil over when MUFC seems to be pressed back and he will unleash one of his mistimed tackles, to state a message, "I am here, don't mess around!" and boy, does that always seems to wake everyone's ideas.<br><br>Did anyone noticed Scholes lashing out after the corner when Faye got a free header?<br><br>Now, MUFC is playing with high energy and with Rooney peaking now, it is a good sign. Kudos to Saha for assisting Ronaldo for the 3rd goal, rather than blasting that. Cause that goal killed Bolton off and the game is gift-wrapped.<br><br>We do have Fletcher, peaking too. Yes, he is a scots and blah blah,<br>But those who saw his game vs Liverpool, would have kept their mouth shut. Rem, he is only 22, but he is maturing fast.<br><br>At the back, now, we got ample backups for all position. And when Bolton was heaving those missiles (set-plays), all credit to MUFC for finally emerging with a clean sheet. I was wondering when JOShea is coming in to lend his height. And rightfully,we got him in later.<br>No Nonsense Vidic complement Rio very well. One classly, one just does his clean up work. Another fact, when's the last time, since MUFC central defenders both have goals to their credit in a season?<br><br>Moving ahead, if we want to do well in League and UCL, we need better cover in MF and Forwards. If we get OwenH and even Torres in, then we are more complete. But just a wish_list.<br><br>One last point, we need to ensure scoring comes from all angles and not just Saha and Rooney. That will make our team unpredictable, and dangerous.<br><br>Currently, chelsea has only a few goal scorers.<br>When the last time, you hear of a robben goal? or even John Terry, or Ricardo? Doesn't that amaze you? Yes, Lampard, Ballack and Drogba...<br>Somewhere, the mechanics does not seems right.<br><br>And we need to leverage on that, cause once put under pressure, then we can see the cracks.<br><br>Nov 25 or 26, is when we entertain Chelsea. Let's keep on this form, and see what the current champion can put up or pave the way for our coronation.<br><br></div>
