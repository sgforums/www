               United's owners are £1.1bn in debt - £400m more than previously known -
               after borrowing extensively against their shopping mall business.
              <br> <br>BBC Panorama has found evidence that the Glazer family's debt levels
               may threaten their hold on the club.
              <br> <br>A spokesman for the American family has said it holds more than £2bn
               in assets.
              <br> <br>But the extent of the debt owed by the Glazers is likely to fuel a 
              continuing revolt by some supporters, who oppose their ownership of the 
              club.
              <br>Green and gold
              <br> <br>Details of the financial arrangements of the owners also come at a 
              time when the sport's governing bodies are facing questions about 
              Premier League debts that have reached a combined total of £3.4bn and 
              the growing popularity of leveraged buyouts in English clubs.

              <br> <br> These are people who tell us not to worry about Manchester 
              United debt because they are great businessmen. In their core business 
              in the US they got it absolutely wrong
              <br> <br>Andy Green City Analyst and Man U supporter
              <br> <br>Mortgage documents seen by the BBC show that the Glazers have 
              borrowed £388m ($570m) against shopping malls and £66m ($95m) against 
              their American National Football League team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
              <br> <br>In addition to their mortgages in the US, a portion of the Glazer 
              family's £700m Manchester United debt will soon see them charged 
              interest at a rate of 16.25%.
              <br> <br>Fans fear that, despite the club's record of success on the pitch, 
              the Glazers' leveraged buy-out of United has saddled the club with debt 
              and that may mean that there is no spare money in the future to buy a 
              new generation of star players.
              <br> <br>Disappointed fans have launched the "green and gold" campaign that 
              resurrects the original team colours in protest over the Glazers' 
              ownership.
              <br> <br>Their numbers have reached 158,000 and former United star David 
              Beckham has signalled his support.
              <br> <br>They point to the £80m sale of star striker Cristiano Ronaldo last 
              year and note that he has not been replaced by a player of similar 
              quality. Yet ticket prices have gone up by more than a third.
              <br> <br>The club's management denies any lack of commitment to buying new 
              talent and says that cash is available for Sir Alex Ferguson to buy 
              players.
              <br> <br>A spokesman for the Glazers confirmed that the family does have 
              debts of at least a £1bn, but added they have assets worth more than 
              double that.
              <br>Negative equity
              <br> <br>City analyst Andy Green, 37, is the disgruntled Manchester United 
              supporter who first uncovered the extent of the Glazers' debts.
              <br> <br>Mr Green said: "They borrowed more money at inflated valuations 
              right at the top of the cycle.
              <br> <br>"These are people who tell us not to worry about Manchester United 
              debt because they are great businessmen. In their core business in the 
              US they got it absolutely wrong."
              <br>Man U's Nani The Glazers have defended their ownership of the team
              <br> <br>The debt levels at the club are also drawing the attention of other 
              prominent football figures.
              <br> <br>Dave Whelan, Chairman of Wigan Athletic, told Panorama: "I don't 
              think anybody can be satisfied with how Manchester United are being 
              run... they have got somewhere in the order of three-quarters of a 
              billion pounds worth of debt. That has got to be eliminated and 
              eliminated quickly."
              <br> <br>The Glazer family's main assets are the shopping centre business in 
              America, First Allied Corporation, along with Manchester United and the 
              Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
              <br> <br>First Allied is a private business and its accounts are not publicly
               available. But Mr Green discovered that the Glazers' shopping mall 
              mortgages had been bundled with other loans as Commercial Mortgage 
              Backed Securities.
              <br> <br>Those bundles are publicly traded and therefore require the Glazers 
              to provide detailed information on all the mortgages, which are then 
              publicly available in the US.
              <br> <br>Mr Green found mortgages - confirmed by the BBC - on 63 of 64 First 
              Allied shopping centres, totalling £388m ($570m).
              <br> <br>Most of those were taken out with Lehman Brothers before the US 
              investment banking giant went bankrupt, triggering the global banking 
              crisis in 2008.
              <br>'Watch list'
              <br> <br>While Lehmans collapsed, the Glazers' mortgage debt lived on and 
              many of those shopping centres are not generating enough income to keep 
              up with interest payments.
              <br> <br>With falling commercial property values, many are also now in 
              negative equity.
              <br> <br>Banks have put 28 of the shopping centres on a watch list, meaning 
              they are worried about the loans.
              <br> <br>Four shopping centres - one each in Ohio, New Mexico, Texas and 
              Georgia - have already gone bankrupt.
              <br> <br>When they bought Manchester United in 2005, the Glazer family 
              borrowed £500m and paid the remaining £272 million in cash.
              <br> <br>Mr Green found that the Glazers had remortgaged 25 of their shopping
               centres in the six months before the takeover.
              <br> <br>He believes the family borrowed against their US properties to pay 
              for United: "At the time when they had to present a huge amount of cash 
              over here in the UK they borrowed a huge amount of extra money in the US
               and publicly they didn't buy anything else that year."
              <br> <br>A spokesman for the family did not respond to questions about the 
              mortgages taken out by First Allied.
              <br> <br>But with properties now worth £378m ($555m) but mortgages valued at 
              £388m ($570m), the shopping mall company now appears to be worth next to
               nothing.
              <br>'Commercial expertise'
              <br> <br>That financial picture has analyst Mr Green questioning how the 
              Glazers will service their £1.1bn debt.
              <br>A green and gold supporter sells scarves Fans are wearing green and 
              gold in protest over the Glazers' ownership
              <br> <br>United chief executive, David Gill, has said: "We're very confident 
              the business model we have in place will ensure the club can continue to
               compete at the top of football for many years to come.
              <br> <br>"The owners have been true to their word since they took over the 
              club in 2005. They've brought commercial expertise and commercial 
              benefit to us in a numbers of areas, and we've seen our revenues grow 
              significantly."
              <br> <br>The Glazers' most troublesome debts are held by Red Football, the 
              parent company that owns Manchester United.
              <br> <br>They are payment in kind loans, or PIKs, worth £200m and the 
              interest owing on them will soon rise to 16.25%.
              <br> <br>Mr Gill told the BBC in January: "We don't worry about the PIK 
              repayment. That's nothing to with the club."
              <br> <br>A spokesman for Manchester United told the BBC last week that the 
              club stands behind Mr Gill's assertion that the debts will be repaid 
              without involving the club.
              <br> <br>But sources close to the Glazers have confirmed that Red Football 
              will use cash from Manchester United to pay off the PIKs in the future. 
              The Glazers are said to be "comfortable" with the PIKs.
              <br> <br>The situation at Manchester United reflects the wider issue within 
              the Premier League, where clubs like Liverpool and West Ham are 
              struggling with huge debts and FA Cup finalists Portsmouth barely staved
               off bankruptcy.
              <br> <br>Both the Premier League and the FA declined requests for interviews 
              on the subject of debt in football.
