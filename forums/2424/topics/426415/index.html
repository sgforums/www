              <p>not sure how reliable this is, but here's the news</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/leagues/english-premiership/manchester-united">Manchester United</a></abbr> have struck terms with <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/leagues/spanish-liga/atletico-madrid">Atletico Madrid</a></abbr> for goalkeeper David De Gea, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p><em>Sport</em> says the deal is all but done for the 20 year-old shot-stopper, who will move to Old Trafford for €20 million.</p>
              <p>Talks were held between the two clubs in England yesterday. Both Atletico and De Gea have approved the transfer.</p>
              <p>De Gea now only needs to pass a medical and for all contracts to be signed for the deal to be closed.</p>
              <p>Atletico chose to cash in on De Gea as they need funds to carry out their plans of a major squad overhaul in the summer.</p>

              <p>true, but it is good to get someone in with a clean history, and given he is young, eager to prove and do well. Reina is proven but maybe some baggages.. And as per some already mentioned, Pool will play hard ball.</p>

              <p>If this is true, I really doubt De Gea will get much first team play. I think Ferguson may go ahead and get ANOTHER keeper.</p>
              <p>We might see Kuszack leave then.</p>

              <p>If Reina starts banging table and said he wants to go to United,
              there is very little Pool can do... But of course there must first
              be an offer from United lah...</p>
              <p>Even if Pool can't stand the thought of letting him join United,
              just the thought of him keeping goal for them next seasons
              will send shiver down their necks... Later he not happy

              <p>I beg to differ, Heinze did exactly that but he didnt get what he wanted did he? Of course you can argue that Heinze is barking up the wrong tree (aka Fergie) but given similar situation, I doubt Dalglish would allow his player to join their fiercest arch-rival. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Maarten Skeletenburg hasn't have experience in other Leagues yet, the Ajax Amstertam is an equivalent to the Tottenham hotspurs in the BPL and he has been sticking there for most of his career. For me I personally feel it is a big leap and he is not tried in other leagues. Ditto for De Gea as he is too young. Rene Adler might be a suitable candidate, Manuel Neuer has to prove himself by playing in other leagues, no use when he is not interested in stepping out of the Bundesliga.</p></div>

              <div class="date">March 31, 2011</div>

              <div class="subhead"><span class="page-actions"> <cite class="source"> <br></cite> </span></div>
              <p>Manchester United have held talks over the signing of Atletico Madrid goalkeeper <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/108482/david-de-gea?cc=5739">David de Gea</a>, according to the player's agent.</p>

              <div style="width: 275px;"><cite>PA Photos</cite>David De Gea: €20 million release clause</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/897462/manchester-united-parent-firm-post-L108.9m-losses?cc=5739"></a></strong></p>
              <p>United's current No. 1, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8884/Edwin-van-der-Sar">Edwin van der Sar</a>, will retire at the end of the season and De Gea is one of the star names pencilled in to replace the out-going Dutchman.</p>
              <p>De Gea, 20, has established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper at Atletico ahead of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/111613/Sergio-Asenjo">Sergio Asenjo</a> since breaking into the first team in 2009 and has been watched by United goalkeeping coach Eric Steele on numerous occasions. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> also saw De Gea in action when Atletico played Valencia in September last year.</p>
              <p>With
               reports circulating that United have made a £17.5 million offer for the
               Spain U-21 international, his agent, Hector Rincon, revealed that the 
              Premier League leaders have been in contact and that their offer would 
              meet De Gea's release clause.</p>
              <p>"Well, we did have talks with 
              Manchester United but, first of all, they always look for an agreement 
              with the club," Hector Rincon told <em>sport.co.uk</em>. "Anyway, most of the biggest European teams have shown interest in David de Gea."</p>
              <p>Asked
               if Atletico would be willing to part with their highly-rated 
              goalkeeper, Rincon said: "You would have to ask the club. What I can 
              tell you is that his release clause now is €20 million, but I have no 
              idea if the club would sell him for less.</p>
              <p>"Right now, the player 
              has a contract with Atletico Madrid and if Manchester United or any 
              other team want him they will have to reach an agreement or pay the 
              whole release clause."</p>
              <p>Rincon also reiterated - as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=731584&amp;sec=transfers&amp;cc=5739">he told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em> last year</a> -  that Wigan Athletic once made an offer for De Gea and that recently all the top clubs in England have shown an interest.</p>
              <p>"Well,
               some time ago, before he became an important player in Atletico, Wigan 
              made an offer, but the club rejected it," the agent said. "Recently, I 
              don't want to say any names but all the big clubs in England and in 
              Europe have asked about him."</p>
