              Paul Scholes believes United are well equipped to cope with the run-in...
              
              There are going to be some tense moments and some tough games coming up because we have quite a difficult run-in.
              
              That said, weâ€™ve had difficult finishes in the past and that has seemed to spur us on. Hopefully it will be the same story again this year.
              
              May will be a nerve-wracking month, but this is what you want, you want to be successful at the end of the season and you want to win trophies. Weâ€™ve had a great season so far but, other than the Carling Cup and Club World Cup, weâ€™ve not achieved anything else. Weâ€™ve put ourselves in a good position, but thatâ€™s all weâ€™ve done. We need to finish the job now.
              
              I know I wonâ€™t be playing in all the games, I just have to be ready when the games come along, and make sure that Iâ€™m prepared properly. Then if the manager picks me, Iâ€™m ready. 
              
              Itâ€™s massively important that we keep everyone available. Touch wood, but I donâ€™t think weâ€™re too far off now. There are a few bumps and bruises here and there, but youâ€™d expect that at this stage of the season.
              
              We do have a big squad, and as weâ€™ve said throughout the season, other players need to be able to step in and do the job. So far, for the majority of the time, I think weâ€™ve been able to do that.
              
              Once you get to the last few weeks itâ€™s a case of ticking over. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™ll be too much physical work, itâ€™s more about keeping what youâ€™ve got and saving most of your energy for the games.
              
              There are a few games that are very tough. City at home is a difficult game, as we saw last year when we were poor and lost. Arsenal, obviouslyâ€¦ but Wiganâ€™s not an easy place to go to and Hull could be fighting for their lives on the last day of the season.
              
              I think itâ€™s better that we know every game is going to be tough. Weâ€™re not going into any game expecting a walkover, so that should concentrate the minds in the right way.
              
              I think every team that plays United battles for their lives, really. They want the scalp of beating us. With regards to that, every team that faces us is going to want to beat us. At Old Trafford or wherever we go, weâ€™re up against teams who want to get one over on us to get themselves some credit.
              
              I think weâ€™re ready for that all year round anyway. Nothing changes with this last few games, and hopefully weâ€™re strong enough to come through it all.
