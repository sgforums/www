              <p>honestly speaking, when SAF buys someone, he only see them in action a couple of times, most of the times, the scouts see them. So when he appears, the players played superbly.</p>
              <p>I think SAF is always trying to get players who can play two roles well, so in case of need, can rotate. Some of the flops mentioned, can't do that, and hence got shipped out.</p>

              <p>Hargreaves - Hasn't disappointed when he plays. But too injury prone, can fight with Foster for most appearances on treatment table.</p>

              <p><br>No lah, just this season only... Last season he was ok mah... I still have image in my mind of him scoring that important free-kick against Arsenal to win us the match while under pressure from Chelsea... The Arsenal players were expecting Ronaldo to hit it as he was standing beside him then Owen took it to their surprise... lol</p>
              <p>Next season, after his knee operation, I believe he will come back a better player... Its like United will have another "new" quality player added to their midfield...</p>
              <p>Anderson... Looks like he is getting better... But still only 21, so lots of room for improvements...</p>
              <p>Foster I am not too sure about him... I think PIG could be better actually only he is not an Englishman...</p>

              <p>Wow, I went to dig some websites and actually found out he played thrice this season.</p>
              <p>One was against Villareal(Sept 17) at home, the other Chelsea(Sept21) away. One substitute appearance against Liverpool(Sept 13) away.</p>

              <p>P Neville, Laurent Blanc, Saha shouldn't even be on that list of yours... Blanc did rather well helping United win the EPL title in his second season... He was also a very cool defender... I believe Rio learnt a lot from him cos I somehow find Rio's style quite similar to his then...</p>
              <p>Another one is Saha... Although injury prone, he contributed a lot to them winning the 2006/07 season's title during a time when Roon and Ron were coming of age only...  Fergie bench Rvn due to Saha's top form... It was then that Rvn and Fergie didn't get along... Cos Saha was scoring more goals and performing better than Ruud, and Fergie drop him in favour of Saha.</p>
              <p>The likes of Fortune, P Neville also don't deserve to be called flops... They are very much what Fletcher is to United today... They were utility players asked to cover different positions when the team needed... only difference is they were not in a great side like what Fletcher has now...</p>
              <p>Veron and Alan Smith well, while Veron was there, he played many games... and they did win the premiership title too with him in the squad... and the return they got for him $15m isn't too bad either... So I can see it otherwise. Smith, he came and left at about the same price... So its ok, and we can see he really did tried very hard... Many United fans still like him...</p>
              <p>The others like Chadwick, Richardson were like from their youth team, didn't cost much, if anything, they made handsome profits for the club somemore... Good to have more of these type of players, how can you call them flops... lol</p>
              <p>Liam Miller, he was signed as a free so its still ok, nvm.</p>
              <p>Only ones I can agree on your list are Kleberson, Djemba Djemba and the Italian keeper... But Taibi had a great debut leh, even getting man of the match award for his great performance helping United win Liverpool... For this we forgive him... lol</p>

              <p>I still think P.Neville is a flop..<br><br>When he play behind Irwin, when sub on, still ok not much effect.<br><br>when he play as first team.. Knn always crucial time kena yellow card next match cannot play.<br><br><br>Fortune IS a flop!!! His style is never suited for EPL... Maybe Laliga or bundesliga better...<br><br>Alan smith only score 1 goal in an entire season!!!! =(<br>Then Alex fergurson says to the media, he will be the fitting piece to the winning ways, he broke his leg....<br><br><br>and i fucking hate players who break leg for minor competition for country and unble to play for club the entire season!<br><br><br>P.S. I still think chadwick very lousy... but money wise i duno how much sold for but like what u said shld be cheap..</p>

              <p>I cant agree on P.Neville being a flop too.</p>
              <p>The season before he left Utd, he had some stellar performances in the "destroyer" role in midfield. Most notably was the 2-0 victory against Arsenal which ended their 49 match unbeaten run.</p>

              <p><br>If you happen to have watched United long enough (as I did), try recalling games like the one away to West Ham on the final day of 94/95 or the home leg against Dortmund in 96/97 (CL semi-finals). He was just too profligate and Hoddle was right to justify not picking him for England for that.</p>
              <p>I don't think the goalscoring statistics prove anything in this instance - even Ole Gunnar Solskajer had a more prolific strikerate (when you consider the amount of time - measured in minutes - he played) in '99. For me, the fact he went on to break Denis Law's european goalscoring record (which was later broken by van Nistelrooy playing in a far more mediocre team) just goes to show how strong United had been during his time (the midfield quadrumvirate comprising of Giggs, Scholes, Keane and Beckham in particular).</p>
              <p>Moreover, you've got to start wondering how is it any decent player who was a prominent regular starter for Man Utd (especially during '99) for almost a decade never really made the grade at international level - there must be more to it than the statistics.</p>
              <p>Personally, Cole's just peerless as far as being the worst United player I have seen - he's just in a league of his own...</p>

              <p>aiya flop also make much more money than u all...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
              <p>Rendering them a flop is for us to decide anyway..At least they don the Man utd jersey...at least they entered the theatre of dreams..at least they shook hands with bobby charlton, SAF, giggs, etc..at least they travel to many countries and face numerous superstars..</p>
              <p>while we here gaze at posters of giggs, SAF, ronaldo dreaming to shake their hands..wear their replica jerseys proudly as though we are one of them..parading them at the local run down small grass patch as though its OT..displaying skills on fifa 2009 like we are one of them...</p>
              <p>haiz..at least be proud of them to have contributed albeit a small part to where Man utd is now..</p>

              I can name past flops during the early years of fergie reign.
              
              Jim Leighton (dropped for the 90 fa cup replay)
              
              Neil Web (was great for forest, but when joined Man Utd, couldnt re-produce the form that made him great at forest. Fergie suspected it was the broken leg he sustained during england vs sweden world cup qualifier in 1989 and he never recapture the same form, was sold in 92)

              <p>klberson is a flop...he shone during the world cup (dunno why) and SAF bought him - thereafter he kicked Viera's ass during the Community Shield - that was the last I heard of him i think.</p>
              <p>There is another one - David Bellion - bought from Sunderland - I don' t know what SAF see in him - but he was promptly shipped out to neverland...</p>
              <p>Mark Bosnich is another flop, everytime he tries to clear the ball from the penalty box, i get cold sweat because chances are, he will commit a boo-boo.  He is also weak on high balls too...</p>
              <p>Barthez and Blanc - i think they are not too bad lah.  Blanc was bad in the first season, thereafter, he proved his mettle.  There was once criticism about his defending because he was walking instead of running but I think SAF defended him saying he reads his game well.</p>
              <p>Another flop - Luke Chadwick - the once heir to David Beckham but then a word for this chap - David Beckham then was on the teamsheet always for the right side midfielder - this poor chap has hardly the chance to prove himself. </p>
              <p>Kieron Richardson is another flop that comes to my mind....he is credited to sinking Sunderland now....haha.</p>
              <p>Forlan - I don't think he is 100% flop because when he went to Spain, he flourish - its just that perhaps the play in BPL does not suit him</p>
              <p>But for Veron - its different, after he went to Chelsea, he still cannot make it...so, flop.</p>
              <p>Alan Smith - I won't be very critical because remember there was a season where SAF has almost all his strikers injured and Alan Smith was the only one fit, he was scoring 1-0 wins for Man U for a few matches, earning the nick - super sub.</p>
              <p>I think another flop = Wes brown - at his peak, he was scoring own goals for pleasure and thereafter gets injured big time.</p>
