              <p><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED SET TO SPEND £15M ON NEW GOALIE</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><br>The unexpected announcement in The Times is that 'Manchester United are on the verge of agreeing a deal to sign David De Gea, the Spain Under-21 goalkeeper, from Atlético Madrid in January.'<br><br>De Gea has been generally only mentioned in passing as a potential successor to Edwin van der Sar, but The Times reckons that 'talks are at an advanced stage after several weeks of negotiations, with United expected to pay a fee in the region of £15 million for the 20-year-old. It was unclear last night whether De Gea would join United in January or see out the season at Atlético before formally completing a move to Old Trafford in the summer.'<br><br>However, there's also a suggestion that United could sign a second goalkeeper:<br><br>'Tomasz Kuszczak seems unlikely to remain at Old Trafford beyond the summer, so United could make a move for a second goalkeeper and retain a firm interest in Anders Lindegaard. The 6ft 4in Denmark player, 26, plies his trade with Aalesund in Norway and has already drawn comparisons to his compatriot, Peter Schmeichel, the former United goalkeeper.'<br></p>

              <p>The Manchester United boss has tracked 26-year-old Lindegaard since July and is close to agreeing a deal with Lindegaard's club Aalesunds.</p>
              <p>The Norwegian side's chairman Bjarne Haagensen flew to Manchester yesterday for talks over the move. And in a shock twist last night, Aalesunds' official website accidentally announced the transfer was complete.</p>

              <p><strong>It was soon deleted but the statement, which only needed key details adding, said: "AaFK and Manchester United have agreed Anders Lindegaard's switch. </strong></p>
              <p>"The agreement was signed recently and it is a dream come true for the Dane. "He'll will be ready to play for the Red Devils from ..... and the contract lasts until ..... "We wish Anders every success and happiness in Manchester and thank him for a brilliant effort!"</p>
              <p>Lindegaard is expected to hold talks over personal terms before undergoing a medical in Manchester later this month.</p>
              <p>With current United No1 Edwin van der Sar expected to retire at the end of the season, Ferguson has been searching for a replacement.</p>
              <p>He was linked with a move for Atletico Madrid's Spanish Under-21 keeper David de Gea.</p>
              <p>However, Lindegaard is seen as the more experienced and cheaper option. He has four caps for Denmark and kept a clean sheet as they played out a goalless draw with Czech Republic on Wednesday.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel believes the club's prospective new goalkeeper, Anders Lindegaard, is not ready for regular Barclays Premier League action.</strong></p>
              <p>United were last night on the verge of completing a £3.5million deal for 26-year-old Denmark star Lindegaard, who is expected in Manchester for a medical this weekend.</p>
              <p>He has recently been playing for Aalesund in Norway and it is thought Lindegaard is being signed as a future No 1, rather than an immediate replacement for Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>Certainly Schmeichel thinks his countryman does not have the right calibre or experience.</p>
              <p>Asked if Lindegaard had the necessary quality, Schmeichel said: 'No. We are talking about Manchester United here.</p>
              <p>'You can look at talent, you can look at young, good players. You don't want that. You want someone who can go in straight away and give performances in 80 per cent of the games the No 1 keeper will play for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>'Too many goalkeepers have been in and out of the doors. Now, for this team to win trophies, that position has to be someone who is of the very, very highest quality but also with the right experience.'</p>

              <h2>Yes, but who is he?</h2>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">So, Manchester United are replacing Edwin van der Sar with some guy nobody outside Scandinavia has heard of, right?</p>
              <p>Wrong. Anders Lindegaard has won five caps for Denmark. And anyway, he is not expected to replace Van der Sar as soon as he arrives in January.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But he is hardly young at 26. He'd better improve quickly if he wants to be the next Peter Schmeichel.</span></p>
              <p>Funny you should say that because Anders grew up as a United fan and Schmeichel was his hero. However, he is more like Van der Sar in his style and stature - 6ft 4in and gangly.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else?</span></p>
              <p>He played under Bruce Rioch at Odense before the arrival of former United keeper Roy Carroll forced him to move on. Since then he has been at Aalesund in Norway.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blimey, is that it?</span></p>
              <p>It's fair to say this guy has been under the radar for most of his career but keepers develop late. He is known in Denmark as commanding, brave and a bit crazy. Sounds a bit like his new manager.</p>
