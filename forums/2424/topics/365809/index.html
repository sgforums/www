              <p>The expected arrival of £80 million from the imminent sale of World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid,
              together with the finances set aside for transfer negotiations this
              summer, will not guarantee a reckless summer of overspending for
              Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson, according to a report in <em>The Times</em>.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2009/5/16/1242490462184/Man-Utd.-league-champions-004.jpg"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2009/5/16/1242490462184/Man-Utd.-league-champions-004.jpg" alt="Man Utd. league champions: Rooney and Ferguson" width="288" height="202"></a></p>
              <p>The
              iron-willed Scot is likely to have in excess of £100 million to splash
              on recruiting this summer, but according to the report, that does not
              mean that the weighty price tags of two apparent targets - Atletico
              Madrid's Argentinean starlet Sergio Aguero and Olympique Lyonnais'
              Karim Benzema -will be met.</p>
              <p>Any potential deal to either, or
              both, sought-after talents could be largely dependent on the respective
              clubs' willingness to drop their valuations to £25 million. Ferguson is
              expected to not want to part company with any more <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2009/06/26/1348104/report-manchester-united-manager-ferguson-will-not-overspend#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">cash</span></span></a> due to the relative inexperience of the pair, and also the risk involved as neither have played in the Premier League.<br><br>Elsewhere,
              it looks likelier with each passing day that the club's on-loan
              forward, the tireless Carlos Tevez, will be leaving the Theatre of
              Dreams, and local rivals Manchester City appear to be the Argentina
              international's expected destination.</p>

              <p>go buy Costa lar. seriously david gill should negotiate with his club and bring down the fee to the region of 12-15m. Ronaldo joined Man Utd as 18 year old in 2003 for 12m. </p>
              <p>that said, Costa may or may not turn out to be successful, it all depends on his determinationt to succeed and his adaptability to EPL hustle and bustle pace. but he is young and has age at his side.</p>
              <p>tats the peril of investment I suppose.</p>
              <p>If Benzema does join RM, then Utd should sign for Huntelaar and another midfielder, since Valencia is almost in the bag, like for like replacement for Ronaldo, although he is not the same class of Ronaldo.</p>
