            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>United's U18s slipped to a second consecutive defeat - and the heaviest loss of the season so far - when visiting Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.<br></strong><br>With the two clubs also meeting at senior level at Old Trafford in the afternoon, the Reds had the chance to do the double over Wolves. Instead, the first leg became something of a cruel lesson for Paul McGuinness' young side, as Libyan player Zeli Ismael bagged a hat-trick for the dominant home side.<br><br>Ismael successfuly challenged centre-back Sean McGinty and rounded goalkeeper Liam Jacob to claim his first goal; he then made it 2-0 with a spot-kick after Michael Fornasier was penalised, perhaps harshly, for handball. Even though the referee ordered the penalty to be retaken, Ismael beat Jacob with his second attempt, just as he had done with his first.<br><br>Liam McAlinder put Wolves 3-0 up shortly after the break, with a header from Jordan Cranston's left-wing cross. A low ball in from the right by Kristien Kostina was then clipped past Jacob by Ismael at the near post to complete the Libyan's hat-trick and the scoring in the match. <br><br>The Reds earned credit for a stronger finish to the match with Jesse Lingard, who'd earlier struck the crossbar, continuing to probe, ably supported by substitutes Jack Barmby and Joe Rothwell. The latter was one of three players making their U18 debuts, the others being centre-back Luke McCullough and winger Gyliano van Velzen.<br><br><strong>United:</strong> Jacob; Fornasier, McGinty, McCullough, Blackett; Giverin (Rothwell), M. Keane, Hendrie, van Velzen; Lingard, Lawrence (Barmby). Sub not used: Coll.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Paul McGuinness’s Under-18s got back to winning ways against West Bromwich Albion at Carrington on Saturday morning after a run of three straight defeats.<br><br></strong>United got off to the best possible start when skipper Jesse Lingard was fouled in the box after just four minutes to win a penalty. The Reds attacker dusted himself down and coolly converted the spot-kick to make it 1-0. <br><br>The home side continued to dominate, with defender Sean McGinty, striker John Cofie and winger Gyliano van Velzen all going close to opening the scoring; Cofie’s initial attempt was saved by West Brom’s goalkeeper Shane Lewis, before Cofie’s second attempt was cleared off the line.<br><br>At the other end it took a while for West Brom to really threaten, but when they did it was forward Saido Berahino leading the attack. Reds keeper Liam Jacob kept the 17-year-old out with a fine save from Berahino’s free-kick. But a minute later he got revenge, with a turn and shot from the edge of the box to haul the Baggies level.<br><br>Parity only lasted five minutes as United’s own dangerman, Cofie, regained the lead. The Ghana-born English youth international used his pace and power to run at the West Brom defence before firing a low shot home from 20 yards.<br><br>The second half started much the same as the first: with a United penalty, this time for handball. This time Cofie placed the ball on the spot, sending the keeper the wrong way to make it 3-1. It is Cofie’s ninth Academy goal this season, his 12th at all levels.<br><br>West Brom had a goal disallowed, despite a fine strike from Gez Mulholland and Berahino continued to threaten from dead-ball situations and Lingard headed an effort off the line. After a frustrating losing streak though, United were not about to let this lead slip away.<br><br><em><strong>United</strong>: Jacob; M Keane (Massacci 81), McCullough, McGinty, Blackett; Lawrence (Giverin 67), Pogba, Hendrie (Ekangamene 67), Van Velzen; Lingard, Cofie.<br>Subs not used: Coll, Thorpe</em></p>
