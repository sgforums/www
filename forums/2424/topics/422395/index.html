              <p>http://www.caughtoffside.com/2011/02/08/manchester-united-linked-with-surprise-swoop-for-18m-barcelona-midfielder/</p>
              <p>Manchester United are reportedly interested in mounting a surprise swoop to sign <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/barcelona">Barcelona</a> midfielder <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/javier-mascherano">Javier Mascherano</a>.
               The former Liverpool man has failed to make an impact at the Nou Camp 
              since his arrival at the La Liga club in August and has been linked with
               a move away in the summer. Sir Alex Ferguson is looking to bring in a 
              defensive midfielder and has set his sights on the Argentine 
              international captain.</p>
              <p>Mascherano has barely featured in Pep 
              Guardiola’s first eleven as young Spanish international Sergio Busquets 
              continues to impress at the heart of the <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/barcelona">Barcelona</a> midfield, this has led to the 26 year old battler feeling frustrated on
               the bench, a situation the San Lorenzo born star is not experienced in 
              his career.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has been linked with moves to bring a new 
              defensive force into the centre of his midfield, not least because Owen 
              Hargreaves seems no nearer to ending his injury woes. A move for 
              Mascherano may appear at first surprising given his previous stint at 
              Anfield, but his proven record at Premier League level will greatly 
              interest the Old Trafford boss.</p>
              <p>Barcelona paid £22m to sign the 
              former West Ham, River Plate and Corinthians man but will reportedly 
              accept offers of around £18m so that they can re-invest funds to either 
              pay off debt or to bring in new additions to beef up Guardiola’s squad.</p>
              <p>hmmm.. good buy??</p>

              <p>He should have just stayed at Pool instead of going to Barcelona. Furthermore, he not 1st team because there already got many star players at there.</p>
              <p>So, Man U can save his career again. Need an attacker like him to replace Giggs &amp; Scholes once they retire.</p>

              <p>18 million for Mascherano isn't too bad.</p>
              <p>And at the age of 26, he should still have quite a few good years ahead of him.</p>

              <p>I've a feeling this transfer will go through mainly because Hargreaves is nearing the end of his career and I don't see how he can recover fully and perform at the same level as he did before he was injured and who else is an out and out defensive midfielder at United now? Fletcher? I dont think so. Carrick? Was he even playing in the first place Mr Invisible?</p>
              <p>And I don't know if fellow United bro notice that Fletcher is playing Scholes' role in recent game, spraying quality ball across field. Usually all he does was the dirty job, square pass the ball and thats it but now he is not doing the dirty work but instead, playing the ball to the wingers and strikers.</p>
              <p>Maybe Mascherano will really come to Old Trafford together with Henderson and probably Reina to replace Hargreaves, Scholes and Van der Sar respectively.</p>
