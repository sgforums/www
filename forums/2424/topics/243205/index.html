You can see they don't even bother about sat's match against City by resting defender Woodgate, in-form striker Viduka and others...<br><br>You can bet that they will be going all out for this as they know a win could very well get them to the final since it is Watford they would meet in the semi-final...<br><br>Expect a hard match.

I don't think it has. There is no reason we cannot go down to Manchester and get a victory. We have been there before and done it, so why not again?<br><br>"It is going to be hard because United are one of the best teams in Europe, but we are more than capable of doing it on the day, as we have shown against some of the better sides in the top half of the table."<br><br>Boro can boast an impressive record at Old Trafford. United have only notched one win in the Teesiders' last five Premiership visits to Manchester.<br><br>"We have no cause to be frightened of any team and our record against United over the last few years proves they are only human," said Woodgate.<br><br>"We have got a lot of big-game players, people who have taken part in big matches over the course of their careers, and we will back ourselves to do it again."<br></div>

Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo, the man whose late penalty secured Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final replay at Old Trafford, turned in a stunning individual display in Saturday's 4-1 Barclays Premiership demolition of Bolton to serve further warning of his excellent form. Striker Wayne Rooney, who opened the scoring in the 2-2 draw at the Riverside Stadium, helped himself to a superb double to serve warning to Southgate's men that they will have to be at their best to stand any chance of keeping their cup dream alive. </strong><br><br>However, the former Boro skipper insists they can only concentrate on themselves. He said: "We cannot be concerned about what they are doing, we have got to be focused on what are our strengths. "We have got to go there and take them on. We have done that in the past and that gives us the belief we can do it again. "We are looking a decent side, we have got results against just about everybody. "In matches against top-class opposition, we are capable of big performances.<br><br>However, they were woeful in defeat by City at the weekend as goals from Sylvain Distin and Emile Mpenza deservedly handed Stuart Pearce's side victory. Southgate's decision to rest key men Jonathan Woodgate and Mark Viduka was perhaps understandable, but he later admitted he had perhaps sent out the wrong message to his players. Both men will return at Old Trafford, but there remain question marks over midfielder Julio Arca as he battles against a groin injury and defender Emanuel Pogatetz, who was carried off with a knee injury on Saturday.<br><br>Boro missed Arca's artistry against City and while both Abel Xavier and Andrew Davies could line up alongside Woodgate should Pogatetz miss out, the Austrian's absence would be a big blow. Saturday's defeat was only Boro's second in 16 games in all competitions since the turn of the year and the destiny of their season could rely on what happens at Old Trafford.<br><br>A trip to Wembley remains the dream as the Teessiders look to go one better than last season when they were beaten by West Ham in the semi-finals. However, their manager is hoping an extended cup run will also pay dividends on the Premiership front.<br><br>Southgate said: "I would not say it has kept our season alive, but it has given us something else to focus on and something different to look forward to. "That is the same for the fans - it is great to have that excitement away from the bread and butter of the league.<br><br>"A run in the cup can boost a team's confidence and winning in any competition is a nice habit to get into. "But we still have another eight league games to go and we still think we have something to play for in the Premiership. "It is like the first season I was here. We made the semi-final of the FA Cup and that coincided with an upturn in our league form."<br><br></div>

Â“I think thereÂ’s a complex about it because itÂ’s Ronaldo.

Almost inevitably, too, there was a strong whiff of controversy as the Portugal winger won the 76thminute penalty that he himself converted past Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to see United through to a semi-final against Watford. </strong><br><br>Jonathan Woodgate, outstanding at the back as Middlesbrough pushed United all the way, was as convinced as his outraged teammates that his tackle had not sent Ronaldo tumbling. Television replays appeared to show that referee Mike Dean had made the right call, with Woodgate just catching RonaldoÂ’s trailing leg before the United player hit the deck.<br><br>But BoroÂ’s frustration as they saw their FA Cup dream disintegrating in the fraught final minutes boiled over when substitute James Morrison was sent off for a foul on Ronaldo near the corner flag. As referee Dean brandished a straight red card at Morrison, who had been on the pitch less than half an hour, Wayne Rooney went charging in to give the England Under 21 midfielder a piece of his mind.<br><br>Woodgate was the peacemaker there as Old Trafford pondered the irony of Rooney diving in on RonaldoÂ’s behalf after the World Cup controversy that threatened to wreck the wingerÂ’s United career. But MorrisonÂ’s dismissal did nothing to take the heat out of the situation, and United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz was pulled away from the Middlesbrough bench following an audible cry of "cheat" towards UnitedÂ’s dug-out.<br><br>Boro assistant boss Malcolm Crosby and kit man Alex Smith appeared to be the men getting a glare from Queiroz, who has been a mentor to fellow countryman Ronaldo during his time at Old Trafford. Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate was clearly one not convinced of the validity of RonaldoÂ’s 18th goal of the season for the club, when he sent Schwarzer the wrong way from the penalty spot.<br><br>It probably didnÂ’t help his demeanour either when Ronaldo, having finished celebrating with most of his team-mates, ran past and seemed to gesture to BoroÂ’s manager that he talked too much. Southgate said: "IÂ’m not sure about the penalty, IÂ’ve seen it three times. But the referee has given it, so itÂ’s end of story. Cristiano Ronaldo is a fantastic player and is really good at what he does."<br><br>When he does what he does really well, as he did when putting Bolton to the sword just 48 hours earlier, Ronaldo is without a match. He wasnÂ’t quite in that scintillating form on Monday night, however. Even so, he was more than a handful for Boro, well as they played in defence, with Woodgate showing the poise and ability that should make him an essential member of the England squad.<br><br>United always had one or two things up their sleeve, such as Ji-Sung ParkÂ’s introduction from the bench when Alan Smith had run himself almost to a standstill and been booked in the process.<br><br>In the end, it took Gaby HeinzeÂ’s astute pass, RonaldoÂ’s homing instinct for goal, and WoodgateÂ’s only imperfect tackle of the night to keep UnitedÂ’s Treble bid alive and condemn BoroÂ’s season.<br><br>Southgate said: "There were some fantastic performances from my players, and IÂ’m not going to knock them. We came here and took the best team in the country all the way. "We did lose our discipline in the last five minutes and thatÂ’s not acceptable. YouÂ’ve got to be mature but James is a young player."<br><br>MANCHESTER UNITED (4-4-2): Kuszczak; Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra; Ronaldo, Carrick, Giggs, Richardson (Park 60); Smith (OÂ’Shea 71), Rooney.<br>Booked: Smith, Rooney.<br>Scorer: Ronaldo 76 (pen).<br><br>MIDDLESBROUGH (4-4-2): Schwarzer; Xavier, Woodgate, Pogatetz, Taylor (Huth 8<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; Cattermole (Morrison 62), Boateng, Arca (Rochemback 69), Downing; Yakubu, Viduka.<br>Booked: Xavier, Woodgate, Pogatetz, Rochemback, Boateng.<br>Sent off: Morrison.<br><br>Man of the match: Jonathan Woodgate.<br>Referee: Mike Dean.<br><br></div>

Boro backroom staff reacted furiously after Ronaldo won and scored the late penalty in United's 1-0 win in the quarter-final replay at Old Trafford.<br><br>Ferguson said: "I don't know what they are going on about, it was a penalty. "If it had been any other player they would not have bothered but they have a guilt complex about him."<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42702000/jpg/_42702841_ronaldodive203.jpg"><br><span class="small">Ronaldo is felled by Woodgate in the FA Cup replay</span><br><br>Ronaldo tumbled under a challenge from Jonathan Woodgate and scored from the spot to clinch a semi-final encounter against Watford. Middlesbrough were also furious earlier this season after Ronaldo won a penalty in a Premiership clash at the Riverside.<br><br>But Ferguson added: "It is a shame. They are putting a stigma against the boy that he doesn't deserve. "We have had some great players at this club in my 20 years here and Cristiano is up there with the best of them. He is phenomenal."<br><br>Ferguson's assistant Carlos Queiroz had to be pulled away from the Middlesbrough management and coaching staff at the final whistle. But Southgate refused to condemn his team or staff, saying: "The galling thing for me is that we have played them three times this season and conceded three dodgy penalties.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42702000/gif/_42702793_rooneyw_getty.gif"><br><br>"In the heat of the moment, everybody is entitled to a reaction. "It is the 75th minute of an FA Cup quarter-final. People are going to react in a way you wouldn't normally." And Southgate was not in an apologetic mood after James Morrison's wild, late lunge on Ronaldo, which earned the youngster a red card. He added: "In that situation, we would all love to do that."<br><br>After scoring the winner, Ronaldo was asked why he thought controversial decisions seemed to follow him. He said: "Maybe some people don't like me. Maybe I'm too good." "For me, it is a penalty. Why when I am involved is it always polemic?"<br><br>Ronaldo insists he did not go down too easily under Woodgate's challenge. He added: "Of course I felt contact, that is why I slipped. He touched. "If he touches me I lose my movement and that is why I go down. He kicked me."<br><br></div>
