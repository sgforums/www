              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson admitted he was a
              frustrated man after seeing his side held to a goalless draw by
              Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>After seeing Liverpool and Arsenal both drop points earlier in the
              day, the champions had the chance to close the gap on their title
              rivals but couldn’t find a way past a Tottenham side who held on for a
              deserved point.</p>
              <p>Speaking to <em>Setanta Sports</em> after the game, Sir Alex
              admitted the result left him feeling frustrated. He said: “It is
              frustrating, I think we dominated the game, particularly in the second
              half. We just needed that little bit of luck you always want, when you
              are in that position.”</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs had the best opportunity in the closing stages with a
              free kick that was well-saved by Heurelho Gomes and the United boss
              paid tribute to the Spurs stopper. The Scot explained: “The goalkeeper
              had two fantastic saves near the end. Rio had a header maybe if he’d
              just glanced it there might have been a better outcome.”</p>
              <p>However, Spurs also possessed a threat of their own and Sir Alex admitted he was wary of Redknapp’s men on the counter-attack.</p>
              <p>“In those situations you are always worried about the counter
              attack,” admitted the United boss before adding, “Of course the little
              lad Modric had a terrific shot that just glanced off one of our
              defenders. That could have been embarrassing for us.”</p>
              <p>Despite only taking a point Ferguson was quick to praise his team and particularly their effort.</p>
              <p>“I am satisfied with the effort the players have put in, they have
              worked really hard. They’re not an easy team to play against at the
              moment. They are on a high,” he explained, “Since Harry’s come there
              has been a rejuvenation in the team.”</p>
              <p>The Scot also insisted that a draw was not the worst result but that
              he had been hoping to take him all three. He explained: “It’s not the
              worst result but I wish we could have got those extra two points it
              would have made a great difference in the league.”</p>
              <p>Today’s results mean that Chelsea have the chance to pull away at
              the top of the league tomorrow when they entertain West Ham United at
              home and Ferguson was quick to reveal what result he was hoping for. He
              concluded: “There are three draws today, hopefully there will be a draw
              tomorrow with Chelsea!”</p>
