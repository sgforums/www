              <p>United need seven points from their four remaining fixtures to guarantee the title but Ferguson was irked by suggestions that, because their next two league games are against <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Arsenal" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;">Arsenal</span></a> and <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a>, the two London teams still have a chance of overhauling them.</p>
              <p>"The thing that puzzles me is that people keep saying we still have to play Arsenal and Chelsea and they talk about these games as if we are going to lose them," the Manchester United manager said after Everton's defensive resilience was broken by Javier Hernández's 83rd-minute header.</p>
              <p>"Why can't we win these games? Why can't we go to the Emirates Stadium and win, as we have done previously? I told the players to forget about all that nonsense and just win their games."</p>
              <p>Manchester United have won their last two games at the Emirates, where they go next Sunday, and should they overcome Arsenal and beat Chelsea, Ferguson will lift the 12th <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> title of his career on 8 May.</p>
              <p>Of those dozen championships, this is likely to draw the least acclaim with United producing few performances that would disprove the charge by the Marseille manager, Didier Deschamps, that this is a team "that lacks fantasy".</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Ferguson paid tribute to a side who have dropped only two points at Old Trafford all season and have now snatched half a dozen victories in the final 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>"There is that winning attitude about them," he said. "We will keep our heads down and not get carried away. There are only four games left and the way they are going about their business and the effort they have shown, it gives them an outstanding chance of being champions. You can test people's character but they keep coming through.</p>
              <p>"We had some great openings and could have had this match finished by half-time but it is in the traditions of Manchester United that we don't do that. We always wait until the very end and keep everyone high on the edge of their seats but we get there."</p>
              <p>Ferguson appeared agitated on the touchline, complaining about what he regarded as Everton's time-wasting and arguing that they should not have been allowed the five minutes of stoppage time that produced. The manager said he was confident a goal would come.</p>
              <p>"I could feel it coming," he said of a match that produced no injury issues before Tuesday's Champions League semi-final first leg against Schalke. "We had the momentum and the crowd was up. When the crowd gets going at Old Trafford they suck the ball in. It was a tight game and some of Everton's defending was fantastic.</p>
              <p>"We had shots blocked near the line and their goalkeeper made two or three great saves. You say to yourself: 'It's going to be a late one' but you can just smell the history of the club when it comes to scoring late and so it was here.</p>
              <p>"The important thing is that we never gave up; we took gambles and we took risks. We put Wayne Rooney in the middle of the pitch and we brought Michael Owen and Ryan Giggs on." Hernández's goal was his 19th in his first season in the English game – as many as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored in his first season at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"We did not expect this kind of return," Ferguson said. "We thought his first year would be an introduction to the club; getting him adapted to English football and strengthening him up. But he has done all these things and more. He is special."</p>
