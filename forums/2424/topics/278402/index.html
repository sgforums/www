            <div class='col-md body'>Former Reds winger Andrei Kanchelskis says Ryan Giggs can keeping on playing for years to come because he is one of the game's consummate professionals.<br><br>At 33, Giggs is still flying high some 16 years since making his United debut. In that time he has won just about every trophy the game has to offer and is now just 39 matches away from overtaking Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time highest appearance maker.<br><br>Kanchelskis, who ended his playing career last season at the age of 38, says there is no reason why Giggs cannot do the same.<br><br>"I don't find it incredible at all that Ryan is still performing at the top level," said Kanchelskis, in Manchester to play for the Reds in the Masters Grand Final on Sunday. "Ryan has always been a great professional who has looked after himself properly. If you are professional in your life and concentrate your efforts in training and matches then you can go on and on.<br><br>"I only finished last season at 38. I didn't want to drop down the divisions in Russia so I retired at the top level. I think Ryan will do the same. But it won't be yet. If I can play to 38, why can't he? Maybe he will play for another four or five years yet. At the moment I don't see any reason why not."<br><br>Giggs' should this week be feeling the benefits of his decision to retire from international football, recharging his batteries in a two-week break from United action. And Kanchelskis, who still watches United's matches from his home in Moscow, has been impressed with how well the Welshman has preserved his talents. "I see a lot of Premiership football and watch United a lot," he added. "Ryan is still fast and clever. He is still definitely good enough for that level."<br></div>
