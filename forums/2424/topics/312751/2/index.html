              <p><strong>Roma 0 - <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 Manchester United</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">1st April 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/0104roma9GCKDM_468x370.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The publicity-seeking Italian actress Sabrina Fellini yesterday promised to strip naked in the Eternal City's Circus Maximus if her beloved Roma were to win the Champions League this season. After a terrific Manchester United away performance, it is safe to wager that she will be keeping her coat on for another year.</strong></p>
              <p>A first-half goal for emergency centre forward Cristiano Ronaldo — his 36th of the season — and a second-half effort from Wayne Rooney gave United a priceless lead — and two away goals — to take back to Old Trafford when the teams reconvene next week.</p>
              <p>After the mauling Sir Alex Ferguson's side gave Roma in England this time last year, it is hard to see them faltering. As such, United have one foot in the last four already. Ronaldo's goal was a powerful header shortly before half-time while Rooney's toe-poke came midway through the second half after United had survived the only real pressure Roma placed them under all night.</p>
              <p>With injuries finally beginning to eat in to his squad at just the wrong time, Ferguson had some decisions to make once Ryan Giggs failed to recover from the hip injury he suffered towards the end of the weekend defeat of Aston Villa. Nevertheless, seeing Ronaldo operating as a lone centre forward was surprising. Ferguson has often spoken of the 23-year-old's ability to play through the middle but in truth there has rarely been any evidence of that.</p>
              <p>Such tactical peculiarities are not uncommon to Ferguson. But who are the general public to argue when the United manager has so many trophies on his CV? Last night he was proved right again. United had been rather average for almost 40 minutes of the tie and had, worryingly, seen central defender Nemanja Vidic carried off with what appeared to be a knee or thigh injury just after the half hour. But just when it seemed as though this may prove a difficult night, United broke through.</p>
              <p> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/0104roma7AFP_468x337.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Ronaldo opens the scoring with a brave header but takes a knock in the process (below)</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Rooney — playing wide on the left with the Ji-Sung Park on the other flank — created valuable space with a sharp turn and pass out to the right to Paul Scholes. And when Scholes floated a hanging cross towards the penalty spot Ronaldo timed his run beautifully to beat Roma goalkeeper Doni with a tumping downward header.</p>
              <p>It was a classic centre forward's goal and Ronaldo took a whack on his leg for his troubles as he collided with rightback Marco Cassetti. No doubt the pain was worth it, though. A vital goal for United, but the first half had been largely disappointing, especially given the atmosphere within this magnificent stadium.</p>
              <p>Roma may have a problem with crowd trouble but they appear to have done precious little to deal with a hooligan element that could yet deprive the city of a Champions League Final next season. The majority of their supporters, though, come only for the football and the manner in which they worked themselves in to a frenzy as kick-off approached was remarkable.</p>
              <p>Had they scored an early goal then the roof may have lifted off but, crucially, they could not. In fact, United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar — recovered from a groin problem again — did not really have a save to make during the first half. Michael Carrick was chosen in the centre of midfield ahead of Owen Hargreaves, a decision that, perhaps, said something for Ferguson's attacking intent.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/0104roma6GCKDM_468x308.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Luciano Spalletti's team played some neat football in the first half but rarely did they threaten to break through. An early shot from the Brazilian Mancini was deflected behind for a corner and, from the ensuing set-piece, Christian Panucci came forward to head powerfully over the bar with Van der Sar beaten.</p>
              <p>A super David Pizarro pass gave Cassetti the chance to cross in the 23rd minute but he wasted it while a 25-yard effort from central striker Mirko Vucinic briefly alarmed United as it whistled narrowly over the crossbar. Vucinic also poked another chance across goal and wide in the moments that followed Ronaldo's goal. A goal then would have been interesting.</p>
              <p>As it was, United's evening was passing by comfortably. The club's travelling supporters had enjoyed a much better evening, too, it appeared. With lessons seemingly learned from the security failings that contributed to their ill-treatment here a year ago, United's 3,200 travelling fans could concentrate on the football.</p>
              <p>And three times in the opening five minutes of the second half, they almost saw their team pegged back. Van der Sar would have been disappointed had he seen a deep cross float over his head and he back-pedalled to touch the ball over but two other opportunities should have brought Roma an equaliser.</p>
              <p>First the midfielder Max Tonetto shot haplessly wide when presented a free strike just seven yards from goal and then Panucci volleyed over with similar profligacy after a flick header found him arriving unmarked at the far post.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>United Prove A Point In Rome - (First Leg)</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Roma 0 - <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 Manchester United</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">1st April 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/150px-AS_Roma.png" alt=""></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>VS </strong> </span><strong><img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o10/zocosss/ManU.png" alt="image"></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/1.jpg" alt=""></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United took a giant stride towards the Champions League semi-finals with a clinical victory against AS Roma at the Stadio Olimpico.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo headed home his 36th goal of the season from Paul Scholes' cross six minutes before half-time. Roma rallied, with Christian Panucci missing from close range and Edwin van der Sar saving brilliantly from Mirko Vucinic's 61st-minute header. But Rooney bundled home United's crucial second five minutes later. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The result leaves United clear favourites to reach a likely semi-final showdown against Barcelona. Sir Alex Ferguson made three changes from the side that won so emphatically against Aston Villa on Saturday - Van der Sar, Anderson and Ji-Sung Park replacing Tomasz Kuszczak, Ryan Giggs and Carlos Tevez.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Vucinic led the Roma attack in place of injured captain Francesco Totti, and he was a lively figure in a first 45 minutes that saw United relatively untroubled. Panucci posed an early threat when he rose to meet David Pizarro's corner but headed over the top. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It prompted a response from Ferguson after 55 minutes as Owen Hargreaves was sent on for the disappointing Anderson, who was also suffering a hamstring problem. Roma were testing United's resolve, and just after the hour Van der Sar needed to produce a stunning reflex save to turn away Vucinic's flicked header. But United survived the siege to break out and deliver a stunning counter-punch to double their advantage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Park did well to head Wes Brown's long cross into the danger area and when Doni failed to collect, Rooney bundled home from inside the six-yard box. Roma, understandably, looked demoralised and United came within inches of adding a third and effectively putting the tie to bed late on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">First Ronaldo fired a low shot against an upright before Michael Carrick was just inches off-target from 20 yards as United gathered momentum. Then, with seconds remaining, Ronaldo almost crowned the perfect in night in spectacular fashion when he volleyed just over from substitute Tevez's cross.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Vucinic was just off target before United suffered a blow after 29 minutes when Nemanja Vidic was carried off after landing awkwardly on his knee in an aerial challenge. However, United reacted well to the setback and took the lead with a priceless away goal from Ronaldo six minutes before the interval.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Scholes sat up an inviting cross and Ronaldo rose superbly to power a downward header past Doni. The Portuguese winger took a heavy bang to the head in scoring, but recovered quickly to carry on. Vucinic could have levelled two minutes later, but he jabbed a finish across the face of goal after escaping the attentions of the United defence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Roma set about United with intent after the break, Max Tonetto sending a powerful drive just wide and Panucci wasting their best chance of the night when he blasted over from close range after United failed to deal with Vucinic's long throw.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>we got the crucial away goals and a clean sheet.. wat mor can we ask for? i think Rio did well to keep the defence in tact after vidic got carried away although it was obvious our defence was not as it used to be without the 'spartan' .. as for the 2 goals.. .after watching the television replays, i'm pretty sure SAF must have being happy with Parks performance.. the fact the first goal from scholes cross that led to Ronaldo making a power header was only possible becuz Park.. whos always got that talent for driving defence out of position.. the television reply will actually show you park moving in to the no man zone which also lead the two central defenders followign him.. giving space at the  back for Ronaldo to rush in to knick a header... the second goal doesn;t need much explaination.. just as everyone thought the ball wud cross the line for goal kick, the little menace rushes in and heads the ball into the no man zone leading to the mistake of the goalie and  the italian stand in captain's body tangle..leaving Rooney with just a simple flick for the second goal.. xD</p></div>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson was annoyed with himself for not employing Wayne Rooney in a central role earlier against, after the striker scored within moments of switching position.<br><br></strong>Rooney spent much of the match in a wide left position as the Italians dominated the early stages of the second half, but moved inside when Owen Hargreaves replaced Anderson. Sir Alex's switch to 4-4-2 reaped instant dividends, as Rooney pounced on a mistake from Roma goalkeeper Doni to give United a vital second goal.<br><br>"I should have put Wayne Rooney through the middle quicker," Sir Alex told ITV after the match. "It (the second goal) was an instant reaction to that. "We maybe had some lucky breaks in the second half, they could have scored a couple when they went through on the left hand side against us."<br><br>Rooney's goal, which followed a superb first-half header from Cristiano Ronaldo, gave United a 2-0 lead to take into next Wednesday's second leg. With the Reds looking well placed for a semi-final place, Sir Alex was highly satisfied with a job well done in the Stadio Olimpico.<br><br>"It was a very good team we were playing against," he said. "I think we had to defend really well at times. It was a good disciplined performance, we had good possession of the ball and that's not easy in that atmosphere. <br><br>"And we didn't lose a goal, which is really vital. It's a fantastic scoreline for us, and we're very, very pleased."<br>The only sour note of the evening came as Nemanja Vidic limped off in the first half with a knee injury. The Serbian is set to undergo a scan to determine the extent of the blow.<br><br>"We don't know," said Sir Alex. "We hope it's a nerve. It's a knee injury anyway, we're just praying it's not anything other than a nerve injury."</p>
