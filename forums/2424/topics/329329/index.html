              <p><span class="italic"><em>Berbatov - insists money does not matter.</em></span></p>
              <p><br><strong><span class="heading">BERBATOV WANTS SILVERWARE NOT GOLD</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United new boy Dimitar Berbatov insists trophies mean more to him than money. United smashed their transfer record to sign Berbatov, the £30.75million deal finally being announced at 12.40am on Monday morning, forty minutes after the transfer deadline expired.</strong></p>
              <p>It concluded a long-running saga and ended a dramatic day, with Manchester City looking at one stage as though they were about to step in and hijack the deal. Yet, while the waiting world may have wondered whether the 27-year-old was ready to abandon United in favour of City, and their new-found wealth, Berbatov confirmed he had never wavered in his desire to join the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>"I don't play for the money," he told MUTV in an exclusive interview. "Those who know me; my really close friends, know that I play for enjoyment and to entertain the fans. "If I want to play for the money, I will accept the Manchester City offer or Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"But the red shirt is a really big thing for me. I want to play for the biggest club in the world. That is why I am here." Indeed, Berbatov feels so strongly about United that he is already talking about staying at Old Trafford for the remainder of his career.</p>
              <p>Certainly, no matter how long the Bulgaria striker is around for, he expects to improve. "I know I can develop here in the way I always wanted. That is the most important thing for me.</p>
              <p>"I am 27 now. I am at the biggest club in the world and maybe this could be the last step in my career." Having spent £5million more than it appeared they wanted to pay - and committed themselves to an outlay that would have represented a new British record had their neighbours from Eastlands not stunned the football world with their purchase of Robinho 45 minutes earlier - United seem to have lost the game of brinkmanship with Spurs, which took the entire transfer down to the wire.</p>
              <p>Berbatov, though is merely looking to recapture the form which made him such a crowd favourite in his two seasons at White Hart Lane until his desire to join United soured the relationship.</p>
              <p>But, despite being stuck in the middle of a stand-off to which there appeared to be no end. And having pulled out of games against Sunderland and Tottenham because he was 'in no fit state' to participate, Berbatov never felt his United hopes would end in failure.</p>
              <p>"I always believed," he said. "People used to say 'keep the faith'. I went through some very difficult times and it was a long battle, but I was always thought it was going to happen and in the end it did.</p>
              <p>"Now I am here and hopefully I will play my part in the team and we can win lots of trophies as well." In joining a club that has won the Premier League title for the last two seasons and added the Champions League trophy to their haul in May, Berbatov has a lot to live up to.</p>
              <p>Not that the challenge bothers him. Indeed, it is one he is relishing as he bids to add more meaningful medals to the Carling Cup gong he won with Spurs last term. "Trophies are an important thing in football and I want to help this team win more," he said. "I have handled pressure and expectation all through my life. "I am not scared of it. That is why I am here.</p>
              <p>"The most important thing is to enjoy myself, help the team win more trophies and entertain the fans. "If I do that and play as I have done in my last two years at Tottenham, I don't think there will be any problem."</p>
              <p>Having now gone on international duty, Berbatov must wait for his debut. But at the back of his mind, there remains the expectant thrill to come from that first game - at Liverpool on September 13.</p>
              <p>"I would love to play there," he said. "We live for the big games and I think this is the biggest. I can't wait to play."</p>

              <h1>Berbatov swagger has echoes of Cantona: Fergie's £30m man is art-loving loner</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00799/berbatov0903afp_799869c.jpg" alt="New Manchester United signing Dimitar Berbatov - Spurs fume, but Dimitar Berbatov's Manchester United deal 'broke no rules' " width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><em>RED AND RIGHT ... Dimitar Berbatov holds his Manchester United shirt</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The modern </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> surged to power in the mid-1990s thanks to a moody, enigmatic forward who bemused and charmed his manager and team-mates in equal measure.</strong></p>
              <p>Now the Barclays Premier League champions may have signed another such player. Dimitar Berbatov has declared himself a loner, a perfectionist and an art lover, with a dislike of alcohol but a weakness for the odd cigarette. If that sounds a bit like Eric Cantona then take this description of Berbatov's behaviour from former Tottenham</p>
              <p>'You look at him and his mannerisms suggest he is a bit sullen,' said Pleat.</p>
              <p>'He looks as though he can maybe be disrespectful towards lesser players, someone who can be very quick to chastise others whom he feels may not be performing totally up to his own very high level.</p>
              <p>'But he is a talent, a player of deft touches and intelligence. It will be utterly fascinating to see how Alex Ferguson utilises him.'</p>
              <p>Pleat's words could have been spoken 15 years ago about Cantona. Ask a player like Ryan Giggs to talk about the constructive part the Frenchman played in his development. Conversely, ask Andy Cole how many stares burned deep in the back of his head each time King Eric felt his strike partner had not come up to scratch. Watching Berbatov assimilate into Ferguson's squad of superstars will certainly be interesting.</p>
              <p>Away from the field, Berbatov is an individual. If Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville manage to drag him to this year's Christmas Party they will have done well.</p>
              <p>Berbatov said recently: 'I have not been to a bar or disco in London. I went to an engagement party of a team-mate, I paid my respects and then left. I hope that doesn't sound sad. Sacrifices must be made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/02/article-0-001A3EE800000258-471_306x321.jpg" alt=" Eric Cantona" width="306" height="321"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Legend: Eric Cantona</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              <p>'I live in an apartment block surrounded by security fences. It's quiet and pleasant and people can't bother me. I feed squirrels from the balcony. I paint or draw. I'll open a magazine and if I see something I like I'll try to copy it. A few days ago I drew an angel with a pen. Maybe God has given me a kind of talent!'</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old Bulgaria striker undoubtedly has rare talent as a footballer. He will bring Ferguson's team a presence in the air and an attacking focal point they have lacked since the sale of Ruud van Nistelrooy two summers ago.</p>
              <p>For all their potency going forward, United can lose shape as Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo seem unsure about who should play at the top of their team's formation. Rooney and Tevez are not suited to it and Ferguson will hope the former will find a little of his true self now he has a No 9 to play off.</p>
              <p>'Berbatov will definitely need an effective partner - or partners - to play with, as that is what he had at Tottenham with Robbie Keane,' added Pleat. 'Keane's influence on Berbatov's success was huge.</p>
              <p>'Berbatov will need to work at understandings with more than one player and appreciate the values of squad rotation. But he is a wonderful talent.'</p>
              <p>A Christian with a fondness for card games, Berbatov comes across as a contradiction but claims to have a humility ingrained in him during the days in Sofia when he had to join a two-mile queue to buy bread for his family.</p>
              <p>'In the team at Tottenham there are guys with different religions, some Muslims who are not allowed to show their private parts so they shower with their underpants on,' he revealed. 'Well, one does shower naked so maybe he is less religious than the others! My surname means 'scatty' or 'disorderly'. I'm trying not to be like that.'</p>
              <p>Such was Ferguson's desire to sign Berbatov that United broke virtually every rule in the Premier League transfer handbook as they whisked him to Manchester for talks and a medical before even agreeing a deal with Tottenham.</p>
              <p>It was a poor show from a club that made such a fuss over Real Madrid's approaches to Ronaldo. How disappointing, too, that Spurs have chosen not to pursue the matter with the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, United and their supporters will not care if Berbatov helps deliver another Premier League title under pressure from rejuvenated Chelsea.</p>

              <h1>Spurs fume, but Dimitar Berbatov's Manchester United deal 'broke no rules'</h1>
              <h2>Dimitar Berbatov happily rushed into Manchester United's willing embrace on Monday night, rather than Manchester City's as Tottenham had hoped, because Spurs had given him permission "to go to Manchester''.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00570/51_berba_682x400_570605a.jpg" alt="RED AND RIGHT ... Dimitar Berbatov holds his Manchester United shirt with boss Alex Ferguson yesterday" width="682" height="400"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>That comment was taken by United as an invitation to meet Berbatov without feeling they were breaking any Premier League rules on courting other clubs' players. The Premier League said yesterday no rules had been broken by United, because no complaint had been made. Spurs were angry that Berbatov was met by United at the airport, when they had agreed a fee with City.</strong></p>
              <p>The Londoners agreed to sell to United because of the player's desire to go to the champions, Juande Ramos' preference for getting a sulky player out of his dressing-room and because they needed a replacement striker. As the midnight deadline loomed, United's promising youngster, Fraizer Campbell, was the only option.</p>
              <p>So Spurs yielded and agreed to drop their complaint over United's conduct in return for £30.7 million for Berbatov and the year-long loan services of Campbell. The figure was more than United initially wanted to pay, negotiations having begun with the champions offering £25 million, and Spurs may eventually view £30.7 million and a year of Campbell as good business with Berbatov so desperate to leave.</p>
              <p>"My only goal was to put on the red shirt,'' Berbatov told MUTV yesterday. The money is not important. I can live well with £1million, £10m or £500,000.”  "It was a tough month. I lived between euphoria and despair. I play to enjoy, to entertain the fans, I don't play for the money. If I want to play for the money, I will accept Manchester City offer or Chelsea, but no, I want to play for the biggest club in the world.''</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov also revealed he was stunned when United chief Alex Ferguson picked him up from Manchester airport to start the negotiations. The new United No 9 said: “I was shocked when I saw him at the airport when he came to pick me up in his car.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">"Everybody knows how big a coach he is. I saw what a great man he is. "We spoke a lot in the car before we reached the United ground. He told me he remembered my goals for Bayer Leverkusen against United six years ago when we reached the Champions League final.” Berbatov insists he can cope with the heat.</p>
              <p>United's chief executive, David Gill, admitted City's bid was a surprise. "Yes it was, but the takeover at City and the subsequent release of funds meant they were always going to be pretty active on the last day,'' Gill said. "Were we worried? No, not really.</p>
              <p>"The very fact that the player had made it clear throughout the summer that he wanted to leave Tottenham to join Manchester United for playing ambitions was enough for us. "He'd talked about his desire to play in the Champions League and to join a club that was challenging for major trophies. So we were quite relaxed about it.''</p>
              <p>Spurs were less relaxed. "It's no secret that relations between the two clubs are not flourishing,'' Berbatov's agent, Emil Dantchev, said. "City's offer was better in financial terms but he [Berbatov] remained adamant and looked only in one direction.''</p>
              <p>Transfer deadline day was a triumphant one for the double-winners. City kept Robinho from the clutches of Chelsea, United's main rivals, and word seeped out of Anfield that Fernando Torres' hamstring problem ruled him out of the Sept 13 collision with the champions. Louis Saha even passed his medical at Everton.</p>
              <p class="article">“I hope my best years are ahead. I’m 27 and now it’s my time. This may be the last club of my career and I’m at the biggest club in the world. “When I sat in the offices of Manchester United I could see the walls and off them were hanging the photos of the great players who have played at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“At that moment I could understand where I was and what I have to do. My goal is to win everything with United. “It was a euphoric moment but I have to keep my feet on the ground.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov also insisted there was no feud between him and Spurs chief Juande Ramos towards the end of his career at White Hart Lane. Now he is looking forward to a debut against United’s bitter rivals Liverpool next Saturday — and his old pal Robbie Keane. He said: “Robbie and I are close friends. I wish him the best at Liverpool and I’m sure when we meet we’ll recall our time at Tottenham.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Sir Alex told me my first game will be the biggest in Britain against Liverpool. “For my debut, why not? These are the games you live for, the biggest games. I can’t wait to play.”</p>
              
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>46</strong><br>Berbatov’s goal tally at Spurs, in 91 games after arriving from Bayern Leverkusen.</p>
              <p><strong>1.67</strong><br>His scoring rate of games per goal – 47 matches producing 28 goals – for Bulgaria.</p>
