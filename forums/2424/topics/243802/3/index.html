But now that you know, what do you think of it? Why haven't you come out and stand as strongly as you have like now?<br><br>The fact of the matter is many players have dived before, like it or not weather its in the EPL or at the international arena. Big names players have dived too, players like Henry, Gerrard, SWP and of course the famous 2 Drogba &amp; Robben... Those mentioned here are only limited to the EPL, There are many more players that do this outside of the EPL, mostly in Spain and Italy.<br><br>And since you mentioned "the worst act, that you ever read about, is maradona, the 'hand' of god." But just 10 days ago only, Salomon Kalou also attempted to score with his hand against Spurs in the FA cup semi (1st match), I didn't see you making anything out of it since you consider it to be "the worst act" And just seven days ago against Man city he when down without any contact at all from Richards... You can watch the clip here if you care and also the slow-motion at the end of this clip and tell us which is worst?<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdEPKHevKck" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdEPKHevKck</a><br><br>Compare it to Ronaldo's which had contact from Woodgate...<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP7feLQp3SU&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP7feLQp3SU&amp;mode=related&amp;search=</a><br><br>If you are still interested, you can also hear professional comments and analysis of the match if you care.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6L9zSl_KuQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6L9zSl_KuQ</a><br><br>The question is, do you see anyone making a big deal out of it? From how i see it, there are 2 main reasons that he gets mentioned most of the time. Firstly, like Beckham before him, the press likes to have articles on him cos it helps sell newspapers and it makes good reading for anti-man u fans and man u fans as well. I guess that if he was not a man u player then they wouldn't be too interested on him anymore.<br><br>Secondly, as a Pool fan, i can understand of your dislike for any Man u player let alone their best player... Had you stand up against other players or even just last week against Salomon Kalou's "acts" then at least your statement of "i am anti diver and cheater" will have sound genuine... But you are only selecting players that you dislike. Which is typical of non-man u fans to pick on Ronaldo cos he is an easy target.<br><br>Anyway, your comment of "If he is that good, he wouldn't have to cheat and dive all the time" Tell me how many times have he done that this season apart from the first Middlesbrough match? Compare to Kalou who tried to use his hand to score a goal 10 days ago only and 5 days later when down without any contact at all from Richards against Man city... Why we don't hear you saying something strongly about it? Are you being bias towards Ronaldo?<br><br>As for the shirt number, i think its time we understand the fundamental fact of it. In their 100 yrs history, there may have been more than a dozen or two who wears the No.7 shirt, But not all of them were great players. Bobby Charlton, Denis Law, Peter Schmeichel, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane just to name a few didn't need to wear the No.7 shirt to be great players to the club... They were great players in their own rights.<br><br>At the end of the day, we have to remind ourselves that It is the player that makes the shirt and not be confuse that the No.7 shirt will automatically make a player great...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
