              <p>Manchester United today called off the Indonesian leg of their Far East tour following two bomb blasts at tourist hotels in Jakarta.</p>
              <p>United arrived in Kuala Lumpur this morning to news of the explosions in the Indonesian capital, one of which took place at the Ritz-Carlton, the hotel the Red Devils were to be staying at for four nights from tomorrow.</p>
              <p>After seeking advice from various parties, including the Foreign Office, United confirmed they would not be flying to Jakarta tomorrow.</p>
              <p>"Following the explosions in Jakarta - one of which was at the hotel the team were due to stay in - and based on advice received, the directors have informed the Indonesian FA that the club cannot fulfil the fixture in Jakarta on the 2009 Asia tour," said a club statement.</p>
              <p>United were to play an Indonesia Super League XI on July 20.</p>
              <p>The match had been a 100,000 sell-out. The club must now decide how to reorganise the tour.</p>
              <p>"We are working on a revised itinerary outside Indonesia with the promoters and we will make a further announcement when these decisions have been made," continued the statement.</p>
              <p>"We are deeply disappointed at not being able to visit Indonesia and thank the Indonesian FA and our fans for their support.</p>
              <p>"Our thoughts go to all those affected by the blasts."</p>
              <p>Speaking at a press conference this morning in Kuala Lumpur, United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "We got the news as we landed and it is very disappointing. I have never been to Indonesia before and I know the Indonesian FA have worked very hard on this.</p>
              <p>"It is terrible news but we have taken what I believe to be the right decision in terms of safeguarding our players."</p>
              <p>United's chief executive David Gill said: "We have taken the appropriate advice. We have met with the British High Commission who are highly experienced in these matters.</p>
              <p>"It is not a decision we have taken lightly."</p>
              <p>Gill was asked if advice about potential trouble was given to the club prior to the start of the pre-season trip to the Far East.</p>
              <p>Gill said: "We were aware of the situation but we spoke to the right people and received the correct advice."</p>

              <p>Chief executive David Gill insists Manchester United would one day like to visit Indonesia after plans to play in Jakarta on Monday had to be scrapped.</p>
              <p>United were due to spend three days in the capital, and take on an Indonesian Select outfit in front of thousands of adoring fans at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.</p>
              <p>Instead, those same supporters have been expressing their anger at the terrorists responsible for the attacks that resulted in eight people, including two suicide bombers, being killed and over 50 injured.</p>
              <p>Some will be able to make it to Malaysia on Monday when United will tackle a slightly different version of the side Michael Owen's late goal allowed them to record a 3-2 win against in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
              <p>But the vast majority must wait for a visit by their favourites, which Gill hopes he can eventually provide.</p>
              <p>"Without doubt we would one day like to repay the loyalty of the Indonesian fans," he said.</p>
              <p>"We were looking forward to going there and if we can go back one day we would like to but we can't make a commitment because we only do these major tours every two years.</p>
              <p>"But we will look at it very seriously."</p>
              <p>One distraught fan claimed there were 28 million United fans in Indonesia. That may be a debatable point. Beyond question is that all 73,000 tickets for the game that should have taken place tomorrow were sold out three weeks ago.</p>
              <p>In addition to the disappointed fans, United have sponsors who will miss out on the team's visit, chief among them the mobile company 3 Indonesia, which was due to sponsor the game.</p>
              <p>"It is disappointing on every count," said Gill.</p>
              <p>"We do have partners in Indonesia but they are not with us for one game.</p>
              <p>"They are with us for the long term because they believe associating with Manchester United is beneficial to their business.</p>
              <p>"I am sure we will work with them to address any issues they have.</p>
              <p>"I think they will understand why we have made this decision and will stick with us."</p>
              <p>It is anticipated barely 15,000 will take advantage of the cut-price ticket offer to watch United in Malaysia again, although such is the fervour supporters in the region reserve for their team, a bigger attendance cannot be ruled out.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils would have attracted far more - and a guaranteed £1million - if they had taken up an offer to visit Australia.</p>
              <p>However, the prospect of a nine-hour flight from Malaysia and then one of over 13 hours back to Seoul, where United are due to play on Friday, made it a non-starter.</p>
              <p>"We looked at a number of possibilities, one was bringing the Indonesian side to Malaysia, and also an offer from Australia," said Gill.</p>
              <p>"But realistically, none of it could have been arranged in time and the team wanted another game."</p>
