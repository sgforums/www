              <p><strong>CELEBRITY Reds fans and Old Trafford idols paid tribute to Ryan Giggs at a star-studded premiere of a film about his life. </strong></p>
              <p>"Ryan Giggs - True Red", takes an in-depth look at the winger's stellar 17 years as a professional at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The
              film, soon to be released as a DVD, was launched at the Odeon in the
              Printworks, and drew stars from the worlds of football, pop, and
              television.</p>
              <p>As the guests made their way up the red carpet, fans lined the barriers, clamouring for a glimpse of their idols.</p>
              <p>The event had all the atmosphere of a party in honour of Giggs' unique achievements.</p>
              <p>And
              the guest list was not simply a who's who of the Manchester United
              first team with celebrity fans including Ian Brown, Angus Deayton and
              Peter Hook joining the fray.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.thespoiler.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/truered.thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="348"></p>
              <p>But the club was also out in force with Carlos
              Tevez, Ronaldo, Wes Brown, Rio Ferdinand, Anderson, Nani, Patrice Evra,
              Nemanja Vidic, Park Ji-Sung, Dimitar Berbatov, Owen Hargreaves, Jonny
              Evans, John O'Shea Michael Carrick all in attendance.</p>
              <p>Looking back to his days as YTS trainee at the club,
              Ryan told the MEN: "Back then I could never have dreamed what my career
              would be like. At that age, I just wanted to get onto the first team
              and had no idea I would spend 17 years at the club. My years at United
              have been unbelievable, I've been fortunate to play in such a
              successful period for the side.</p>
              <p>"When people mention my names alongside the club's
              legends it does feel great, especially for someone like me who moved to
              Salford at the age of seven, grew up in the area, played for Salford
              Boys and then for Manchester United. You can't describe it."</p>
              <p>The Reds' heroes of today were joined by their chief
              executive David Gill, and former captain Bryan Robson, who said: "Ryan
              hasn't just made a great contribution to the club, but also to
              football. For any young kids who want to be a professional football,
              Ryan is the one to look up to."</p>
              <p>Among the stars to stop and chat was Nemanja Vidic,
              who said: "It's a pleasure to know Ryan - he's great player and a great
              person."</p>
              <p>Joking that 'all the best Manchester bands support
              Manchester United', rock star Ian Brown told the MEN: "Ryan Giggs is
              the greatest player Manchester United has ever had. There's no-one like
              Ryan. He's what footballers ought to be - a proper role model for kids
              as boy and man. The sheer number of games he's played for the club
              speaks volumes."</p>
              <p>Liam Fray, of the Courteeners, is another rock star fan of Ryan's.</p>
              <p>The
              singer said: "Ryan has been an inspiration to everyone at the club. I
              was a ball boy for United as a kid and Ryan was a true gentleman, the
              model professional and a great ambassador for the club."</p>
              <p>TV stars Angus Deayton, Max Beesley and Cleveland
              Campbell were also at the premiere, alongside Michael Le Vell,
              Coronation Street's Kevin Webster. Former Royle Family star Ralf
              Little, who stars in new show Massive, narrates 'True Red'.</p>
              <p>The actor told the MEN: "I'm a Red so it was a great
              honour to work on the film. The effect Ryan has had on the club can't
              be measured.</p>
              <p>"Any time they've had a bad run, it's usually
              because they are missing Ryan Giggs. So many people in the modern game
              have a lot of attitude but Ryan is someone who has achieved so much and
              yet is an incredibly humble, easygoing guy."</p>
              <p>Will Mellor, soon to appear in new BBC show Merlin,
              said: "It's about time they got 'True Red' out on DVD because that's
              exactly what he is. I'm a bit gutted they asked Ralf Little and not me
              to do the DVD."</p>
