            <div class='col-md body'>Michael Carrick says Manchester United are not looking over their shoulders at the title threat posed by Chelsea.<br><br>United currently hold a six-point lead over the reigning champions after both clubs picked up away wins at the weekend.<br><br>Chelsea briefly reduced the advantage to three points by beating Charlton Athletic 1-0, but the leaders responded by thrashing Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 just 24 hours later.<br><br>Carrick is delighted with his side's current form and insists the club's focus is not being distracted by events at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"Chelsea's challenge was always going to be strong and it could be stronger now they have Terry and Cech back in the side," said Carrick.<br><br>"But it's not something we focus on.<br><br>"We're in a good position. We've earned that and we don't want to let it slip. It's up to us to get a good result every week.<br><br>"Chelsea have played well in big games and I think there will still be plenty of twists and turns.<br><br>"We didn't feel any pressure after Chelsea had closed the gap on Saturday.<br><br>"It's up to us what we do and we know if we win the right amount of games we will win the league.<br><br>"We are not looking over our shoulder and worrying about Chelsea. I think we showed that we are good enough to go away from home when the pressure is on and get the result."</div>
