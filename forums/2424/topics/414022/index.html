              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON has stepped up his plan to get Manchester United stars to commit to Old Trafford by offering John O'Shea a £16.5million contract.</h2>
              <p>The United boss followed Wayne Rooney's deal by getting Patrice Evra to agree to a big contract as revealed exclusively in yesterday's SunSport.</p>
              <p>Now defender O'Shea is being tied down.</p>
              <p>His £80,000-a-week four-year deal is modest compared with Rooney's £250,000 and it trails Evra's £100,000.</p>
              <p>But O'Shea, 29, will have no complaints. This third contract deal also lets United fans know the club will do all it can to fight off any raids from Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Old Trafford chief executive David Gill said: "We have a policy that wages should be 50 per cent or less of turnover.</p>
              <p>"We believe we can do that and still retain and attract the stars we need. That's a sensible model. Clubs have other models. Each to their own."</p>
              <p>Ferguson moved as O'Shea had just one year left of his contract.</p>
              <p>As well as Rooney, Evra and O'Shea, Anderson will also be getting a new deal.</p>

              <p><br>This is not right, O'shea don't deserve this wage, he is just an utility player. He is not that good. I think Park deserves the 80,000 more than O'shea. Waste of money, more well spend on buying youth potentials. I say O'shea deserves only 40,000 a week, but even that it is regarded very high in EPL terms.</p>

              <p>I heard Wayne got a good deal ... John O'Shea enters negotiations. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</p>
              <p>Question: how do you make paying <strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> £250,000 per week seem reasonable? Answer: Pay <strong>John O'Shea</strong> £80,000 per week. So that's what Manchester United are about to do, according to the Sun. Ta-da! "O'Shea hit's the jackpot!" roars the redtop and it's true that the Irish defender-cum-midfielder-cum-substitute is in luck. For when other utility men are seeking extra money they have to scrawl an ad on a piece of paper and post it on the notice board of their local greengrocer's, where it competes for the attention of passersby with ads for "sensual massages from 18-year-old oriental girls" whose handwriting looks curiously masculine and non-smoking professionals wanted to share a two-bedroom flat close to local amenities, which may or may not include sensual 18-year-old oriental masseuses with curiously masculine handwriting.</p>
              <p>It remains a matter of some uncertainty as to whether the Glazers will allow any more money to be spent after all the contract extensions but some folks clearly believe they will: and that's good news for Sir Alex Ferguson's long-time penpal <strong>Steven Defour</strong>, who will finally be brought to Old Trafford from Standard Liège in January. Mind you, that deal could be funded by the sales of <strong>Michael Carrick</strong> and <strong>Darron Gibson</strong>, with the former a target for Fulham and the latter highly fancied by WBA and Sunderland.</p>
              <p><strong>Tomasz Kuszczak</strong>, meanwhile, may as well start cavorting in his local greengrocer's, it seems. Because reports in Italy claim that when <strong>Gianluigi Buffon</strong> recovers from his hernia bother, he'll not resume playing for Juventus but will instead hightail it to United. Goal.com, meanwhile, insists the keeper United really want is <strong>Shay Given</strong>, who, the site claims, was offered to them as a make-weight in the proposed Rooney-to-City transfer. That didn't go through, as you may have heard, but the Given-to-United bit is still on, or so say the very same sources that said Rooney was definitely on his bike last week.</p>
              <p>City's suits, meanwhile, are standing excitedly around one of those big cashometers that Blue Peter used to have to gauge donations and jibbering excitedly about how close they are to reaching Sheikh Mansour's personal splurge-target of one billion pounds. There's just a little over £400m to go but market observers are optimistic that City may find a way to pay around that much in January, when synchronised swoops will take place for Sporting Lisbon's 21-year-old defender <strong>Daniel Carrico</strong>, Lazio's Romanian full-back <strong>Stefan Radu</strong> and former United flop <strong>Diego Forlán</strong>.</p>
              <p>Roma would quite like it if City, or anyone else for that matter, offered even three old lira for all-too-easily inflatable Brazilian striker <strong>Adriano</strong>. The Italian giants are not big enough to accommodate the Brazilian striker, nor rich enough to pay him £4m a year not to play, and are desperate to ease the strain on their payroll and dug-out. In fact, their payroll is currently so onerous that they are also contemplating selling star man <strong>Mirko Vucinic</strong>. Internazionale are interested. So, of course, are City.</p>
              <p>David Moyes, meanwhile, is confident of beating the smurfish Dider Deschamps in a fight, and it may just come to that, so badly do both Everton and Marseille want the 23-year-old Espanyol midfield schemer <strong>José Callejón</strong>.</p>
              <p>Swindon's <strong>Sean Morrison</strong> is causing ructions, too, as QPR, Newcastle and Sunderland all jostle for his signature.</p>
              <p>At Shakhtar Donetsk, meanwhile, the Croatia defender <strong>Darijo Srna</strong> is showing that the lessons of the Rooney sage can be applied anywhere, and has put his contract talks on hold while letting it be known that several clubs, including Chelsea and City, would be willing to lavish riches upon him.</p>

              <p>People fail to realise that O'Shea is a United player all along and he has been there for a long time already... He has done his fair share to their success over the years...  </p>
              <p>I belief his new salary is because of the years he have been there... This being his 3rd contract and as we know, an increment usually comes along with a new contract...</p>
              <p>But I think some are missing the bigger picture here...  Players need to feel they have a future at the club and the club need to show it reward its players too. Otherwise, no player would want to stay with the club for too long. Look at Arsenal as one good example, Players who reach 27, 28 might want to leave as the club have a history of getting rid of them when they reach around 30...</p>
              <p>O'Shea isn't a bad player... And he certainly helps a lot being able to play in so many different positions...  Anyway, those who thinks he salary is too high, may need to think again should he leave on a free as the club still need to buy another replacement...  Even at $10m, you might only get someone like Smalling, still inexperienced... O'Shea's pay comes up to about $4m a season only... So if the club go out and purchase another player + his weekly salary, I think it probably might cost more... And also, O'Shea is a good nature player who never give Fergie any problem whether he gets to play or not over the last 10 yrs... These are important qualities for team harmony.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, i think you should be rewarded not based solely on loyalty but on performance as well.</p>
              <p>Take Neville for example. He was downhill all the way since he took over Keane as the captain. Yes, I know his contribution back in the 90s and early millenium but does it ever occur to you that he's a good leader?</p>
              <p>I think by extending his contract in recent years, Fergie has shown others the dependent on his old guard instead of blooding new ones in. Players like Phil Bardsley and Danny Simpson shown great potential to replace Neville but alas, both were sold and Neville got retained time and again. It is painful to see him play, you'll never know what stupid acts he'll commit (giving Bayern a freekick in last years Champions League and should have been sent off against Stoke, it would have been difficult to win with 10 men)</p>
              <p>O'Shea has been very very shaky this term. I think majority would agree he and Evans are the weakest link in defence. O'Shea was a class act in his early years and if i remembered correctly, he won the reserve/academy best award. But look what happened as time passes?</p>
              <p>I think it's unfair to compare with Arsenal. Look at the number of players in their 30s and hitting 30s at United? Look at Scholes, Giggs and Van der Sar. Look at Rio, Vidic and Berbatov. I think the message take should be sent across is "Keep up your playing level, look after your private life and leave the rest to United" not "United will stick with you thick and thin no matter how cui you perform".</p>
              <p>O'Shea is going downhill and there might not be a need to have a new signing where there is an academy still fully functioning.</p>

              <p>Of course not solely based on loyalty, No one is suggesting that alone otherwise the likes of Phil Neville, Butt, Beckham, Greening, Eagles, Bardsley, Kieran Richerdson, Campbell etc... all would still be around right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who like to pick on Gary Neville, maybe we should think his contribution on the pitch might no longer be as good as before but I am sure Fergie didn't keep him there for nothing... His influence in the dressing room and being Fergie's eyes and ears is just as important for a team to function well... His seniority in there gives him that advantage over the younger ones... Just like you don't expect Rafael to go up to Carrick or even Anderson to question them cos he is only a 19 yrs old and hasn't been at the club for very long... So who is going to give him any real respect seriously ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fergie has run the club in a fashion where he always had a few senior players helping him out... From Robson to Cantona to Bruce to Keane to Neville and in the future Vidic and perhaps a few others... United are a squad that have many young players and they will need some senior ones to guide them along the way until they become senior players themselves like in the case of O'Shea and Evra...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The players you mentioned the Phil Bardsley and Danny Simpson shown great potential at a younger age but Neville wasn't the one that kept them out of the team... Over the last 3 to 5 yrs there was Brown, then O'Shea, then Rafael too... They left or were sold cos either they couldn't make the grade as a first team member or they didn't had enough patience... Seriously, would you prefer either one of them to Brown and O'Shea during those days? I wouldn't honestly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On Evans, he hasn't had a great season yet but he had good ones before this... The review on him earlier was a good young defender many United fans have also praised him when he first came on... He was ahead of Pique at that time too. So what happen? He is having a poorer season so far but it does not mean he is finished... For all we know, he may recover his form or he may be sold... I trust Fergie and his coach will assess him and decide what to do next with him...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And on those players you mentioned hitting 30s at United... Well, I am glad you brought up their names... Most of them have hit well past 30s, 2 of them in their mid 30s and one even reach 40... But they are definitely still doing a decent job... Giggs was 34 when he was voted Player of the year... VDS top 5 keepers 2 yrs ago only and Scholes Player of the month for Aug or Sep if I am correct... If the club had a policy to sell them for whatever little fee they could earn before they hit 30, these players might no longer be around... And even if the club didn't sell them, they might not want to stay at a club which won't give them any security... They might have all walked away to another club willing to give them a longer contract before they reach 30 or at 30...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A team is not just those who takes to the pitch on matchdays... It's a whole lot more than that... So, Neville may not be good on the pitch, but he may be one of the most important member to Fergie off it we never know...</p>
