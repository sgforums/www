              <p><strong>Pinched arms might be a common complaint in the United treatment room this summer as players young and old come to terms with their surroundings.<br><br></strong>Federico Macheda and Michael Owen in particular could be forgiven for wandering around Asia in a state of disbelief - twelve or even six months ago, neither could have contemplated leading the Reds' attack, let alone together. But that was the situation in Kuala Lumpur on Monday evening local time, and Kiko is clearly grateful for every opportunity.<br><br>"I have to thank Sir Alex because without him I wouldn’t have the chance to play in the first team," Kiko told <strong><em>MUTV</em></strong>. "I know I have to work hard and make sure he gives me more chances."<br><br>Macheda is driven to take opportunities on and off the field, which includes maximising the time he spends training and playing with new signing Owen - his fellow scorer in Monday's 2-0 win over the Malaysian XI. <br><br>"It’s very important for me to learn from Michael because he is one of the best strikers. If I work with him and learn, I can get better, day after day."<br><br>Sir Alex not only <a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BF9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114%7D&amp;newsid=6636516"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">praised Kiko after Monday's match</span></span></a>, he also spoke highly of the Italian earlier on the Asia Tour.</p>
              <p>In an interview with <strong><em>PA Sport</em></strong>, the manager said:<br><br>"Macheda is top drawer, a hero in the making, just as Cristiano Ronaldo was.<br><br>"He does not have the lightning reactions of Ronaldo but he is quick around the box and he has an eye for goal. He was way in front of everyone with his finishing in training the other day - and I mean everyone. It was magnificent to see.<br><br>"It is hard to believe he is just 17. We probably need to check his birth certificate because I reckon he is at least 28!"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Federico Macheda scored his second goal in as many starts on the pre-season tour of Asia in the 3-2 win over FC Seoul, prompting Sir Alex to declare that the 17-year-old Italian striker can make a real impact at Old Trafford this season.<br><br></strong>Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen may be Sir Alex's main striking options, but Macheda's rapid adaptation to first-team life means he is knocking on the door. The United boss has already highlighted Kiko as "a hero in the making", saying that he can make a similar impact as Cristiano Ronaldo did as a young emerging talent.<br><br>"The goal Macheda scored was excellent," the boss said at his post-match press conference. "The lad has a real chance. His movement is very good and he does well when he gets onto the shoulder of the last defender.<br><br>"He took his goal very well. It’s pleasing to see our strikers scoring – obviously the main players are Rooney, Berbatov and Owen and I’m very comfortable with that. But if Macheda continues his progress then it gives me a big advantage. An extra player like that will do us the world of good."<br><br>The Reds were twice behind against FC Seoul, who provided a more demanding test of United's fitness than in previous matches against a Malaysia XI. Rooney and Macheda got the equalisers before Berbatov scored the winner. "It was a very good, open and entertaining game," added the boss. "Without question FC Seoul gave us our most difficult game so far. I enjoyed it.<br><br>"The match was played at a good pace and good intensity. It’s the type of game we needed. I’m pleased with the result and pleased with the quality of the match."</p></div>

              <h3><strong>FEDERICO MACHEDA is to sign a new contract after Manchester United confirmed talks will take place with the striker before the start of the season.</strong> </h3>
              <p>Macheda, whose dramatic impact against Aston Villa and Sunderland last season helped secure the Premier League title, is still on his first professional contract with the club.</p>
              <p>The Italian scored his first goal of Manchester United's pre-season tour on Friday against FC Seoul and is now considered to be one of four main strikers at the club - and will be offered a £20k-a-week deal.</p>
