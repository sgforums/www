              <h3 class="padding-bottom-7">ALEX FERGUSON landed Robin van Persie last night for £22million.</h3>
              <p>And he promised him the chance to form a dream partnership at Manchester United with Wayne Rooney.</p>
              <p>Van Persie will travel to Old Trafford today for a medical after agreeing terms of just over £200,000 a week.</p>
              <p>As SunSport said on Tuesday, boss Fergie hoped to complete the transfer before the big kick-off this weekend.</p>
              <p>Van Persie, 29, who refused to sign a new deal at Arsenal, has been told he will be played at United as an out-and-out striker.</p>
              <p>Rooney will operate in a free role behind him.</p>
              <p>Fergie had feared Manchester City could still land RVP. City boss Roberto Mancini had insisted that the club were no longer in a position to secure him but United believed this was not the case.</p>
              <p>Rooney was also delighted at the news and took to twitter to taunt celebrity Arsenal fan Piers Morgan.</p>
              <p>He said: “Arrrr, poor Piers. what’s up now, big man?”</p>
              <p>Morgan responded by calling Roo “the No 2 striker at Old Trafford”.</p>
              <p>United will pay £15m cash up front with the fee rising to a guaranteed £22m. But, depending on other add-ons, Arsenal could still land £24m.</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: “It’s sad to lose a player of his quality. He had a year left on his deal so we didn’t have the choice.”</p>
              <p>When asked if he would spend on new players, Wenger said: “We’ve already recruited to replace him.”</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In a club statement, the Gunners said: “Van Persie will travel up to Manchester on Thursday so he can agree terms and complete a medical ahead of the proposed transfer.” </strong></p>
              <p>A spokesman for United added: “We are pleased to announce we’ve reached agreement with Arsenal for the transfer of Robin Van Persie.”</p>
              <p>United midfielder Tom Cleverley was told the news after playing in England’s 2-1 win against Italy last night.</p>
              <p>And he said: “He’s a great player — he can only make us strong.”</p>

              <p>The financial fair play rules won't apply much to them as they have a over $100m annual profit to back them. It's those like Chelsea and City who hasn't got a huge commercial income and are back artificially that the rules are aim at.</p>
              <p>Anyway, United have takeover debts, Arsenal also have a $100m stadium debts yet to clear... Chelsea and City obviously don't have any... Spurs are probably manage the best in terms of accounting matters but not on pitch tho.</p>

              <p>Welbeck and Hernandez can stay as they need back-ups as welll as Carling cup players. Berbatov and Macheda can be sold as United don't need so many strikers anymore... They have most likely added teenage Chilean kid striker Henriquez as well. So a good mix of strikers they got for the new season.</p>
              <p>Still can't believed they manage to get Robin. Thought it was just rumours at the start and even if they wanted, chances were he would go to City at the end of the day. But keep fingers crossed as the deal isn't done yet until it's completed...</p>

              <p><span>Wenger has the best part of two weeks to spend some of the money before the transfer window is closed. He said on French TV on Wednesday night: ‘It’s sad to lose a player of his quality. He had only one year left on his contract so we didn’t have the choice.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Asked who he would recruit, Wenger said: 'We already signed Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud.' </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Robin van Persie said he had listened to 'the little boy inside him' when deciding to join Manchester United.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The Dutch superstar will wear the No 20 shirt after completing his £24million switch from Arsenal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He has signed a four-year contract worth an incredible £250,000 per week - the same terms handed to Wayne Rooney two years ago.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Speaking at his official unveiling press conference, he said: 'In these situations, when you have to make a hard decision in your life, I always listen to that little boy inside me. What does he want? That boy was screaming for Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Everyone knows me by now. I love football. I am quite principled in that perspective. It is always difficult to find the perfect match but I do feel this is the perfect match for me.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Manchester United breathes football. If you look at all the players from Manchester United, the stadium and manager, my choice was made very soon.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Earlier, he said: 'It’s an honour to sign for Manchester United. I am looking forward to following in the footsteps of so many great strikers, bringing my experience and playing my part to help the team compete for the biggest trophies in the game. I can’t wait to get started.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">His new strike partner Rooney posted on Twitter: '@Persie_Official welcome to manchester united mate.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Van Persie, who could now make his debut at Everton on Monday night, arrived at Manchester United's training ground on Friday morning to sign his new £12million-a-year contract.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">The Dutch international underwent a medical in Manchester on Thursday night before spending the night in a Cheshire hotel.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The 29-year-old was then taken to United's training ground at 9am to meet his new team-mates and sign the astonishing £250,000-a-week deal that will give him parity at the club with Rooney.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Van Persie then trained with his new club and is expected to go straight in to the team for the season's opener at Everton on Monday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Sir Alex Ferguson said: 'Robin is a world-class striker with a proven record in England and in European football. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'His talents need no introduction to our fans – he has scored a number of goals against us in some classic battles with his former club. His movement, finishing and all-round ability are outstanding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He later told MUTV: 'The boy wanted to come. He turned down various clubs. If he hadn't told Arsenal he wanted to go to Manchester United, the transfer wouldn't have happened.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Ferguson admitted he thought it would be impossible to get Van Persie to sign, but had to make an attempt when the striker did not sign a new contract with the north London club.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>'It has given everyone a lift,' said Ferguson. 'I have a complication to my life (selection). I don't know how I managed in 1999.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'They can gel together. Robin's best position is furthest up the pitch. The most important thing is to win what we want to win. These players can help us to do that.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">At the press conference, Ferguson added: 'We never thought we could get Van Persie. If you go back six months ago, I couldn't see us getting him.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I thought Arsenal are not going to let him go. When I read he had refused a new contract, that is when we acted. It has been a long haul.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Even so, it took a personal intervention from Ferguson to get the deal moving last week after it had apparently stalled permanently.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I can't elaborate but it was amicable,' said the Scot. 'Arsene knew the boy wanted to leave. He knew he wanted to join us. That made it a bit easier but not in terms of trying to reduce the fee.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'He (Wenger) could run a poker school in Govan. He got a great price but we are also happy the matter is concluded. From the starting position when we first started negotiating, Arsene has done well.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Ferguson revealed he was still looking at a new signing for 'one more position' but 'only if a certain player came available'.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Van Persie's old Arsenal team-mate Cesc Fabregas tweeted: 'As a friend and team mate of mine for the last 8 years i want to wish good luck to @Persie_Official and his new adventure at Man United.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">An Arsenal statement read: 'Arsenal Football Club can confirm that Robin van Persie has now completed a transfer to Manchester United after terms were agreed between the clubs.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'This ends Robin’s eight-year association with Arsenal, after joining the Gunners from Dutch side Feyenoord in May 2004.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'His fantastic performances during the 2011/12 campaign resulted in the PFA (Professional Footballers’ Association) and FWA (Football Writers’ Association) Player of the Year awards, together with the Premier League Golden Boot.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Van Persie also became a regular in the Netherlands national team during his time with Arsenal, making 68 appearances to date.<br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">United fought off competition from Manchester City and Juventus to bring the Dutch striker to Old Trafford and hope he will be able to feature against Everton on Monday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">On Thursday, Ferguson claimed United will possess arguably Europe's most fearsome strike force when van Persie arrives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Ferguson has spoken about the new-look attacking options of Van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Javier Hernandez, and the comparisons with the 1999 set of Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</span></p>
