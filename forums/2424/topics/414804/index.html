              <p><strong>Sir Alex's 24th anniversary as United manager was fittingly crowned with one of the hallmarks of his remarkable reign - a winning goal deep into injury time.<br><br></strong>Ji-sung Park produced it, to add to his first-half opener, as the Reds overcame a lengthy injury list and positive opposition to claim a third consecutive league victory. <br><br>"We've done it so many times and you have to admire the perseverance of the team, the never say die [spirit]," Sir Alex told MUTV.<br><br>"It was a long struggle. Given the changes I had to make, trying to get the continuity of performance was difficult today.<br><br>"I thought Wolves were the better team in the first half, they played very well but we got a great goal right on half-time and I thought that would settle us. In the second half we were the better team. We lost a bad goal on our part but went on to get a late winner."<br><br>The manager revealed that not even his starting eleven were fully fit, following a virus that swept through his playing staff and affected him too.<br><br>"Some players played with touches of flu and others with diarrhoea, so we've done really well to get a result," said Sir Alex. "This morning we had to check on Patrice Evra, Paul Scholes and Nemanja Vidic, they were all under the weather.<br><br>"Nemanja in particular did well to play in that game, Patrice battled on and I was only going to use Paul if I needed to. I did need to and he did well."<br><br>Park takes most of the plaudits though for a fine performance, capped by two clinical goals at crucial times. Sir Alex reflected:</p>
              <p>"Right on half-time and right on the final whistle are amazing times to score. ButÂ Ji's in great form actually, he's been one of our best players in recent weeks. It was another really good performance from him today."</p>
