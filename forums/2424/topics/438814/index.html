              <p>Anderson was lost the entire game.....unsure of how to make those incisive passes. Jones looks out of position at times, Evans too.

              <p>I will take any win, whether its due to luck.</p>
              <p>Remember that year when Arsenal went though the entire season with no defeats? Actually they came very close on losing on some occasions and they needed luck to pull a draw or a win.</p>
              <p>So, doesnt matter United played badly or not, a win is a win. Any United fans will take it on any day.</p>

              <p>Well, it's still a good win but United's defence must improve cos their next 2 matches is against Liverpool away and City at home...</p>
              <p>United need Vidic back asap or at least Smalling as Evans isn't very comforting and Valencia covering the right-back spot is kind of playing out of position for me...</p>
              <p>If no Vidic but got Smalling also will help as Smalling and Rio in the centre and Jones on the right-back will be good enough i belief.</p>
              <p>I find Jones's positioning in the centre-back isn't as good as Smalling's... Sometimes he leave his centre-back position and he doesn't get back in leaving Rio or whoever partner him alone... Yesterday there was one incident where he did it again and Evans was alone... Jones just stop running after the centre circle waiting for the ball to come back to start another attack but he fail to realise should Evans fail to win the tackle and instead foul the Norwich striker, he would be deem as the 'last man' and could get send-off for it... If Jones just kept his run back beyond the level of Evans, even if he foul the striker it wouldn't be in danger of a sending off offence...</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Jones is a great buy but he just need to learn from experienced i guess...</p>
              <p>To be honest, of the 3 purchases for this season, I still can't make up my mind who is the best buy cos all 3 are great additions... De Gea started a little slow but he has since done well... Young seems like he has been a United player for years... and Jones energy and enthusiasm is just so compelling...</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex has explained why David De Gea and Ashley Young did not feature in the 2-0 win against Norwich.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds' No1 was left out in favour of Anders Lindegaard, who made his Barclays Premier League debut, while winger Young did not make the bench but should be fit to represent England in the crunch Euro 2012 qualifier in Montenegro next Friday.</p>
              <p>"It was an opportunity to play Anders because he doesn't have a game for two weeks," the boss revealed to <em><a href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUTV</span></span></a></em>. "He goes away with Denmark but he’s not in the team whereas David's got two games with Spain's Under-21s. So it was a good opportunity to give Anders a turn.</p>
              <p>"Ashley got a little knock and it wasn't worth risking him because of the games we've got coming up, including Liverpool in two weeks' time. There are internationals of course but I think he'll be okay for England, he should be alright. He just wasn't right today."</p>

              <p>watched the replay last monday.. MUFC is not as bad as some made them out.</p>
              <p>Jones is young, and a hothead, and his occassionally drive into the box, must be picked up by SAF. But given he is doing it, means SAF doesn't feel the needs to stop it. Actually, his cross from RB position also quite good, if only welbeck can reach it..</p>
              <p>one thing about the GK, he got luck man.. the ball deflected off anderson, and off the post, and everyone is about to shout "goal" and it bounced clear. Sometimes, GK needs that..</p>
              <p>Evans is quite solid, he doesn't have the spotlight, but he is doing his own business the quiet way. But against someone like Jones or Smalling, who are in the spotlight, he gets marganlised.</p>
              <p>Read Fletcher is down again, hopefully, he can recover well.</p>
