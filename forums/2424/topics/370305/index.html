              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson saw plenty of promise in his first look at Antonio Valencia in a United shirt.<br><br></strong>The Ecuadorian winger scored in the Reds’ 2-1 win over Boca Juniors, and although Sir Alex wasn’t entirely happy with the team’s overall performance he was pleased with the contribution of his summer signing from Wigan Athletic.<br><br>“I thought we were poor. It was a disappointing team performance,” Sir Alex told <strong>MUTV</strong>. “Boca pressed the ball and it was something we weren’t used to from the Far East games. No disrespect to the Far East teams, but that was a real game for us tonight in that sense. We’re back in the real world and hopefully we’ll come on from this game.<br><br>“There were positive moments though,” he added. “We were very satisfied with Antonio’s first game. He had to go back to Ecuador to get his work permit and that meant he missed some of the pre-season work, but he has shown that he has good talent, balance and he’s a good athlete. So we have got something to work with there.”<br><br>The boss was also pleased with the performances from the two youngest Reds on the pitch. Teenagers Craig Cathcart, who stepped in after Nemanja Vidic picked up an injury in the warm-up, and Fabio both excelled. “Craig Cathcart made his first appearance for the first-team, and it was a very good night for him. And, of course, young Fabio is impressing all the time.”<br><br>Anderson’s brilliant free-kick also provided some joy for the manager. “It’s the miracle of Munich!” he joked. “But maybe it will spark the boy off, it might give him the incentive to shoot more.</p>
              <p>He’s got the talent, so hopefully he can do more.”<br><br>The only real negative from the match was injuries to Wes Brown and Vidic. “Wes got a little pull in his thigh and there’s no point carrying on in pres-season games. It was wise to just take him off. And Vidic pulled his calf muscle in the warm-up. Once again it’s our defenders falling down.”</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson says he will adapt United's tactics this season, identifying a need to readjust the team's approach in order to produce the goals that the departed Cristiano Ronaldo provided.<br><br></strong>“Obviously Cristiano is a big loss in terms of the goals he gave us,” said the gaffer in the new issue of Inside United (on sale 5 August). “But we’ll just have to find the goals from somewhere else, and our tactics will adjust accordingly. Fans will see us playing a slightly different style of football this season.”<br><br>Rather than ask Wayne Rooney to operate out wide, Sir Alex intends to play him up top alongside Michael Owen or Dimitar Berbatov, who the boss sees as being a key player this term.<br><br>“Last season was a strange one for Dimitar and we maybe didn’t use him in the right way, but we know exactly how to use him now – further up the pitch, playing as a centre forward,” said Sir Alex. “He’s had a first season to settle in, he can get us more than 20 goals.”<br><br>Whatever the formation United adopt for any given match, according to Ryan Giggs the players have the versatility to adapt.<br><br>“The team has adapted well to whatever system we've played, whether it’s 4-4-2 or three in midfield," he says. “We’ve got that flexibility in the squad. With Antonio Valencia coming in, it might be a bit more of a rigid 4-4-2 system, but we’ll have to see.”<br><br>The gaffer has emphasised the need for United to collectively step up to the goalscoring plate this season as well. The boss has set some demanding team and individual goal targets, challenging his men to reach the magic three figures.<br><br>“Usually you look to score about 100 goals in all</p>
              <p>competitions, so we’re aiming for that again,” Sir Alex said. “If we’re going to win the league again or do well in Europe we certainly need players to step up and help fill [the gap left by Ronaldo].<br><br>"Wayne’s capable of scoring 18 or more, and if Michael plays 25 games for me next season, I think he’ll get 15 goals.”<br><br>Beyond the three main strikers, Sir Alex demands an increased yield from the midfield, plus a contribution from the youngsters. <br><br>“Going back a few years, we could always guarantee goals from Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, who always pitched in with about 10 a season. Those goals from midfield have dried up a little in recent years, so we have to address that,” he said.<br><br>“I’ll be looking to Park, Nani, Valencia – even Welbeck and Macheda – to contribute 40 goals between them. The defenders will contribute a few from set-pieces too.”</p>
