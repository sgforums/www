            <div class='col-md body'>THE Glazer family are ready to consider bids for Manchester United - potentially throwing the club into off-field turmoil once more.<br><br>Less than three years after Malcolm Glazer finally won his controversial takeover battle in a deal that cost Â£831million, United's future is up in the air again.<br><br>Boardroom figures are privately conceding a sale in the short-term is likely after the Glazers realised United was not the cash cow they believed it would be.<br>Advertisement<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>If they sell, there is bound to be a period of uncertainty just as manager Sir Alex Ferguson would be aiming to build on the Premiership triumph.<br><br>Financial sources in the City last night confirmed feelers have started going out from Old Trafford because the takeover was proving so costly.<br><br>Malcolm Glazer paid Â£790m, plus legal fees of Â£41.3m, to win his drawn-out fight for control of the world's biggest club.<br><br>But to do so he borrowed a staggering Â£559m from City institutions. Last year, a refinancing package, organised by merchant bank JP Morgan, only came after the amount owed to hedge funds had grown by another Â£71m, leaving a total debt of Â£660m.<br><br>JP Morgan's fees for that transaction came to Â£90m - the cost of three Wayne Rooneys - and the club now faces annual repayments of Â£62m. That burden is wiping out the bulk of United's profits.<br><br>Despite the capacity of Old Trafford increasing to 76,000, escalating player wages and the need to continually invest in the squad - the Glazers promised Ferguson Â£25m each year plus an extra Â£25m one-off for a star signing - account for a huge chunk of income.<br><br>Fans were outraged by ticket prices for next season going up 14 per cent and the cost of home cup ties rising.<br><br>The relationship between the club's management and the Florida-based owners is becoming more and more of an issue and with Glazer seriously ill after a stroke last year and having to put control of the business in the hands of his sons, it seems he is increasingly looking for a way out.<br><br>United chief executive David Gill was said to have been in a "really bad mood" before United's FA Cup Final defeat, preoccupied by affairs at the club.<br><br>One well-placed City source said: "What we're all hearing is United hasn't turned out to be what the Glazers thought it was. When they paid so much, they were convinced a lot of money was to be made.<br><br>"Buying United wasn't about owning a football club, but a business decision and from an investment point of view it's been little short of disastrous."<br><br><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=for-sale--%26method=full%26objectid=19194911%26siteid=89520-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=for-sale--%26method=full%26objectid=19194911%26siteid=89520-name_page.html </a></div>

He'll drag on and on until the player's price keeps soaring and eventually signing the player 2X or more than the asking price.
