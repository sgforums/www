              <p><strong>United lead race to land wonderkid</strong><br>Manchester United are at the head of the queue for QPR wonder boy Raheem Sterling - and desperate to beat all of their big-money rivals. United's youth chief Brian McClair was a VIP guest at Sterling's under-18 game at the weekend as he made a final check on the kid who has been the talk of Rangers for a couple of months. Attacking midfielder Sterling, still just 15, was pencilled in for a record-breaking first-team game when Jim Magilton was in charge - and has also dazzled for England's young sides. Now McClair is targetting the whizz kid for an immediate move, beating off Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham who all want him. Sterling was born in Jamaica, but raised in London. He looks the best prospect for his age and United are keen to land a player who could be a household name for years to come. United and City are battling bitterly for top young talent just now and are also in a tug-of-war for Nigerian midfielder Azeez Ramon who was named the best in his position at the recent FIFA under-17 world cup.<br><em>Alan Nixon, Daily Mirror</em></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong> has branded <strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> 'world class' in recent weeks, but has also told his star striker exactly where he needs to hone his game. "Where I hope he improves more is with his predatory instinct in the penalty box," says the United manager. "He's still got to get to the levels of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Andy Cole and Ruud van Nistelrooy. If he got to that level he would be the best in the world."</p>
              <p>AC Milan manager <strong>Leonardo</strong> has offered to quit after the Rossoneri's Champions League defeat to United, according to <em>The Daily Mail</em>. "If the President wants, I will step aside," says the Brazilian. "All I need is the word."</p>

              <p><strong>Ben Foster was delighted to make his return to senior action in Tuesday's victory over West Ham, but admits he craves more minutes of playing time over the remainder of the season.</strong><br><br>The England international had a week to psyche himself up for his first start since November and, having made a couple of smart saves en route to a clean sheet, is now setting his sights on more action in order to play himself into England's World Cup squad.<br><br>"It's nice to get a run-out tonight," Foster told <strong>MUTV</strong>. "It was a good game for me to get involved in. West Ham have got a couple of big lads upfront and there's always a chance you're going to get some action. It was a good performance from the lads and a good result.</p>
              <p>"I knew maybe a week ago, the Boss told me so it gives you plenty of time to prepare mentally. Obviously I haven't played for a few months and it's nice to know you're going to be playing.</p>
              <p>"It's not nice when you're not even on the bench sometimes and you're not involved in the squad. With it being a World Cup year it's an important time, you need to be involved, but hopefully it's the start of a few more games coming my way.</p>
              <p>"That's all I can look forward to really. I think I need to play some more games. Obviously it's not down to me. If I get a chance, I've just got to do as well as I can do. That's all I can do at the moment."<br><br>Having played his way back into action, Foster concedes that it is unlikely he will be given the chance to reprise last season's Wembley heroics in this weekend's Carling Cup final, but his only concern is that United retain the trophy - whether he is involved or not.</p>
              <p>"I'm not really counting on anything like that (being involved), this is my first game in three months," he said. "It'd be a bit ambitious to expect to be playing in the final on Sunday as well. If I'm involved I'll be happy. But so long as we win the match and retain that trophy, we'll all be happy."</p>

              <p>Looking back at photographs from last year's Carling Cup final have provided Ben Foster with a timely reminder of how quickly footballing fortunes can change.</p>
              <p>With the aid of a specially assembled DVD, Foster famously became the penalty shoot-out hero against Tottenham, collecting man-of-the-match honours when Manchester United lifted the trophy.</p>
              <p>Although Sir Alex Ferguson will not officially announce his starting line-up for this season's showpiece with Aston Villa until an hour before kick-off, the best Foster can realistically hope for is a place on the bench.</p>
              <p>He might have started the season as United's first choice keeper when Edwin van der Sar broke a couple of fingers during a friendly in Munich.</p>
              <p>But after a couple of high-profile clangers, Foster has been relegated to third on the list, behind Van der Sar - who has just signed a one-year contract extension - and Tomasz Kuszczak - who took over from the Dutchman when he suffered a knee injury in November.</p>
              <p>It meant Foster was playing his first game for three months on Tuesday as he kept a clean sheet during the win over West Ham.</p>
              <p>So it is heartening to realise his present predicament might not be long-term.</p>
              <p>"I have not played in three months, so when I see pictures of myself holding the trophy and getting man-of-the-match it is really nice," he said.</p>
              <p>"You do appreciate it a lot more.</p>
              <p>"Being only 26, you do hope there will be a lot more times like that but that day especially is nice to look back on because it was so special for me."</p>
              <p>It was certainly one of the performances that helped bring Foster to the attention of Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>Also quite noticeable was the reaction Foster gave immediately after his last international, against Brazil in November.</p>
              <p>As it was his second England game on the trot, and Foster had by now begun his slide down the Old Trafford pecking order, the former Stoke keeper presumably felt he was entitled to point out that Capello deemed him the best for his country, while Sir Alex Ferguson rated him no better than number three at United.</p>
              <p>Whether Ferguson felt Foster deserved to be taught a lesson is unknown. But, within a fortnight - following the Champions League defeat to Besiktas - Foster began an extended exile, which did not even come to a merciful end during the January transfer window as many had predicted.</p>
              <p>Maybe somewhat wiser for the chastening experience, Foster has no intention of airing similar grievances again.</p>
              <p>However, in World Cup year, he is not scared to admit his desire to get on the plane to South Africa.</p>
              <p>"I really want to go to the World Cup," said.</p>
              <p>"It is a childhood dream of most footballers to go to the World Cup and I am no different.</p>
              <p>"I feel I have done fairly well when I have represented my country.</p>
              <p>"Playing against West Ham, and hopefully a few more before the end of the season should help. I can only do as well as I can in the games I am given."</p>
              <p>As the business end of the season approaches, Foster can only cross his fingers and hope Ferguson retains some kind of faith in him.</p>
              <p>A Premier League winners' medal would also be a welcome reward for his early-season endeavours.</p>
              <p>And, while Foster cannot collect one of those this weekend, he feels the outcome at Wembley may well have a bearing on how United's entire season unfolds.</p>
              <p>"If we could win it would give us a big boost," he said.</p>
              <p>"It has been a difficult season for many teams in the Premier League, especially the top four. You have not been able to predict the results almost since the season began.</p>
              <p>"To get that first title of the season would be a big boost for us. Hopefully we can all kick on from there.</p>
              <p>"If we can go on a nice little run in the Premier League, we can still retain the title."</p>
