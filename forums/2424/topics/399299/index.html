              <p>Manchester United striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=12724"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></span></a> has failed to live up to the reputation he made for himself at Tottenham, according to United legend Denis Law.</p>
              <p>Berbatov has managed to score just 26 goals in two seasons at Old Trafford and his performances have been widely criticised since his £30.75 million move from White Hart Lane in August 2008.</p>
              <p>''I don't want to knock him. He hasn't come up to the standard he set at Spurs, but when he was there he looked an extremely good player,'' Law told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>. ''He's always had that laid-back style, even when he was at Tottenham, and that's what the fans admired him for but now he gets criticised for it.''</p>
              <p>Law, who scored 237 goals in 404 United appearances, said he hoped Berbatov did not turn out to be another expensive misfit like £28 million midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron, who joined from Lazio in 1999 but lasted just two years at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>''He [Veron] looked an excellent player with Argentina and in Italy, but when he came to United he didn't do it,'' Law added. ''He was a commanding player, yet when he came to United he wasn't.''</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Berbatov has announced he will quit international football after speculation in the Bulgarian media suggested he had grown tired of continuing criticism.</p>
              <p>Berbatov, the team's captain for the past three years, will retire to focus more on his club football.</p>
              <p>''I came to the decision that as of now I have retired from the national team,'' he said. ''It wasn't a decision I took lightly and I have reconsidered several times. Everything has a beginning and an end and that is today.''</p>
              <p>''I feel exhausted and now there are many guys who can emerge from my shadow. For them the moment has come. You should always know when to stop. I haven't discussed it with my club team. I guess it will come out in England and Sir Alex (Ferguson) will call me.''</p>
              <p>Berbatov, who has made 74 international appearances, is Bulgaria's all-time leading scorer and netted his 48th goal for his country in a friendly against Malta.</p>

              <p>Do you see Bulgaria in World Cup? No? Thats because he's prolific when it comes to scoring against weaker nation during friendlies! No offense but name any player from Malta? Cant? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
