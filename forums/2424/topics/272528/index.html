            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Giggs: We deserved to win<br><br>Ryan Giggs says United were the better side and fully deserved Sunday's Community Shield victory.</strong><br><br>"I think we easily had the better chances over 90 minutes," he told MUTV. "We defended quite well and overall I'm pleased with our performance. It's always a tight game against Chelsea and there wasn't a lot in it."<br><br>Indeed, the game went to a penalty shootout after scores were tied at 1-1 after 90 minutes. It was Giggs who put the Reds in front on 35 minutes with a well-taken strike from 12 yards. Incredibly, it was the first goal the Welshman has scored at Wembley since he netted for England Schoolboys as a 14-year-old.<br><br>"I had a chance a little before I scored, which I should have tucked away," Giggs said.<br><br>"I tried not to make the same mistake with the next chance I got. There was some great play down the left, then Patrice Evra pulled it back and I just tried to get some height on the shot in order to get it over any defenders who may have been sliding in. It was great to see it go in."<br><br>Back in May, Giggs was a dejected onlooker as Chelsea climbed the steps to Wembley's Royal Box to receive the FA Cup. On Sunday, however, the 33-year-old was all smiles as United lifted a record 12th Community Shield.<br><br>"It was disappointing a couple of months ago, so it was obviously nice winning the game and getting the trophy."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Giggs other than the goal, did not do much...<br><br>perhaps it was the hot weather.. and well, it was 1-1..<br><br>but it seems MUFC was a bit more fitter to the ball.<br><br>And looking at how chelsea players were going to ground, maybe, more chicken feet or pig trotters to strengthen..</div>
