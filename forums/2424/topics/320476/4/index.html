              <h1>Surgery Imminent For Ronaldo</h1>
              <p>Manchester United's Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo could be going
              under the surgeon's knife in the next two to three days, according to
              Sky Sports News.<br> <br> Following the previously reported meeting yesterday between United
              representatives,  Ronaldo and members of Portugal's medical staff
              to discuss the necessary course of action to treat the winger's injury,
              Portugal's team doctor told Sky Sports News that Ronaldo is expected to
              be operated on at the weekend.<br> <br> The meeting with United officials is believed to have been the first
              time since the end of last season that Ronaldo, 23, has spoken to the
              Red Devils while Real Madrid's courtship of the player has been raging
              through the media.<br> <br> It is also understood that Ronaldo delayed the operation in order to go on holiday.<br> <br> Surgery will mean Ronaldo missing the pre-season training and match
              schedule, although United will be aiming to have him fit, available -
              and still a United player - when the 2008-09 Premier League campaign
              kicks-off on August 16th.<br> <br> United's first fixture is at home to Newcastle United that day.</p>

              <p><strong>Man Utd laugh-off latest Real-Ronaldo link</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United have described latest reports claiming that a move by Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid is imminent as 'utter nonsense' and insisted that the Portuguese winger is not for sale.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is expected to undergo surgery on an ankle early next week after he was seen by a specialist today and may miss the start of the new season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United, meanwhile, have been infuriated by a report today claiming that the 23-year-old will sign for Real within a matter of days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A club spokesman said: 'It is utter nonsense and totally laughable. Cristiano Ronaldo is not for sale.'</p>
              <p>Despite Ronaldo's desire to move and a huge fee of around £70million being on offer, United chiefs believe selling the player would cause huge disruption to the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apart from the effect on the team's playing style and formation, it would also send a signal that United are in some way a lesser team than Real.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Glazer family bought United because they viewed it as the biggest club in the world so they cannot afford to been seen as weaker than Real Madrid, one of their biggest European rivals, or in thrall to their star player.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The message chief executive David Gill has given to the Glazers is that if they stand firm on Ronaldo and neither sell him nor give him another big new contract then it will strike a major blow against player-power and have long-term future benefits for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no real financial incentive to the Glazers either - the club's profits are already covering their debt repayments easily so there is no requirement to raise new capital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they considered selling him, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson would argue that he would need all the £70million fee as transfer funds to replace his most valuable player.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Confirmation of Ronaldo's operation comes after a specialist echoed the view of medical staff from both United and the Portuguese FA that the ankle injury needs surgery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He could be out for up to six weeks, and could be out for the start of the season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United leave for their tour of South Africa on July 18 but Ronaldo was not going on the trip anyway.</p>

              <p>Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari has reiterated that he has no idea if

              <p>The Brazilian coach did have one message though, stating United will be
              a tough nut to crack with-or-without Ronaldo this season.</p>
              <p>“Whether Ronaldo stays or not is not my business,” said Scolari, speaking in English.</p>
              <p>“Ronaldo is one very fantastic player, fantastic, but he is not United’s only player.</p>
              <p>“Whether he goes or not, the league for Chelsea is very very difficult.”</p>

              When asked about the protracted wrangle over the 23-year-old's future,
              Blatter insisted players should be allowed to leave with impunity when
              they want to move clubs.</span></p>
              <p><span>"The important thing is, we should also protect the player," he told <em>Sky News</em>.</span></p>
              <p><span>"If the player wants to play somewhere else,
              then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he
              does not feel comfortable to play then it's not good for the player and
              for the club.</span></p>
              <p><span>"I'm always in favour of protecting the player and if the player, he wants to leave, let him leave."</span></p>
              <p><span>Blatter believes the issue raises interesting questions about the way transfers and contracts are dealt with in the game.</span></p>
              <p><span>"I think in football there's too much modern
              slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there, and
              putting them somewhere," he continued.</span></p>
              <p><span>"We are trying now to intervene in such cases.
              The reaction to the Bosman law is to make long-lasting contacts in
              order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave, then there is
              only one solution, he has to pay his contract." </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think this guy is seriously mad. If players just want to move cause they want, what's the point of a contract?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the contracts more of to discourage, but I think it should be ok if the player does want to. I support the idea to pay off the contract. But the payment has to be substantial to discourage and linked to performance.</div>
