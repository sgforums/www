              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CRISTIANO RONALDO has phoned Manchester United to say ‘I’ll be back’.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">SunSport can reveal that the Portuguese star dramatically made contact with Old Trafford for the first time in a month. Ronaldo, 23, has given United fans the news they most wanted by informing the club he would be going straight on holiday and would return, as instructed, for pre-season training.</p>
              <p class="article">His call makes it clear Ronaldo does not envisage any move to Real Madrid in the coming weeks. The player was told he must be back at United three weeks from the day Portugal’s interest in Euro 2008 ended — July 10 — and he has said he will be there.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo initially claimed he would return to Manchester this week for an exploratory ankle op. But he has delayed that to go on an immediate break. He is clearly having to accept that Alex Ferguson remains as determined as ever to keep him.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Boss Ferguson returns to work on Monday, after his holiday in the South of France. He believes he can talk the player round, as he did after the 2006 World Cup when the wing wizard first stated his interest in joining Real.</p>

              <p>I would literally expect the hairdryer treatment. if beckham got a boot in the face, I would expect Ronaldo to have stud marks on his face next.. HAHA.</p>
              <p>but surprisingly, SAF seems quite calm but given his age, a good break is needed to recharge those batteries.</p>

              <h1>Ronaldo Finds House In Spain</h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed it has been reported in various Spanish and
              Madrid-based newspapers that the Portugal international has already chosen a
              house in the Spanish capital.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              Manchester United winger is suggested to have decided upon a property in the
              district of Morajela, an upmarket area, which close to where Madrid’s president
              Ramon Calderon and head coach Bernd Schuster live.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Former
              United and Madrid star David Beckham was located in the area for the majority
              of his four-year spell at the Bernabeu.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In
              what has been a sensationally protracted transfer saga, Ronaldo was quoted last
              week as saying that he would be prepared to upset Sir Alex Ferguson to secure
              what would be a world-record transfer to Madrid, underlining his determination
              to secure his dream move.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ronaldo,
              who scored an incredible 42 goals in all competitions last season, stated after
              Portugal's elimination from the European Championship finals in Austria and
              Switzerland by Germany that he hoped to join the reigning Spanish champions,
              although a formal bid is yet to materialise with Calderon saying that his side
              can do nothing unless United initiate a move.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hopes
              of United fans who are still hoping that the player stays at Old Trafford were
              handed a boost this morning however, after it was reported by The Sun that Ronaldo
              is definitely prepared to return to Manchester for pre-season training, after
              his three-week holiday to Italy comes to an end.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">However,
              the report did state that although he would be fulfilling his contractual
              obligations with the European Champions, his desire for a move certainly hasn’t
              been dampened. </span></p>

              <h1>Ronaldo Finds House In Spain</h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Indeed it has been reported in various Spanish and Madrid-based newspapers that the Portugal international has already chosen a house in the Spanish capital.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Manchester United winger is suggested to have decided upon a property in the district of Morajela, an upmarket area, which close to where Madrid’s president Ramon Calderon and head coach Bernd Schuster live.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Former United and Madrid star David Beckham was located in the area for the majority of his four-year spell at the Bernabeu.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In what has been a sensationally protracted transfer saga, Ronaldo was quoted last week as saying that he would be prepared to upset Sir Alex Ferguson to secure what would be a world-record transfer to Madrid, underlining his determination to secure his dream move.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ronaldo, who scored an incredible 42 goals in all competitions last season, stated after Portugal's elimination from the European Championship finals in Austria and Switzerland by Germany that he hoped to join the reigning Spanish champions, although a formal bid is yet to materialise with Calderon saying that his side can do nothing unless United initiate a move.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hopes of United fans who are still hoping that the player stays at Old Trafford were handed a boost this morning however, after it was reported by The Sun that Ronaldo is definitely prepared to return to Manchester for pre-season training, after his three-week holiday to Italy comes to an end.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">However, the report did state that although he would be fulfilling his contractual obligations with the European Champions, his desire for a move certainly hasn’t been dampened.</span></p>

              <p>Don't belief what the Spanish newspaper say lah... This is just another one of Real's ways of disturbance... Always un-named Real source then when report them they say its not them who say it and blame it on the Press... Their usual behaviour...</p>

              <p class="introcopy"><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo is on the brink of a remarkable U-turn to declare his allegiance to Manchester United after publicly revealing his “dream” to join Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Ronaldo has told close friends and advisers he is unhappy at Real’s public prevaricating. He was expected to give a full explanation of why he wants to go to Madrid “within days” but is now said to be reviewing his future afresh. </p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">And United sources are hinting at a change in their hard-line approach to an improved contract. It is possible United could lock Ronaldo into a new image-rights deal plus a new contract that could take him close to the £200,000-a-week mark. </p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">A United spokesman said: “We have not changed our position – Ronaldo is not for sale.” </p>
