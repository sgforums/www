              <h1>Calderon: United Have No Evidence To Back Complaint</h1>
              <p>The Premier League and European champions sent Fifa a formal letter of
              complaint about Real Madrid's behaviour regarding their reported
              interest in the Portugal winger. World football's governing body
              confirmed they had received the complaint from United on Monday.<br> <br> But Calderon appears to be quite relaxed about the affair. Speaking of
              United's complaint he told journalists at a meeting today: “They don’t
              have any evidence because nothing has happened.<br> <br> “All there is is what the papers say and rumours that the player seems
              to want to leave. But at the moment a move is impossible because United
              don’t want to sell him.<br> <br> “It’s United’s right [to complain] but we haven’t done anything and we
              are not going to do anything. It’s a matter between the player and his
              club.”<br> <br> Madrid have made no secret of their admiration for Ronaldo in recent
              weeks through a number of public statements, and even appeared to be
              urging him to demand a transfer from United, while at the ame time
              acknowledging that the object of their affections is still a contracted
              employee of the Manchester club.</p>

              <h1>Wright To Ronaldo: I'm Embarrassed For You</h1>
              <p>Manchester United are growing increasingly anxious and annoyed with the
              attempts of Real Madrid to keep the fires stoked with regard to a deal,
              as well as the fact that Ronaldo himself is more than happy to
              reciprocate his suitor's advances.<br><br>Wright, for once, was firmly
              on United's side, and suggested that Ronaldo 'the person' is nowhere
              near the caliber of Ronaldo 'the player'.<br><br> "As a player, there's no doubt what you're capable of. As a man, you're not showing any class whatsoever." Wright scathed.<br><br>"You're also failing to show any respect to either Alex Ferguson or the Manchester United fans.<br><br>"To be honest, I'm embarrassed for you.<br><br>"You're now 23 and you should not be acting quite so immature.<br><br>"You've been at Old Trafford for five years but it's only the last two seasons you've set the place on fire.<br><br>"Previous
              to that, Fergie stuck with you. Despite your diving and despite the
              fact you would always try to take on a defender rather than pass to a
              team-mate. When you acted a right winker at the World Cup two years
              ago, your club manager once again showed extreme loyalty to you, along
              with United's fans.<br><br>"They could have turned on you after your behaviour during the England match in Germany but they didn't.<br><br>"You've now become one hell of a player - the best on this planet. I'd pay just to see you warm-up, let alone play a game.<br><br>"But with the drop of a hat, it seems you're ready to join Real Madrid."</p>

              <p>how about 75M pounds for transfer, 300K after tax for salary and they value Ronaldo @ 0.5B? Numbers falling from the skies??</p>
              <p>for me, MUFC just have to sell Ronaldo @ 0.5B pounds, and call it quits.And then let RM go earn their 0.5B, since they already win the next La Liga and European Champions Cups for maybe the next 10years..</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>THIS is the sensational moment a senior Real Madrid official met Cristiano Ronaldo — 22 weeks ago in Rome. Our exclusive picture shows the Manchester United ace with Real’s fitness coach Walter Di Salvo, who quit Old Trafford for Spain.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Madrid president Ramon Calderon only yesterday insisted there is <strong>NO</strong> evidence his club have tried to lure winger Ronaldo from United. But that looks inconceivable thanks to our dramatic picture, which we will give to United as they urge FIFA to take action against Real.</p>
              <p class="article">The tug-of-war between the clubs got uglier yesterday with Calderon branding Alex Ferguson “grotesque” in an explosive attack. Calderon is furious at boss Fergie for linking Madrid with former Spanish dictator Franco and United No 2 Carlos Queiroz for saying Portugal kicked the Spaniards out of their country.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Real supremo bleated: “It seems grotesque to talk about Franco and the occupation of Portugal. It wasn’t a very fortunate thing to say. “It is United’s right to complain but Real Madrid have done nothing irregular and we will never do that. “We’ve not interfered and we won’t interfere.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“It’s impossible that they have proof of the contrary because it’s something that has not happened. It’s a matter between the player and his club.” Real boss Berndt Schuster fuelled the row by again insisting Ronaldo would be a great signing for the Bernabeu giants. Schuster said: “The case of Cristiano does not worry me or make me obsessed. “We have to wait, although it’s clear he’d be a great signing and would adapt very well in the squad.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Furious Fergie had launched an astonishing attack on Madrid a couple of weeks ago for their very public pursuit of Ronaldo. He said: “You get used to Real’s performance in these things.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I read Calderon is talking, Schuster is talking, and they use Marca (a Spanish newspaper) as a vehicle to unsettle players. “The simple facts are Ronaldo is with us and has four years left on his contract — that’s the first thing.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“And Calderon has made that great statement: ‘Slavery was abolished many, many years ago’. Did he tell Franco that? Give me a break.”</p>

              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">The Red Devils lodged an official complaint last week regarding the manner in which los Merengues have approached the Portugal superstar, who spurred his country to victory against the Czech Republic yesterday.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson and co believe the Spanish giants have been tapping-up their prize winger, with recent revelations suggesting Real have been in contact with Ronaldo and his agent for several months.<br><br>But los Blancos have refused to admit to any foul play on their part – and world football’s governing body has sided with the La Liga champions.<br><br>A spokesman for the FIFA executive committee said: “United’s chances of getting Real punished are zero. <br><br>“I think everyone knows that these things go on in football but proving any wrongdoing is next to impossible. <br><br>“Real are very powerful and I don’t think they’ll be too worried about United’s claims.” <br><br><strong>Mickey</strong><br><br>The sordid saga has not been helped by the man in the middle of it all, as Ronaldo has failed to commit his future one way or the other.<br><br>And ex-United winger Gordon Hill believes the 23-year-old's behaviour on and off the pitch has made a mockery of the club and its traditions.<br><br>“It looks like there’s been something cooking for months,” he said. “What pees me off is that meanwhile they grab the shirt and they grab the badge. That takes the mickey.”<br><br>Getting back to the issue at hand, with FIFA having washed their hands off this subject, and Ronaldo and Madrid keen on the reunion (as apparent from their daily reminders), the chances of Manchester United holding on to the winger are growing slimmer by the day.</span></p>

              back on his performance following his side’s 3-1 win over the Czech Republic
              as they book their place in the quarter finals. <br><br>As
              opposed to their usual red kit, Portugal wore their white away kit, and
              Ronaldo did not let the opportunity pass to make another bid for a
              Bernabeu move.<br><br>He believes his side can go on
              and win the tournament, but what caught more attention was the remark that he likes playing in white as he drops an
              ironic hint to Real Madrid.
               
              <br><br>“I really like playing in
              a white football kit, the white national kit that is,” Ronaldo told Marca.<br><br>“I am really happy with my
              goal, when you score against Cech it makes you feel even better. <br><br>"I am in good
              shape and training well but the best is yet to come.”<br><br>Ronaldo also spoke about his
              side’s chances.<br><br>“Our main aim was to get to
              next phase. I'm very happy to have helped my team-mates to win,” said Ronaldo
              <br><br>"We played very
              well, although the Czech
               Republic played very well
              in the first half.
              <br><br>"It was very
              difficult to penetrate their defence. Portugal have played well in the
              first match and well again in this match as a team.
              <br><br>"We know how to
              sacrifice everything for the good of the team. We have now got a big chance but
              must respect our opponents because they too have a mission - they want to win
              as we do.”
              <br><br>Portugal will play Switzerland
              in their last group A game on Sunday and then they will play the group B runner
              up which is likely to be Croatia.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="graybold">Should Cristiano Ronaldo
              decide his future is at Real Madrid, then he will have to grow
              accustomed to playing in the number 9 shirt, which according to reports
              in Spain, has already been reserved for him. The winger will have to
              sacrifice his lucky number 7 to fulfil his reported childhood dream of
              playing for the Galacticos.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span class="black">Real Madrid’s battle for
              Cristiano Ronaldo continues, even after Manchester United’s complaint
              to FIFA due to Real’s conduct to lure the player, by attributing the
              number 9 jersey to him.
              </span></p><p>According to Spanish
              newspaper ‘As’, Ronaldo does not want to create any conflict with Raúl,
              rightful owner of the number 7 for many years, and will be “humble and
              respectful” when presenting himself to Madrid, according to his agent
              Jorge Mendes.</p>
              <p>Attributing the ‘9’ to Ronaldo was
              a very clever move by the Galacticos’ management as it was previously
              used by Ronaldo, the Brazilian striker, eighteen months ago.</p>

              <h1>Real to lodge £75m Ron bid to Glazers</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Real Madrid will reportedly sidestep Sir Alex
              Ferguson and Manchester United and lodge their bid for Cristiano
              Ronaldo straight to the Glazers.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Daily Express claims that the Spanish
              giants will offer £75million for the Portuguese winger's signature but,
              aware of Ferguson's determination to hang on to his star player, will
              make the proposal directly to the club's heavily in-debt owners.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, though, appeared confident two weeks ago that the Americans would not entertain such an offer.</p>
              <p>"I've had a couple of meetings with the Glazers and their
              attitude was, 'to hell with them'. They would sit a player in the stand
              - I'm telling you - to prove a point," he insisted.</p>
              <p>"They're not going to give in. They've got balls and I've been delighted with them in that respect."</p>
              <p>But, maintains the newspaper, 'that will not deter Real from
              going direct to the Glazers and it is becoming increasingly difficult
              for Ronaldo to return to Old Trafford. Real are fully briefed on the
              Glazers' highly-leveraged ownership of the club - with massive annual
              interest payments - and are not deterred by the Americans' insistence
              that their £600million debts and £80million interest repayments can be
              managed out of club resources.'</p>
              <p>Should the seemingly unlikely claim from the Daily Express
              that Madrid have offered Ronaldo £300,000 per week be true, then it is
              easy to see why the player's head has been turned.</p>

              <h1>Ronaldo Going Nowhere, Insist United</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/31544_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="179"></p>
              <h2>Manchester United have reiterated their desire to keep hold of
              Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo by insisting he will not be allowed
              to leave Old Trafford this summer.</h2>
              <p>Although Ronaldo is still to reveal his intentions for the future, it
              is thought that Real Madrid are thought to be in the process of
              launching a record £70 million offer for the winger. <br><br>However, United have now revealed that they will not allow Ronaldo to leave the club no matter how big an offer they receive. <br><br>The
              club also warned Ronaldo that even if he does decide he wants to move
              to Madrid, he will not be allowed to leave the club. A United source
              said:  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“If Ronaldo submits a formal transfer request, it will be
              rejected.” </span><br><br>They also sent a clear message to Real Madrid by
              saying:  “The management and the entire board are at one over this
              issue and that is that the player is not for sale.” <br><br>Despite United’s strong stance on the matter it is unlikely to put off Madrid who are determined to get their man.  <br><br>In
              order to help recruit Ronaldo it is reported that Madrid plan to bypass
              Sir Alex Ferguson and present a bid straight to the club’s owners, the
              Glazer family, in order to secure their man. <br><br>The Glazer’s
              ownership of the club and the debts incurred are widely known and it is
              believed that a record offer of £70 million would be too much for the
              Americans to turn down.</p>

              <h1 id="heading-alone" class="article-no-standfirst">Ronaldo accused of concluding Real deal months ago</h1>
              <p><img src="http://image.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/06/14/ronaldo460.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo's personal terms for a move to Real Madrid were
              agreed 'a long time ago', <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">according to a senior Manchester United
              source</span></strong></span>. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes is now understood to have
              finalised all the key details with executives from the Spanish club.</p>
              <p>'<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They
              have been talking for at least two months</span></span></strong>,' the source told Observer
              Sport last night, 'and it was all agreed with Real Madrid weeks ago.
              All this chat from [Real president] Ramón Calderón that he does not
              want to upset Manchester United, and Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be bought
              because he belongs to another club, is absolute rubbish. Discussions
              have gone way beyond the point of no return. Sir Alex Ferguson knows
              this now so you can imagine how it has gone down.'</p>
              <p>This explains
              United's decision to lodge a formal complaint with Fifa, claiming that
              Ronaldo has been tapped up; a threat that, although announced
              occasionally by clubs, is rarely acted upon. Last week a national
              newspaper also published a photograph of Ronaldo meeting a Real
              official in January in Rome, the club's fitness instructor, Walter Di
              Salvo, who left Old Trafford for the Bernabéu.</p>
              <p>'The people
              around Ronaldo and Real Madrid have been talking seriously for a long
              time - about everything including the details of his contract if he
              moves,' added the source.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo signed an improved contract
              that runs until 2012 in April of last year and Ferguson has taken the
              stance, in public at least, that the player will not be allowed to
              leave. But the source outlined that United believe Madrid's strategy to
              have been based on winning Ferguson round once it became clear that
              Ronaldo wanted to go. 'Madrid knew it would be tough, but thought for
              the right price the manager would sell. But he doesn't want to. No way.'</p>
              <p>But
              would not a sizeable offer make the deal inevitable? 'No, I don't think
              he would sell even for £100 million,' the source claimed, although
              there is no definite confidence at United about what will happen.
              Ferguson has said that the Glazer family, which owns United, would not
              sell Ronaldo for any price. But whether they would turn down an
              astronomical fee, especially given the club's £600m debt, is unclear.
              One option that may be explored is for Ferguson to persuade Ronaldo to
              stay at least one more season, then allow him to leave.</p>

              <h1>Ronaldo Will Not Return To Old Trafford</h1>
              <p>The player has long been linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu
              and Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon promised that he would do all
              he can to lure the player away from the Old Trafford based club.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo himself declared that he would like the idea of playing for Los Blancos but he admits that it is not up to him.</p>
              <p>"I would like to play for Real Madrid but that depends on others, not me," Ronaldo told Marca.</p>
              <p>Manchester United have been making a song and dance over Real Madrid's constant penchant for the player.</p>
              <p>Marca claim that the player's agent has already revealed that
              Ronaldo wants to leave the Red Devils because he wants a new challenge
              following his triumphs with United in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>It is uncertain of where exactly Ronaldo will be playing next
              season. The rumour mill is spinning wildly out of control over his
              future but it seems as if Calderon will have to fight hard for the
              winger as Manchester United are not willing to succumb to Calderon's
              tactics.</p>
