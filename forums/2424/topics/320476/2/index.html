              <p><strong>Manchester United have warned that they will not be pressured into offering Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo a new contract - and a hefty pay rise - to persuade him to stay at Old Trafford. That will be the uncompromising message to the £120,000-a week winger when he meets United officials after his Euro 2008 duties are completed.</strong></p>
              <p>A United insider said: 'Ronaldo's head may have been turned by reports of all the money he could be offered by Real Madrid, but he isn't exactly on peanuts at United. And he won't be getting a penny more.'</p>
              <p>Contrary to reports that Sir Alex Ferguson wants the club to make Ronaldo an offer he cannot refuse to stop him joining the Madrid giants, the United manager is in total agreement with the hard-line stance the club are prepared to take over the player. They will insist that he adheres to the five-year contract he signed last year - and the pay that comes with it.</p>
              <p>Sources close to United claim much of the speculation about a Ronaldo move to Real has been driven by reports placed in the Spanish media by the club themselves and not by the 23-year-old double footballer of the year.</p>
              <p>Real appeared to be up to their tricks again yesterday when the Spanish newspaper Marca, well known for their close relationship with the club, reported that Ronaldo's advisers were blaming Ferguson's infamous "he can rot in the stands' outburst for the player's reluctance to return to United.</p>
              <p>Although United are confident that Ronaldo will start next season in Ferguson's squad, there is disappointment within the double Premier League and European champions that the winger, who is likely to be rested for Portugal's final European Championship group game against Switzerland today, has not declared his outright loyalty to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>'It's a familiar game that Real Madrid are playing but Cristiano could end it by coming out and saying he's staying,' said the United insider.</p>
              <p>United officials feel that, having recently tied down the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra and Michael Carrick on long-term contracts, it would be unfair to undermine those deals by yielding to pressure from Ronaldo or his representatives. United also point out that the team are heading for another exciting season with the World Club championship added to their domestic and European programme.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldo can achieve everything he wants by staying here," added the Old Trafford source. "We understand that he has ambitions to play for Real, and no doubt he will fulfil them some time in the future, but at the moment he is better off where he is."</p>

              <h1>Fergie To Walk If Ronaldo Is Sold?</h1>
              <h2>In yet another development in the ongoing Cristiano Ronaldo
              transfer saga, Manchester United's legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson
              may well threaten to quit if the player is sold to Real Madrid.</h2>
              <p><em>The Telegraph</em> reports that the boss, who took over in 1986 and
              has won 10 Premier Leagues, five FA Cups, three League Cups and two
              Champions Leagues and one Cup Winners' Cup to make him one of the most
              decorated managers of all time, may well leave if Ronaldo is sold to
              Real Madrid.<br><br>This has come following one of the more recent
              developments in the seemingly endless quest of Spanish champions Madrid
              to sign the Portuguese, with rumours rife that they plan to go straight
              to the club's owners, the Glazers, and offer them £75 million up front
              for the 23-year-old, which would go some way towards clearing their
              infamous £600 million debt.<br><br>Sir Alex is infuriated with <em>los Blancos'</em> persistence and has on numerous occasions insisted that his star player
              is going nowhere, despite ongoing rumours that he is edging ever closer
              to the move.<br><br>"Sir Alex has put his foot down. He is so adamant that if the club
              dared to cash in on Ronaldo against his wishes, it wouldn't surprise me
              if he walked out," said an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>unnamed source</strong></span></span> close to the Scottish coach.<br><br>The
              player himself has said he will finally make a definitive statement
              regarding his future after Euro 2008, with his side Portugal most
              likely facing Germany in the quarterfinals in three days' time.</p>

              on Tuesday afternoon where Portugal are preparing for their Euro 2008

              unwillingness to discuss club affairs until his country's interest in

              Ronaldo to anyone BUT Real Madrid and has the cash to land the
              Portuguese. New Inter coach Jose Mourinho would love to work with his

              <p><strong>Scolari laments Ronaldo 'lies'</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Luiz Felipe Scolari has labeled as ‘lies’ quotes that were attributed to him over the weekend regarding Cristiano Ronaldo’s future. The People newspaper carried quotes from the Chelsea-bound Brazilian that claimed Ronaldo would force through a move to Real Madrid ‘whatever the difficulties’.</strong></p>
              <p>Scolari would be forgiven for having a vested interest in seeing Ronaldo head for Madrid next season as he prepares to try and guide Chelsea back above Manchester United to the top of the Premier League pile.</p>
              <p>However, any such thoughts have been dismissed out of hand via a statement released on the Portuguese FA's official website.</p>
              <p>“Luiz Philipe Scolari categorically denies that he has given an interview or made any declaration to ‘The People’ or to any another publication on the future of Cristiano Ronaldo,” read the statement.</p>
              <p>“Moreover, the national team coach has not had any contact with the media since the end of the game between Portugal and Germany.</p>
              <p>“Luiz Philipe Scolari regrets that his name is used in connection with lies and wants to deny in advance any alleged declarations used by the media without their authenticity being clearly verified.”</p>

              <p>I think since his mind/heart is not with MU anymore..</p>
              <p>He should just leave..</p>
              <p>If its 80m, then sell him!!</p>
              <p>With that money, i'm sure Fergie can buy in another 3~4 players..</p>
              <p>Maybe he can consider buying Villa &amp; Ashravin after selling Ronaldo...</p>

              <p>The way I see it Ronaldo is a soccer mercenary who will play his best at any club that owns him so if he is with us for another season just pretend all this never happened.If he is sold then either way Man U still wins.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Karl-Heinz
                  Rummenigge has taken a swipe at Real Madrid's relentless pursuit of
                  Cristiano Ronaldo, only days before he presides over a meeting of
                  Europe's biggest clubs.</strong></p>
              <p>The Bayern Munich chairman is unimpressed by the Spanish club's
                  handling of their desire to sign the Portuguese star and thinks their
                  actions could be bad for the game.</p>
              <p>On Monday, the European Club Association (ECA), the body that
                  has replaced the G14, will meet in Nyon, Switzerland and the Ronaldo
                  saga will be the hot topic in the background.</p>
              <p>But Rummenigge is not worried about Manchester United being
                  bullied into allowing the player to leave because of their strong
                  financial footing.</p>
              <p><strong>Financially strong</strong></p>
              <p>"I am not worried about the case because the rules are clear and
                  Manchester United has a very strong contract with the player for the
                  next four years," Rummenigge told the international press.</p>
              <p>"Besides, I know enough about (Sir) Alex Ferguson to know that if he says no, then that means no.</p>
              <p>"Anyway, this is not a question of money for Manchester United.
                  The player and Real Madrid can say what they want, United have the last
                  word and if they say it is not happening then that is that.</p>
              <p>"Teams will always have players in their squad that see
                  incredible offers come in for them and contracts put forward that could
                  see them earn a lot more money than they do with your club.</p>
              <p><strong>Fergie law</strong></p>
              <p>"That is the world that we currently live in, but luckily people
                  can still say no. No is a very good word. In fact it is one of my
                  favourites."</p>
              <p>Rummenigge believes that drumming up a deal through the media and rumours is not a helpful way of conducting business.</p>
              <p>"I cannot believe that a club like Real Madrid can force a
                  player like Cristiano Ronaldo to cause such tension, because the price
                  that they will have to pay is too high for everyone," he continued.</p>
              <p>"I think that this is dangerous for world football. Each club has to find its own way of dealing with things in these cases.</p>
              <p>"This is a situation that only concerns Manchester United, but I
                  would like to see Ronaldo stay at the club for the benefit of
                  everyone."</p>
