            <div class='col-md body'>OWEN HARGREAVES is pushing for a January move to Manchester United. The England ace is keen to leave Bayern Munich for a big-money transfer to Old Trafford after recovering from a broken leg.<br><br>Hargreaves, 25, was disappointed to see United's Â£17million bid turned down by the German giants last summer. But the Canadian-born midfielder Â— whose father is from Bolton Â— has not given up hope of joining the Premiership leaders.<br><br>He said: "It's about the opportunity to play in another league I haven't played in before, which is also the country I represent and where my family lives. "If people don't understand that, I don't expect them to. It's not their life Â— it's mine. "But I don't think anyone in the football world is in the same situation as me.<br><br>"Nobody at any club is going to wait for anyone forever. I don't want to go into too great depth about it because it's not down to me. "I received a lot of criticism for suggesting it would have been a great opportunity, but sometimes you need to say it. I don't feel bad about anything I said or did.<br><br>"Anybody who sees United play at the moment knows it's a very special team and they're in a great time. "But it's not like I'm saying I want to go to AC Milan or Inter Milan because they're offering me more money.<br><br>"It's because it's England and because Britain is where my family is. "My parents and my brothers are in Canada, but the whole of my dad's side of the family is in Bolton and my mum's side is in Rhyl.<br><br>"I think some people don't realise that. They think I'm half-German or something, but I'm not. I was brought up by a British family. It just happened to be in Canada."<br><br></div>
