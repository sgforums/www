Â“At half-time during games, he has shouted at me a few times, but always to improve me. People say heÂ’s mellowed, but he can still get angry Â– believe me!Â”<br><br>But the Portuguese star has revealed that itÂ’s not all red-face and flying boots when it comes to his manager. Ronaldo believes that FergusonÂ’s unique management skills help get the best from his game.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s like my mother or my father, he gives me limits and targets. But he is fair. The work that I have done with Sir Alex has been very helpful.<br><br>Â“I speak to him almost every day. He knows how to create a good atmosphere.<br><br>Â“Before every game the manager tells me Â‘Cristiano, enjoy yourself, use your skillsÂ’. I listen to that. I like dribbling, itÂ’s my style. But IÂ’ve never taken the mickey out of opponents. I respect them.Â”<br><br>Ronaldo achieved an unexpected comeback in England last season after he was vilified following the part he played in the sending-off of Wayne Rooney in the World Cup.<br><br>The 22-year-old was close to quitting Old Trafford, but the United management convinced him to stay. What followed was a magical season where the young Ronaldo came of age, showing the world his obvious talents.<br><br>Although cleaning-up in the post-season awards, Ronaldo is focussed on more success with his team.<br><br>Â“Last season I was voted Player of the Year by the players, the journalists and the supporters,Â” Ronaldo told Zoo magazine. Â“You donÂ’t get that kind of unanimity without having a great season. It is a reward for all my hard work and means I reached my target.<br><br>Â“But an individual trophy will never be as strong as one you share with your team mates, even though it remains a great joy. I am proud of what I did.Â”</div>
