              <p><strong>A groin injury could keep Wayne
              Rooney out for the rest of the season, although Sir Alex
              Ferguson insists United's medical team will do all they can to get the
              striker fit for the last two games.</strong><br><br>The 24-year-old sat
              out the Reds' 3-1 victory over Tottenham on Saturday after getting
              injured in training on Thursday. And the outlook does not look too good
              for the forward.<br><br>"It's difficult to say how long he'll be out," the boss told <em>Sky Sports</em>. "It might take two or three weeks.<br><br>"We'll try to get him back and Wayne will be desperate to play, of course. But we'll just have to wait and see."<br><br>As
              well as treating Rooney, the club's medical staff will also be
              monitoring the health of Patrice Evra and Nani who were both physically
              sick during the match.<br><br>"We had a bit of sickness with two or three players today," revealed Sir Alex.<br><br>"Patrice
              didn't feel too well yesterday, but felt okay to play. The heat maybe
              brought it on or it might have been something they ate or perhaps a bug
              is going around the place.<br><br>"They've got eight days to recover though so hopefully they will be okay."</p>

              <p>Maybe they just tahan? Or maybe the pill Evra took was some sort of a painkiller or something like that? So he didn't feel anything until he had to Merlion.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Wayne Rooney" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wayne-rooney"><span style="color: #005689;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> has not given up hope of being involved in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s potentially season-defining game at Sunderland on Sunday. Rooney, once again, is ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation and refusing to accept he has no chance of being involved in a match that could go a long way to determining whether the championship trophy stays at Old Trafford or returns to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>While Sir Alex Ferguson said at the weekend that Rooney would be missing for two or three weeks with a groin strain, the player has a more optimistic timescale after several days of intensive treatment. Rooney has strained the abductor muscle at the top of his leg, but the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a>'s leading scorer is encouraged by the fact that he is a quick healer.</p>
              <p>United's doctors have given him an outside chance of playing at Sunderland and Rooney will almost certainly be available for the home game against Stoke City the following weekend. He is said to be surprised by some of the manager's public statements.</p>
              <p>The last time Ferguson said Rooney would be out for up to three weeks, after he had damaged an ankle in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich, the striker played in the return leg the next week. He lasted 55 minutes and the gamble of playing him has led to concerns, predominantly at the Football Association, that the fitness of England's most accomplished striker is being risked with a World Cup looming.</p>
              <p>At Old Trafford, however, a fourth successive league title is at stake and the club will leave it as late as possible before deciding whether Rooney has to be ruled out of the trip to the north-east. The player himself has no qualms about the way his initial injury has been handled and has told associates that he is pleased with the support and expertise he has received from the club's medical staff.</p>
              <p>United are a point behind Chelsea going into the penultimate weekend of the season, but Carlo Ancelotti's side have the more difficult game on Sunday against Liverpool, who are still chasing the fourth Champions League qualification place. Chelsea may need to win because any other result would mean United going on to the pitch at Sunderland knowing that six points from their final two games would win them a record 19th championship.</p>
              <p>Rooney, the Professional Footballers' Association's newly crowned player of the year, said: "I'm disappointed to have missed a couple of games over the last few weeks. It's difficult knowing you can't influence the game. But if there's any consolation I'll probably be fresher for the World Cup, which will be good for me."</p>
