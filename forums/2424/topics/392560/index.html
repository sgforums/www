            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Nani wants a Mig fight<br></strong>United winger Nani has urged Sir Alex Ferguson to press ahead with his bid for Sporting Lisbon star Miguel Veloso. Midfielder Veloso has been one of the most sought-after players in Europe since last summer, with Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal all interested in him. Nani said: "I know there are many rumours regarding Manchester United's interest in Veloso but I can't decide whether he comes. I know him well because he was a team-mate of mine and I know he has the quality to play for a club like United. The football here is hard but he is someone who can do well at a big club. And I know he already has the opportunities to leave Sporting." Veloso, 23, has been in superb form for Sporting this season and scored in both legs of their Europa League win over Everton.<br><em>Tony Little, The Sun</em><br><br>In other news, <strong>Fabio Capello</strong> says he visited United's Carrington training ground to discuss the state of <strong>Rio Ferdinand</strong>'s troublesome back complaint with both the player and Sir Alex. "I also spoke with David Gill at Wembley, who told me it is not the same problem," says Capello. "I just hope he will be fit in a short time because he needs to play." In an interview with the <em>Guardian</em>, Ferdinand reveals how he found out he was England captain from the TV news.<br><br>Meanwhile, the <em>Daily Star</em> claim <strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> might not start England's friendly against Egypt tonight after he was injured in a training ground collision with James Milner.<br><br>Fulham defender <strong>Chris Smalling</strong> has been talking about his "very exciting" move to Old Trafford which he will complete in the summer. He said: "When you have one of the biggest clubs in the world even considering you will be good enough for them, it is a massive compliment."</p></div>

              <p>Paul Scholes has admitted his match-changing equaliser against AC Milan three weeks ago is probably the worst goal he has ever scored.</p>
              <p>Trailing to Ronaldinho's early opener and lucky not to be out of the tie after being completely outplayed, Manchester United managed to reach the interval level at the San Siro after an outrageous piece of good fortune.</p>
              <p>As he attempted to get on the end of Antonio Valencia's cross, Scholes completely missed his kick and was as amazed as anyone to see the ball shoot off his standing left leg and fly past Dida into the far corner.</p>
              <p>It proved to be the catalyst for an imperious second-half display which saw United charge into a 3-1 lead before Clarence Seedorf gave the Italian giants some hope of recovering the position at Old Trafford on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>"That goal was probably the worst one I have ever scored," said Scholes, who bagged his 100th in the Premier League on Saturday with a late winner at Wolves.</p>
              <p>"It is easy enough to admit. I meant to hit it with my right foot and the ball came off my left.</p>
              <p>"But a goal is a goal and I will take it. It was a goal we needed because after the first 20 minutes we could have been three or four down.</p>
              <p>"From then on it always looked like we were going to win the game."</p>
              <p>As Sir Alex Ferguson is likely to confirm the extended absence of Wes Brown with a broken metatarsal suffered in that win at Wolves, following on from the season-ending hamstring injury to Michael Owen, plus the knee injury that threatens to rule Wayne Rooney out of Wednesday's contest, United's build-up has hardly been trouble free.</p>
              <p>Yet Ferguson does appear to have found a winning formula in his three-man midfield, which will be lacking Michael Carrick through suspension on this occasion, supplemented by two wider players and a single striker, who will be Dimitar Berbatov if Rooney is ruled out.</p>
              <p>"The three central midfielders has worked well in Europe for the last few years," said Scholes.</p>
              <p>"We have got some good results away from home in Europe and hopefully that will continue.</p>
              <p>"Whether we play that way in the home leg I don't know but as long as we get the same result, I don't mind."</p>
              <p>Just as with the first leg, David Beckham will be the centre of attention.</p>
              <p>As a fellow member of that famed 'Class of 92', Scholes knows Beckham well.</p>
              <p>And he is certain the former United star will receive a warm reception from the Old Trafford faithful, even if, once the real action starts, both men will be fully committed on behalf of their present clubs.</p>
              <p>"I am sure he will get a good reception," said Scholes.</p>
              <p>"United fans still love him for what he did for this club and he will get a fantastic ovation.</p>
              <p>"After that, we want to put him out. That is the plan.</p>
              <p>"He will need to be watched though. If you give him time and room on the ball there is no doubt he will pick players out.</p>
              <p>"From free-kicks as well, his delivery is as great as ever."</p>
