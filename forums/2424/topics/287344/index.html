Simply, they want to be the most successful club in UK, but they can't buy history. (note, I did not mention they buy the title).<br><br>What Liverpool, Arsenal, MUFC have established are more than 2 titles. They have established a tradition, a culture.<br><br>Chelsea simply thought, get Kenyon, get Jose, get Sheva, get Ballack, get etc etc.. It is not a mathematics formula.<br><br>And GP, by rejecting these history, tradition, &amp; culture, has already stepped on people's toes. Yes, you won two titles, and now you can feast at the big table. But hey, you still need to give some respect to the others who have already at the big table.<br>But GP and new age chelsea fans don't want that, they want to create new things, want to forge ahead. But that came crashing down, when they can't win the European Cup, can't make it 3 titles in a row, lose their best manager.<br><br>So what's next?<br>Instead of turning their focus on their club, they aim to spotlight other clubs'..<br><br>Ronaldo dive, Rooney cheat, the whole MUFC cheats, manure..<br><br>Well, it is music to all MUFC fans,and I, for the more the outcry, the more victories MUFC are getting..<br><br>And these stupid buggers just keep on coming, creating clones,once their hearts are poisoned, they can't stop.. They just want to use their 'imaginary" hammer and pin MUFC down.<br><br>Slowly, they are beginning to find out one fact that we all MUFC fans know, this club, the players, and manager, can't be pinned.<br>We got that steel, that character to go out and do the talking on the field.<br><br>We can't win with youth, we do it in your face. We can afford to kick out Stam, Beckham, RVN, and still come out with the winning formula. That takes character..<br><br>Arsenal did it finally by selling Henry.<br><br>But how does Chelsea tackle problems?<br><br>Like chickens, they tok tok tok..<br><br>Ballack, not happy, smoothe, throw more money, Sheva, not happy, let him play a few more games, then keep him on bench, Jose, the manager, too direct, hey, just fire, people will queue for the russian roubles.. That's their way to success.<br><br>Yes, they managed two titles, they win by a huge lead, they took the league by storm.. but their formula all wrong, nothing based on greed of money can last..  On no, we got true blues -&gt; Terry, Lampard, their die hard for Chelsea.. Well, didn't they struggle to get them to resign?? Lampard.. Terry... Why?? Cause big Roman did not promise that big yacht that was on their christmas wishlist lor.<br><br>So GP, want to whack MUFC for diving, cheating, go ahead, it is like a broken record.  End of day, look at the league title.. You got more than MUFC to consider now.. Gunners are creating a blaze.. Go, create more noise about Gunners, and see how they will "blow" you..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Given how lightweight he is, he has to protect his asset -&gt; feet from serious damage and thus, sometimes, need to evade heavy and stupid challenges.
