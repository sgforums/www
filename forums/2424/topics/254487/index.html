            <div class='col-md body'>United have only just collected the Premiership trophy, but chief executive David Gill is already promising investment in new players this summer to strengthen the Reds' push for a tenth title under Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>There were jubilant scenes at Old Trafford after Sunday's encounter with West Ham and Gill assured fans the club will do all it can to ensure next season is just as memorable.<br><br>"You can't just assume the success you've achieved will continue," Gill told Manchester United Radio.<br><br>"You have to always look to improve and invest, and that's what we're going to do. We've got a great team who have done very well and we'll be looking to tweak it here and there.<br><br>"Manchester United has been Â– and always will be Â– a club that buys players as well as giving youth its chance. And that's what we'll see next year and for many years to come."<br><br>Gill admitted the 2006/07 title tasted especially sweet after going without for the last three seasons.<br><br>"It's a good feeling all round for everybody associated with the club. As we prepared for the season and brought in new players, we wanted to have a good go at Chelsea. The fact that we hadn't won the title for three seasons meant we wanted to get it back.<br><br>"This is truly a team effort Â– obviously from Alex, his coaches and the players, but also the people selling the tickets, preparing the stadium, making the food, and, of course, the fans. It's been a brilliant recovery."<br><br>He also reiterated the role United's owners have played in this season's campaign.<br><br>"The Glazer family understands the sports business and know that success on the pitch is key to success off the pitch," Gill said.<br><br>"Before they'd taken over there was a lot of talk about what the ownership structure was going to be and we had the disciplines of the stock exchange to follow. I think now, with the private ownership, we have stability and can concentrate on delivering a great team on the pitch."<br><br>Sir Alex , meanwhile, confirmed the club are continuing to monitor targets, but insists it is imperative to get the right players.<br><br>"Any time you bring a player into a winning team you have to measure whether itÂ’s going to improve you," he said. "WeÂ’re doing that at the moment with some players.<br><br>"Assessing what weÂ’ve got is hopefully right, and if we do bring someone in theyÂ’ll contribute and compliment the team or the squad."<br></div>
