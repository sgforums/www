            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Dong Fangzhou is determined to prove he is more than just a Manchester United shirt seller after penning a three-year contract at Old Trafford.</strong><br><br>The striker is now a fully-fledged Red Devil after being granted a work permit in January and became the first Chinese player to appear for United in the Premier League draw at Chelsea in May.<br><br>After three years in Belgium with United's feeder club Royal Antwerp, it means Dong has the opportunity to try and impress Sir Alex Ferguson in training on a daily basis.<br><br>And, buoyed by the award of a contract to celebrate his newly-acquired status, Dong is keen to show he can be as effective on the field as he is in United's Far East marketing campaigns.<br><br>"I am trying to prove I am good enough to play for Manchester United," he said.<br><br>"I need to train hard and work hard, but that is no problem for me.<br><br>"Like every Chinese player, it is tough when you move to a new country because of the language and the fact it is a different culture.<br><br>"But, while those three years at Antwerp were hard, in a way they may help me because I am used to playing in Europe now."<br><br>Dong was speaking at the launch of a 'Goals for Kids' initiative in Macau, backed by United's sponsors, American banking giant AIG.<br><br>For each goal the Old Trafford outfit score on their current Far East tour, AIG have pledged to give Â£2,000 to TREATS, a Hong Kong-based charity group committed to promoting integration among children, youth and families.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's nearly impossible for him to break into the first team. Big clubs are defined by their star strikers/midfielders and we Asians are always being looked upon as inferior ones. Sun Jihai was able to make it solely due to him being a defender.<br><br>Dong should just give it up and move to a smaller club to have a higher chance of playing. Most prob Fergie will loan him out to the lower leagues.</div>

He's a very athletic boy and has a marvellous physique."<br><br>However, the Chinese attacker faces a difficult task to get into the Premier League champions' first-team with the likes of Wayne Rooney, Louis Saha and Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of him in the pecking order.<br><br>Dong, though, has now signed a permanent three-year contract at Old Trafford after spending time at United's feeder club Royal Antwerp following his initial transfer from Dalian Shide in 2004.<br><br>Having handed him his new deal, Ferguson is now keen to see the 22-year-old compete for a first-team role.<br><br>"He did exceptionally well and scored a lot of goals at Antwerp and his experience with the Chinese national team has been good for him," Ferguson added.<br><br>"Next season we will see a better player. Hopefully he is an emerging player for us."<br><br>Dong has made one Premier League appearance to date, which came against Chelsea in the penultimate game of last season.</div>
