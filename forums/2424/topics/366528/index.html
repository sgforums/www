              <p><strong>Antonio Valencia joining United was the worst-kept secret - everyone expected him to come to Old Trafford.<br><br></strong>Still, he's an important signing and the timing of his move is great as it means he can go on the Asia Tour later this month. He'll get to know his team-mates much better by living around them in the hotels. The players are all together, all the time, they're in each other's company for every minute of every day.<br><br>I'm sure Valencia won't be our only summer signing, we might need a striker as well. But a wide player was certainly something we needed, so he's a great addition to the squad. He's quick and could be a full-back's nightmare - the last thing you want to do as a defender is play against someone who's quick, running at you.<br><br>When he played against United at Old Trafford in January, he gave John O'Shea one of the biggest chasings John's ever had. The only time I'd ever seen someone do that to John before was when Ronaldo did it for Sporting Lisbon in a friendly in 2003!<br><br>Valencia's goal return, only three for Wigan last season, doesn't matter. I think when you're playing with better players, there'll be more possibilities for you to score goals. But another great talent in football that's often overlooked is creating goals.<br><br>People have a go at Berbatov because he's not as energetic as Tevez, but he scored 12 goals in the league and also how many did he make? The art of making chances is almost as important as scoring goals.<br><br>I think it's great when someone wants to join you as much as Valencia does. We have a lost a couple of big players and like it or not, money played a big part in it. But this lad wants to come and play for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Berbatov was another exception to the point about money. All the rumours on deadline day last summer were that Manchester City were trying to hijack the deal with a bigger offer but Berbatov said, 'No, I want to play for Manchester United'. When you get foreign players saying that, I think it's a bonus.</p>
