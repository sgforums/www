              <p class="art-txt-first">The agent of Federico Macheda claims to have received assurances from Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson regarding his client's future.</p>
              <p>Reports have suggested that the striker could return to his native Italy in the winter transfer window, while West Brom have admitted an interest in the past.</p>
              <p>But Macheda's representative, Giovanni Bia, is confident that the 19-year-old will not be leaving Old Trafford after holding talks with Ferguson in October.</p>
              <p>Bia told calciomercato.it: "I was in Manchester 10 or 15 days ago and I spoke with Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"The issue of a transfer is not even being considered. Ferguson is focusing on him. He wanted Federico at Manchester.</p>
              <p>"The Scottish manager thinks that, if all goes as it should, Macheda can become one of the strongest strikers.</p>
              <p>"It is therefore impossible that the player will be transferred in January."</p>

              <p><strong>Federico Macheda hopes his late strike at Aston Villa will be the catalyst for more minutes on the pitch this season.<br><br></strong>The young Italian, thrown on as a second-half substitute, scored an 18-yard screamer on 81 minutes to inspire a dramatic comeback at Villa Park.<br><br>Despite United’s late charge, though, the game ended 2-2 and Sir Alex’s men registered a seventh league draw of the season.<br><br>Macheda, who netted in even more dramatic circumstances against Villa on his Reds debut in 2008, was thrilled to have played a part in the Reds’ latest late revival.<br><br>“Aston Villa seem to be my lucky team,” he told <em>MUTV </em>on Saturday. “I scored against them on my debut and now again today. It was a good goal.<br><br>“I love to score goals and I was the last striker in the team without a goal this season. Now I’ve scored one and I’m happy to have helped the team to come back from 2-0 down.<br><br>“I hope I get a few more chances now. But it’s not easy for me. I’m the youngest of five strikers at the club and in the next week or so Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen may come back. I just hope the manager picks me for his next game and I score again.”</p>
              <p>personal joy at finding the net for the fourth time in his United career was married with disappointment after the Reds yet again dropped points away from home.<br><br>“A draw is better than losing but we are Manchester United,” he added.<br><br>“Obviously we want to win every game. So we’re disappointed, even with the late draw. We came here to win the game and get as near as possible to Chelsea."</p>
