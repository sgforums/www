              <p class="story"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Manchester United last night came under fire after signing one of Italy's most promising young strikers. Just days <span style="color: #000000;">after they were pipped by Arsenal to the signature of 17-year-old Cardiff midfielder Aaron Ramsey</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> United snapped up Davide Petrucci, 16, who scored 14 goals in 19 matches last season and was the top scorer in Roma's youth team. He has also starred for Italy's under-17 team.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">United will pay Petrucci £95,000 a year and will cover the cost of regular flights home to Italy. The deal is the maximum permissible offer for a youth-team player. Roma will receive around £200,000 in compensation but the move has caused fury.</p>
              <p class="story">"It is a nightmare," said Il Romanista, a newspaper dedicated to Roma. "Manchester United have dealt us another low blow, stealing Petrucci from under our noses, probably the best product of our youth system. In three to four years, he will be worth 100 times as much."</p>
              <p class="story">Petrucci, who comes from the San Basilio suburb of Rome, has been compared to a young Francesco Totti and could have made the first-team squad next year. However, Roma offered him a contract worth only £16,000 a year, the basic youth-team deal. Petrucci was also said to be concerned that he had not already been called up to the first team. Totti made his debut in 1993 when he was 16.</p>
              <p class="story">Bruno Conti, Roma's technical director, said the club were unwilling to improve the terms because it would upset other youth-team players who had already signed similar deals, including Riccardo Brosco, a defender who has already been promoted to the full squad.</p>
              <p class="story">Conti said Petrucci would have been given opportunities to show his value next season. Roma have a history of developing youth players. Daniele De Rossi and Alberto Aquilani have come through the system in the past two years and are now playing for Italy. Roma are unable to contest the signing, since Italian rules state it is impossible to offer a professional contract to anyone under 17. Petrucci's birthday is in October.</p>
              <p class="story">Meanwhile, Patrice Evra has signed on for four more years at United. His contract extension is worth £75,000 a week. "United is more than a club, it is a family," said Evra. "I'm proud to be a part of it."</p>

              <p><br>Not really lah... Basically, these clubs don't pay their youth team members that well thats why they will jump at an opportunity... Players this age can only sign their first professional contract when the reach 17 leaving English clubs who are willing and able to pay more to make them an offer... But first they must of course come to know of them... thats where the scouts comes in...</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, Its the money being offered... Roma are only offering the kid $16,000 a year, thats like $300 a week while United are offering $95,000 making it $1,800 a week plus all the expenses for flights home to Italy...</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United have sparked Roma's fury by snapping up the player dubbed the new Francesco Totti. Midfielder Davide Petrucci, 16, has agreed a three-year deal with the Barclays Premier League and Champions League winners on a reported ??95,000 salary, against a ??16,000 offer from Roma.</strong></p>
              <p>It is another example of United's policy of snapping up the best young talent in Italy and Spain where clubs are banned from offering professional deals to under 17s. United even helped entice the Italy under 17 international by offering his dad a job as a groundsman.</p>
              <p>Petrucci said: 'Going to play for the strongest club in the world in United is a great. opportunity for me. It was hard to say no, even though I am a Roma fan and would gladly have stayed with them throughout my career.</p>
              <p>'United have offered my father Stefano a job as a gardener and he will accompany me. I will go over on June 30 and start in United's academy the next day. I will start English lessons.'</p>

              <p>Ya...when was the last time a reserve player actually had a decent run in the first team?</p>
              <p>i seriously cant recall.</p>
              <p>Eagles seems to have faded.</p>
              <p>Simpson looks promising, but must be cursing that Brown signed a new contract.</p>
              <p>Welbeck only makes up the numbers on the bench.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is the gulf between the first team and reserves too big? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>

Just like Rossi, Pique, Richardson and the rest... But if he does make it to the first team... that would be great for him and United.
