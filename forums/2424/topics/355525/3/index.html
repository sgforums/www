              really glad that rio is back, can see that he have the backline more confidence and his partnership w Vidic is simply awesome, a steady rock in central defence.
              
              btw what happened to Park JS? He is more workmanlike and stamina is good, is he injured?

              <p>now, it is fairly easy, cause SAF will use one set of players, and another set of the next match, resting the oldies.</p>

              <p>When rio comes back, man u's defence suddenly looks rock solid. Such vulnerability outlines the importance of rio to man u like gerrard or torres is to liverpool. If that chap is out, the team slumps.</p>

              <p>And what i observed is...cannot play berbatov and rooney together. At the final third of opponent's field, they somehow dun get to pass balls to each other.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Carrick is still an above average player. Cannot stamp his authority due to two reasons imo: 1) cannot score spectacular goals from outside the box like scholes, lampard or gerrard. 2) Needs to bulk up his body as he can be easily challenged off the ball.</p>

              <p>firstly, I think Rio and Vidic got this understanding. Even if one miss, the other is behind to clear. Somehow, Evans did not get this link up with either of them yet.</p>
              <p>Agreed, Berba will drops out of his normal high goal/ratios in EPL for the first time . Neither Berba or Rooney is an out N out striker so SAF in the porto game, did well, when he pushed Ronaldo upfront and allow these two to work off him.</p>
              <p>Carrick, we all know came under so much when he "inherited" #16 jersey, or Keano's. But I would say he is growing into the role. Unlike Keano, he goes about his business in the quiet way, much like Scholey. Many a times, he was the one tracking back,blocking off passes, and I do think he is quietly winning alot of his critics over.</p>
              <p>Anderson seems to thrive in Porto, perhaps his old backyard or etc. He is maturing, but got tons to learn. A good model would be Essien.</p>
