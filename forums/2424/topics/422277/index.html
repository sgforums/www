              <p>http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thefootballtacticsblog/2011/02/are_manchester_united_lacking.html.</p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">
              </span></p><p dir="ltr">So Manchester United's 29-game unbeaten run in
                   the Premier League has come to an end. Who guessed it would have been 
                  Wolves, the division's bottom club on Saturday morning, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9384148.stm">who inflicted the damage? </a></p>
              <p dir="ltr">Not many, perhaps. Yet coming after the wins over <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jan/05/wolverhampton-wanderers-chelsea-premier-league">Chelsea </a>and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9135951.stm">Manchester City</a> at Molineux, the 2-1 victory showed that Mick McCarthy's side are more than a match for some of the league's biggest teams.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Goals by George Elokobi and the industrious 
                  Kevin Doyle cancelled out Nani's opener but there was evidence from the 
                  back to the front that Wolves deserved their victory.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">The problem now for McCarthy is to maintain 
                  that sort of form against lesser teams, a key factor if the Midlands 
                  outfit are to stay up.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">
              </span></p><p dir="ltr">"Wolves were absolutely sensational," said <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/default.stm">Match of the Day </a>pundit Alan Shearer.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">"During the second half you were expecting an 
                  onslaught by Manchester United and they attacked in little bursts. But 
                  whatever they threw at Wolves, the home side handled really well and 
                  defended so well too."</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Resolute defending was also a feature of 
                  Wolves' wins over Manchester City and Chelsea at home this season, where
                   they only allowed two and three shots on target all game.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Chelsea usually average more than double that 
                  figure but the reduction was, in part, down to the Wolves defence 
                  willing to put their bodies on the line, blocking six of their attempts 
                  on goal.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">On Saturday, Manchester United only had four 
                  shots on target all game, where they usually average about six, but with
                   Wolves only blocking three other shots it shows how much the visitors 
                  petered out in the second half.</p>
              <div class="imgCaptionRight" style="float: right;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 10px 0pt 5px 20px;" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thefootballtacticsblog/Passes_Doyle_Black.jpg" alt="Passes to Kevin Doyle show he was often Wolves' out ball from defence" width="226" height="363">
              <p style="width: 226px; font-size: 11px; color: #666666; margin-left: 20px;"> </p>
              </div>
              <p dir="ltr">Some of that was down to the indefatigable <a href="http://www.teamtalk.com/premier-league/6734609/Doyle-delighted-to-end-Reds-run">Doyle</a>,
                   who allowed the Wolves defence time to breathe by maintaining 
                  possession even when the ball was hit long to him. Judging by the passes
                   he received in the graphic to the right, that was an awful lot.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">McCarthy's team were also clinical in front of
                   goal. From only five shots they scored twice, a similar story to when 
                  they beat Chelsea with a goal from only three shots.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">In three other games this season - against 
                  Aston Villa, Birmingham and Blackpool - their shot total has hit double 
                  figures with only one goal as a return, whereas in five other matches 
                  more than 10 shots on goal have yielded nothing.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">"Kevin Doyle up front was magnificent," stated
                   Shearer. "He worked his socks off, he worked the channels, he held the 
                  ball up and he was brilliant.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">"I'm still not totally sure if he got a touch for the second goal but he deserved it because of his work rate all afternoon."</p>
              <p dir="ltr">As good as Wolves were, Manchester United 
                  finally came unstuck having spent most of the season getting results 
                  without playing well. This time they forgot the first part.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">The signs were there: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9154647.stm">only an injury-time winner from Park Ji-Sung</a> separated Sir Alex Ferguson's side and Wolves at Old Trafford in November.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">More recently, another late comeback <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9371173.stm">saved United from defeat at Blackpool</a>,
                   where Ryan Giggs helped turn their fortunes around, and a similar 
                  scenario was repeated in the FA Cup tie at Southampton where t<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/9379065.stm">hey came from behind to win 2-1.</a></p>
              <p dir="ltr">Even before then at Tottenham in January, it was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2011/01/fergusons_fighters_still_stand.html">a vintage performance by centre-backs Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand</a> that were the most outstanding aspects in a display in which the forwards and midfield failed to fire.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">In all of this, the reliance on veterans Giggs and Scholes may be the most worrying aspect for United fans.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">While <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/club_stats/default.stm">others have scored goals</a>,
                   they have provided more zest and energy to the centre of midfield, 
                  where the likes of Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Anderson have 
                  failed to do so.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Driving runs by Giggs on the ball have been 
                  matched by Scholes' never-ending capacity to gamble on getting into the 
                  box. This was emphasised when he replaced Carrick on Saturday and was 
                  more involved in advanced and wider positions.</p>
              <div class="imgCaption"><img class="mt-image-none" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thefootballtacticsblog/Carrick_v_Scholes_Touches.jpg" alt="Scholes' touches against Wolves showed he was in more advanced and wider positions" width="595" height="335">
              <p style="width: 595px; font-size: 11px; color: #666666;"> </p>
              </div>
              <p dir="ltr">Comparisons with the other top four teams show
                   that United appear to be lacking a creative influence from the middle 
                  of the park.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Arsenal have Cesc Fabregas, Tottenham have 
                  Rafael van der Vaart and Luka Modric, Manchester City have David Silva 
                  and Yaya Toure, while Chelsea can usually rely on Frank Lampard, whose 
                  injury-hit season has contributed to his team's stuttering form.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Only Manchester City are in the same category 
                  when it comes to shots and goals from central midfield but that is only 
                  because manager Roberto Mancini prefers a more defensive approach, with 
                  the likes of Nigel de Jong and Gareth Barry anchoring the midfield.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">From their regular central midfield players, 
                  Tottenham average 1.59 shots per game, Chelsea 1.41, Arsenal 1.17 and 
                  Manchester City a lowly 0.69.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Fletcher, Carrick and Anderson make up three 
                  of the six central midfielders from the top five clubs who have taken 
                  the least number of shots. (John Mikel Obi, Nigel de Jong and Wilson 
                  Palacios are the other three.)</p>
              <p dir="ltr">And together with Scholes, they have totalled 31 attempts on goal, at an average of only 0.6 shots per game.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Does that indicate where Manchester United need to improve? Or with them still <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/table/default.stm">sitting pretty at the top of the Premier League table </a>is it an overplayed issue?</p>

              <p>I've mentioned in the other thread that Fletcher has switched his style of play if you notice. He's now playing the Scholes' role: Deep-Lying Playmaker. Usually Carrick will be the one tracking back while Fletcher plays the ball forward. I'm sure that is part of Fergie's plan to buy yet another defensive midfielder instead of an attacking one.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, we MAY get to see Valencia back and Park too. So my guess is an attacking midfielder may not be on Fergie's shopping list:</p>
              <p>Fergie's Shopping List:<br>1. A Goalkeeper to replace retiring Van der Sar</p>
              <p>2. A Defensive Midfielder to take over Hargreaves.</p>

              <p>I've mentioned in the other thread that Fletcher has switched
              his style of play if you notice. He's now playing the Scholes'
              role: Deep-Lying Playmaker. Usually Carrick will be the one
              tracking back while Fletcher plays the ball forward. I'm sure that
              is part of Fergie's plan to buy yet another defensive midfielder
              instead of an attacking one.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, we MAY get to see Valencia back and Park too. So my
              guess is an attacking midfielder may not be on Fergie's shopping
              list:</p>
              <p>Fergie's Shopping List:<br> 1. A Goalkeeper to replace retiring Van der Sar</p>
              <p>2. A Defensive Midfielder to take over Hargreaves.</p>

              <p>yep, i think the initial plan was reverse, carrick to provide the balls, and fletcher to be protector just infront of defence. but it took a turn for the worse when carrick's form drops.</p>
              <p>i agree with you on the transfer list. but given EDS's public declaration, MUFC is going to be held to ransom and they may end up giving the poles or the new buy a chance (if funds are unavailable).</p>
              <p>obertan not lighting the skies in that aspect, he is pacy, reliable, but has no special sparks like a nani, ronaldo or a younger giggs. and his days are numbered. I recall Blanc was amazed MUFC picked him up.</p>
              <p>I think giggs' influence on/off the field is impt to the younger players on how to conduct themselves, and given an icon is on the field with them will calm their nerves.</p>

              <p>Bro, I take it that you meant Edwin van Der Sar's retirement announcement.</p>
              <p>I neither doubt nor agree, since it's already clear that he will move on at some point in his career. A new keeper has to replace him just like how Bosnich (Blardy hell), Taibi (. . . .) and van Der Ghouw replaced Schmeichel, how they were taken over by Carroll, how Howard takes over Carroll, how Van der Sar takes over Howard and how Foster fails to live up to his billings.</p>
              <p>It is whether Fergie is willing to wait and sieve through the keepers and find the bargain + quality he needs.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo did alot of stepovers and tricks but he suck initially wasn't he because he just cannot make that crucial last ball. Do you recall there was once Fergie even had to make Solskjaer play right midfield because of this problem?</p>
              <p>Same for Nani, he was a right midfielder but played on the left initially. He did all the tricks but always fail to deliver the final cross. Now that he switches back to his preferred Right Wing, he played with more confidence and with the experienced gain, he was changed to an assist master.</p>
              <p>But I do agree that I'm not enjoying what I'm seeing when Obertan plays. The youtube videos of him at Bordeaux must be heavily edited. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>Fergie cannot made those same mistakes again. you need to pay top money for a top top goalie. I hope he doesnt made the same mistakes again and again. I repeat, you need to pay top dollar for a top goalie.</p>
              <p>Goalie is different from other positions. Imagine the goalie always made the same odd mistakes once every few matches and result the team in losing and going out of CL, like howard last min goal conceded in 2004 against Porto.</p>

              <p>bro,</p>
              <p>I do hope that "once bitten twice shy" theory works with SAF in his hunt for Edwin's successor after PeterSchmeichel left and MUFC suffered such a dip. And the owners will seriously back SAF after another american owners loudly raise their battle cry to knock MUFC off their perch.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo in his first game vs Bolton was all flash, but somehow, for me, you can see that quality. He has pace, but his eagerness to perform,his "give me the ball", his unpredictability sets him apart, Same with nani. but this obertan seems to be playing safe. maybe, I watched too many negative videos.</p>

              <p>i wonder if anderson works on his finishing in games. He's running into goalscoring positions these days but his final shot....is abyssmal.</p>
              <p>He can be a spark, a pity the shooting. Carrick used to fire shots like these but he has become a sad case. They need someone like van der vaart.</p>
