              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>A couple of minor demons were put to flight in Gelsenkirchen. Wayne Rooney, who made the first of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s goals and scored the second, will no longer be required to think of the Veltins Arena as the place where his dismissal prefaced England's exit from the 2006 World Cup. Meanwhile his manager was taking a big step towards ending a run of defeats at the hands of German teams – Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich – for United under his command in two-legged <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> knockout rounds.</p>
              <p>For Rooney this was a particularly satisfying night. Having spent the morning, according to his Twitter message, in his hotel room listening to the Beatles, he produced a display good enough to expunge the memory of the doleful figure who stumbled through the World Cup last summer and took months to emerge from some sort of personal slough of despond.</p>
              <p>The arrival of Javier Hernández as an attacking partner seems to have reawakened the enthusiasm formerly aroused by the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. Once again Rooney is playing with optimism, as though anything is possible any time he has the ball. The return of Antonio Valencia may be another contributory factor, the Ecuadorian here providing United with a series of threatening raids that encouraged the forwards to make answering runs.</p>
              <p>United made enough chances to have widened the margin considerably against a side whose coherence never came close to matching their spirit. You do not go away from home in the semi-final of the European Cup and expect to enjoy two-thirds of the possession and perhaps 90% of the chances. Come the end of the second leg at Old Trafford next Wednesday, however, it is unlikely that they will be rueing the number of opportunities they spurned here.</p>
              <p>Rooney, Ryan Giggs, Fábio da Silva, Park Ji-sung and Michael Carrick might all have lit up the scoreboard in the first half. But the best chances fell to Hernández, who found an impenetrable foe in Manuel Neuer, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Schalke" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/schalke"><span style="color: #005689;">Schalke</span></a>'s hero of the night.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old Mexican was quickly into his stride, darting through the Schalke defence with his increasingly familiar blend of persistence and a perceptive eye for fissures in the opposing defence. In the sixth minute he pulled away from his marker at the far post to meet a low, curling centre from Valencia with a shot saved by Neuer. Then he was scampering through to meet Park's prodded pass, only for Neuer to smother a shot from a difficult angle.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson bought Hernández in the summer but did not expect him to settle in so quickly. Before this match he had made 40 appearances in all competitions and scored 19 goals, a rate of return that has delighted not only his new manager but also United's support, responsive to his transparent eagerness.</p>
              <p>Hernández is a terrific goal-snatcher, a prodigy in the mould of Michael Owen, who travelled with United's squad but was not even named among the substitutes here, and of Raúl González, once the prodigy of all prodigies at Real Madrid, who led Schalke's line for this match without reward.</p>
              <p>Of their generation, born in the 1970s, Raúl, Owen and Filippo Inzaghi were the most lethal predators, all three with a gift for timing their sprints to confound the shrewdest defensive trap. Ferguson, who once admiringly joked that Inzaghi must have been "born offside", nurtures a particular affection for the breed, and now he has captured what looks very much like the latest example, similar in build and with an identical aim in life.</p>
              <p>Here, given considerable responsibility alongside Rooney, Hernández was able to show other dimensions of his play as he held the ball up in the centre under pressure from Schalke's burly centreâ€‘backs, Joël Matip and Christoph Metzelder, made occasional forays to the flanks and searched constantly for opportunities to create combinations with his attacking partner. From their different vantage points both Owen and Raúl must have been watching Hernández with a nostalgic ache as he fought a personal duel with the remarkable Neuer, who left the field at half-time to the sound of an ovation from the home fans behind his goal.</p>
              <p>After surely the most one-sided 45 minutes of United's season, Schalke could have taken the lead in the first 20 seconds after the interval, and it was Raúl who should have accepted the opportunity, racing in at the near post but failing, under Rio Ferdinand's timely challenge, to match his old standards by making a clean connection with Jefferson Farfán's perfect slanting pass. Six minutes later Hernández finally had the ball in Neuer's net, hooking it home with a brusque left-footed volley, only to be given offside. It was not as futile a gesture as it might have seemed. "That broke the dam," Ferguson said later. "After that the players knew they could beat the guy."</p>
              <p>Outside the stadium there were posters advertising a forthcoming Oldies Marathon, starring such museum pieces as Shakin' Stevens, the Rubettes, the Sweet, Smokie and Boney M. Eventually it was one of the golden oldies who broke the deadlock, Giggs cruising lethally on to Rooney's sweet reverse pass. But youth would not be kept down and two minutes later Hernández authored an equally cunning pass, from which Rooney suavely left the brave Neuer helpless once again.</p>
