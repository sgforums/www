'They are never the same after 70 minutes', he insisted. And once again, he was right." And Flamini said the late win also proved Arsenal, often accused of lacking the stomach for a fight in tough matches, were capable of battling to get a result.<br><br>"You have to be honest, Manchester played really well and we found it really difficult to get going," he added.<br><br>"They put up a real fight but Arsenal is not just a team which plays football. It is also a team which never gives in."<br><br>Also, another article-&gt; http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007030565,00.html<br><br>MANCHESTER UNITED must prove they are not the DadÂ’s Army of the Premiership in the race for title glory.<br><br>Alex Ferguson will react furiously to Arsene WengerÂ’s suggestion his old-timers are only good for 70 minutes.<br><br>But the statistics back up the Arsenal managerÂ’s claim that United are starting to feel the pace.<br><br>Even skipper Gary Neville concedes they threw it all away in the final 10 minutes at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.<br><br>United were heading for a nine-point lead at the top of the table after Wayne Rooney headed them into a 53rd-minute lead at Arsenal.<br><br>But they were unable to withstand a furious late fightback from the young Gunners, who equalised through Robin Van Persie in the 83rd minute before Thierry HenryÂ’s winner in the third minute of stoppage time. Five of UnitedÂ’s six defeats this season have been inflicted in the final stages.<br><br>In fact, a remarkable 46 per cent of all the goals they have conceded this season have come in the final 20 minutes.<br><br>That places a huge question mark over the stamina of an ageing team.<br><br>United boss Ferguson sent out his strongest side to face Arsenal and that included five stars well past their 30th birthday.<br><br>With an average age of 28.3 years, they are by far the oldest of the top four rivals and Fergie knows he will be relying on golden oldies Ryan Giggs, Henrik Larsson, Paul Scholes, Edwin van der Sar and Neville to carry them over the finishing line.<br><br>In sharp contrast, Arsenal had an average age of just 24.5 years.<br><br>So it is no surprise Gunners full-back Gael Clichy, 21, claimed: Â“We were better than United physically and showed a character and state of mind beyond reproach.<br><br>Â“While remaining faithful to our own game, we ended up by having them in the physical impact.Â”<br>!<br><br>Match-winner Henry added: Â“In the past few weeks we have been scoring a lot of goals in the dying minutes of the game, which tells you our squad is really on form.<br><br>Â“And this is coming at a time of the year when you are usually tired after the Christmas period.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know if we are unstoppable but the point is that we know we can deliver something throughout the whole game and that is important.<br><br>Â“We have a young team but I think the work we have been doing with all our coaching staff has been a big plus for us.<br><br>Â“If you donÂ’t work properly on the training field then the final five or 10 minutes will always be difficult in games.Â”<br><br>United skipper Neville admitted: Â“SundayÂ’s defeat was incredibly difficult to take. We had played so well, put in a good performance for 83 minutes and were kicked in the teeth right at the end.<br><br>Â“We were comfortably in control of the match and created the better chances in the first half.<br><br>Â“We got the goal through Wayne and everything was going so well until we conceded those two goals.Â”<br><br>It was the second time this season Arsenal had beaten their old rivals in the dying seconds.<br><br>How the goals go in<br>MANCHESTER UNITED<br>Conceded 26 goals in all competitions Â— 12 in last 20 minutes, which is ... 46.1%<br><br>CHELSEA<br>Conceded 25 goals in all competitions Â— eight in last 20 minutes which is ... 32%<br><br>LIVERPOOL<br>Conceded 36 goals in all competitions Â— eight in last 20 minutes, which is ... 22%<br><br>ARSENAL<br>Conceded 28 goals in all competitions Â— six in last 20 minutes, that is ... 21.4%<br><br>Emmanuel Adebayor scored in the 86th minute when they triumphed 1-0 at Old Trafford in September.<br><br>Wenger underlined his teamÂ’s superior staying power with his post-match analysis of SundayÂ’s game.<br><br>He said: Â“United were more mature than us in the first half and it took us time to get going. But we took over in the second half and for the last 20 minutes it was all us.<br><br>Â“Fabregas and Rosicky fought like mad to win the ball for Robin van PersieÂ’s goal, underlining the spirit and resilience of this young team.Â”<br><br>Even Ferguson acknowledged his team ran out of steam. The United boss said: Â“We controlled the first-half possession-wise but when we went ahead, maybe we sat back and played 10 yards deeper.<br><br>Â“I sent on Louis Saha for Henrik Larsson with 10 minutes to go to use his pace up front. The players worked hard and thereÂ’s not a lot I could fault them with.<br><br>Â“I couldnÂ’t see any danger throughout the whole day. But Arsenal resorted to long balls which is unlike a normal Arsenal team. When they tried their normal passing game our midfield coped well.Â”<br><br>With a six-point lead over second-placed Chelsea, United remain overwhelming favourites to win their first Premiership title in four years.<br><br>But their rivals will pounce on SundayÂ’s setback as a possible weakness.<br><br>How true do you think this statement is?? and if so, what should we do??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well its true that the premiership has high physical requirements, but i think conceding late goals sometimes is like winning 3-0 and you know just switching off.</div>
