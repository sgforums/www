              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo has once again reiterated his desire to stay at Manchester United despite rumours of his future resurfacing. </strong></p>
              <p>Reports over the weekend suggested that Real Madrid
              had agreed a price for the winger but that has now been dismissed by
              United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>The question received a frosty
              response from the Scot with the 23-year-old World Player of the year
              also seemingly unimpressed with the query.</p>
              <p>The 67-year-old
              manager was quoted as saying that he 'wouldn't sell Madrid a virus'
              during the World Club Cup in December and that viewpoint does not seem
              to have softened.</p>
              <p>"I am happy at this club. I think it is the right club," Ronaldo said.</p>
              <p>The
              reports also suggested that Real had stepped up their interest after
              hearing that the Portuguese international was growing tired of the
              constant rough treatment he receives in England.</p>
              <p>But the former Sporting ace admitted that this season was no different to the previous five at Old Trafford.</p>
              <h4>Rough treatment</h4>
              <p>"It has always been like that," he added.</p>
              <p>"It is only normal this season that the defenders have kicked me to try and stop me. It is just normal."</p>
              <p>United
              moved back to the top of the Premier League on Sunday with a last-gasp
              3-2 win over Aston Villa thanks to a brace from Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>The win ended a run of two straight league defeats and the player is now confident United can secure success at home and abroad.</p>
              <p>"We are the best team in England. We have shown that by being top of the table. That speaks for itself." he insisted.</p>
              <p>"We
              respect all our opponents but if we carry on winning, we will win the
              title again. We have a chance to win everything this season.</p>
              <p>"First we have to beat FC Porto. After that, we must carry on."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
              also sees similarities between his own debut against Bolton in August
              2003 and 17-year-old Federico Macheda's first appearance for the senior
              team on Sunday.</p>
              <h5>Similarities</h5>
              <p>The Italian youngster
              curled a sublime winner past Brad Friedel to ensure a valuable three
              points for the champions and his team-mate could not be more pleased
              for him.</p>
              <p>"It's similar to me," he pointed out.</p>
              <p>"The feeling
              is quite the same. I remember when I started to play for Manchester
              against Bolton when I came on (with) 70,000 supporters - it's not easy.</p>
              <p>"I play good, I did good skills, good passes. When Kiko
              (Macheda) scored I know what he is feeling, it is one of the best days
              of his life.</p>
              <p>"He is young and he can still improve and he is
              good. It is good to be involved with the first team and he scored a
              goal to help the team.</p>
              <p>"I am really, really happy for him."</p>

              <p>Maybe Ronny scared liao... He scared Kiko will overshadow him at United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But both are great players...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United seems to have unlimited striking talent:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rooney, Tevez, Berbatov, Welbeck and now Kiko (Mac delivery if u like)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now i want to see the strike partnership btw Rooney and Kiko. Will be very interesting.</p>
