'It's also the wish of the player.<br><br>'Everything is right and it is also financially right,' continued Beckenbauer.<br><br>Asked if reports about the size of the fee were true, he said: 'It will be around that size.'<br><br>The Canada-born midfield anchorman represented hometown club Calgary Foothills FC from 1994 to 1997 and had been contracted to Bayern until 2010.<br><br>His breakthrough year was 2001 when he starred in the Bayern team that won the Champions League, the Intercontinental Cup and the Bundesliga.<br><br>Hargreaves won many admirers for his performances in what was an otherwise disappointing performance by England in last year's World Cup.<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=431861&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=431861&amp;cc=4716</a></div>

Rooney likes to drop deep and play off a frontman, which is why during the FA Cup final, before the introduction of Smith, United were creating chances, but were not really threatening to score. But then again, there's been a slight problem in the striking department that looks set to be rectified in this transfer window.<br><br>We'll just hv to keep our fingers crossed and wait and see.</div>

That equates to about Â£17.5m and will be viewed as a good piece of business within Old Trafford, given that Bayern had initially set the price above Â£20m.<br><br>The finer points of the deal are still to be thrashed out but Hargreaves has already started looking for a house in the Manchester area ahead of joining his new team-mates when Ferguson's squad return for pre-season training on July 2. "Owen Hargreaves will go," Beckenbauer told the DFB-Doppelpass programme on German television. "It is the wish of the player. Everything is right for him and it is also financially right for us."<br><br>The arrival of Hargreaves signals Ferguson's intentions not to allow Chelsea to re-establish themselves as England's best team next season. It may also add variation to the way United play. Ferguson likes the idea of Hargreaves taking a defensive-midfield role alongside Michael Carrick, with Scholes pushed further forward in an attack-minded 4-2-3-1 formation, ideally with Louis Saha as the most advanced striker. Alternatively, Hargreaves can also fit into a more conventional four-man midfield, giving Ferguson a combative presence in an area of the pitch where United were noticeably sub-standard compared with Chelsea at Wembley.<br><br></div>

'World-class players are going to strengthen you and Owen is a top player.<br><br>'We need a big squad.
