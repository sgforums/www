              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Cristiano Ronaldo has given his clearest sign yet that he intends to stay at Manchester United<span class="iAs" style="border-bottom: medium none ! important; font-weight: normal ! important; font-size: 100% ! important; text-decoration: none ! important; padding-bottom: 0px ! important; color: darkblue ! important; background-color: transparent ! important;"></span> by declaring: "I feel at home and loved here."</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Fresh stories have emerged
              from Spain this month claiming the Portugal winger will move to Real
              Madrid in the summer after the Primera Liga champions failed to sign
              him last year.</p>
              <p>However, Ronaldo has reiterated that he is happy to remain at United.</p>
              <p>"Everything that revolves around Cristiano Ronaldo is a bit of
              speculation," he told Portuguese channel RTP. "Everything that I do
              generates a certain interest from the press and public.</p>
              <p>"But 90 per cent of what is said and written about me stems
              from speculation. The only thing that is true is that I am happy at
              Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"This is my home. Because I am winning things, because of friends, because of fans, I have always felt very loved.</p>
              <p>"I feel at home here, it is a very lovely stage in my career, as
              much because of the coach, who has always supported me, as because of
              the players.</p>
              <p>"I feel part of the furniture at United. I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow, but I feel very happy here."</p>
              <p>Last season was Ronaldo's best as his 42 goals helped fire United to Premier League and Champions League titles.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old has been duly rewarded for his stunning season
              with a host of individual honours including the Ballon d'Or and the
              FIFA World Player of the Year award.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo admits his rise to fame at such a young age has come as a surprise even to him.</p>
              <p>"To be honest I never imagined playing at a club like Manchester
              United," he continued. "I dreamed of Benfica, Porto and Sporting, but
              never arriving at this level.</p>
              <p>"I always dreamed of being a professional footballer but never
              even thought about signing for a club like United, to the extent that
              even when they came to see me I thought nothing would come of it, but
              after it proved true that they were interested in me."</p>
              <p>Despite winning almost everything in football, Ronaldo insists
              he still has a burning desire to add more awards to his already heaving
              mantelpiece.</p>
              <p>"I have never counted them, but there is space for more still," he said. "I want to win more things.</p>
              <p>"What I have already won is an incentive, but I want to win more.</p>
              <p>"In two or three years from now I want to have another Golden
              Boot, another Ballon d'Or and, who knows, maybe another World Player of
              the Year award."</p>
