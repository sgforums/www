            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://english.people.com.cn/200611/27/images/football3.jpg"><br><br>Manchester United chief Sir Alex Ferguson fears star winger Cristiano Ronaldo is being targeted by referees because of his extreme talent.<br><br>Ronaldo was only just returning from a three-match ban following his dismissal by Steve Bennett for headbutting Portsmouth's Richard Hughes when he was cautioned by Alan Wiley for diving during the Premier League win at Everton on Saturday.<br><br>Ferguson has reviewed both incidents on video and on each occasion, he feels the official clearly got it wrong.<br><br>And, on the eve of Ronaldo's return to his former club Sporting Lisbon, the Red Devils boss has expressed his anxiety over the treatment his star man is receiving.<br><br>"It is a worry for us," said Ferguson. "It is almost as though Cristiano is being punished for his success.<br><br>"There is no question in my mind there is an unfairness about it all.<br><br>"We have looked at the Portsmouth one from another angle and it was a quite ridiculous decision. Hughes said Cristiano never touched him, so he gets a three-match ban for that.<br><br>"And the one on Saturday was even more ludicrous. Quite clearly, Cristiano was tripped on the edge of the area. Why would Cristiano go down when he can score? On that occasion, the referee reacted far too quickly."<br><br>It is clearly an opinion Ronaldo concurs with, even though, sat two feet to his manager's right, the Portugal international opted not to enter the debate.<br><br>"What the boss says is true," said the 22-year-old. "But I don't want to talk about referees. I only want to speak about them to my manager and my team-mates."<br><br>Ferguson's concerns about Wednesday night's Champions League Group F opener at the Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon were only heightened when he was informed excitable German referee Herbert Fandel was in charge.<br><br>It would be fair to conclude United have an unhappy history as far as Fandel is concerned.<br><br>A trained pianist, Fandel has played all the wrong notes for Ferguson in the past, sending off Roy Keane during a stormy last 16 tussle with FC Porto three years ago before producing another red card to get rid of Paul Scholes in last season's quarter-final first leg against Roma.<br><br>Initially, Ferguson buried his head in his hands as Fandel's name was mentioned, before jokingly adding: "We need a supply of mogadon."<br><br>Whether he felt the calming drug was for Fandel or his own temper, Ferguson did not say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>on a case by case incident, Ronaldo did not dive and got mistimed tackled.<br><br>however, I believe his reputation goes before him.<br>to be fair, there are also questionable decisions that went for him in that game.<br><br>be it quick feet or whatever,  I hope that he doesn't get seriously injured before the authorities realised that they were wrong..</div>
