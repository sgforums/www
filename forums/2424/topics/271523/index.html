            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">The latest Tevez twist - West Ham 'agreed' to a Â£100,000 pay-off for the Argentine.</span><br><br>A West Ham document, said to accept that they would receive just Â£100,000 from Kia Joorabchian for the sale of Carlos Tevez this summer, was the central issue as a High Court preliminary hearing investigated the wrangle over the player's registration yesterday.</strong><br><br>Joorabchian's lawyers are sure this previously undisclosed contract amendment for Manchester United target Tevez, drawn up by Hammers chairman Eggert Magnusson and signed by his deputy-chief executive Scott Duxbury, on December 1, will win them the case as Joorabchian is suing West Ham for breach of contract in a bid to release the registration of Tevez.<br><br>West Ham, however, insist that the document was not counter-signed by Tevez, remained "unexecuted" and had been seen by the independent commission which investigated the deal for the Premier League.<br><br>It was among the contracts unilaterally terminated by West Ham to end the third party influence of Joorabchian's company MSI over Tevez after the commission fined the club Â£5.5million in April. Joorabchian claims that he and his companies own the economic rights to Tevez, 23, while West Ham claim they are the true 'owners' as they hold his registration. Tevez, currently in his native Argentina, will be called to give evidence by Joorabchian's lawyers, who also offered to provide handwriting experts to support their claims.<br><br>Magnusson, Duxbury and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore are also expected to be witnesses if the case makes it to court. Mr Justice Blackburne agreed to fast-track the case and schedule the three-day hearing from August 22 in order to complete it before the transfer deadline, although West Ham remain keen to settle the matter out of court.<br><br>Either way, the interpretation of the document dated December 1 looks set to be a crucial. It was drawn up by Magnusson, who completed his takeover in November, to amend the original contract signed in August when Tevez joined from Corinthians. West Ham's new Icelandic owner was apparently uncomfortable with the nature of the deal, and the player's form, so he changed the contract to include a clause that Joorabchian must find Tevez another club in the summer and that Magnusson agreed to accept a token Â£100,000 fee.<br><br>The document was sent to MSI for Tevez to counter-sign but, according to West Ham, was not returned. MSI, however, claim Tevez did sign it, that it was returned and they have offered to provide a handwriting expert to verify the signature. A copy of the contract minus the Tevez signature was submitted to the independent commission by the Hammers to be considered as evidence.<br><br>This will probably be enough to stop the Premier League from re-opening an investigation into Magnusson, who has always leant heavily on this deal being struck by his predecessor Terry Brown. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson remained resolute after learning he may be kept waiting almost another month to complete the protracted signing of Tevez.<br><br>With the transfer window closing at the end of August, Ferguson admitted contingency plans were being drawn up in case any judgement went against them, but was adamant they would not have to be used. Mindful that Tevez has declared his eagerness to join United and that a compromise could be struck by Joorabchian and West Ham, Ferguson said: "At least we know there will be a final decision at the High Court and if something happens before then, so much the better. We'd welcome that and I believe it would suit everyone. It has dragged on and it can be frustrating, but I am confident Tevez will be our player and so is our chief executive David Gill."<br></div>
