              <p>Ronaldo has been the transfer story of the summer, with the Portugal winger expressing his desire to play for Real, who in turn have made him their number one target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I understand Cristiano,' Tevez told <em>AS</em>. 'Every footballer wants to play at Real Madrid. On the other hand, I also think that everyone wants to play for Manchester United, but if what he seeks is something else, I think that should be respected.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United have been furious with Real's public pursuit of the player, once again reiterating this week that they have no intention of selling their prize asset.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Old Trafford team-mate Tevez has risked incurring the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson by claiming the European champions should not stand in Ronaldo's way if he wants to leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The (United) team has great players, including Cristiano Ronaldo, of course,' Tevez added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It's clear that he is a very important player for us, but this is a personal decision, which is up to only him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I have not talked to him, but when these things happen, neither side feels good.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, United legend Paul Scholes has warned Cristiano Ronaldo about leaving Manchester United and believes players should be thankful that they are playing for such an illustrious club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'If players fancy a move and a bit of money, then good luck to them, but when they're at a place like this, I don't think they realise how lucky they are to be playing here,' Scholes said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It's always a step down [after United]. There are obviously big clubs in the world, but while certain people think it might be a progression if they move somewhere else, when you leave here I don't think it is.'</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well said from scholes..nt sure if the media using tevez to say these things again..oh well</span></p>

              <p>if the guy wants to go, let him... it's hard to hold on to someone when his heart is somewhere else... the club should then make lemonade out of lemon and wring RM for as much money as they can.. and that's a truckload of cash...</p>

              <p>if want to leave leave lah no pt holding back someone who wont give 120% for the club.. im guessing they are just holding back bcos they dont want to lose face bcos they say no matter what they hold him back.. actions are the same, but motives are different now..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to think of it also.. its real madrid.. sure man u is a big club as big as real, but like what tevez said, every player wants to go to real bcos they've got illustrious players who had played for them.. figo, zidane, beckham, raul, ronaldo (fat one)... its a cult status to be a madrid player.. c.ronaldo is not a born-united player so he doesnt really have a deep sense of loyalty or belonging to the club..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ungrateful as it may seem, but at the end of the day, players do leave clubs, and some do stay..</p>

              <p>its saddening to see players nowadays (especially the young ones)
              displaying such a lack of professionalism. wanna go real wait until his

              should still give his all, no excuses.</p>

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Sir Alex defends Tevez over Ron row</h2>
              <p><strong>Spanish daily AS reported that Tevez understood why Ronaldo was keen
              to join Real, and that United would ‘have to respect it’ if the player
              did confirm his desire to move to the Bernabeu.</strong></p>
              <p>Such sentiments would clearly not sit well with Ferguson as he has
              spent the summer insisting that Ronaldo will not be moving to Spain,
              despite a constant stream of stories to the contrary.</p>
              <p>Now the bullish Scot has denied that Tevez weighed into the Ronaldo
              debate and has criticised the press for their treatment of the transfer
              saga.</p>
              <p>“Carlos Tevez did not say that,” said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>“At this moment in time we’re driven by a mad media who have to get stories out every day.</p>
              <p>“I can’t wait for the season to start so we can get back to some
              sense of normality and we can all settle down to play football again.
              These guys in the press are just crazy.”</p>
