              <p>ferguson time again and again make bad line-ups.</p>
              <p>Paul scholes should stop playing already, look at his passes today. Bad and giving away balls easily.</p>
              <p>berbaflop should go off too, he was missing during 2nd half.</p>
              <p>Last time, Man Utd was a 2nd half team winner but now they are first 20minutes team, after that they suck really bad. Can be said to perform lousier than WBA, a newly promoted side.</p>

              <p>Its worrying to see that so early in the season the players seem bereft of the desire to grind out a win already.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://picsrv.manutd.com/?fif=/manu/img_10_36849_9384.jpg&amp;obj=iip,1.0&amp;wid=240&amp;hei=359&amp;rgn=0.308,0.048034934497816595,0.48,0.5225618631732168&amp;cvt=jpeg" alt="" width="240" height="359"></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“From our first-half performance, which was outstanding, the criticism is that we didn’t finish them off,” the boss told <strong>MUTV</strong>. “Where it should have been 5-0 at half-time, we’ve gone in 2-0 up. That is an area we have to be concerned about.<br><br>“Everton
               away should have been five or six, we should have got three or four at 
              Fulham; and we’re losing points because of it. It’s not a defining 
              result in terms of where the league’s going to end up, but we can’t keep
               doing that. We are very frustrated about it. Two-nil is never a great 
              scoreline. If you lose a goal, it gives the other team a lifeline. I 
              always think 1-0 is better. It keeps the concentration better, you push 
              more for the second goal.”<br><br>As for the goals conceded, Sir Alex didn’t apportion blame. “They got a real break for 
              the first goal. I didn’t think it was a foul. But they got the luck 
              after that, it came off the inside of Evra’s leg and it was just a bad 
              bit of luck. The second goal… what can you say? Edwin has been playing 
              for over 20 years as a top goalkeeper and he was probably in primary 
              school the last time he made a mistake like that. You just have to wipe 
              it off the slate. There’s nothing you can do about it, it was just one 
              of these inexplicable errors.”<br><br>So United remain unbeaten, but 
              that statistic is no consolation for damaging dropped points. “There are
               two ways of looking at it,” concluded Sir Alex. “If we were a team in 
              the middle of the league you’d say we were undefeated. But for 
              Manchester United that’s not good enough.”</p>

              <p>He should have improve on the defence and not talking about scoring more goals to kill the game.</p>
              <p>In the past, man utd can defend for one goal lead. So criticise your defence don't use poor reason like man utd should score more goals to kill the game.</p>

              <p>united story so far. started very well and score goals in first half. second half inexplicably self destructed when opponents score 1 goal and then score another one to tie the score. united is performing well in one half, but went missing when second half started. how many points were dropped as a result? chelsea and man city must be laughing deep down due to united dropping so many 2 pointers.</p>

              <p>“Everton away should have been five or six, we should have got three or four at Fulham; and we’re losing points because of it. It’s not a defining result in terms of where the league’s going to end up, but we can’t keep doing that. "</p>

              <p>I feel that this sentence is a cover up of the poor man utd defence this season.</p>
              <p>He should have improve on the defence and not talking about scoring more goals to kill the game.</p>
              <p>In the past, man utd can defend for one goal lead. So criticise your defence don't use poor reason like man utd should score more goals to kill the game.</p>

              <p>But Man U really worked on defence in a goalless draw at Sunderland. IMO, that was the match when the defenders worked on how to prevent Sunderland from scoring, especially prevention of Darren Bent to stun Man U.</p>

              <p><br>Many draws will harm their chance of winning BPL. If this continues goes on, can finish 3rd liao. Remember 04/05 season, Man U had paid the price of claiming many draws.</p>
