              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson saluted his team's composure and killer
              instinct after United came from behind once again to beat Tottenham
              Hotspur at White Hart Lane.</strong><br><br>Jermain Defoe's stunning
              goal for Spurs after just 50 seconds wasn't the only blow to the
              champions - later, the Reds lost the services of Paul Scholes when he
              was harshly shown a second yellow card. But despite playing for more
              than half an hour with ten men, United wrapped up the win when Wayne
              Rooney scored on the counter-attack to make it 3-1.<br><br>"Wayne's goal came at a great time, it killed the game for us," reflected Sir Alex.<br><br>"We
              were under the cosh with the ten men and had to defend really well. We
              had some good counter-attacking play and the third goal finished the
              game."<br><br>Entering the game with maximum points, Tottenham quickly set United a test by taking that lightning lead through Defoe. <br><br>"I
              think it was always going to be a hard game," said Sir Alex. "Spurs are
              in great form at the moment and they got off to a fantastic start by
              scoring in the first minute. <br><br>"It was a marvellous finish from
              Defoe but it was early in the game and there were still ninety minutes
              to play. We had to gather our game and show our composure and I thought
              our football was fantastic."<br><br>After Ryan Giggs equalised from a
              free-kick, United went 2-1 up through a rare source as Anderson scored
              his first competitive goal for the Reds in 78 appearances.<br><br>"I hope that drives him on to get more because he's capable of that," said the manager.</p>
              <p>"He hasn't played a lot of games but he's part of a squad, we have so
              many midfield players and we have to rotate it at various times in the
              season and Anderson will play his part. He had a marvellous performance
              for us today."<br><br>The only blemish on a brilliant evening for United was the red card for Scholes.<br><br>"It was a terrible sending off," complained by Sir Alex. <br><br>"I
              think the referee (Andre Marriner) got it wrong. Scholes clearly lifted
              his leg above the player. I think the Tottenham player's done him, I
              think he (Tom Huddlestone) should have been punished. <br><br>"I've
              looked at it twice on the video and I can't see a sending-off in that.
              I think he was sent off because his name's Paul Scholes."</p>
