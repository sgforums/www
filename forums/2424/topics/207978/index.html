The important thing is Owen H should show no interest in training at Bayern Munich and make them realise that they forcing him to stay is only a waste of their money...<br><br>To be fair, Carrick is a good player... he just need to settle in and i am sure he will show that he is a good buy.<br><br>Tevez and Mascherano are good players but weather they can accustom themselves to the EPL and the weather is another thing... They didn't come from playing a few years or a year in Europe, they came straight from South America so it may be harder, a lot of difference cos English weather always raining and cold.<br><br>Honestly, i don't see them alone will be able to make WH into a top team, maybe a upper mid table one probably.<br><br>At first they said it was a loan deal but now they say its a permanent deal at $1m.</div>
