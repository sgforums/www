              <p><strong>Bayern Munich want </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> winger Ji Sung Park and are ready to bid £7million.</strong></p>
              <p>The South Korean is a popular figure at Old Trafford but ambitious Bayern recognise United are approaching a transitional stage and want to tempt them to sell and help fund their rebuilding.</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson says he needs two players but privately there are concerns he will need at least four top level performers with question marks over Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, plus Owen Hargreaves still to prove his long term fitness.</p>
              <p>Park, 29, has been a key figure in United's big games, scoring against Arsenal, Liverpool and AC Milan, but has endured fitness concerns himself following international matches involving long haul travel.</p>
              <p>He is contracted until 2012 and only this week said he wanted to stay at Old Trafford for the rest of his career.</p>
              <p>However, Bayern want to offer United a 90 per cent profit on the £4m they paid PSV Eindhoven for him in 2005 and that could trigger his departure.</p>
              <p>United have their own targets in mind including Everton's Steven Pienaar, Valencia's David Silva and Sotiris Ninis of Panathinaikos but are still to determine their budget.</p>

              <p>it seems a lot of football fans are easily impressed with pacy players. there are many around; SWP, park, aaron lennon, bellamy etc.</p>
              <p>i wouldnt go to the extend of saying they are no good.  they are simply over-rated and even over-priced.</p>
              <p>their pace definitely add to the excitement of the game - the main selling point of the premiership.  but thats just it.</p>

              <p>park is an intelligent footballer and can be deadly between the middle of the field and the final third. He is able to split defences. Woh man, I don't know what you are talking about lol.</p>
              <p>SWP I agree. Bellamy has superb technique which few british footballers have. And aaron lennon, besides his pace would be the perfect winger if he can send in more accurate crosses. He's working on it now.</p>
              <p>Defenitely not as one dimensional as you have mentioned...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>maybe fergie can turn park into a defensive midfielder like hargreaves or fletcher, since his stamina is so good and can run up and down the pitch. another option for fergie if hargreaves is so injury prone.</p></div>

              <p>you gotta be kidding, you know how many hancork media running ard OT simply becos Park is with ManU? they even have those visit OT and see our own hancork player pitting thier skill against the very best in the world, and you mean to say hancork fans dun buy anything?</p>
              <p>i kinda agreed with Rock on Park's performances for ManU, he will never be in the same mould as players like Becks, Ronaldo Giggs and the likes but this very guy some of you are claiming worthless are often seen banging the goals in or helping out with teammates when he gets his chance, and best part, he doesnt complain when he dun get those chances</p>

              <p>can't believe people here demeaning Park.</p>
              <p>He is a fantastic player, SAF has to go crazy before letting him go at 7M. Park worths more than that!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If silva does join united, then park chances in the team will be limited to the league and fa cup matches, he will be mostly on the bench in the league and maybe CL, who knows. But I feel he can play as a defensive midfielder, since his stamina is very good and cover a lot in the pitch. maybe its time for fergie to change his role to a defensive midfielder to protect the back 4.</p></div>
