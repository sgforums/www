            <div class='col-md body'>Patrice Evra became UnitedÂ’s eleventh different scorer this season as he capped his return to the starting eleven with the second goal in the RedsÂ’ 3-0 win over Everton.<br><br>The French full-back's second half strike was the pick of the bunch. Latching onto Rooney's clever through-ball, Evra angled his run towards goal from the left flank before firing his shot between Everton goalkeeper Richard Wright's legs.<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson is pleased with variety of goalscorers in his team, and has challenged the players yet to get off the mark to chip in as well.<br><br>Â“We were delighted with PatriceÂ’s goal,Â” he told MUTV.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re not too bothered where the goals come from, but I think one season we had 17 different scorers. If we can get somewhere near that then weÂ’d be very pleased.Â”<br><br>United could equal that total if the first-team regulars yet to score this season get themselves on the scoresheet. Yet to find the net this term are Michael Carrick, Wes Brown, Gaby Heinze, Gary Neville, Ji-sung Park and Alan Smith.<br></div>

Kanchelskis... he is one the best right winger IMHO, lightening fast, brave, willing to take on players, can cross well, chip in his fair share of goals.. if not for the 3 non EU player restriction i'm sure he would have played an even bigger role on Man Utd, but then again if he is still ard, maybe Beckham wouldn't have been able to score that amazing goal from middle of the field..cos he probably wouldn't get to start the game at all... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
