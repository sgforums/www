            <div class='col-md body'>Wayne Rooney did just about everything but find the back of the net against Aston Villa, but Sir Alex Ferguson has no great concerns about his lack of goals.<br><br>His influence and endeavour is not in question, but he has only scored three goals since striking a hat-trick against Bolton on 28 October.<br><br>Rooney hit the crossbar in the 3-1 win over Villa and had several shots saved by Thomas Sorensen. The impression is that once one goal comes, a glut will follow.<br><br>Â“He perhaps needs a goal just to give him the confidence that all strikers need,Â” said Sir Alex. Â“He hit the crossbar against Villa and had a few other chances.<br><br>Â“The important thing is that he is working hard and is enjoying his football at the moment. But I have no great concerns about Wayne.<br><br>"We missed a few chances, but that has been the nature of us this season. The most important thing is that we are creating chances and scoring a good portion of those opportunities. ItÂ’s not a big issue for us because there are enough players scoring goals for that to balance out.<br><br>"Michael got a goal, as did Ji-sung, which was good for them. There are quite a few goalscorers in the ranks now, we're just waiting for Gary Neville to get his yearly goal - I hope it's a really important game."<br><br>With the Reds travelling south to take on Arsenal next weekend, the first match at the Emirates Stadium would be a good place for Rooney to end his barren spell.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted that he is a little concerned by Wayne Rooney's lack of goals.<br><br>-&gt;http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=442664&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=1&amp;lid=3&amp;title=Sir+Alex's+Rooney+concern<br><br>The Manchester United chief is happy with Rooney's form, but he has netted just once since the middle of November.<br><br>United face Arsenal on Sunday, live on Sky Sports 1, and Rooney is sure to play a major role for The Red Devils at Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"He is a big-game player," said Ferguson. "You could say, in a lot of cases, it was bad luck. In the cup game against Villa he had nine attempts at goal.<br><br>"In the last game (against Villa) he had a fantastic strike which hit the bar.<br><br>"He just needs a little break. I'm concerned by it."<br><br>Ferguson is keen for Rooney to find some consistency in front of goal, but the Scot says the 21-year-old's work ethic is beyond reproach.<br><br>"What he needs to do is get these odd goals," added Ferguson. "He has had spells of two and three. He needs to get into scoring a goal a game that strikers can do.<br><br>"If he can do that he would make a big difference in the title run-in.<br><br>"He is working his socks off the boy. He has a terrific attitude and we are happy with that."</div>
