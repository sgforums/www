            <div class='col-md body'>Co-ownership deals can be rather tricky. Wonder if that will put Fergie off as I dun think he wants another drawn out transfer saga after the long chase for Hargreaves.<br><br>As i understand it, independent offers have to be made to the respective clubs. Making it possibly twice as difficult to acquire the player.<br><br>But, if he's really worth it, then I believe United will go all out to get him. Hopefully he's worth it.</div>

They had indicated yesterday that they would be ready to sell the player if the price was right, and Sampdoria have moved to secure him.<br><br>A 6 million euro deal has been struck between the clubs, which could well turn out to be quite a bargain for Samp.<br><br>The agreement was reached between Udinese director general Pietro Leonardi and Samdoria general manager Beppe Marotta this evening, and a confirmation is expected soon.<br><br>This should clear the way for teams to bid for the striker, who is being followed by Roma, Inter, Juventus and Manchester United, and is rated at at around 15-20 million.</div>
