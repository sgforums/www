              <p><strong>Real steal Kar from United<br></strong>United were last night handed another bitter blow by Real Madrid as the Spaniards signed Lyon star Karim Benzema for £30million. SunSport had told you exclusively weeks ago that France striker Benzema was the man Old Trafford chief Alex Ferguson wanted to replace Carlos Tevez. But free-spending Real president Florentino Perez nabbed the ace to leave Fergie reeling - just three weeks after finally prising Cristiano Ronaldo away with a world-record £80m move. Benzema, 22, became Madrid's fourth signing so far this summer after the capture of Ronaldo and the £62m deal for Kaka from Milan and Raul Albiol's £13m move from Valencia. <br><em>Antony Kastrinakis, The Sun<br><br></em>The tabloid also says reported United transfer target <strong>Franck Ribery</strong> will leave <strong>Bayern Munich</strong> - but only for <strong>Real Madrid</strong>. "I have made up my mind, I want to leave. It will be Real Madrid or nothing," the winger is quoted as saying.<br><br>After missing out on Benzema, the <em>Daily Mirror</em> says Sir Alex is pressing ahead with his interest in Atletico Madrid playmaker <strong>Sergio Aguero</strong>, who is likely to cost £40m.<br><br>In other news, <em>The Sun</em> claims Sir Alex's son Darren faces a battle with his dad to sign Stockport County centre-half <strong>Josh Thompson</strong>.<br><br>Meanwhile, the <em>Daily Star</em> reckons <strong>Fraizer Campbell</strong> will complete his move to <strong>Hull</strong> once he has resolved his cash dispute with United.</p>
