              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has
              said he is researching new signings, but admitted he may not buy anyone
              this summer.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson has not added to his Champions League-winning squad, despite being linked with a host of big-name targets.</p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov is still on the Scot's wanted
              list and discussions will continue over other potential signings until
              the transfer deadline at the end of the month.</p>
              <p>However, despite a growing injury list that looks certain to
              keep Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and half a dozen other senior men
              out of the opening Premier League game against Newcastle on August 17,
              Ferguson may keep his cash where it is.</p>
              <p>"We might well start 2008-09 with largely the squad we had last season - and after all, they didn't do too badly," he said.</p>
              <p>"We have not brought in the kind of top-quality player everyone seems to be expecting.</p>
              <p>"We are still researching and looking but it is not easy and certainly we are not desperate."</p>
              <p>In Nani, who will be suspended against Newcastle, and Anderson,
              who is on Olympic duty with Brazil, United have two men likely to show
              significant improvement on their first year at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Angola striker Manucho is due to apply for a work permit and
              success of that, plus the emergence of Rafael da Silva at right-back
              and the failure to get Berbatov for a price he feels is realistic could
              be enough to convince Ferguson he does not require any new blood.</p>
              <p>"We have the right balance of youth and experience thanks to
              the work we did in the transfer market the previous year," he claimed.</p>
              <p>"In terms of numbers we have been boosted by the return from
              loan of several young players who have the potential to go all the way.</p>
              <p>"So I think we already have the men for the job."</p>

              <p>actually, I think it is a smart move.</p>
              <p>why held ransom by Spurs over Berba?</p>
              <p>secondlly, we all know Ronaldo is leaving next season, why not use this season to sound out a good replacement and splash the cash next season?</p>
              <p>anyway, it is so short to the start of season, anyone coming in will have a rush job of fitting in, and with so many 1st team out, how to do that?</p>
              <p>money is the pocket is better than splashing it and getting a veron..</p>

              <p>Fergie is just at it again lah... I belief he will still get a striker before the end of this month... Spurs are making it difficult only but on their own end, they can't seem to get a replacement as well so this thing is being hold up...</p>
              <p>Fergie saying all these could be his mind games at work, to warn Spurs if they continue to be difficult, maybe he won't buy Berba anymore... If Spurs suddenly spend another $30 to $40 millions on players, They will have to sell Berbatov to balance their books...</p>
              <p>As it is, they already had a $15m bid for Dean Ashton rejected by WH... So when they have got their man, United will get theirs...</p>
