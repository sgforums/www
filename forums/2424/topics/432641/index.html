              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>David De Gea finds the challenge of succeeding Edwin van der Sar at Manchester United far more daunting than becoming the most expensive goalkeeper in the history of the Barclays Premier League. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">De Gea kept a clean sheet in Spain’s 2-0 Under 21 European Championship win over the Czech Republic on Wednesday and his £17.5million move to Old Trafford from Atletico Madrid will go through after he returns from the tournament. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The deal will make the 20-year-old the second most expensive goalkeeper ever, behind Gianluigi Buffon of Juventus, but De Gea is not fazed by the price tag. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: ‘I’m not interested in numbers, clauses and prices. Real value is that which you show on the pitch, not what they say you are worth. Money is secondary and while being that expensive is not something I like particularly, what really interests me is how much worth people think I have on the pitch.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">De Gea is more concerned with following in the footsteps of 40-year-old Van der Sar who retired at the end of last season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: ‘That a team like United think of you as a replacement for a goalkeeper as strong as Van der Sar is great, but I have to keep fighting and working because I’m just at the start of my career and to get to his level will take a lot of effort. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Hopefully I will still be playing at his age. You need strength, luck and to take great care of your body, because football consumes you.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Asked how he and his girlfriend, Spanish pop star Edurne, would cope with the increased media spotlight, De Gea added: ‘I don’t think it will be a problem. Edurne will keep singing ballads and I’ll keep stopping balls. Everyone else can say or do what they like.’</span></p>

              <p><strong>Atletico Madrid goalkeeper and Manchester United target David de Gea has revealed his two biggest idols were Old Trafford icons Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. </strong></p>
              <p>The 20-year-old keeper, who is away with Spain's under-21 side in the European Championships in Denmark, is expected to seal a move to United at the beginning of next month, but the youngster says he is focused on his national team for now.</p>
              <p>"I am trying to stay focused on the Euros for now because it's fundamentally important to our hopes that we all think only about that," he told AS in an interview.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the keeper admits he is proud of United's interest in signing him.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United are a great club and if they are interested in you, it's a compliment," he said.</p>
              <p>The deal is set to go ahead early next month and not beforehand, because the negotiations have been handled by Portuguese agent Jorge Mendes, who will not represent De Gea until the beginning of July, when the deal with his current representative runs out.</p>
              <p>However, the official line from the player is he wants to concentrate on the Euros.</p>
              <p>"I'm just more relaxed if I focus on the Euros," he said.</p>
              <p>"I want my head here, not somewhere else."</p>
              <p>Despite those words, a move to United looks a formality, though, and De Gea will hope to follow in the footsteps of two of his idols.</p>
              <p>"Edwin has been playing at 20 years at the highest level; he's a great goalkeeper and a big point of reference for me," he said.</p>
              <p>"(When I was younger) I liked (Peter) Schmeichel a lot, as well as Van der Sar - they're the two best that I've seen."</p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>David De Gea is expected to finally rubber-stamp his £17.8million switch to Manchester United after arriving for his medical.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>As exclusively revealed by Sportsmail earlier this year, the Atletico Madrid goalkeeper - who helped Spain to Under 21 Euro glory on Saturday - has been pinpointed as the successor to Edwin van der Sar, who retired at the end of the season. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>De Gea arrived at Bridgewater Hospital on Monday to put the finishing touches to his move, which will take United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's summer spending past the £50m mark.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferguson has already recruited England pair Ashley Young and Phil Jones - from Aston Villa and Blackburn respectively - for a combined fee of £32.5m. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Although Ferguson considered deals for Manuel Neuer and Maarten Stekelenburg, who are now heading for Bayern Munich and Roma respectively, De Gea quickly emerged as his No 1 target.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He told La Gaceta: 'I very much welcome this news because David is a great keeper. When it becomes official he is going to start working to prove in the Premier League what a good goalkeeper he is.' </span></p>

              <p class="art-txt-first"><strong>Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard has vowed to fight for the number one jersey at Old Trafford next season.</strong></p>
              <p>Danish international Lindegaard, who joined United last January from Aalesund, found himself third-choice last season behind Edwin van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak.</p>
              <p>Despite the retirement of Van der Sar, Lindegaard could find his path to the starting XI blocked by the possible arrival of David De Gea from Atletico Madrid.</p>
              <p>Lindegaard, who made only two first-team appearances last season, is excited about the new season ahead and is ready do all he can to win the starting spot at United.</p>
              <p>"I am really excited to get things started. It will be an exciting season for me and for the team," Lindegaard told Norwegian daily Sunmorsposten.</p>
              <p>"I will fight with all I have for the [goalkeeper's] position to be mine.</p>
              <p>"The goal for Manchester United is to win as many titles as possible and I will do my best to contribute to this."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DAVID DE GEA arrived at Manchester United with a trophy on his arm — and we don't mean the European Under-21 Championship.</h2>
              <p>Get a load of his girlfriend Edurne, who will leave every WAG at Old Trafford desperate to raise their game next season.</p>
              <p>At 25, the stunning Spanish pop star is five years older than Alex Ferguson's new £18.3million goalkeeper. And while her music is far from critically acclaimed back home, her looks are enough to make her as big a star as the man who has to fill the void left by Edwin van der Sar's retirement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the new-found fame the pair will attract, De Gea is trying to keep his feet on the ground. He said: "I don't think it will be a problem - Edurne will keep singing ballads and I will keep stopping balls.</p>
              <p>"Everyone else can say or do what they like."</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Those words show the deep and serious character of the young Spaniard, who had a medical in Manchester on Monday as part of his switch from Atletico Madrid. Indeed United's new golden couple are like chalk and cheese.</p>
              <p>De Gea is not even a fan of pop music like his missus sings. Heavy metal is his thing... although he does have a touch of the old romantic in him as he lists Titanic as his favourite film.</p>
              <p>While Edurne is outgoing and showy — as our picture suggests — De Gea is very grounded.</p>
              <p>He said: "From the first moment people started to recognise me and fame has arrived, I've tried really hard to keep the same people around me, do precisely the same things as before and to stay grounded thanks to my family.</p>
              <p>"Being praised, no it doesn't worry me. One day you are being praised and the next people are on top of you.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>"If you keep your feet on the ground you'll never get above your station."</p>
              <p>He is a young man who has not forgotten his roots in Illescas — a municipality 25 miles outside Madrid the population of which would fill the Stretford End at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He goes back there to visit his old school and is a hero to the kids there. His old school master at the Castilla School is Jose Luis Garcia who describes De Gea as an inspiration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Garcia said: "David was a very, very good student.</p>
              <p>"He came from a very good family background and always had a very positive attitude. He was with us from the age of four to 17.</p>
              <p>"Academically he was very good, although not so much in English — he wasn't very good at that!</p>
              <p>"But, of course, he was brilliant at all sports. He excelled at basketball and football. He had very big hands so it is no surprise to us he's a goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>"But, for all his success with Atletico Madrid, David hasn't changed a bit. He has always been a modest lad and very down to earth. He is not big headed at all and I don't think anything will change that either. He's just very normal.</p>
              <p>"He is often back in school and always wants to see his old teachers. He brings in autographs and pictures and will always spend time talking to the children about doing well in school."</p>
              <p>De Gea's rise has been dramatic after only 18 months in Atletico's first team.</p>
              <p>He played in all 38 La Liga games for Atletico last season, conceding 53 goals behind a defence which made West Ham's look like a fortress.</p>
              <p>But boss Ferguson saw something he liked way back in September. Which is why he kept track of De Gea all season and finally agreed to pay £18.3m for him last month.</p>
              <p>His judgment is backed by some of the biggest goalkeeping names in the game, including Spain's current No 1 World Cup-winner Iker Casillas.</p>
              <p>De Gea helped Spain win the Euro Under-21 title by beating Switzerland 2-0 in Saturday's final.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>And Real Madrid star Casillas reckons the youngster will soon be battling to take his place in the full international side despite more competition from Liverpool's Pepe Reina and Barcelona's Victor Valdes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Casillas said: "He could pension us all off. He will soon be fighting for my place.</p>
              <p>"We have to take care of him because he is the future. Watching him reminds me a lot of when I started 12 years ago."</p>
              <p>De Gea faces a tough introduction to English football against neighbours Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 7.</p>
              <p>United goalkeeping legend Alex Stepney, 68, said: "Making your debut in a Manchester derby is as big a test as they come.</p>
              <p>"Mine was at Old Trafford against City. We won 1-0 and it really settled me down.</p>
              <p>"If you've got that experience under your belt straight away then it is priceless."</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> have completed the signing of the Atlético Madrid goalkeeper David de Gea on a five-year contract.</strong></p>
              <p>De Gea is United's third new signing of the summer, following the deals for Phil Jones and Ashley Young.</p>
              <p>De Gea told MUTV: "I feel very proud and I can't wait to start playing here. When a club the size of Manchester United comes in for you it obviously makes you very, very happy.</p>
              <p>"I saw their interest as an extra motivation to work even harder to show off my ability. It's a great privilege to be part of a club like United and I'm keen to do my best and show what I can do."</p>
              <p>With Anders Lindegaard also having arrived at the club in December, it now appears likely that Tomasz Kuszczak will be allowed to leave, even though the Pole was on the bench for last month's Champions League final defeat to Barcelona.</p>
              <p>It is thought United are still hoping to secure at least one more new signing following confirmation of Paul Scholes' retirement. Luka Modric and Alexis Sanchez were both of interest to Sir Alex Ferguson, although it appears neither man will end up at Old Trafford, while doubt remains over United's ability to sign Internazionale's Wesley Sneijder.</p>

              <p>I'm just worried because he's Spanish. At the end of the day, the press and tabloids are sure to exert tremendous amount of pressure on him as to whether he would move to big Spanish Clubs - Barcelona and Real Madrid, should he play well.</p>
              <p>And he doesn't speak English, I wonder how does he communicate with the backline?</p>
