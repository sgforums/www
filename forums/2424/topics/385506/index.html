              <p><strong>Sir Alex admits life at United could be tough until the club’s defensive injury crisis eases.<br><br></strong>The Reds slumped to a 3-0 defeat against Fulham on Saturday, with Sir Alex again forced to play midfielders in the heart of United’s backline.<br><br>Seven defenders were unavailable for selection at Craven Cottage – Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Jonny Evans, Gary Neville, Wes Brown, John O’Shea and Rafael are all sidelined – so Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher reprised their central defensive roles. Alongside them was young Belgian defender Ritchie De Laet, making just his sixth appearance at senior level. <br><br>And although United’s makeshift defences have largely coped well in recent weeks, Saturday’s reshuffled backline struggled and United suffered a fifth league defeat of the season.<br><br>“I hope that loss doesn’t prove too damaging,” Sir Alex told <em>MUTV </em>afterwards. “In other words, I hope it doesn’t cost us the league. <br><br>“There was a fragility at the back today, but we couldn’t do anything about that. I have sympathy for my players because it’s difficult for midfielders to play as centre-backs and Ritchie De Laet’s only 20 years of age so he’s not yet got the experience you need for these type of matches.<br><br>“The players are feeling a little bit sorry for themselves at the moment because of the situation they find themselves in. But I think it’s obvious that if we get our defenders back we’ll be okay. We need to them back to give us a proper chance of challenging for the league.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sir Alex went on to reveal United’s physios and medical staff are “working over-time” to get players off the treatment table and back on the pitch. Some defenders – Jonny Evans and John O'Shea – aren't expected to return until the end of January but others should be back in action before the New Year.<br><br>On Friday morning the manager told reporters that Gary Neville and Rafael could return for the Reds’ trip to Hull City on 27 December, while Wes Brown may be fit for the home game against Wigan Athletic two days later.</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson believes Manchester United are a different proposition heading into the second half of the season as injuries start to ease.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>United welcomed back a trio of key defenders in Nemanja Vidic, Wes Brown and Rafael da Silva at Hull on Sunday and immediately looked stronger than the side humbled by Fulham last week.</p>
              <p>The champions still needed to battle hard to shake off a determined Hull but their eventual 3-1 win left them well placed behind leaders Chelsea midway through their Premier League campaign.</p>
              <p>Ferguson told MUTV: "It was a bonus having two centre-backs back - it made a heck of a difference to us.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully in the next few weeks Jonny Evans will be back, as for Rio Ferdinand we will have to wait and see.</p>
              <p>"But I'd think when the European campaign gets going again we should have a strong squad together.</p>
              <p>"Rafa and Fabio [da Silva] were both back too and it makes a difference to us.</p>
              <p>"You'd expect us to get some continuity defensively soon and that will make a difference."</p>
              <p>United have already lost five games this season but such has been the competitive nature of the league, none of their rivals have been able to take full advantage.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: "There have been some strange results in the first half of the season - I said in a recent conference I thought that 41 points had been dropped by the recognised top four but I think it's about 65.</p>
              <p>"It's unusual and maybe good for the league in the sense no-one is winning games easily, everyone is battling for the points.</p>
              <p>"The Premier League is the only place to be so you can understand the way Hull battled."</p>
              <p>United's victory owed much to an extraordinary performance from Wayne Rooney.</p>
              <p>The England striker opened the scoring and then set up United's two clinching goals after committing the mistake that led to Hull's penalty equaliser.</p>
              <p>United went back ahead when Andy Dawson turned a Rooney cross into his own net and Dimitar Berbatov tapped in their third after a superb pass from his strike partner.</p>
              <p>The in-form Rooney has now scored six goals in his last six games.</p>
              <p>Berbatov believes United are now well placed to launch yet another title charge.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian said: "We are in a great position. There are a lot of games before the end of the season but we have great players.</p>
              <p>"There are a lot of games this time of year and it's a been a bit of a difficult time with the injuries but the players are coming back now.</p>
              <p>"The boss knows what he's doing and I'm sure at the end of the season we will be on top."</p>
              <p>United are next in action on Wednesday as Wigan visit Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The three-day turnaround is more generous than that of other sides and should give the likes of Brown and Vidic the chance to recover.</p>
              <p>Brown had only been given an outside chance of featuring at Hull after a hamstring injury but the 30-year-old felt his return went well.</p>
              <p>He said: "I thought it was a good performance and a good win.</p>
              <p>"Hull made it tough for us but we did well in the end.</p>
              <p>"I had no feelings from my hamstring so the 12 days I had out (did the job).</p>
              <p>"Myself, Nemanja and Rafael were back and hopefully soon Jonny, Gary Neville and Rio will be back so we can be back to a full-strength squad.</p>
              <p>"Wayne was devastated when he played their player in for their penalty but he keeps on going. He didn't mean to do it, it was one of those things.</p>
              <p>"But if anything it made him work harder. He's got such passion for the game and his performance I thought was fantastic.</p>
              <p>"It's been a funny old season. Teams are losing games to everyone.</p>
              <p>"I think now we've got to start winning and keep the run going. We're in a confident mood now."</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs played 78 minutes at Hull on his return from a hamstring injury but fellow veteran Paul Scholes, who made a bad error at Fulham, did not even make the bench.</p>

              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson still expects Chelsea to emerge as the most serious threat to Manchester United's hopes of a record championship four-timer.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>In the wake of Sunday's win at Hull, Wayne Rooney labelled as "crazy" a season in which United suffered five defeats before Christmas, Chelsea go seven games without a win, Liverpool slump to eighth and Arsenal remain in the title race despite twice being written off after falling away following damaging defeats.</p>
              <p>With Aston Villa, Tottenham and Manchester City all in the hunt and even Birmingham flying high on the back of an 11-game unbeaten run, nothing can be taken for granted.</p>
              <p>Yet, eventually, as everyone predicted last summer, Ferguson sees United and Chelsea scrapping it out for the biggest honour.</p>
              <p>"At the start of the season I saw Chelsea as our biggest danger and I have not changed my mind," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Nobody has had a consistent run really and although it is not looking like it at the moment, history tells you that two teams break away at the end.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea are the big danger because they too have great experience."</p>
              <p>Given he has spent the last six weeks operating with hardly any defenders, Ferguson admitted he would gladly accept having a two-point deficit to make up heading into 2010, which would be the case if United manage to record an 11th straight win against Wigan tomorrow night.</p>
              <p>As Gary Neville returns from a groin injury, Ferguson could name an experienced back four, even if Edwin van der Sar has been placed on extended compassionate leave after his wife Annemarie suffered a brain haemorrhage at home in Holland on December 23.</p>
              <p>Amazingly, not only are United still in the thick of the title picture, they are only one point worse off than last season, and have actually scored more goals, which is staggering given the £80million summer departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>"People looked at us losing Ronaldo and saw that as being crucial," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"They felt we wouldn't be nearly as good without him.</p>
              <p>"Cristiano was an unbelievable player. But we have adjusted to it. There is only one point difference."</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is hardly a surprise Rooney has relished the extra responsibility.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old might not be as overtly showy as Ronaldo but his focus and determination have been invaluable to the Old Trafford outfit at times this season.</p>
              <p>At Hull on Sunday, he played a major role in all four goals, scoring his 14th goal of the season to put the Red Devils ahead, then creating two more after his mistake had allowed the Tigers to level at the KC Stadium.</p>
              <p>It was a welcome revival after a couple of lethargic performances, one that his manager is hoping will continue.</p>
              <p>"Wayne was fantastic on Sunday. That was the Wayne Rooney we know," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"He had a quiet spell for two or three matches but he was explosive at Hull. He was a constant threat.</p>
              <p>"That is the kind of form we are hoping for because when he is playing like that, he is hard to handle."</p>
              <p>With just nine goals needed to match his best campaign for the Red Devils - in 2006-07 when he ended up as a title winner for the first time - Rooney has a clear personal focus as he strives for more team honours.</p>
              <p>"Strikers always have personal targets," said Ferguson, once a forward himself.</p>
              <p>"They always want to get to a certain number of goals and maybe look at their best season.</p>
              <p>"That is a good thing, providing they do not forget the fact they are a team player."</p>
              <p>The impact of Dimitar Berbatov has been equally significant.</p>
              <p>Berbatov is yet to win over a section of the United support since his club record £30.75million arrival from Tottenham 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>But his efficiency is starting to pay dividends and, having eased him through a knee injury Ferguson is now confident will not require an operation, the Bulgarian will be a key figure in the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
              <p>"Dimitar has had a bit of a knee niggle but it is a lot better now," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"We have been treating him quite carefully because we know that we need him in the important second part of the season.</p>
              <p>"He came through a full game against Hull and felt fine. He doesn't need an operation and hopefully that is it gone now."</p>
