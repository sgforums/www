              <p>Edwin van der Sar wants to be Manchester United’s No.1 keeper until he lifts the Champions League again.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman is finding it impossible to decide on a retirement date even though he is just a month from his 39th birthday.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar has targeted the Premier League clash with Bolton on October 17 for his return from the finger injury that has sidelined him since pre-season, and that could be bad news for England hopeful Ben Foster.</p>
              <p>And Van der Sar told Sunday Mirror Sport his hunger for more United success means he is likely to sign a contract extension that will take him to 2011 and into his 40s.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar, close to agreeing to a World Cup comeback for Holland, said: “I don’t want to pack it in. At the end of my holiday this summer, I was itching to go back to the training ground.</p>
              <p>“I have the hunger to win the Champions League again. It does not matter that I won it in the past.</p>
              <p>“The season could not start soon enough for me and it was unfortunate I got injured. After our pre-season tour in Korea, I said something about my future and the next day it was all over the back pages that I wanted to ruin Foster’s World Cup dream.</p>
              <p>“That was nonsense. Foster got more playing time than ever last season because I was taking rests.</p>
              <p>“I think Foster has done well as my replacement. But I still work as hard as all the others at training, whether I’m old enough to be their dad or not.”</p>
              <p>After winning the European Cup with Ajax and United, the agony of last season’s final defeat to Barcelona has sharpened his desire to win the trophy again.</p>
              <p>And he believes that while Real Madrid have Cristiano Ronaldo, it is the presence of Sir Alex Ferguson that gives United the edge.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar said: “I am not concerned by what Real Madrid have done. It is all about the team spirit. Eleven Cristiano Ronaldos wouldn’t lead to success.</p>
              <p>“I know some people think differently. But when you play with 11 Ronaldos, not many of them would care about defensive duties.</p>
              <p>“Three English clubs were among the last four in the Champions League last season. Everyone knows the Premier League is the best in the world.</p>
              <p>“But because we lost to Barca and Real buy some big names, suddenly we have to be in awe of Spanish football.</p>
              <p>“Of course, Ronaldo was a big player for us. And we have to change our team a bit now. But we will do that. United is a lot bigger than Ronaldo.”</p>
              <p>He added: “Alex Ferguson is the man who guarantees continuity at this club. He has built an empire and a group of loyal and trustworthy people around him and the team.</p>
              <p>“He does not need to be at the training ground every day. He does not even have to try and influence me to sign again.</p>
              <p>“As a player you know what you have got at United because of all the staff around Fergie. They are all great people. The trick is that as a player here, you know you are employed by a multi-million pound football company, but inside it feels as if you are surrounded by family.”</p>
