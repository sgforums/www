              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.05em; FONT-SIZE: 1.05em">DIMITAR BERBATOV has revealed how he revived his Manchester United career by putting himself through a punishing summer of training.</h2>
              <p>The Bulgarian striker admits he was disappointed with his United form in his first two seasons, but now he believes everything is coming right.</p>
              <p>Berbatov, 29, said: "I was disappointed with myself that I could not please all the supporters. "I've said before, the people of Manchester United are the judges and that is the way it should be. It's their team. I am a guest - a privileged guest.</p>
              <p>"Now I feel like everything I imagine on the pitch will come true and that feels awesome.</p>
              <p>"I have worked hard on my fitness. So hard. I'm not a weights guy, I'm sure you can see by my body. But I have been trying to even work on that.</p>
              <p>"I ran six miles every day during the off season. I watched one World Cup match, went for a run, then watched another and went for another run. This was my routine."</p>
              <p>Berbatov is getting his rewards in a spectacular way - most notably his incredible hat-trick in Sunday's 3-2 victory over Liverpool.</p>
              <p>He added: "This crowd at Old Trafford. The way I feel right now. I'm not tired, I feel alive. "I have always said I am so lucky to play here. For these people. For this manager. For this club. With these players."</p>
              <p>But while the emotion was clearly bubbling away inside, he admitted after the game he finds it difficult to show it outwardly and would not be dwelling on his achievements with recordings of his heroics.</p>
              <p>He said: "No! I can't watch myself. Even when I came off and everyone was applauding I felt so shy. I love it but I don't know how to react to it.</p>
              <p>"I'm going to go home, play with my family and maybe watch a movie later. I cannot wait for training. How weird is that!"</p>

              <p><strong>Berbatov is just no ordinary man and no ordinary player - as his second goal at Old Trafford on Sunday showed. He took a cross from Nani on his knee, flicked the ball up before executing an incredible overhead kick. But what he takes real pride in is his charity work back home in Bulgaria.</strong></p>
              <p>The intensely, private and humble striker is more likely to be checking that his foundation to help orphans and disadvantaged kids is still on track than reliving any heroics of his own.</p>
              <p>Berbatov has not forgotten his tough upbringing in a communist country. He added: "I am not the sort of person who courts attention or talks much in or outside the dressing room.</p>
              <p>"But when it comes to my foundation I want to talk because it is a very special thing.</p>
              <p>"The foundation is in my own name and we try to support talented kids who want to do something with their lives, whether it's acting or football.</p>
              <p>"My organisation also helps kids without any parents in orphanages. It is very important to me and the more people who can help it the better. I do it because I want to help these kids and give something back.</p>
              <p>"If I can show kids the way and support them to do the same it would be great."</p>
              <p>As part of his foundation Berbatov gives money to five children's homes. His generosity is not a new thing, either, for even when he was starting out as a player he saved a sick Bulgarian girl by paying for her liver transplant operation in 2001.</p>
              <p>It is this side of him as much as anything why people in Bulgaria will have been celebrating his heroics against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>His team-mates and over 70,000 people at Old Trafford were, too, with his hat-trick bringing his tally to seven goals in six games this season.</p>
              <p>It's an incredible statistic given he boasted just 26 from 86 appearances in two seasons up to the start of this campaign.</p>
              <p>Last season boss Alex Ferguson preferred a half-fit Wayne Rooney to Berbatov in big games and left him out of the 2009 Champions League final line-up.</p>
              <p>Now he is taking over from Rooney as the key player in United's team this season. Captain Nemanja Vidic has revealed Berbatov has changed his game to make sure the goals start flowing.</p>
              <p>Vidic said: "We are all aware how good Dimitar is. His skills with the ball are incredible. "The criticism he got last year was because he didn't score many goals. This season he is scoring a lot and important ones, too.</p>
              <p>"He has learned what to do. He has changed his game compared to last season. He is in the box more and is more of a threat.</p>
              <p>"Dimitar has always had a great touch and gave us composure but because he is also going into the box, he is scoring goals.</p>
              <p>"If he keeps doing that we have a good chance to win the league and for him to gain some personal reward by becoming player of the year."</p>
              <p>Full-back Patrice Evra was not surprised by Berbatov's brilliant second goal and said: "He does this in training and can do it many times. I hope he will carry on like that all season."</p>
              <p>Every United fan will say 'aye' to that.</p>
