              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/people/england/1941/rio-ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a> has dismissed pundit Alan Hansen's opinion that he should retire from the <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/teams/england/16/england">England</a> team.<br><br>The
               ex-Liverpool centre-back stated yesterday that the Three Lions skipper 
              should concentrate on club duty after he fell victim to repeat injuries.
               After Ferdinand overcame the latest knock that kept him out for five 
              months and saw him miss World Cup 2010, he intends to build on his 
              comeback match against Montenegro tonight.<br><br>"How many times did he play for Scotland? You can’t retire from England. I can’t," Ferdinand was quoted as saying by the <em>Daily Express</em>.<br><br>“To
               stop doing that for me, personally, would be taking a big chunk out of 
              my footballing life. I love playing for Man United and I’m thankful for 
              that every morning when I wake up, but I do for England, too.<br><br>“Unless
               I’m physically incapable of doing it, it’s something I would not 
              consider. It’s not got to the point where a doctor has suggested it.<br><br>“If I need to make a decision between club and country, I will be making it.<br><br>“It is not for anyone else to do even if they are entitled to their opinion.<br><br>“I
               am working as hard as I can to make sure I am ready and fit and well 
              for club and country. Retiring from my country is not something I think 
              about. <br><br>"People have done it. You respect their decisions. <br><br>"I won’t be one of them unless I am forced to through injury.”</span></p>

              <p>i think he should do that smart thingy like Giggs/Scholes, and retires.</p>
              <p>Given his actual playing time with MUFC, he was soley missed as MUFC lost out on the title/UCL. With him fully healed and back, will be boost.</p>
              <p>England should be rebuilding and focusing on youth. Give Smalling a chance and retire, Rio..</p>

              <p>smalling is molded after Rio, so he should help to nurture.</p>
              <p>not to run england to the ground, but with their current squad, i think Rio should focus more on United, more chance of winning silverware.</p>

              <p>Manchester United captain Rio Ferdinand has commended the club for resolving their differences with Wayne Rooney and told the striker not to worry about Sir Alex Ferguson's transfer policy.</p>
              <p>Rooney looked set to leave Old Trafford after statements issued by both himself and Ferguson confirmed speculation he did not wish to sign a new deal with United but a dramatic U-turn today saw him pen a new five-year contract.</p>
              <p>One of the reasons given by Rooney for failing to agree terms was a lack of guarantees about investment in the squad, something that appeared to cast a negative light on Ferguson's recent acquisitions.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand is delighted his England team-mate is once again committed to the club but suggested his concerns over transfers were unfounded.</p>
              <p>"Obviously it's been an awkward couple of days and the club have done a fantastic job putting this to bed as quickly as we have," Ferdinand told MUTV.</p>
              <p>"I think Wazza (Rooney) knows he's a Manchester United player, he knows this is where he's best. He's seen players leave and talk about regretting it and he's come to the true way of thinking which is that this is the best place for him.</p>
              <p>"Wazza wanted questions answered and he obviously got the right answers, which is good for the club.</p>
              <p>"He's made his mind up that he wants to stay and we're happy as players, I'm sure the fans will be and the manager is too."</p>
              <p>The central defender added: "Wayne's a big part of the success we've had in the last few years but it's never down to one individual and the manager always states that.</p>
              <p>"The manager is probably the most successful British manager there has ever been, we trust and believe in everything he does, the players he signs and the players he chooses to bring from the youth team.</p>
              <p>"We trust his judgement and he's never seen us wrong so far so there's no reason to doubt him in any way, shape or form."</p>
