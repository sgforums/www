              <p>Darren Fletcher has borne the brunt of plenty of jibes since
              establishing himself ain the Manchester United first-team squad - and
              says there are still people at the club who don’t think he has the
              talent to become a star at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The Scotland international has been the subject of several transfer
              rumours this summer, but is determined to tough it out at United.</p>
              <p>He has endured accusations that he is afforded preferential
              treatment by Ferguson because they are both Scots, but knows it is only
              his ability that has kept him at club since he first broke into the
              first-team in 2003.</p>
              <p>He said of the jibes when talking to The Manchester Evening News: "He [Fergie] gets called my dad, my granddad, you name it.</p>
              <p>"I get it all the time and I'm sure people think that's why I'm in the team.<br><br>"I've
              been there since I was 12 and maybe he took a special interest because
              I was Scottish. But I know when I signed it didn't matter if you were
              Scottish, Norwegian or whatever. If you are not good enough, you won't
              get in the team.<br><br>"I've been in the youth team with a lot of
              Scottish players. A lot of Scottish players have been there and I don't
              think the manager would have had the success he's had if he only wanted
              Scottish players in his team.<br><br>"I get a lot of people saying I'm
              only picked because I'm Scottish and that's fine. It's water off a
              duck's back. People will say what they want, there is nothing you can
              do about that."<br><br>Everton, Sunderland and Birmingham have all been
              interested in signing Fletcher, 24, this summer, since the end of last
              season, but Ferguson has not been tempted to sell.</p>
              <p>He agrees he has a strong relationship with Ferguson, but no stronger than that enjoyed by his United team-mates.<br><br>"We can talk about Scottish football, but at the same time he's talking to Ronaldo and Nani about the Portuguese game," he said.<br><br>"He
              loves his football that much that he goes home and watches all these
              games. He will talk to me about Celtic and Rangers and the Scotland
              game, but at the same time he will talk about Sporting Lisbon's game.<br><br>"You can say what you want. I never came to Manchester United because Alex Ferguson is Scottish.<br><br>"I came to Manchester United because they were the best team in the Premier League and Alex Ferguson was the best manager.<br><br>"You
              want to learn from the best and if I didn't achieve it here I always
              said I could say I gave my best and if I came up short then fine.”<br><br>He
              added: "There is competition for places, which drives you on, but until
              you are at the stage when you are not needed, then you have to move on.
              I've not felt like that, but who knows what the future holds or when
              your time is up at United?</p>
              <p>"The manager decides that or if you feel you are not helping the team or playing enough games and then it is time to go.<br><br>"But until that time comes I'm going to work hard and take every disappointment and use it as a fuel to get into the team."</p>
