              <h1>Chelsea Chairman: Ferguson Wouldn't Have Survived Slow Start At Manchester United Today</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/123kvsw.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Chelsea
              have attracted criticism for their recent hiring and firing of
              managers, their perceived lack of patience contrasting with the
              situations at Old Trafford and the Emirates, where longevity has been
              the order of the day for both Arsenal's Arsene Wenger and, especially, Manchester United's Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>However,
              perhaps reacting to accusations that Chelsea are somewhat
              trigger-happy, their chairman Bruce Buck has said he thinks the
              unimpressive start Ferguson made at Old Trafford would have seen him
              ousted in today's climate long before the four years it took the Scot
              to land his first trophy as United boss.<br><br>It is generally
              believed that Fergie, appointed in the Autumn of 1986, was on the verge
              of being fired before Mark Robins scored the goal that kept them in the
              1990 FA Cup, which they went on to win. The rest, as they say, is
              history - and a glittering history at that, including a remarkable 10
              Premier League titles, two Champions League triumphs, a Cup Winners'
              Cup win, four more FA Cups and two League Cups.<br><br>Ferguson is now
              in his 23rd season at the United helm, while Wenger (three League
              titles and four FA Cups) is in his 13th at Arsenal. Chelsea, in
              contrast, have Guus Hiddink taking charge of the team for the first time this weekend, the Dutchman becoming their fourth manager in less than 18 months.<br><br>In the opinion of many, his predecessor, Luiz Felipe Scolari, was not given nearly enough time in the job.<br><br>But
              Buck has told Chelsea's official website, "A lot of people talk about
              continuity in managers and I think that we as a board and Roman
              [Abramovich, the Blues' owner] would agree that continuity is a real
              plus.<br><br>“But we don’t think it’s continuity for continuity’s sake and it has to be with the right person at the right time. <br><br>“Everyone
              points to Arsene Wenger at Arsenal and Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester
              United as situations where continuity has worked very well. But
              football has moved on and I think it was four, five years before Alex
              Ferguson really won anything at Manchester United. <br><br>“I think
              the way dynamics of football are today, that’s not really acceptable.
              When Manchester United does finally change coaches, and they will at
              some point, I don’t think they will have the luxury of waiting four,
              five, six or seven years for their new manager to win a trophy. <br><br>“I
              think times are different from when Wenger and Ferguson first started
              their jobs. Everyone looks at continuity as helpful and as relevant but
              there’s not a lot of it because of the nature of football. <br><br>“So yes, continuity is important but it has to be with the right person and it’s very hard to achieve.”</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Witht eh current united squad, if you don't win anything, you deserve to be sacked. What they failed to noticed is that Ferguson and Wenger did'nt inherit a good team. Fergie inherited a recently promoted team of drunkards and turned them into winners. Scholari inherited a team perfectly capable of winning the title....</p></div>
