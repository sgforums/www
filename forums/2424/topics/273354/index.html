            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://soccerlens.com/images/RooneyRonaldo.jpg"><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has told Manchester United's title rivals they have not seen the best of star pair Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>The duo have long been thought of as two of the most promising young talents in the world and scored 23 goals each as United stormed to their ninth Premier League crown.<br><br>Ferguson acknowledged they could buck the trend of when players reach their peak but, as his side prepare to begin the defence of their title against Reading on Sunday, he has no hesitation in outlining his belief both players can deliver even more.<br><br>"There is no doubt Rooney and Ronaldo can do better," he said.<br><br>"As a player, I felt at my strongest when I was 25 and 26, so they have another three years or more before they get anywhere near their peak and maturity.<br><br>"At 21, you do daft things on the pitch. You produce moments of ability but there is no consistency. You might score a goal, then miss one.<br><br>"Maybe these two defy that a little bit but experience gives you authority, timing and control."<br><br>During pre-season both players have shown glimpses of hitting form, with Rooney in particular impressing.<br><br>The England star has been on the verge of losing his temper on occasion too, notably in Sunday's Community Shield win over Chelsea when he ranted at what he felt was an unfair booking for a foul on Petr Cech.<br><br>Ferguson accepts such tirades are not always desirable but the Scot recognises they are part of Rooney's make up and he is not about to do anything that could diffuse the striker's spark.<br><br>"He will always have that," Ferguson added. "Wayne knows when he has done wrong, so when he is unfairly treated he reacts to it.<br><br>"You don't want him to do that all the time but at least there is an honesty about what he does."</div>
