              <p><strong>It’s fair to say that United’s games at the new Wembley haven’t exactly been thrill-a-minute barnstormers.<br><br></strong>Last season we were involved in two goalless draws, enlivened by penalty shoot-out climaxes. But from the off yesterday, the Carling Cup final was a great spectacle.<br><br>The early goal – and debate surrounding it – was just what the game needed. Villa’s fans were incensed by referee Phil Dowd’s refusal to send off Nemanja Vidic for his foul on Gabriel Agbonlahor.<br><br>Though James Milner put away the resultant spot-kick, one half of the crowd were on Dowd’s case for the remaining 85 minutes, and it made for a lively encounter that we might not otherwise have been treated to. United’s support, too, were in fine voice to refute the ‘no atmosphere’ accusation levelled by some at the reincarnated Wembley.<br><br>Given that slight reprieve by Dowd, United came out of the blocks looking for an equaliser, and instantly the game opened up. Michael Owen’s finish was typically clinical, and it was disappointing to see him forced off through injury – even if the man who replaced him must have instilled fear into Villa’s hearts.<br><br>Wayne Rooney is in such scintillating form that you expect him to score every time he gets the ball anywhere near goal. Yesterday he had to settle for one goal, yet another immaculate header, to retain the Carling Cup for his side.<br><br>It was a fluid display from United and one that will please Sir Alex and his coaching staff. Vidic recovered from his early setback to dominate Agbonlahor, Tomasz Kuszczak was rarely troubled and Dimitar Berbatov showed some delightful touches.<br><br>Meanwhile, Antonio Valencia, Ji-sung Park and Darren Fletcher were immense in midfield, particularly after the break. Villa couldn’t handle the Reds’ pace on the break and the scoreline could easily have been more lopsided.<br><br>As a United fan I always feel privileged to make the trip to Wembley – many other clubs’ supporters will never be afforded the experience. It was a long coach trip down yesterday – we convened at Old Trafford at 7.10am and didn’t get back until 10.45pm – but well worth it, and especially so after United’s win.<br><br>Cup finals are special, and not just for the match itself. Arriving en masse at motorway service stations in the Midlands, walking down Wembley Way to soak up the pre-match atmosphere, queuing on the car park for over an hour after the game, singing songs and watching United DVDs on the way home – all these add up to a memorable occasion that doesn't come round that often.<br><br>The Carling Cup may only have been fourth on the list of United’s priorities at the start of the season. But it’s too easy to take trophies for granted and we should be savouring this latest piece of silverware.<br><br>It is, after all, the very first time in our illustrious history that we’ve retained a cup. Let’s hope there’s more excitement to come in the final three months of the season.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Gary Neville hopes the Carling Cup will again be a trigger for further triumphs.</strong><br><br>The club captain feels winning the trophy has had a galvanising effect in the past, and would like more of the same as the Reds chase league and European glory in the final three months of the 2009/10 campaign.<br><br>"People may say it's the lesser of the cup competitions but I think this can be a springboard for us to go on and be more successful," Neville told MUTV. "It's proved to be in previous years and hopefully it will be again this season."<br><br>The Carling Cup was the first silverware that Neville collected as skipper in 2006 and while no more trophies were added that season, it whet the appetite for Wayne Rooney and co to win the league in 2007. Last year's final triumph over Tottenham was soon followed by another title, and the Reds also went very close to claiming the European crown.<br><br>"This competition has been really good to us in the last few years, and it's great to get a medal around your neck this early in the season," added Neville.<br><br>Explaining the happy but slightly muted mood in the Wembley dressing room, he said: "If it was the last game in the season, we'd all be delirious. But there's so much still to play for.<br><br>"We go to Wolves on Saturday, hopefully with all our players back fit from the internationals, and then we've obviously got a big game against Milan.<br><br>"Fulham and Liverpool are coming up too and we have to win every game in the league. Nobody's pulling away in the title race but now it's time for us to step up and go for it."</p></div>
