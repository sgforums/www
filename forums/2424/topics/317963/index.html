              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney is anxious for Manchester United to claim bragging rights over Liverpool and win the Champions League.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> The England striker has been hurting for the past</strong> three years after Rafael
                      Benitez delivered the trophy to Anfield following a remarkable victory against
                      AC Milan.</p>
              <p>Now Rooney will get his chance on Wednesday in Moscow when United face Chelsea
                      in the first all-English showdown in the final of Europe's top club
                      competition.
                      It has been a long wait for the 22-year-old, born in Liverpool and raised as
                      an Everton supporter.</p>
              <p>He said: 'It is difficult when you see one of your rivals winning things.
                      When Liverpool took the trophy, it was hard to take.
                      'Because they haven't really been challenging for the league in the last few
                      years, they've had chances to rest players before big Champions League games and
                      that helped them.
                      'By Liverpool winning the Champions League, it's made us want to win it even
                      more.'
                      Rooney gets great pleasure teasing his pals from the Kop.
                      One such scenario unfolded nine years ago when United won the European Cup
                      with a famous last-gasp victory against Bayern Munich in Barcelona.</p>
              <p>He explained: 'A few of us watched the match and most of my mates were
                      Liverpool fans.
                      'It was just me and another pal who were Everton supporters. We wanted United
                      to win and obviously they (my mates) didn't.
                      'When they won, I was really happy and we were winding the Liverpool fans
                      up.
                      'I remember listening to the radio after the game and they were speaking to a
                      lot of fans around Manchester.
                      'The atmosphere there sounded brilliant, so hopefully I can be involved in
                      something like that this year.'
                      That was the last time United won the trophy - they also lifted it in 1968.</p>
              <p>Forty years on from Sir Matt Busby's triumph and 50 years after the Munich air
                      disaster, the weight of history hangs heavily in the air.
                      Rooney, however, is inspired by the past, not fazed by it.
                      He said: 'I don't think it will be a burden, we just need to go out there and
                      try and enjoy ourselves.
                      'If we enjoy playing, I'm sure we will do well. If we go out there thinking a
                      bit negative then it becomes harder.
                      'The players are well educated in the history of the club.</p>
              <p>When you
                      walk around the training ground, you see the players from 1958,
                      1968 all the way through to today.'
                      Rooney weighed in with 18 goals in a season that saw United retain their
                      Barclays Premier League title.
                      While he was widely applauded for his work ethic and team play, he insists
                      there is room for improvement.
                      He said: 'I can score a few more goals, possibly with my left foot and a some
                      more headers. I keep working on all different things, my passing, my fitness and scoring.
                      'I've changed my game a little bit. Instead of playing in the
                      hole or off one
                      forward, I've mainly been the striker looking to get in behind.</p>
              <p>I've
                      enjoyed doing it this year - to be honest a lot more than I thought I
                      would. It has brought me a few goals in different games.'
                      Led by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, United will fly out to Russia tomorrow and
                      Rooney is desperate for the match to get under way.
                      He said: 'It's a horrible feeling waiting for the final. I'd like to go to
                      bed tonight and wake up on Wednesday. It's a bit like Christmas when you're a kid, so I just can't wait.
                      'I've been playing FIFA on X-Box with my mates. My girlfriend's not too happy
                      with me, but it keeps me occupied. I've played in three cup finals, winning one and losing two, so hopefully I
                      can even that out.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets hope he scores in the final<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> still play xbox confrim is fifa 06</p>
