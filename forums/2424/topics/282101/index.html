            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson admits Wes Brown is revelling as an interim right-back during Gary Neville's enforced injury absence.<br><br>The Reds' club captain is back in training after more than six months out of action, but Brown's recent outstanding displays have not gone unnoticed by the United manager.<br><br>"Wes Brown is a great substitute for Gary because he's a terrific defender," Sir Alex told Manchester United Radio.<br><br>"His two best performances have come against Sporting Lisbon and Chelsea. He's played his guts out in Gary's position."<br><br>United sit second in the Barclays Premier League table, despite a shot-shy start to the season, thanks to a miserly defence that has conceded just twice in seven games.<br><br>Edwin van der Sar was a virtual spectator in Sunday's win over Chelsea, and Sir Alex has been delighted with his side's collective defending.<br><br>"I must say, in home games this season, we've done that quite a lot," he said. "Reading and Sunderland hardly had a shot between them. I don't think we're doing a lot wrong.<br><br>"The team ethic has been good and everyone's working very hard to win the ball back," Sir Alex said. "That's all down to team-work, all of them, not just one or two."<br><br>Sir Alex is hopeful that his side's 2-0 triumph over Chelsea Â– the Reds' first two-goal haul since April Â– will prompt a return to the traditionally goal-laden play United can produce.<br><br>"There's no question this club is built on goals," he said. "I was talking with Sir Bobby the other day and he said he'd never heard of four straight 1-0 wins. I said 'I'll be getting sacked soon!'.<br><br>"I'll take four 2-0 wins now. The way we attack and the way we play, of course you expect goals, but I think they'll come now."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think he's doing okay la, but i still feel he and Ronaldo sometimes not on same wavelength. Unlike Gaz and Ronny.<br><br>Probably needs more match time with Ronaldo, but once Gaz is back, its back to bench warming for him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
