              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> has branded Manchester City's handling of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=20"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark Hughes</span></a> dismissal as "unacceptable".</p>
              <p>Hughes was sacked immediately after last Saturday's victory over Sunderland, even though it had been common knowledge throughout the day that his time as Blues chief was up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>City have come under fire this week for the whole way they have gone about installing Roberto Mancini as Hughes successor.</p>
              <p>Blues chief executive Garry Cook has attempted to defend his position, although that has managed only to draw more ire from his club's interrogators. And Ferguson feels Cook is trying to defend the indefensible.</p>
              <p>''It is so obvious that kind of behaviour is not acceptable,'' said the United boss. ''It doesn't matter whether you have lost 20 games or two, there is a way to treat people. For some reason Christmas seems to bring out the worst in directors. I do not know how you can do something like that.''</p>
              <p>Ferguson was one of the first to phone Hughes, having also spoken with another former player, Steve Bruce, who had instantly defended his old team-mate on Saturday evening.</p>
              <p>''To be sitting throughout the game knowing there was something going on was terrible,'' said Ferguson. ''I spoke to Mark the next day and I could tell he was suffering. Steve Bruce felt that as well.</p>
              <p>''On Saturday the rumour mill was working overtime and Mark obviously realised it was his last game. It was a terrible position to be in.''</p>
              <p>Having been part of the double-winning 1994 side that Ferguson regards as the most mentally strong of his time at United, the Scot was not surprised that Bruce was so quick to leap in on Hughes' behalf. To Ferguson's mind it showed a loyalty that City so sadly lacked.</p>
              <p>''In the game of football you have disputes with managers from time to time,'' he reflected. ''But what Steve did was defend an old team-mate. That great team of 1994 stood by each other. Their loyalty to each other was fantastic. That team would fight the devil together.</p>
              <p>''It was as if Steve was saying: 'That is my team-mate you are talking about'. I was really proud of him. I thought he did fantastic. And Mark really appreciated it. He sees that kind of loyalty, which he didn't get from City from one of his old team-mates.''</p>

              <p><strong>The recent events at Eastlands have served to emphasise the strong bond that ties former United players who now plough different Premier League furrows.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester City’s decision to sack Mark Hughes last Saturday and install Roberto Mancini as his successor was met with surprise and outrage by some sections of the media.</p>
              <p>One manager who leapt to Hughes’ defence was Steve Bruce, his team-mate for seven years at Old Trafford. The Sunderland manager, whose side had lost 4-3 to City just before the announcement, branded the decision as “unbelievable” and added that he was “really disappointed” for his counterpart.</p>
              <p>It was a gesture of solidarity for an ex-Red that pleased Sir Alex Ferguson, who was himself surprised and unhappy to see Hughes go.</p>
              <p>“I think everyone was shocked,” Sir Alex said. “I spoke to Mark the next day and I could tell he was suffering. I spoke to him about Steve Bruce, who was fantastic after the game.</p>
              <p>“In football you have disputes with managers from time to time, but what Steve Bruce did was defend an old team-mate. They were both part of that great team of the ’90s and they all stood by each other – their loyalty to each other was fantastic.</p>
              <p>“That team would fight for each other and that’s what Steve Bruce did. It was like he was saying, ‘that’s my team-mate you’re talking about’.</p>
              <p>“I was really proud of Steve and I know Mark really appreciated it. Mark recognised the loyalty from his old team-mate which he didn’t get at City.”</p>
              <p>Sir Alex was appalled by the way Hughes was treated but backed his former striker to come back stronger.</p>
              <p>“It was unacceptable behaviour,” the Reds boss added. “It doesn't matter whether you have lost 20 games or two, there is a way to treat people.</p>
              <p>“I don’t know how you can do something like that. From Saturday morning the rumour mill was working and Mark must have realised it was his last game. It was a terrible position to be in. Brucey said he felt it during the game.</p>
              <p>“But Mark will bounce back, absolutely. He did a great job for Wales and at Blackburn. And, as everyone thought at the time, he was the right man for City. But he’ll be okay.”</p>

              <p>Michael Carrick cannot wait for his first experience of a Manchester United-Leeds clash, dubbed the War of the Roses.</p>
              <p>United encounters with Leeds have been missing from the fixture list since 2004, when the Elland Road outfit were relegated following the catastrophic financial problems incurred when they "chased the dream" of establishing themselves among England's elite.</p>
              <p>And the fall did not stop there. They were in League One before finally hitting rock bottom, although after a couple of failed promotion attempts it appears the West Yorkshire outfit are on the rise again under impressive young manager Simon Grayson.</p>
              <p>There is certainly enough optimism around Leeds just now to ensure a scramble for all 9,000 tickets they have been given for Sunday's eagerly-awaited FA Cup tie at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>And, although he knows the reception he faces will be decidedly frosty at one end of the ground, Carrick is eager to get out in the middle.</p>
              <p>"Experiencing those types of feisty atmospheres are why you play football," he said.</p>
              <p>"Rivalries like that add extra spice. It is great for the fans and good for the players.</p>
              <p>"No matter where you play, or whether the atmosphere is for or against you, it is a great feeling to play.</p>
              <p>"Besiktas were very hostile when we went there earlier this season but it was still terrific to play in.</p>
              <p>"Leeds are bringing a lot of fans and we are looking forward to it. It should be a cracking game."</p>
              <p>Although history dictates any match between the biggest two teams who represent the red and white roses will have an extra edge, the reality of the situation suggests a comfortable home win.</p>
              <p>As Leeds were unable to break their Old Trafford hoodoo when they were competing on level terms, their current status in the third tier of the English game hardly suggests a first win at the home of their bitter rivals since 1981.</p>
              <p>It means United should take a small step forward in another competition, having already secured a Champions League knock-out meeting with AC Milan, a Carling Cup semi-final with Manchester City and second spot in the Premier League, two points adrift of current pace-setters Chelsea following last night's five-goal hammering of Wigan.</p>
              <p>By general agreement, their latest success represented United's best performance of a campaign blighted by injury, in addition to the major adjustment required following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>But now they have set a suitable standard from which to push for honours, Carrick is expecting far more convincing displays during the second half of the season.</p>
              <p>"We have not hit top form all season, especially at home," said Carrick.</p>
              <p>"We have just been doing enough to get through. We know we are better than that and now is the time to do it.</p>
              <p>"It is a busy time until the end of the season. We need to get a run going and start playing some good football.</p>
              <p>"We are in a good position in the league, we have the FA Cup coming up, we are through to the Champions League last 16 and reached the Carling Cup semi-finals.</p>
              <p>"We have done as much as we can so far. Now is the time to really drive on and achieve things again. That is why we are here."</p>
