            <div class='col-md body'>The only thing Rooney is not doing right now is scoring goals. Which is important of course but he has contributed in many other ways. His creating chances for others in the team and his willingness to get back to defend where some strikers won't bother is still a plus to the team.<br><br>His scoring form will be back, and Larsson addition at this time is just right with Saha injured.</div>

Cause with Larsson, and Ole (on good form), and if Saha is fit, Rooney may be rested.<br>For me, from his injury, to the WC, and now, he is simply putting his body to too much abuse.. He should get a rest now if possible and then come back blasting.<br><br>Who can forget the night when he first came on for United, in that fateful UCL game, with his clean-shaven head, and his shooting...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i watched Man U play Newcastle and wonder why did Fergie kept Solksjaer &amp; not name him as sub.  He will have put away some of the chances going his way.<br><br>Park, poor lad, though he looked like a pale shadow but I would give him a few more games before condemning.  I think Rooney has taken a different role somewhat, he is not at eagerly pushing to be the receving guy and more often than not, he plays a bit of midfielder - as if trying to complement Ronaldo.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as for the goals, sometimes, have to give credit to opposing players.<br>the one by Milner, stunner..<br><br>I am beginning to question EdwinVS's ability.<br><br>for Milner's goal, he can't even reach the top half of the goal, and for 2nd goal, he seems to be so late. Given his reach, he should be able to save that.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree, I think the first goal was within his ability to save.  He underestimated the flight &amp; tenacity of the ball. Not for the second, because of the deflection from Scholes, if not, he would have it covered.<br><br>But he did make a very good save from Siberski's header, thats a point blank, reflex save.<br><br></div>
