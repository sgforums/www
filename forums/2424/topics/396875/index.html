              <p><strong>It looked for all the world as if Manchester United would have to settle for 
              a point against locals rivals City in Saturday's crucial Premier League 
              match.</strong></p>
              <p>Once again, we reckoned without United's extraordinary knack of claiming 
              victory with time almost up.</p>
              <p>It has become one of the defining characteristics of Sir Alex Ferguson's 
              remarkable era as United manager.</p>
              <p>Here are some other late, late shows produced by Ferguson's men.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">1993: Steve Bruce</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> heads Fergie and United into ecstasy </span></h2>
              <p>They still talk about this one - it was probably the first of United's epic 
              late goals that have helped to shape football over the past couple of 
              decades.</p>
              <p>Steve Bruce headed home two goals in stoppage time, the second after about 
              140 minutes, to spark celebrations from Sir Alex and Brian Kidd that will long 
              stay in the memory. United took advantage of a crucial victory to go on and win 
              a first league title for 26 years.</p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">1999: Ole Solskjaer knocks 
              bitter rivals Liverpool out of FA Cup</span></h2>
              <p>This one is often forgotten when they talk about United's 'annus miraculous' 
              of 1999.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were leading 1-0 and seemingly on their way to knocking their 
              bitter rivals out of the FA Cup, but Dwight Yorke equalised with time running 
              out and in stoppage time Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fired home a winner that send Old 
              Trafford into delirium.</p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">1999: United stage late show in 
              Nou Camp to win European Cup</span></h2>
              <p>No place, no time and no moment could compare with the Nou Camp in May 1999, 
              when United stunned Bayern Munich to win their first European Cup in 31 
              years.</p>
              <p>Mario Basler's free-kick had put Bayern in front, and as the game entered 
              stoppage time German ribbons were being tied round the famous old trophy.</p>
              <p>United turned history on its head however, with Teddy Sheringham firing home 
              an equaliser and then Solskjaer flicking the ball into the roof of the net to 
              set up the party of a lifetime in Barcelona.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-0-0154D38700000578-457_468x343.jpg" alt="Solskjaer" width="468" height="343">

              </div>
              <h2 style="color: #ff0000;"><span>2007: John O'Shea 
              silences the Kop but delights Sir Alex</span></h2>
              <p>United were clearly second best in a Premier League clash against their great 
              rivals Liverpool at Anfield in 2007 (as they had been a week earlier when 
              Cristiano Ronaldo scored a dramatic late winner against Fulham at Craven 
              Cottage).</p>
              <p>That made what happened in stoppage time all the sweeter for supporters, as 
              Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina fumbled a Ronaldo free kick and John O'Shea blasted 
              the ball into the roof of the net in front of a disbelieving Kop. Sir Alex was 
              delirious once more, and United went on to win a first league title in four 
              seasons.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-1266751-067758E60000044D-602_468x356.jpg" alt="John O'Shea " width="468" height="356">

              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">2009: Federico Macheda scores 
              wonder goal to stun Villa</span></h2>
              <p>Another vintage piece of Old Trafford theatre, the sort that falls into the 
              'you couldn't make it up' category.</p>
              <p>United had already suffered a couple of disappointing results before Aston 
              Villa took a 2-1 lead at Old Trafford that had the natives twitching.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo scored an equaliser before 17-year-old Italian substitute Federico 
              Macheda turned and curled home a magnificent winner to put United back in charge 
              of the title race.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-1266751-044E2B79000005DC-756_468x361.jpg" alt="Federico Macheda " width="468" height="361">

              <h2><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Manchester City fans should look away now 
              ....</span></strong><br></h2>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">2009: Michael Owen pounces to 
              win derby thriller for United<br></span></h2>
              <p>This topsy-turvy derby clash at Old Trafford had it all, but when Craig 
              Bellamy scored City's third equaliser in the closing minutes the visitors looked 
              to have clinched a draw.</p>
              <p>Michael Owen had other ideas however, bursting through to score a 96th minute 
              winner that had Sir Alex dancing around in delight yet again. </p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">2010: Wayne Rooney heads United 
              to Wembley</span></h2>
              <p>City were winning 2-1 after the first leg of this Carling Cup semi-final, and 
              even though United went 2-0 up in the return Carlos Tevez scored to set up a 
              grandstand finish.</p>
              <p>United were determined to prevent City reaching their first domestic final 
              since 1981 however, and Wayne Rooney headed a stoppage time winner.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-0-080CF699000005DC-206_468x292.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="468" height="292">
              <p class="imageCaption">Heading to Wembley: Wayne Rooney scores United's late 
              winner against City</p>
              </div>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">2010: Paul Scholes on target to 
              inflict more misery on City</span></h2>
              <p>After the fireworks earlier in the season, the match at Eastlands was rather 
              flat but again there was a dramatic finish in store.</p>
              <p>Patrice Evra crossed into the danger zone, and Paul Scholes rode to head home 
              past the despairing Shay Given. What odds would you have found I wonder on 
              United scoring three stoppage time winners against City in the same 
              season?</p>
