              <p><strong>Barcelona have been strengthened by the return to fitness of Lionel Messi, who makes his first UEFA Champions League appearance since sustaining a hamstring injury in the first knockout round second leg at Celtic FC. Having been rested for the quarter-final return against AS Roma, Cristiano Ronaldo is restored to the United lineup by Sir Alex Ferguson. However there is no place for Nemanja VidiÄ‡ who was injured in the first leg against the Giallorossi. <br>- The only two unbeaten clubs in this term's UEFA Champions League meet tonight at Camp Nou as FC Barcelona host Manchester United FC. United maybe returning to the scene of their triumph of 1999, but they will have to do something no side has done in the competition this term – avoid defeat in Barcelona. The teams have met seven times before in UEFA club competition with both sides having emerged as victors on two occasions.</strong></p>

United are without Nemanja Vidic so Wes Brown partners Rio Ferdinand in central defence with Owen Hargreaves at right-back. Looks like a 4-4-2, with Carlos Tevez partnering Wayne Rooney up front, Ji-Sung Park on the right and Cristiano Ronaldo on the left. Barcelona leave out Thierry Henry and instead play Andres Iniesta on the left in a slightly more defensive line-up than the norm.</strong></p></div>

              <p>with vidic out, looks like hargreaves was our only option with brown moving to center with Rio.. i expected SAF to be more defensive, guess not.. this is truly a match up all football fanshas being waiting for...a full attack minded line up by SAF ..</p>

              <p>my take is 0-0 is a bad result for man u. man u now needs to win outright. altho' home ground for man u makes a huge difference, barcelona is not any other team. looking forward to another enthralling encounter here next week.</p>

              <p>for a football point of view, the penalty was too early. and it would have spoil the game. When I see Ronaldo not doing the hesitation step, I tot "LIAO".. and really "LIAO"..</p>
              <p>From MUFC point of view, they just wanted to park the bus and play their counter.</p>
              <p>As per the commentators, it is the first time, I see Rooney so quiet. His case -&gt; he is playing for the team not himself.</p>
              <p>The first thing on all MU players' mind is defence and then boot to Ronaldo.. Very similiar to one team i know which got them into 3 recent finals.</p>
              <p>So hey, SAF did a Cut &amp; paste..well, the objective is still Moscow, right???</p>
              <p>To be fair to Barca, they should have won the game. With a 65% percent possession, MU luckily stood up to the test.</p>
              <p>Alas, I hate the way Deco goes down so often, and the player who tried to con the referee when Evra was near, shame on you...</p>
              <p>Ronaldo has to do less whinning cause after a while, the ref will go tired and ignore.</p>
              <p>Just show your skills. but then he was often alone against 2 or even 3. Tevez and Rooney was always at the half-way line watching "video"..</p>
              <p>Anyway, in the 2nd leg, it will be more crucial and deciding, Messi will be fitter, Henry too, Puyol will be back, and On MU side, Vidic should be back, freeing OwenH to his role and, hopefully, at OT, we can see the two "attacking" sides go at it.</p>

              <p>Abysmal performances like the one just witnessed are what
              convinces me Ferguson is simply not good enough at this level -
              quite simply, he's not the one to take United to the next level in
              Europe. Tactically naive, logically incompetent (playing for 0-0
              away from home is tantamount to suicide) - just watch Barca inflict
              the same destiny on United as Monaco did 10 years ago following a
              0-0 first leg draw...</p>

              <p>Maybe ppl forget that we still have a REALLY CRUCIAL NEXT FIXTURE against Chelsea which can determine who will end up as EPL Champions.. its not surprising that SAF chose to rest nani and brought him out late and letting anderson have a break. Between Chelsea and Barcelona.. who would i prefer to lose to.. definitely not to Chelsea and i think most devil fans would agree...a win against Chelsea will spur us to beat Barca in the return leg and head into the finals without the need to think about the EPL fixtures anymore unless someone is telling me that it is possible that Chelsea would score 18 goals in the remaining 2 fixtures to them on level with us on goal difference.. :D</p>
              <p>when going forward, rooney/.. well can;t blame him.. he was doing a part time left back..while park was doing a part time right back...We played like crap..Ronaldo fell too easily.. Tevez was poor losing possession Owen fitness looks a doubt to me..he can defence, but to use him as a right back winger is not possible (too slow)..carrick was half asleep..brown caught by surprise ..Rio and VDS and scholes were solid..<br><br>we went to nou camp..and i cannot say i am upset with the result, although the penalty miss was a surprise..<br><br>Dropped by red cafe and was amused by the so called devil hardcores who seem to think they know more than Saf...Pique for Park in 2nd half and bring owen upfield? (As if that would have made a difference..) Ultimate Suicide...i'm glad they hang out at that forum and not elsewhere.. xD</p>
