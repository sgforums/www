              <h1>United and Barcelona can serve up a feast of flair at Camp Nou</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_02/102ronbarca_468x303.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Clash of the Titans: Ronaldo v Messi</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The patriots and the tacticians will anticipate the Chelsea v Liverpool Champions League semi-final with relish, and with plenty of pride too. But for the purists and the fantasists, it is the road to Camp Nou that glitters this month.</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona versus Manchester United in the semi-final of the Champions League. It sounds sexy just saying it. The two most adventurous teams in European football will come face to beautiful face with more at stake than ever before. Can this fixture live up to its remarkable promise? For once, even the protagonists are not seeking to play it down.</p>
              <p>United midfielder Owen Hargreaves is not known for expansive statements but he said yesterday: "I've never played against Barcelona but I must have watched them on television every Sunday for the past two years and they're a fantastic team. "You know exactly how they're going to play. They're going to try to play right through the middle of us and we're going to have to defend very well. But we will play the same as them.</p>
              <p>"We're two very attacking sides and are going to go for it and try to create chances. There will be a lot of chances at both ends and the better side will win. We have to play our football and we'll get chances. When we attack, we're difficult for any team to handle."</p>
              <p>United will face Frank Rijkaard's team in Spain on April 23 with the return leg at Old Trafford six days later. For many it would have been the perfect final. Sir Alex Ferguson's men have played the most exciting domestic football in Europe this season. In Cristiano Ronaldo they have, perhaps, the world's best player.</p>
              <p>Barcelona, meanwhile, have played poorly in La Liga this season and will be without the talismanic Brazilian Ronaldinho and Deco, both supposedly injured but also accused of disruptive indiscipline. However, Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi do not occupy their places in most people's European dream team for nothing so Ferguson will pray defenders Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic arrive in Spain in good health in just 11 days' time.</p>
              <p>The memories are plentiful, for both clubs. Ferguson won his only European Cup in Camp Nou nine years ago and as a 19-year-old Hargreaves watched from the stands as his Bayern Munich team-mates had glory torn from their grasp. "I was in the stadium screaming my lungs out," said Hargreaves last night. "Afterwards I was in shock. We all were."</p>
              <p>United and Barcelona have not met for nine years. In United's 1998-99 campaign, the teams played out two 3-3 draws in the group stage, while four years earlier Ferguson had been chastened by a 4-0 thrashing in Spain.</p>
              <p>"I left Peter Schmeichel out that night," laughed Ferguson this week. "So obviously that worked out well for me!" Such history counts for nothing on the field, of course, but it adds greatly to the general lustre of a tie that will be watched by 160,000 fans over the course of the two games. With the second leg taking place at Old Trafford, United will perhaps start as slight favourites.</p>
              <p>A domestic tussle with Chelsea for the Barclays Premier League will not aid their preparations, although Barca are struggling to reduce a seven-point deficit on Spanish leaders Real Madrid, having won only one of their past six League games. Ferguson may have reason to fear a repeat of last season when an AC Milan team, long since left behind in Serie A, were able to focus solely on a semi-final with United that — in truth — they won comfortably.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said last night: "We have learned from that and I think we are in better physical shape this season. "The energy levels in the team were gone by the time we got to that tie last season and there was nothing we could do. The squad was not deep enough to cope. This season we have much more energy and I just pray that everybody will be fit."</p>
              <p>For their part, Barcelona will perhaps not miss Ronaldinho too much. His contribution this season has been negligible. But they will sweat on the fitness of their Argentinian safebreaker Messi and will fret about the defensive absence of the suspended captain Carles Puyol. He is one of the best man-markers in Europe and if anybody could look after Ronaldo in Catalonia, it would be the dogged little Spain star.</p>
              <p>Hargreaves added: "We can cope this season. I know we can. We haven't lost in the Champions League this season. We're the only team who can say that. Plus, we've won 11 games in a row at home. So far, so good. "It's going to be two fabulous games against Barcelona and after that we'll see what happens. We've got a good rhythm, everyone's contributing and we're playing well.</p>
              <p>"Barcelona are not in the best form at the moment but when you look at their squad it's among the best in the world. They are going to be a threat, that's for sure. But we've been playing exceptionally well for the past couple of months. "We've been very consistent and put ourselves in a good position. We're in the home stretch and this is where it counts."</p>
              <p>Hargreaves has won the Champions League before, with Bayern in 2001. Such is the quality available to Ferguson this season, he may not even be in the team for the semi-final. There will be only 11 lucky ones. And millions watching who will envy them like never before.</p>

              their home game against Espanyol next weekend forward 24 hours to allow

              <p>The Blaugrana face a tricky local derby at Camp Nou only days before
              the enticing encounter with the Red Devils in the Champions League semi
              finals and do not want to play on Sunday.<br><br>LFP officials gave the
              green light for the game to be played on Sunday, April 20 in order for
              Spanish satellite to show the game live on its main channel at 21:00
              CET.<br><br>But Barça are hoping to move the game to Saturday, April 19
              to give them an extra days preparation time before facing Manchester
              United at Camp Nou the following Wednesday.<br><br>Television channels
              may not be happy as Atlético de Madrid are playing Real Betis and Real
              Zaragoza and Recreativo are all plying at 20:00 on Saturday, while
              Sevilla's game against Almería at 22:00. The LFP is said to be
              "studying the petition" and would have to negotiate with Audiovisual
              Sport about the request.</p>

              <p><strong>Enrique warns Reds</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Barcelona legend Luis Enrique feels there is little to choose between his former side and United, ahead of their looming Champions League semi-final.<br><br></strong>The Catalan giants' stuttering La Liga form has prompted many pundits to place United as favourites to face either Liverpool or Chelsea in this year's final, but Enrique expects Frank Rijkaard's side to raise their game for the Reds.<br><br>"I think it will be very equal," Enrique told <em>Sport, </em>a newspaper in his native Spain.<br><br>"United, on paper, are better at the moment. They are top of the Premiership and have impressed in the Champions League and have looked very strong throughout.<br><br>"They have had 11 (consecutive home) wins in Europe and that shows what level they are at right now. <br><br>"But I still think that Barcelona have every chance of going through. <br><br>"The first game is at Camp Nou and with our fans behind us I think it will be a spectacular game. Without doubt, it is one of the best ties there could be in Europe right now. I hope we can earn a good result for the second leg.<br><br>"I truly believe and expect the tie to be very even. I think Frank Rijkaard will enjoy the</p>
              <p>ambiguity of it. This is the last step to the final and I think the team will raise their game."<br><br>Enrique was part of the Barcelona side who contested two memorable 3-3 draws with United during the 1998/99 season, and can still recall the pulsating atmosphere of playing at Old Trafford.<br><br>"The atmosphere there is absolutely incredible, truly spectacular," he said. <br><br>"United do not have a song like Liverpool, but the stadium is incredible, the noise is deafening and everything there is what any player would dream of. It is a joy to play there."</p>

              </h1><h1>Cruyff tips Barca to beat 'long ball' United</h1>
              <p>Barcelona legend Johan Cruyff believes his former side can pull Manchester United apart by keeping possession when the teams meet in the Champions League semi-final..Cruyff, who now acts as an official adviser to club president Joan Laporta, denies there is any reason to be pessimistic, however, and says that Sir Alex Ferguson's men have as much to fear as anyone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Dutchman coached Barcelona to their first European Cup triumph back in 1992, and he believes he knows the way to beat the English champions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He told El Periodico today: 'They run a lot. Their style of football, and that of all the English teams, gives the false sensation that they run more than anyone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'That's because despite having a majority of foreigners in their squads they maintain the philosophy of long-ball football and sprinting 60 yards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'That is how they exploit spaces in front of the midfield. If they played in the other team's half more often those spaces wouldn't exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Despite recognising their effort, you can disarm an English side that presses and looks for the long ball by keeping possession and moving the ball around quickly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'And if you know they will expend all their energy on closing down and chasing long balls, then you know where to beat them: by playing the ball horizontally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'However badly Barca is doing we have at least the same chance of progressing to the final as United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'They are very good, that's true. Of the three English teams in the semis, for me Manchester is the best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'But I'm absolutely convinced that they're thinking exactly the same about Barca. That of all the semi-finalists, the Blaugranes are the strongest.'</p>

              <h1>Fergie: Rooney And Co Fit For Barca</h1>
              <h2>Sir Alex Ferguson has claimed Wayne Rooney, Owen Hargreaves, Edwin
              van der Sar and Anderson will all be available for Manchester United’s
              clash with Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday.</h2>
              <p>Hargreaves, Anderson and van der Sar were all absent from United’s 1-1
              draw with Blackburn Rovers yesterday at Ewood Park, while Rooney was
              forced from the pitch with a hip injury.<br><br>The England forward
              went down under a challenge from Rovers captain Ryan Nelsen midway
              through the second half, and seemed to move gingerly for a time
              afterwards. He was eventually replaced on 90 minutes by Korean
              midfielder Park Ji-Sung.<br><br>Such a knock to their star striker will
              no doubt have United fans worried as the first leg of their blockbuster
              Champions League semi-final with Barca looms midweek, but Ferguson
              insists Rooney will be fit to play.<br><br>“Wayne got a knock on the hip but I’m sure it won’t keep him out of Wednesday night’s match,” Sir Alex told <em>Setanta Sports</em>.<br><br>“Sometimes when you get a kick on the bone it can be very sore at the time but I expect he’ll recover.”</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The winger played the second half of Barca’s goalless draw against Espanyol on Saturday and fired off a warning to rivals United. He said: “I am ready for United. I am well. The fans are waiting for me to show what I can do on Wednesday.</p>

              <p class="article">“I am calm and I’ve so much desire to be at my best and be able to offer my team the things I can bring on the pitch. “I am certain I will be even more determined in the game against Manchester which has special significance.”</p>
              <p class="article">Messi, 20, insisted that this game will not just be a duel between him and United ace Cristiano Ronaldo. He added: “Cristiano is a great player. He showed it last season and he’s showing it this season with many goals. “But the game is between Manchester and Barcelona, not between Ronaldo and me. It’s a game between two great teams.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Messi missed the 2006 Champions League final win against Arsenal in Paris after getting injured. He admitted: “It’s true I still have a thorn inside me about the final. For that reason I want to win another Champions League with me playing in all the games.”</p>

              <p><strong>Robbo backs Reds</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Former United captain Bryan Robson is tipping the Reds' fine form to take them past Barcelona and into this year's Champions League final.</strong><br><br>Robson, who recently agreed to take on an ambassadorial role at Old Trafford, concedes that the Catalan giants will ask questions of Sir Alex Ferguson's side, but feels that United are on the crest of a wave going into the season's climax.<br><br>"They’ll be tough games because Barcelona have got outstanding players," Robson told <strong>Manutd.com</strong>. "They’ve got the likes of Eto’o, Messi, Ronaldinho and Henry, and they’re a great attacking team. <br><br>"But I’m sure United can trouble their defence with the forwards they’ve got. I think there will be goals in the games because of the style of the two teams, and I’ve got United down as favourites for the way they’re playing at the moment."<br><br>With the Reds three points clear at the Premier League summit, Robson is hopeful that they will have wrapped up another league title before Barcelona's second-leg visit to Old Trafford, allowing Sir Alex Ferguson to focus on masterminding a Double.<br><br>"Hopefully United will have tied up the Premier League before the second leg has come around. If they win both then it would definitely be deserved, after the way they’ve played," said Robson. <br><br>"In every game they've played in Europe this season, they've deserved the result they've got. In the league they’ve been playing some great football, and you can tell how dominant they’ve been just by looking at the goal difference and points tally they’ve racked up."</p>
