              <h1>Vidic a serious doubt for United's clash with Barcelona after stomach complaint lands him in hospital</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_04/VIDBARCpa_468x322.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Hospital trip: Vidic is thought to have gone to a local hospital with a stomach complaint.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>Manchester United's preparations for their Champions League semi-final first leg against Barcelona were thrown into chaos on Tuesday night after defender Nemanja Vidic missed training amid reports that he had been taken to hospital with a stomach complaint.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sportsmail can reveal that United's Serbian central defender took no part in preparations at the Nou Camp on Tuesday, along with fellow defender Wes Brown who was also absent from the first team squad.</p>
              <p>It was initially thought that Vidic had succumbed to the knee complaint that he suffered in Rome three weeks ago and kept him out of action for a fortnight.</p>
              <p>But it was suggested in Spain late last night that the defender had in fact visited a Barcelona hospital for treatment after going down with a stomach problem.</p>
              <p>A United spokesperson could neither confirm or deny the reports, but it is clear that United manager Alex Ferguson faces an anxious wait to see if Vidic is ready for Wednesday's crucial tie against Frank Rijkaard's team.</p>
              <p>There was no suggestion on Tuesday that Vidic had been detained in the hospital and it is believed that he was back with his teammates by nightfall at their hotel on the outskirts of the city.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"> </p>
              <p class="article">BARCELONA’S defence is really going to struggle with the blistering pace of United’s front three and the absence of suspended skipper Carles Puyol will hit them even harder. Rafael Marquez deputises at centre-back and Wayne Rooney will look to drag him all over the place and create space in the box for the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo to exploit. Mexican Marquez will use all his experience to frustrate Rooney. But Rooney must not allow himself to be drawn into a war. If he keeps a cool head and focuses, he will definitely come out on top.</p>

              </ul>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">A CRACKING confrontation between two of the most talented players in the game. Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world right now. There is no one to touch him. He’ll relish the chance to electrify this match. He’s scored seven goals in the Champions League this season and I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t get at least one in this semi-final. But Xavi is a man United must fear. All Barcelona’s play flows through this fella and if Michael Carrick and Co don’t get to grips with him, he could cause havoc.</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">LIONEL MESSI’S return from his recent thigh injury is a huge boost to Barcelona’s hopes. They’ve really missed this guy in recent weeks. The speedy Argentine will be looking to cut in from the right wing and get between Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic. Evra has to show Messi the outside at all times and make sure he doesn’t get any decent crosses in to Samuel Eto’o and Bojan Krkic. If United can isolate Messi out wide, Barcelona will suffer. Evra has made a huge improvement this season but this is probably his biggest test so far.</p>

              <p><strong>Eidur wary of United threat</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>Eidur Gudjohnsen has warned his Barcelona team-mates that they will have their work cut out against an "all-round great" United side.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Chelsea forward has seen enough of the Reds this season to know that they pose a serious threat to Barca’s chances of reaching the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think they are a typical English side,” he said. “I think they have tremendous quality and they play great football, but when it comes to the physical part of the game they are very strong as well. They’re an all-round great side.”</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney may have grabbed most of the headlines this season, but Gudjohnsen reserved special praise for two of United’s older heads.</p>
              <p>He continued: “Everyone knows about Ronaldo and Rooney, but the players I’ve admired most throughout my career are Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. For me, Scholes has been one of the most complete footballers of his time.”</p>
              <p>Coach Frank Rijkaard was also complimentary about opposite number Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>“In modern football it’s difficult to imagine a man who has achieved as much as Ferguson,” he told <em><strong>Barca TV</strong></em>. “When I think about Manchester United, I immediately think of him.</p>
              <p>“United’s strength is their team-work, mentality and the spirit, and the way they want to achieve results together. It will be difficult but we’re looking forward to it.”</p>

              <p><strong>Vidic eyes deadly duo</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nemanja Vidic will not shirk the responsibility of trying to stop Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o if he's fit to face the Barcelona duo tonight.</strong> <br><br>United's Serbian hardman missed training at the Nou Camp on Tuesday evening, fuelling speculation he could also miss the match. He insists the task of tackling Argentina star Messi and Cameroon striker Eto'o is imperative to United's cause.<br><br>"Messi is one of the best players in the world," said Vidic. <br><br>"He's very good in one-on-one situations. But he's not the only player. Barcelona have many good players. Take Samuel Eto'o - he is an excellent striker. <br><br>"My job on Wednesday night is just to do my best to stop them. Hopefully we can prevent them from playing and get the result we need."<br><br>Vidic played in the semi-final second leg defeat to Milan last season and the 0-3 scoreline clearly cut deep.<br><br>"Last season we were not ourselves in the semi-final," Vidic added. "We were knocked out and we want to fix that.<br><br>"We are much better this season and we want to win trophies. Last season we played most of the games with the same squad. In the last few games we had a few injured players and this was the reason why we didn't play well in the semi-final. <br><br>"Now we have a stronger squad and we are in a good position physically."<br><br>Let's hope that's also true of Nemanja come kick-off at the Nou Camp tonight. <br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>Lets hope vidic will be alright<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></strong></em></p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>FRANK RIJKAARD has warned Alex Ferguson that Barcelona are out to wreck his European dream for yet another season. Barca boss Rijkaard is adamant his star-studded squad will inflict more European Cup semi-final misery on United’s legendary manager.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Fergie has lost <strong>THREE</strong> out of four Champions League semi-finals with United. And Rijkaard said: “The team is motivated and confident and of course we are capable of beating United. "Today’s Barcelona team has the chance to write history. “</p>
              <p class="article">Stars Leo Messi and Deco are back from injury and will play as will Thierry Henry who has recovered from the fever that troubled him at the start of the week. Rijkaard added: “I think Messi is well, he’s fit to start. "Thierry is with us and he has trained after a few days out. Deco is well and has worked hard in the last few training sessions.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have tension, desire and the determination. They have great players but so do we.” Under-fire Rijkaard’s fate could be sealed if Barca crash out of Europe after a poor season in La Liga. But he does not see this game as his chance to secure a future in Barcelona.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “This is a game between two teams, it’s not a personal thing and it’s not about a personal goal. "These issues don’t cross my mind.” As if things were not bad enough already for the beleaguered Barca boss thieves broke into his villa on Sunday and made away with a “huge” amount in cash as well as jewellery and other valuables.</p>
              <p class="article">Asked about the robbery Rijkaard said: “Thanks for your concern. I am OK.” Wonder if he will still be saying that after the final whistle this evening.</p>
