Now we can all add the name of another candidate Â— Jose Mourinho.<br><br>I've no doubt that when my friend, Sir Alex Ferguson, steps down Â— and I hope it's a long time away Â— Jose will be the first choice of the United board. After all, he has a proven track record in England, loves the country and the passion for football and, importantly, his family like living here.<br><br>I don't think Jose can go to another Premier League club immediately and will probably want to recharge his batteries. But down the line, I can't see how he could resist United.<br><br>He won't be the only candidate of course, everyone will want the job.<br><br>But while the fans may press for an ex-United player like Mark Hughes or Roy Keane, their CVs can't match Jose's.<br><br>And United will demand the best.</div>

But football has changed over the years as well. Our formation do need to have a change at times too.

I believe the players brought in were with that formation in mind.<br><br>Anw, Mourinho should be good for United. The only other managers I feel that are really suited for United would be Hiddink and possibly Juande Ramos. One manager whom I do admire is Arsene Wenger. But given that he's Arse-nal's gaffer now, I wouldn't want him in, barring a catastrophe.<br></div>
