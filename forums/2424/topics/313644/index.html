              <p>I won't buy it for one min that this is going to be easy... Arsenal will be disappointed and hurt from getting eliminated from the CL... But from how i see it, they will have more to play for in this match than any other cos Wenger still belief that they still have a very slim chance of winning the title. If this match takes place 3 days after their elimination from the CL, it could be a little different but 5 days is quite a long time and they would have recover from it by then...</p>
              <p>United have to be careful here... Arsenal are hurt and angry... and after their elimination from the CL, they probably won't have so much pressure on them now...</p>
              <p>United will need Rio or Vidic back to win the high balls from Arsenal's danger man Adebayor...</p>

The Gunners travel to Manchester United knowing victory would move them back to within three points of the Premier League leaders. But defeat would leave Arsene Wenger's side without silverware this season after they were sent crashing out of the Champions League at Liverpool last night.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor said: "Of course we can still win the league. "Sunday is our season now, it determines whether we still have something to play for or whether we can go on holiday. "If we win in Manchester we can still hope to win the league so we have to get our focus back, stay strong and make sure we do that.</p>
              <p class="article">"Right now we're all disappointed but we will be back in the Champions League next season and the boss knows the answers. "He knows what to do and what's needed to win it."</p>

              <h1>We are still playing for the title at Old Trafford says Adebayor </h1>
              <h1>Toure vows to win for the Arsenal fans</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor maintains all is not lost for Arsenal this season despite seeing their European dream ended in dramatic circumstances at Anfield. The Gunners must now regroup for Sunday's trip to Manchester United following what was a bitterly disappointing finish to a thrilling Champions League quarter-final second leg on Merseyside.</strong></p>
              <p>"The most important thing now is to stay focused on what we can achieve this season," declared the Togo striker, who had missed a gilt-edged chance just before Walcott's moment of brilliance. "We are still playing for the title and we still believe we can win something at the end of the season. Sunday will be another big game for us and we will see what we can do."</p>
              <p>Defender Toure accepts it will take a Herculean effort from the squad to recover and produce a match-winning performance at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>However, the Ivory Coast international feels the players owe it to the fans to restore their faith. "We need to show character on Sunday and to play really well, and give our fans some belief for this season," Toure declared. "It will be hard if we do not win anything because we were going so well at the start of the season. We still have the chance for the Premier League and we will try to take it. "We know it is not over - we just have to look at the next game and try to win."</p>
              <p>Wenger could well hand Walcott a start at Old Trafford after the 19-year-old again came off the bench to great effect last night. Toure believes the former Southampton trainee has the world at his feet. "Theo is a good player and is improving every time," he said. "I think Theo is going to be one of the best players in England."</p>
              <p>Adebayor also hailed the pacy young winger, who forced his way back into the senior England squad after also impressing in the last round against AC Milan in the San Siro. He declared: "For a few months now Theo has been on fire. Theo is very quick and is playing some good football. Playing up front alongside him is brilliant."</p>
              <p>Arsenal, meanwhile, could be without midfielder Mathieu Flamini at Old Trafford after he went off with an ankle injury last night.</p>

              <p>i hope Park gets a start again ahead of Giggs &amp; Nani...i think scholes will start this one since hes being rested in place of carrick or anderson..</p>
              <p>we could rest tevez and bring him out in the second half if needed, <br>as for ronaldo and ronney, no need to see..</p>

              <p><br>Subs : Kucsk..Silvestre...Anderson...Tevez...Giggs</p>
              <p>y did i do my lineup like this? <br><br>Hagreaves can cross as he showed and he has speed, and he can act as a back up cover when gary makes his bulldoze run along the wings...Park is a valuable asssert becuz he is a no nonsense one touch passer, something which will come in extremely handy against teams like arsenal, coupled with him opening up space and moving into position and getting back to defend when necessary, that i believe alone, is good enough reason to be the most suitable position for him, and he deserves to start!!  besides he has a very good understanding with rooney , ronaldo as well, ronaldo in the wings as usual will cut into central when necessary switching places with park.. Scholes as usual will mystify Fabregas with his precision passes along the center... carrick will help out in the center with some dirty works coupled with occasional runs into the box...</p>

              <p>i hope nani would be fit for the match though and tevez to partner rooney...heres my line up <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>                                              VDS</p>
              <p>                      Brown  Ferdinand Slivestre Evra</p>
              <p>                   Ronaldo Scholes Hargreaves Nani</p>
              <p>                        Rooney             Tevez</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Subs:Kusz,Park,Giggs,Neville,Anderson,Carrick ,,</p>
              <p>Reason.. Brown has more games den Neville so Saf would prob nt risk anything as gary is much slower..slives and ferdinand performed well during roma...Ronaldo is a sure in Scholes seem he was rested for his 100th Cl appearance..would be given a chance to distrubute chances as well as hargreaves a start for his good performance against roma and his defensive abilities...nani would be given a start provided he is fit and rooney to partner tevez..come to the worst nani cmi then park would take his place<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I still got this nagging suspicion that hargreaves is not 100% well, and he is chosen on games/condition.</p>
              <p>given England is out of EURO, it is good that he can get some well deserved rest.</p>
              <p><br>btw, it will be interesting as normally after EURO, transfer market will be buzzling. Can't wait to see whether MU will buy or not.</p>

              <p>well, if we cruising then we should let Neville in for some action and to build up his match fitness.</p>
              <p>Rio and Silvestre in the middle.. hmmm, Pique still wet behind the ears?</p>

              <p><strong>Rio fit, Vidic on the mend</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rio Ferdinand will be fit to face Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday, while Nemanja Vidic is on course to return against Blackburn next Saturday.<br><br></strong>Ferdinand had to have three stitches in a cut on his right foot at half-time during Wednesday's 1-0 win over Roma. The injury was unrelated to the problem that forced him off against Middlesbrough last week. The good news is that the 29-year-old has suffered no further ill-effects from this latest complaint.<br><br>Vidic, Rio's central defensive partner, was forced off in the first half of the first leg against the Italian side in Rome ten days ago. He was given a two-three week recovery prognosis, and looks set to be back in double-quick time.<br><br>"Vidic is doing very well," said Sir Alex Ferguson. "He's not available for Sunday, but he should be back for Blackburn."<br><br>Nani, who has been suffering with a thigh problem, may struggle to play a part against Arsenal, but he will definitely be available to face Mark Hughes' side at Ewood Park.<br><br>Elsewhere, Gary Neville is in contention for the first-team after his cameo appearance on Wednesday. But Sir Alex admits competition for places is tough with "players playing well in defence". He added: "Nevertheless, it's great to have him back."<br><br>United's only other injury concerns - Darren Fletcher (knee) and Louis Saha (hamstring) - are doing well in their recovery and will both be back before the end of the season.</p>

              <h1>Hargreaves and Tevez set to miss Arsenal clash as Fergie looks to keep things fresh</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_02/087owenDM_468x548.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is keeping his eyes peeled for signs of fatigue as his Manchester United side kick off seven games in 28 days against Arsenal today. And the United boss is likely to become a regular rotator, with Carlos Tevez approaching burn-out and Owen Hargreaves contemplating a summer operation to try to cure a long-standing knee problem.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has pledged to use his full squad on his mission to win the Premier League-Champions League Double for the first time since 1999. He has set his players the target of winning their next two league games so they can clinch the title at Chelsea on April 26, a match that is sandwiched between two epic Champions League semi-final encounters with Barcelona.</p>
              <p>'My eyes will tell me which players I need to rest and which ones are fresh,' said Ferguson. 'I have to use common sense with the fixtures coming up so I can pick the right teams. 'Freshness is so important. Last season we didn't have enough to compete for both big trophies, but having Tevez, Hargreaves, Nani and Anderson has changed that. Having a strong squad helps us and Chelsea, which is why we're both challenging in the league and in Europe.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson will welcome back Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes — all rested against Roma — as they try to extend their lead at the top to six points, with Chelsea playing tomorrow. But it is unlikely 18-goal Tevez or Hargreaves will be asked to play twice in the same week at this stage of the season. Tevez, whose last two summers have been interrupted by playing in the World Cup and then Copa America, said: 'I want to have at least 20 days of peace and quiet with my family, without doing anything. My body needs a rest.'</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Hargreaves — outstanding in the Champions League win on Tuesday — is considering going under the knife because of tendinitis in the knee. United decided earlier in the season that Hargreaves would not have an operation, but England's failure to qualify for Euro 2008 gives him the opportunity this summer.</p>
              <p>A source said: 'Owen finds it hard to train 100 per cent. He is certainly better than at the start of the season when he couldn't train at all, but an operation is one option that will be considered.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson believes he has the strongest squad available in his 22 years at the club and is targeting victories against Arsenal and Blackburn so United can then win the league by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. That would also provide revenge for 2006, when Chelsea became champions by beating United 3-0 on the day Wayne Rooney broke his metatarsal.</p>
              <p>Nemanja Vidic misses today's game with a knee injury, giving young Spaniard Gerard Pique another chance to shine.</p>
