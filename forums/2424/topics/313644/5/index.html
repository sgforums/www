              <p>Didn't he went out to loan in the LaLiga? I think if he is loaned, he will move for a transfer..Already, there is talk of him going back to Barca.</p>
              <p>To be fair, he is not tactically astute/aware as Rio or Vidic, he was caught out a few times in the Gunners games.But isn't that the learning curve? If he continues to perform well, I believe slowly, but surely, he will improve.</p>
              <p>Do we sell or keep buying? Cause Rio/Vidic is also not getting any younger leh.</p>
              <p>Also if we loan him out, we will need to rely on Brown or Oshea to plug the gaps again.</p>
              <p>Rem, Brown has not signed a contract yet..but the good news is that Neville is coming back with Silverstre.</p>

              <p>oh, another thing I note, was how Rio called the team back after Ronaldo scored the penalty...</p>
              <p>if was as if he was saying "come on, let's get the 2nd goal to kill off Gunners".. I think that was really encouraging..</p>
              <p>I think this capello's effect is rubbing on english players.. can even see Rooney slowly maturing.</p>

              <p>If he is going to play for United in the future, its better that he goes on loan to another Premiership club cos the defending style and the speed of the game would be quite similar... Going to another La Liga side won't really improve on the necessary experience that he clearly lacks... To be honest, he is quite our very own version of Senderos at Arsenal... If he is not happy with a loan deal to improve himself, then I say selling him for anything around $2m wouldn't be a real lost... Cos we won't want him to cos us like at Bolton again or like how Senderos has caused Arsenal... Its not worth it...</p>
              <p>If Vidic cost $7m and Evra $6m... Buying another better than him defender shouldn't be too difficult... And since him being Spanish, thats the only reason i can think why Barce want him back... so if they are willing to offer who knows, $3, 4, 5 million... Then i say hurry sell, that amount can get you a better defender in Europe for sure...</p>

              <p>Just how good are Manchester United? There have been times this
              season when that sentence might have ended instead with an adulatory
              exclamation mark. The 2-1 victory over Arsenal did, however, raise it
              as a genuine question. It took grit for United to recover from a goal
              behind but their opponents were accomplices in the comeback. The
              handball offence for the equalising goal from the penalty spot was a
              screwball moment from William Gallas.</p>
              <p>Every advantage lay with a well-rested United, who had fine-tuned
              themselves by letting a diluted line-up get on with the chore of
              knocking Roma out of the Champions League the previous Wednesday. In
              consequence there was no excuse for shedding possession so often
              against Arsenal as the visitors, in spells, left United wheezing. Had
              Emmanuel Adebayor been as good at finding the net with his feet as he
              was, unintentionally, with his arm, the situation could have been
              beyond recovery.</p>
              <p>The resilience and quality of United over the entire campaign is, of
              course, to be admired and their goal difference is comfortably the best
              of the 92 senior clubs in England. There is no disputing the
              temperament of the players either, not when Owen Hargreaves can settle
              the match against Arsenal with a feathery touch from a free-kick when
              sheer tension could have made him clumsy. It would be thrawn, as well,
              to query Cristiano Ronaldo while his goal hoard makes him so
              influential, even if the going for the winger never looks so smooth
              against, say, Arsenal or Chelsea.</p>
              <p>As it faltered, though, Arsène Wenger's side still highlighted the
              mortality of the supposed demi-gods of Old Trafford. Though the large
              squad has been a critical advantage for United over Arsenal, the
              visitors destroyed any notion that Ferguson's line-up is impregnable.
              There is strength in numbers but that does not make a side utterly
              unassailable.</p>
              <p>Though Ferguson added Hargreaves, Carlos Tevez, Anderson and Nani
              last summer, that does not mean he has a complete set of answers. Team
              selection turns into a treacherous task when options proliferate and
              the manager did not quite get it right on Sunday. With the movement so
              fast and elusive from Arsenal, the contest was beyond the reach of the
              33-year-old Paul Scholes. Elsewhere the industrious Park Ji-sung seemed
              short of the necessary accomplishment for this game. He and Scholes
              were both substituted.</p>
              <p>The jubilation at the close was all the more intense because United
              had reached their target on a wing and a prayer, rather than through
              effortless excellence. Victory was cobbled together. Ferguson will
              rather like that but it ought to deter the rest of us from assuming
              that they are really above the fray. Where might they be now if their
              squad had been as racked by injury as Chelsea's? The mere lack of
              Nemanja Vidic for two or three weeks suffices to make United queasy.</p>
              <p>Despite the investment United will have to take nine points from the
              four remaining League games simply to equal last season's total.
              Football is a knotty business and not all problems are unpicked even by
              the affluent clubs. There are always idiosyncrasies. Wayne Rooney, for
              instance, has evolved into a more mature footballer of steadier
              temperament, yet his conversion of straightforward chances is less
              steady than it was when he was a hot-headed youth at Everton. That can
              hurt United when he is the lone striker.</p>
              <p>It takes so little to foil grand aspirations. A year ago United were
              chastened when their injuries and Milan's capacity to rise to the
              occasion brought defeat in the Champions League. Ferguson realises that
              his team's record in that competition is out of kilter with the club's
              gilded image. The rest of us may view Barcelona as hapless bunglers
              under the control of a manager, Frank Rijkaard, who no longer has the
              ear of his own players. At Old Trafford, though, Ferguson will fret
              that the opposition might be inspired at Camp Nou next week by a
              Champions League semi-final with such a ring to it.</p>
              <p>So far as the Premier League goes, United have the edge over Chelsea
              but the hazards continue to be significant. At a deeper level all this
              should be to Ferguson's liking. Despite the real advantage of being
              able to afford a profusion of accomplished footballers, doubts are
              never eradicated entirely.</p>
              <p>United have been outstanding since they started to warm to their
              task in the autumn but that does not make them a side of a wholly
              different order from all others. Infallible line-ups are a figment of
              the imagination.</p>
              <p>The thrill for the world at large and, perhaps, for the players
              themselves, lies in the fact that desolation is almost as close as
              glory itself.</p>

              <p>If Vidic cost $7m and Evra $6m... Buying another better than him
              defender shouldn't be too difficult... And since him being Spanish,
              thats the only reason i can think why Barce want him back...
              so if they are willing to offer who knows, $3, 4, 5 million... Then
              i say hurry sell, that amount can get you a better defender in
              Europe for sure...</p>

              <p>Didn't he went out to loan in the LaLiga? I think if he is
                  loaned, he will move for a transfer..Already, there is talk of him
                  going back to Barca.</p>
              <p>To be fair, he is not tactically astute/aware as Rio or Vidic,
                  he was caught out a few times in the Gunners games.But isn't that
                  the learning curve? If he continues to perform well, I believe
                  slowly, but surely, he will improve.</p>
              <p>Do we sell or keep buying? Cause Rio/Vidic is also not getting
                  any younger leh.</p>
              <p>Also if we loan him out, we will need to rely on Brown or Oshea
                  to plug the gaps again.</p>
              <p>Rem, Brown has not signed a contract yet..but the good news is
                  that Neville is coming back with Silverstre.</p>

              <p>i was pretty surprise how hleb got past him with ease... and overall i feel he needs to play at a higher gear. goin out onloan to an english club would help him to adpt to the pace of the english league.. and the thing abt man utd is actually they prefer to play a settled back four.. ferguson himself stated it many times... that is why i don't see pique playing much next season if both rio and vidic are fit...</p>
              <p>saf wanted to use him in the carling cup but unfortunately we got knocked out pretty early. as a defender... the margin for error is very small... after the error he commited against bolton he was not been utilise for a long time... even oshea got infront of him. since we can't afford many games for him to proof himself... loaning him out to a relegation fighting bpl team is the best option. he would be severly tested in every game and i expect to see him take charge at the back. would prefer not to sell him... i see him as a long term replacement for rio.</p>

              <p>hleb is one with extraordinary close quarters dribbling skills.. actually, it is a good test for MUFC cause messi plays about the same, with the ball glued to their feet.</p>
              <p>all teams love to play with a settled team but sometimes, we need replacements to come in, and without proper exposure, the replacements may not rise to occassion and kill off the team's plans.</p>
              <p>however, I am unsure whether teams will take players on loan, and nuture them for your team leh.</p>
              <p>Normally, why would other teams take loaned players unless short?</p>
