              <p>Man u never look like they were gonna win.. I have to say we won this a bit on luck.. Pique is not a player for this kind of matches or at least not yet, I would have preferred Silvestre.. He was suffering with those classy Arsenal passes and runs..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have to say Arsenal played better football for most of the match.. They were different the last time we met them.. This time they pressed really hard making our players hard to play our passing football, end up long balls by VDS or by Pique who can't give long balls for nuts..</p>
              <p>Like I had always mentioned last time, if we have to resort to long balls, it is very difficult for us to win cos we don't have players to deal with balls from defence..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scholes is no doubt a player with uncontestable vision. But did anyone else realise what happens when he gets the ball? He slows the game down allowing Arsenal to reshape. Matches with Arsenal, we can't afford to play a slow game.. When Anderson and Tevez got into the game, our tempo starts to increase. These 2 players brings so much attacking pace into our game which causes Arsenal to unsettle because they can't reshape that fast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal were really unlucky not to have gotten away with the 3 pts.. or at least a draw.. I felt they deserve it.. But thank god we got the 3 pts.. Carrick as usual, getting brilliant by every match and Ferdinand made so many crucial tackles.. F*ckin brilliant..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Felirox, u were wrong it wasn't a stroll in the park.. Arsenal played really well but tough luck..</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #0000ff;">Arsenal's Inability To Retain A Lead Ends Their Title Bid.</span></h1>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Sunday, 13 April 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/11_01/125handshake_186x250.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United went six points clear at the top of the Premier League after coming from behind to beat Arsenal in a pulsating encounter at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal were on top for long spells but striker Emmanuel Adebayor wasted some gilt-edged chances, before he appeared to use his arm to open the scoring. United levelled through a twice-taken Cristiano Ronaldo penalty after William Gallas had handled in the Arsenal box. Owen Hargreaves won it with 20 minutes to go with a superb 25-yard free-kick. The result all-but ends Arsenal's hopes of winning the title and after their Champions League exit at the hands of Liverpool in midweek, means they will end a third successive season trophyless.</p>
              <p>United deserved to be behind, but Arsenal have recently become a team that looks afraid to be ahead and only four minutes later they were pegged back. Hargreaves' ball into the box was inexplicably handled by Gallas and after his first penalty was ruled out for encroaching, Ronaldo slammed his second effort into the bottom corner.</p>
              <p>Sensing blood, United sent on Carlos Tevez and Anderson, while Wenger replied with the introduction of Theo Walcott, under the watching gaze of England coach Fabio Capello. Tevez almost made an immediate impact, his sizzling 25-yard strike flying inches wide of the Arsenal goal with Lehmann comfortably beaten.</p>
              <p>After Gael Clichy's deflected cross was tipped onto a post by Van der Sar, United dealt a hammer blow to the Gunners' hopes of winning silverware this season. Evra was tripped 25 yards out and Hargreaves stepped up to delightfully clip the ball up and over the wall and into the unguarded corner of Lehmann's net.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar saved late on from substitute Nicklas Bendtner as United held on for a victory that may well secure them yet another Premier League title.</p>

              <em>Sir Alex Ferguson says winning their next two Premier League games will secure the title after they beat Arsenal 2-1. United are six points clear of Chelsea after victory over the Gunners and meet the second-placed Blues on 26 April. Ferguson said: "If we win at Blackburn and at Chelsea we're champions. We've got over a nervous day today. "I thought it was a fantastic game, absolutely outstanding. You won't see a better game anywhere this season."</em>  </div>

              <div class="cap"><em>Arsene Wenger admitted his team's title hopes are now over following the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford. "Yes we are out," Wenger told Sky Sports One. "We played with quality and spirit, and I'm very proud of our performance. What can you do? "We had plenty of chances and we were really unlucky not to win." </em><em>Wenger was at a loss to explain the turnaround in the Gunners' season, having been five points clear at the beginning of February, but feels luck has not been on their side. "The last two months, we have been not very lucky - and you could see that again," he said. "I believe this team is good enough," he added. "We had a dip since March and we need to look at why, but the biggest target is to keep the team together."</em></div>

              <p>Man u never look like they were gonna win.. I have to say we won
              this a bit on luck.. Pique is not a player for this kind of matches
              or at least not yet, I would have preferred Silvestre.. He was
              suffering with those classy Arsenal passes and runs..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have to say Arsenal played better football for most of the
              match.. They were different the last time we met them.. This time
              they pressed really hard making our players hard to play our
              passing football, end up long balls by VDS or by Pique who can't
              give long balls for nuts..</p>
              <p>Like I had always mentioned last time, if we have to resort to
              long balls, it is very difficult for us to win cos we don't have
              players to deal with balls from defence..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scholes is no doubt a player with uncontestable vision. But did
              anyone else realise what happens when he gets the ball? He slows
              the game down allowing Arsenal to reshape. Matches with Arsenal, we
              can't afford to play a slow game.. When Anderson and Tevez got into
              the game, our tempo starts to increase. These 2 players brings so
              much attacking pace into our game which causes Arsenal to unsettle
              because they can't reshape that fast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal were really unlucky not to have gotten away with the 3
              pts.. or at least a draw.. I felt they deserve it.. But thank god
              we got the 3 pts.. Carrick as usual, getting brilliant by every
              match and Ferdinand made so many crucial tackles.. F*ckin
              brilliant..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Felirox, u were wrong it wasn't a stroll in the park.. Arsenal
              played really well but tough luck..</p>

              <p>agreed, gunners did really take it to MUFC. And with a bit of luck, Gunners would have put 2 or even 3 in the first half.</p>
              <p>Hleb, Fabregas are really good, instead of going thru MUFC's MF, they went around. Given how young Fabregas is, he is really superb.</p>
              <p>In short, our Midfield got owned, big time. Park was chasing shadows, Scholes and Carrick just not fast enough to cope. OwenH was struck out @ sea trying to be defensive and attacking @ same time. Rooney was left to fight alone and has to rely on those long balls.</p>
              <p>The one-twos MUFC did were nice but no pentration. But the one-twos that Gunners did really open us up.If Barca was watching, I think their confidence must have gone up.</p>
              <p>The space between Def and MF is just too big for an ageing scholes, slow carrick and owen (alone) to cover.</p>
              <p>I think the defence sat back and allow Gunners to come at them than to go up and press. Brown got exposed.</p>
              <p>The key is anderson, he got a better engine and willing to tackle. His tackle to win the ball against a bigger adebayor was the highlight. On the other hand, he was found to be MIA.  With Tevez, he is hard-working, holds the ball well, like a worker-bee.</p>
              <p>The only explanation is SAF expects an onslaught and hence just soak and counter.</p>
              <p>Anyway, with Anderson &amp; Tevez coming in, the team looks more balanced and aggressive.</p>
              <p>Is 4-5-1 really the best formation for us? I don't think Rooney should function as the lone striker, I still think we need a target man.</p>

              <p>jinx? he scored the equaliser at emirates. well, given he is pairing song is quite a feat. I think Wenger knows MUFC playing with one lone striker and hence enforces the wings.</p>
              <p>Like one of the commentators said, the gunners were stupid if they thought Ronaldo going to take it. Anyone who watch EPL knows Ronaldo's process. He will position the ball with the valve and take the rugby position before kicking.</p>
              <p>However, even so, Lehmann couldn't have save it. Why? cause he got too much hot air in his head.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Manchester United came from a goal behind to beat Arsenal in a dramatic encounter yesterday. Boss Fergie said: “The quality in that game was outstanding. “It was an incredible game — but it was torture. “Arsenal came here and gave it their best effort and we still managed to win it.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I couldn’t ask for more from my team. “Arsenal were the better team in the first half. Our passing was poor, our confidence was poor and there was no expression in our play. I couldn’t wait until half-time. “When Arsenal scored, it forced my hand with the substitutions and we were fantastic after that. "Wayne Rooney could have had a hat-trick. Arsenal had some fantastic moments, too. They were unlucky not to get something from the game.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Emmanuel Adebayor gave Arsenal the lead in the 48th minute but United were level just six minutes later. A William Gallas handball gifted them a penalty which Cristiano Ronaldo had to take twice after his first effort was ruled out for encroachment. Fergie added: “There was some pressure on Cristiano when he had to take that penalty again. “But he showed great courage and ability — it was a marvellous hit. He got it just inches inside the post. “No goalkeeper in the world would have stopped that.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">United then won it in the 72nd minute with a stunning Owen Hargreaves free-kick from just outside the area. The England midfielder said: “I wanted to take the first free-kick we had outside their box but Ronaldo said it was too far out for me. "The next time we were a bit closer, a good distance for me, and I didn’t even ask him.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson gave Gunners boss Arsene Wenger a rare hug at the end and offered words of consolation for the defeat. The United boss added: “Arsenal are a team of great potential. Like us, they have a lot of young players and you have to be patient as you wait for the lads to develop and get top-level experience. "They have recently been hit with injuries to important players and you don’t get the best results when you can’t call on your best individuals. “But from our point of view, we have got over a nervous day today.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal have suffered a miserable week which has seen their Champions League and title bids go up in smoke. Wenger said: “The gap between success and failure for us has been so small this season. We are out of the title race now and that is hard to swallow. “We played this game with great quality and spirit. I’m very proud of our performance. “We were really unlucky not to win this game. With the quality of this performance, it is very difficult to blame anybody.”</p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/wenger_pa.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Wenger claimed the penalty decision was debatable and insisted Patrice Evra was not fouled for the free-kick that led to United’s winner. The Frenchman added: “You could give or not give the penalty. For the free-kick, Gilberto did not touch him. “In terms of technique and ability there is hardly anything between us, Chelsea and Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I feel we have done a lot for the Premier League this season and for the promotion of it all over the world. “I’m not an idealist, I want to win trophies. “But I want to continue playing the way we play and get better. “If we do that then the trophies will come.”</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Manchester United manager salutes win over football rivals Arsenal</h1>
              <p>MANCHESTER, England (AFP) - - Sir Alex Ferguson hailed his Manchester
              United side's 2-1 victory over Arsenal here at Old Trafford as a
              decisive moment in this season's Premier League title race.</p>
              <p>Victory moved United six points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who
              can reduce that gap to three points with a home win over Wigan on
              Monday.</p>
              <p>But with just four league games remaining, Ferguson is
              convinced his men have now taken a massive step towards the successful
              defence of their title.</p>
              <p>Next up for the Scot's side are Blackburn
              and victory at Ewood Park will mean United can all but take the title
              if they beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on April 26.</p>
              <p>"I said if
              we win our next three games we would be champions," said Ferguson after
              seeing United come from 1-0 down to win thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo's
              coolly-taken penalty and Owen Hargreaves's superbly struck free-kick.</p>
              <p>"We
              have got over a nervous day today (Sunday)," Ferguson added. "We've got
              a week's rest now, get them freshened up before Blackburn away.</p>
              <p>"The
              players knew this was a massive game today. Arsenal and ourselves have
              been competing for trophies for 15 or 16 years and the games are always
              so emotionally tight and this was another one."</p>
              <p>Ferguson agreed
              his team had been fortunate to beat an Arsenal side who had gone ahead
              in the 48th minute through Emmanuel Adebayor as they tried to keep
              their season alive after last week's Champions League exit against
              Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"The quality of this game was outstanding," Ferguson said as he reflected on another compelling United-Arsenal clash .</p>
              <p>"There
              won't be a better game this year. They were the better team in the
              first-half. I thought we were very nervous and our passing was poor and
              I couldn't wait to get to half-time.</p>
              <p>"When Arsenal scored they
              forced my hand, and I had to bring on Anderson and Carlos Tevez. That
              was a pivotal moment and we were fantastic after that, played some good
              football, and it was just an incredible game."</p>
              <p>Victory would have hauled Arsenal back into the title race, moving them to within three points of United.</p>
              <p>Instead,
              Arsene Wenger and his players were forced to admit that, at nine points
              adrift of top spot, they were out of the race having been five points
              in front as recently as February.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have been criticised
              for an inability to turn impressive performances into wins but their
              French manager insisted there would be no compromising when it came to
              the Gunners' approach next season.</p>
              <p>"I believe the gap between
              success and failure is very thin and I didn't feel that today we were
              inferior technically speaking and in terms of quality," he said.</p>
              <p>"I
              feel we have done a lot to promote the Premier League all over the
              world this season. I'm not an idealist, I want to win trophies and I am
              sad we haven't won a trophy," Wenger insisted.</p>
              <p>"We want to win trophies by playing the way we do but we want to do it better. That will come.</p>
              <p>"But
              we have to go beyond the situation we have now where the praise given
              to winners is beyond reason while those who don't win are slaughtered
              beyond reason," he added.</p>
              <p>"We feel there is not a big difference
              between ourselves and the other teams. We play quality football because
              we think that is the way to win trophies. We have lacked maturity
              defensively at times this season but that will come."</p>
