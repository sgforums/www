              <p>Dimitar Berbatov is loving life in Manchester. Not only is he
              delighted at the fact that he plays for a club he regards as the
              biggest in the world, but he prefers life in a city that is one of the
              wettest in England.</p>
              <p>"People talk about the north and the south but I don't make
              comparisons like that, I am just interested in my football," he told <em>MUTV</em>.</p>
              <p>"People say it is not sunny here and it rains all the time but that
              doesn't bother me. I like it the way it is. In fact, I like it better
              here."</p>
              <p>The player, accused by his former employers, North London outfit
              Tottenham Hotspur of disloyalty, went on to admit that he never really
              liked the English capital anyway, and prefers life in the "more
              peaceful" north of the country.</p>
              <p>"I am not a guy who looks for places with a lot of people and traffic. London was crazy anyway, so I used to live out of town.</p>
              <p>"Here it is more peaceful. But the city is secondary to the team I
              play for. Now I play for the biggest team in the world, so it doesn't
              matter where I live. I am very happy and things are going well.</p>
              <p>"My dream was to come here, now I can see how the biggest stars are
              working and I can compare and measure myself against the best."</p>
              <p>In addition to relishing his change of geography, Berbatov is also
              enjoying the serious and professional atmosphere at Old Trafford, where
              hard work is the order of the day, although the squad do share the odd
              joke too.</p>
              <p>"I come into work and enjoy training, then I go home but I just want
              to go to bed and then start training again," the Bulgarian added.</p>
              <p>"I enjoy sharing jokes. But when we work, it is serious. We have
              very important games ahead of us and we need to prepare for them."</p>

              <p>if he moved north and indicated that he (still) prefers south, in such a short time, it does not bode well for his intelligence.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Many player have moved out of London, some to the north and some further south but after moving, they still prefer to return to the capital... Like Defoe and Bentley are just some of the examples... Others like Paul Konchesky just want to stay in London... Then there are some who claims that London is too noise, crowded with too many people and cars (like Hleb) and would prefer a less hectic surroundings to live in... It isn't surprising if Berbatov, known to perfer a more quiet lifestyle, would prefer somewhere away from busy London.</p></div>
