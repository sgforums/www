              <p>i think barca will win no matter how MU plays.</p>
              <p>but I feels valencia/giggs are totally negated. Carrick at least did better, but he was overwhelmed. I would have prefer someone like anderson to have more bite. and Nani who has more threat.</p>
              <p>park/carrick/giggs/valencia are suppose to form the 2nd line in front of defence. In that end, they didn't and allow the goals.</p>
              <p>MU's tatics is to be close to Messi, whoever the nearest player. however, he is too good and MU's players are not disciplined enough.</p>
              <p>surprisingly, mufc's top epl scorer and their top assist players both did not start. this season is really strange.</p>
              <p>and by the 70th min, it is effectively over. Just imagine the EPL champion reduced to that. Not sure how SAF can "reinvent"..  really sad to see how this is the last game for Edwin and psossibly scholes.</p>

              <p>thats why their passing is so effective and dominant. I agreed, passing is a simple game really. u can pass from defence, to midfield and attack, like total football.</p>

              <p>I do agree with you. not sure whether it is the quality issue or how MUFC is playing, but two times, and they failed miserably.</p>
              <p>can't even win the ball back, chasing shadows and can't even fight back.. something has to change if MUFC wants to win another UCL. and i think it should give other teams in EPL - UCL a lesson too.</p>
              <p>and it has to starts with some really really wise buys or changes.</p>

              <p>The result was kind of expected to be honest. Barce isn't called "The best team in the world" for nothing... They have the top 3 of the current Fifa player of the year in their squad. But I also belief the United style was part of the problem as well... I belief Chelsea or a Rafa's Liverpool European cup match team might have fare better and gave Barce a harder time cos they are more physical and they work harder and run more, a lot more, closing down opponents like Barcelona more effective than the United's style of slowly passing the ball around and waiting for opponents to come at them then win the ball back kind...</p>
              <p>United were very slow, they don't close down the Barce players fast enough... Thats the main problem, Anyway, they don't seem to have enough such players also. The only one is Fletcher who wasn't fully fit... Park tried and did a good job on his own... But the rest of the midfielders, Giggs, Carrick and Valencia were very poor... They are not the fast players that close down opponents kind...</p>
              <p>Anyway, to be in the final is also not too bad lah... It will still increase their income for this year and they can use the money to buy players in future.  </p>
              <p>This was a bonus to me only... The all important Premier League crown is the one I wanted and still would prefer over the CL anytime... Beating the likes of Liverpool, City and Chelsea is still more meaningful than Barce whose rivalry with United isn't as big probably bacause they are from a different league I guess...</p>
              <p>So at the end of the day, I am still very pleased overall... lol.</p>
              <p>The satisfaction from winning the League is good enough. And if I am ask to pick again for next season, I wouldn't change a thing. Premier League over Champions League...</p>

              <p>Yeah, I noticed the Man U players seemed more willing to wait for the Barca players to come at them  rather than take the initiative to go in for the tackle and close them down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why Barca could string 10-20 passes among themselves easily around the pitch and wait for openings through the defence.</p>

              <p>Barca has easily 5 or 6 world class players; messi, xavi, iniesta, pedro, villa....all top draw......and Utd? I can only count rooney and hernandez. Hernandez didn't show up. Sometimes rooney lost the ball easily. Maybe valencia, nani and giggs. Carrick? Van der sar only made one notable save. Nono....... Not anderson nor scholes either.</p>
              <p>Next year if utd meets them, it will still be the same old story. I expect a golden era for their next 3 years at least.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>frankly speaking, england dun have a creative midfielder for the past 15 years since Jack Wilshere came along. Paul Gascoigne last played for england in 1996 european championship and that was how long ago england have a creative midfield. the current crop of english players are crap except for Rooney and Wilshere, potential to be as good as fabregas at Arsenal.</p></div>

              <p>yes, we all know Barca has this and that, blah blah blah..and yes, MU won the 19th title.</p>
              <p>EPL title was won with a good home record, but an disappointment away and with a huge pinch of luck. Yes, a big pat on the back for winning the 19th title.</p>
              <p>UCL is a totally new battleground where the best meets the best and MU is found wanting. I think SAF and team have to really self-examine and see how best they can move forward.</p>
              <p>And their transfers will see how best SAF wants to go ahead..</p>

              <p>true, I feel SAF already got a feel of how barca played in ROME, to me. And barca stick to how they played. but MUFC still can't adjust or present a threat to barca to force a change, and that's my issue here.. no offense to any.</p>
