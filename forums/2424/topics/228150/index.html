            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/07/cronaldoST170706_228x357.jpg"><br><br>Steve Coppell knows a thing or two about thrilling the Old Trafford punters with his touchline runs as a former Manchester United star. But even he is in thrall to the latest phenomenon to grace his old stamping ground and believes Christiano Ronaldo is the most exciting sight in football and a certainty to become the club's next superhero.<br><br>Coppell takes his team to a theatre of dreams he doesn't recognise it has improved so much but reckons Ronaldo graces its stage in the manner of the very best. And in trying to figure out the best way of stopping him, Coppell also recognises Ronaldo as a huge physical figure too.<br><br>He said: "Not only is Ronaldo a terrific player, he is a huge physical specimen as well. He must be almost 6ft 3ins, getting on for 14st, quick with a left and a right foot. The list is endless and his qualities are immense.<br><br>"It is no surprise a number of people have been saying that potentially he is the best player in football at the moment. "He can certainly be one of the club's superheroes. Not only does he provide goals, he's such a strong scorer himself. "He is tremendous, he is THE current player - more than any other who is right at the top end of his game."<br><br>Asked if Ronaldo excites him like past United wide men, Coppell added: "He's just unique in the way he controls the ball. His stepovers are special. You are almost guaranteed every week a trick he will do on the ball that no one else appears to do."<br><br>And Coppel believes that the Portuguese magician is also coming to terms with the criticism he has has received for simulation and overreacting at situations, like his infamous World Cup gesture to have United team-mate Wayne Rooney sent off.<br><br>Now they couldn't be better team-mates and Coppell says: "That just comes with maturity. He has reacted to the response of everybody around - whether that be the crowd, peer pressure or common sense after sometimes seeing yourself on TV."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/columnists/jamie_redknapp.jpg"><br>Jamie Redknapp<br><br><strong>Ronaldo epitomises United's swagger</strong><br><br>Boo Cristiano Ronaldo if you must, but surely it's also time to appreciate the qualities of this powerhouse of a player.<br><br>It would be foolish to ask for supporters to stop taunting him, because they won't, but perhaps it's worth remembering that the last Manchester United player to emerge from a World Cup with a battered image was David Beckham, who began the 1999 season as public enemy No1 and finished it with a treble.<br><br>Such success is not beyond Ronaldo and his rampant Manchester United team-mates. The top scorers' list for the Premiership has three United players in the leading group, with Ronaldo their highest scorer with 10 League goals and 12 in all competitions. While Chelsea are relying on the goals of the ferocious Didier Drogba, Ronaldo is carrying the fight to them from the red corner.<br><br>Even when United had a poor day at West Ham recently, Ronaldo must have created five or six chances for himself. Currently, he is overshadowing Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford and there is no sign of World Cup fatigue from the flying winger.<br><br>The only World Cup hangover is from opposition supporters, who want to blame him for England's exit from Germany and his part in Rooney's red card. It's time to get over it.<br><br>How do opponents stop him? He comes at you with such force, such pace. Kick him? He's too strong for that. Believe me, at 6ft 1in he is fast and direct and strong too.<br><br>We are used to producing nippy little wingers in this country, who have pace but can be bullied out of a game. Not Ronaldo. When I played against him, I marvelled at his strength but he is getting bigger and more direct. He has become a punishing force and his influence on the United team is growing by the game, even coming off the bench to score twice more against Wigan on Boxing Day.<br><br>He used to overcomplicate his game. Why beat a player once when you can try and beat him again and again? His dancing runs and step-overs used to frustrate his team-mates, because they wanted an early ball into the box.<br><br>Now he has simplified his approach. He will still mesmerise a full-back, but he can create openings for team-mates and his goal record shows that he can finish too. It is a developing part of his game. In his first season in England, he scored six goals; in his second season, he scored nine goals, but didn't score his first until December.<br><br>Last season, he scored 12 goals. Now he has a dozen already and, having been set a target of 15 by his manager, the dressing room is now urging him to emulate the 20-plus goals scored from midfield by Frank Lampard last season.<br><br>With Rooney and Louis Saha weighing in too, you can see why there is such confidence about United. Like Ronaldo, they have a bit of a swagger about them going into 2007.<br><br>Booing Ronaldo hasn't had an adverse effect on the player. He looks to be inspired by it. He has cleaned up his diving too. He used to go over too quickly, especially for a big, strong lad, but now he is staying on his feet and has learned there are more ways to hurt the opposition than tumbling over.<br><br>Middlesbrough supporters and their manager, Gareth Southgate, were aggrieved by a penalty awarded when Ronaldo went to ground under a challenge from Mark Schwarzer, but it was his pace that carried him through into the box, he draws fouls and he will win free kicks and penalties. We have to accept that.<br><br>I don't expect an overnight change in the reaction to him. We are not all about to fall in love with Ronaldo suddenly, but I hope that in time there can be respect and admiration for his talents.<br><br>We've seen a player of similar ability, Thierry Henry, given respect on his travels. Portsmouth fans once gave him a standing ovation after one game at Fratton Park and he has since spoken about their passion and support.<br><br>I heard once of a long queue of Manchester City fans waiting for Gianfranco Zola, who then stayed and signed all their autographs while the team bus waited for him. Maybe Ronaldo can learn from these experiences. Perhaps he has a role model closer to home in Ryan Giggs.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson once told me that Ronaldo would become the best player in the world. At the age of 22, he is already on his way to becoming the best player in the Premiership.<br><br>After Eric Cantona, Henry, Zola, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Dennis Bergkamp and Paolo Di Canio, to name just a handful of the great foreign entertainers, we have another. Let's celebrate that.<br><br></div>
