Actually at present i think not really necessary but the season is a rather long one and with a few different tournaments... Its not bad to always get someone in earlier so that he can settle in with the team. Scholes cannot last very long another 2 yrs and is is over... And also, if they get injuries there will be enough able players to step in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so sorry, I have not been clear.<br>I read this post which was debating whether OwenH is good for the team.<br>And given SAF's last minutes buys are disastrous, so this article questions the decision.<br><br>Yes, Scholes may not last another 2 years, but I believe Carrick is taking over. Carrick is not in the Keano's mould. So we still need someone like that (pitbull mould).<br><br>So we are still short of that DM, and now, a scorer.<br><br>I am amazed at the loyalty shown to Ole, for he to me, is still a super sub, for the game against watford, I don't think he produced. I rather Rossi or Richardson is thrown in to absorb experiences.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i agree... Ole don't look like what he used to be nowadays. That is why there is a linked of Trezeguet to United... United may need an additional striker in case, but in Trezeguet case, he may still be available in Jan 07 cos he won't play any CL match so won't be ban... can still get him in Jan if things don't work out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess this deal won't go through after all cos Hargreaves didn't push BM hard enough... He should have come out to say something like he won't play for BM anymore like Reyes or that Lyon guy that went to Real M. He just kept quiet and spoke softly behind the scene which was never going to get the point across to BM managers.<br><br>Man u should now just go for Mascherano and forget Hargreaves. After all, Mascherano is 2 yrs younger than Hargreaves and bigger size than him too.<br><br><strong>JAVIER MASCHERANO has emerged as a deadline-beating target for Manchester United.<br><br>Alex Ferguson could turn to the Argentine ace, with Owen Hargreaves now looking set to STAY at Bayern Munich.<br><br>The United boss is fed up that weeks of negotiations with Bayern over Hargreaves have failed to lead to a deal.<br><br>And the player has now had the onus put on him to get the Germans to agree Â— or risk seeing his dream move to the Premiership come to nothing.<br><br>Ferguson wants to make a final Â£18m bid before the transfer window closes at midnight tomorrow, despite the playerÂ’s agent claiming Bayern have won their battle to keep him.<br><br>Hargreaves, 25, had hoped to bide his time in Munich and wait for United to return when the window reopens in January.<br><br>But Fergie has ruled that out, fearing the midfielder will have become cup-tied for the Champions League.<br><br>United also refuse to be dragged through the same saga with Bayern next summer.<br><br>Hargreaves may even have become surplus to requirements in 12 monthsÂ’ time if the likes of Darren Fletcher, John OÂ’Shea and youngster David Jones continue to progress at Old Trafford.<br><br></strong></div>
