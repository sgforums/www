            <div class='col-md body'>Damn Bayern Munich, the player don't want to play for them anymore let him go lah right... Not say they are letting him go for free... $13 to $17m already very good what. Keep him for what? his family all in England somemore got a big club like United want him sure he wants to go back what.<br><br>Hope Hargreaves continues to give interviews to the papers saying he no longer wants to play for Bayern... Then the fans will not want him at Munich and the GM have no choice but let him go...<br><br>Right now it all depends on Hargreaves himself... He must continue to make noise and make Bayern give up on him...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Thats is why Owen &amp; Carrick will be the eventual pair with carrick being able to pass the ball aroung better... Did you watch, A spurs without carrick look a little lost when goin forward...

'A club may only contact a player when the club holding his contract agrees to it.'<br><br>United manager Alex Ferguson confirmed on Friday that he wanted to bring in Hargreaves, who could help fill the gap left by Roy Keane. Hargreaves himself has been quoted as saying he would like to move to United.<br><br>The midfielder has a contract with Bayern running until 2010.<br><br>Newspapers have speculated that United might be prepared to pay 25 million euros ($32.15 million) for a player who greatly enhanced his reputation during England's run to the World Cup quarter-finals.<br><br>Bayern said they left Hargreaves out of their squad for Sunday's 2-1 win over Bochum in the Bundesliga because of a bout of flu. He will miss Tuesday's friendly match against Barcelona at the Nou Camp for the same reason.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't understand... If a player wishes to leave so badly, might as well let him do so. No point keeping a player who won't be 100% motivated to play.. If Hargreaves keep up this way, he probably won't stay in Bayern for long but the question is when Bayern will allow him to leave. Probably after the Champions League squad selection just so that Hargreaves can't play CL football...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bayern just want to prove that they are a big club thats all... and won't be push about... Rummenigge said: "We are not Hamburg, who let Khalid Boulahrouz go at the first sign he wants out. We are FC Bayern. "We do not just let anybody go - the employer decides here, not the employee."<br><br>I think they are hoping for Aug 31 to pass, they don't want to play Hargreaves at the moment cos probably they don't want people to see he has no heart to run at the moment... so say he has the flu... Maybe they are hoping after Aug 31, Hargreaves would give up the idea then they can convince him to play again.<br><br>Its now up to Hargreaves to make it very clear to Bayern that he wants to leave and even if they are successful in forcing him to stay, He won't be happy even after Aug 31.<br><br>Time for him to fight for it... But it seems like he is the afraid type... not dare to talk much or go against the boss kind.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OWEN HARGREAVES is set to defy Bayern MunichÂ’s Â‘keep quietÂ’ ultimatum by publicly pleading today for a move to Manchester United.<br><br>German giants Bayern have warned they are ready to lodge a complaint to FIFA over an illegal approach for Hargreaves if United continue to chase him.<br><br>But he and his advisers have arranged a Munich press briefing at which the England midfielder, 25, is set to demand a transfer.<br><br>UnitedÂ’s move for the Canadian-born star has ground to a halt with Bayern refusing even to discuss selling the player. But Hargreaves, who has four years left on his Bayern contract, is determined to come out fighting after being stung by the clubÂ’s hard-line stance.<br><br>Bayern general manager Uli Hoeness warned Hargreaves to Â‘keep his mouth shutÂ’ this week after losing patience with the playerÂ’s refusal to distance himself from Old Trafford.<br><br>And club president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge warned: Â“We have told Manchester United to drop their interest or we will turn to FIFA.<br><br>Â“We are FC Bayern and do not just let anybody go.Â”<br><br></div>
