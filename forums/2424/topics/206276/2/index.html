You mention so many but not one league title... Even Blackburn got 1 league title... winning cups are not really the thing people care about... its the dominating ways that a club keeps winning the league title that makes other club fans angry... Cups are one off. Maybe you play 7 to 10 games to win it. One year you win it the next year you go out early, hard to say depends on your luck... League titles are different, you must consistently play well through-out the 9 months.<br><br>Like i said, They have never even won the premiership title before since it started more than 10 yrs ago liao...<br><br>And their "treble" ... I always laugh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> when people bring up Liverpool's "treble" to Man u supporters... It didn't even have the European Cup or the League title in it... Only the FA cup is consider respectable the other 2... The European Little Boys Cup and the Mickey Mouse League Cup... are not exactly what one consider respectable titles...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bayern is really stubborn. There's no point in paying the salary of a player who doesn't want to play for the club anymore. They should just sell him, get the money and buy players who wants to go bayern. They are just wasting time as the transfer window is coming to a close.

It would appear that Hargreaves, for whom United have made an offer of Â£17m, had been picked out by HÃ¶ness in front of the whole squad for making clear his wishes to leave.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bayern do dirty on Owen<br>By NEIL CUSTIS<br><br>BAYERN MUNICH double-crossed Manchester United after agreeing a Â£12million fee for Owen Hargreaves.<br><br>The England star had a medical on August 15. But Bayern pulled the plug just as the deal was due to be confirmed two days later.<br><br>They ordered Hargreaves back to Germany and upped their asking price to Â£17m.<br><br>Bayern have since been accusing United of an illegal approach.<br><br>And their chief executive Uli Hoeness branded Hargreaves, 25, a Â‘prostituteÂ’ for offering himself to the Premiership club.<br><br>United are now hoping Old Trafford director Bobby CharltonÂ’s friendship with the GermansÂ’ president, Franz Beckenbauer, can help smooth the move before ThursdayÂ’s transfer deadline.<br><br>Bayern agreed the deal the day before Hargreaves played for England against Greece.<br><br>An announcement was set for the day after the Old Trafford international Â— until Bayern pulled out.<br><br>It is believed their stubbornness may be simply to placate their fans who are already angry at losing Michael Ballack to Chelsea.<br><br>But Hargreaves has made it clear he wants to quit Munich.<br><br>He accused the Bundesliga champions of treating him with no respect after nine years of service to the club.<br><br>Hargreaves said: Â“IÂ’ve given everything to Bayern and I want to be treated with respect.<br><br>Â“I simply want them to accept United would be a great step for me. The manager does not want to let me go. ThatÂ’s his right. But he knows what I want.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s simply a great challenge. IÂ’m an England player, part of my family lives near Manchester. A lot of things come together.Â”<br><br>Bayern argue that the midfielder was happy to sign a new deal only last season, keeping him at the club until 2010.<br><br>Hargreaves admitted: Â“The contract was a great honour but a lot of things have developed in a different way. I have a great chance to become a key player for England.Â”<br><br>And while United hope to wrap up the deal by Thursday, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge last night insisted there is no chance.<br><br>Rummenigge said: Â“Owen is free to swap sides Â— but not before July 1, 2010.<br><br>Â“This is the last word. If I say this, that is what it is going to be.Â”<br><br></div>
