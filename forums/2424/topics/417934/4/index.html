              <p>On a positive note, if we look down the years of EPL, every team up there has faced ups and downs in their entire season, including the champions. This is one down for utd......would have liked it if they'd had shown more mettle after the 2nd chelsea goal. Then again, i think their confidence suffers as usual when away. It will be a different game at OT come april.</p>
              <p>Sigh...wonder why fergie brought giggs on instead of berba.</p>
              <p>Poor smalling.....doing things right all this while and gave away a penalty in a massive game. Not that he shd be blamed as if he hadn't stuck out the leg, zhirkov would have been one on one with VDS.</p>
              <p>The defining moment has to be the intro of drogba. He solidified their control on midfield and attack. Poor him....made way for torres probably because roman told ancelotti that he's got to play the 50m pounds player lol. Disappointing match for torres once again. He was a star at liverpool.</p>
              <p>Ouch.....this game hurts.</p>

              <p>You know, when I saw Luiz get away with no red card, I'm sure that decision will come back and bite United. Of course I was praying that my instincts ain't right but Martin Atkinson proves to be one dick of a referee.</p>
              <p>Smalling gave away a very very cheap penalty. His legs were on the ground and Zhirkov ran into them. Same too did Torres earned a freekick which could have changed the game completely when he ran into Evra.</p>
              <p>It's a pulsating match with end to end stuff and although United lost, it was a very entertaining match. The commentator even said "It's like basketball: you attack, we attack."</p>

              <p><span><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson exploded in fury at referee Martin Atkinson on Tuesday night and questioned his integrity after seeing Manchester United slump to defeat at Chelsea and miss the chance to take a firm grip on the title race.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Frank Lampard scored the winner from a disputed penalty but Ferguson was most angry that David Luiz escaped a red card after a cynical foul on Wayne Rooney, who opened the scoring with a 25-yard screamer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Luiz had earlier equalised with a terrific volley and it was United who finished with 10 men after Nemanja Vidic was sent off for second booking - leaving United with a defensive crisis for Sunday's trip to Liverpool. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'You want a fair ref,' fumed Ferguson on MUTV. 'I don't know how he got this game. When I saw who was refereeing it, I did fear the worst. It's been three years in a row now down here.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Ferguson's comments will risk an FA misconduct charge and touchline ban, especially as he has previous with Atkinson, clashing with him after an FA Cup defeat at home to Portsmouth in 2008. </span></p>
              <p><span>The same referee was also in charge when United lost at Stamford Bridge last season and the United boss disputed the free-kick which led to John Terry's winning goal. </span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p>Despite conceding before the kick-off that Rooney was lucky to play after escaping a ban for an elbow on Wigan's James McCarthy on Saturday, Ferguson was quick to accuse Atkinson of letting Luiz off the hook. The Brazilian was already in the book when he made bad challenges on Rooney and Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez. </p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 'I don't know how he's on the pitch. He's done Chicharito off the ball. Nothing's done and the referee's in front of it. He's done Rooney, clear as day, and he's six yards from him. Doesn't do anything. These decisions change the game. You hope you get a really strong referee in games like this. And we didn't get that. </p>
              <p>The penalty was so soft - deary, deary me.' <br>

              <p><strong>Ferguson claimed he did not have a clear view of the second yellow card which led to a red for Vidic but said Barclays Premier League champions Chelsea, 12 points adrift of his team, could win still the title if they continue to benefit from lenient officials. </strong></p>
              <p>'If they keep getting decisions like tonight, it could change everything,' said the United boss. Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti wasn't so sure. 'It's too far,' he said. 'But this victory is important for us and our confidence. We were able to stay focused even when we were losing 1-0, and showed strength, power and intensity in the second half.' </p>
              <p>United are four points clear of Arsenal at the top but have played a game more and face a stern test at Liverpool without Vidic, who is suspended, and Rio Ferdinand, who will not be back from injury. Wes Brown and Chris Smalling are likely to play in central defence. </p>

              <p><strong>One item of consolation for United was Ryan Giggs, who came on as a substitute to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 606 League appearances.</strong></p>
              <p>'He's a phenomenal man,' said Ferguson. 'He deserves all the accolades because he's an example to the game and to any young player.' </p>

              <p><span>The same referee was also in charge when United lost at Stamford Bridge last season and the United boss disputed the free-kick which led to John Terry's winning goal.</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite conceding before the kick-off that Rooney was lucky to play after escaping a ban for an elbow on Wigan's James McCarthy on Saturday, Ferguson was quick to accuse Atkinson of letting Luiz off the hook. The Brazilian was already in the book when he made bad challenges on Rooney and Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez.</span></p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 'I don't know how he's on the pitch. He's done Chicharito off the ball. Nothing's done and the referee's in front of it. He's done Rooney, clear as day, and he's six yards from him. Doesn't do anything. These decisions change the game. You hope you get a really strong referee in games like this. And we didn't get that.</p>
              <p>The penalty was so soft - deary, deary me.'</p>

              <p><strong>Ferguson claimed he did not have a clear view of the second yellow card which led to a red for Vidic but said Barclays Premier League champions Chelsea, 12 points adrift of his team, could win still the title if they continue to benefit from lenient officials.</strong></p>
              <p>'If they keep getting decisions like tonight, it could change everything,' said the United boss. Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti wasn't so sure. 'It's too far,' he said. 'But this victory is important for us and our confidence. We were able to stay focused even when we were losing 1-0, and showed strength, power and intensity in the second half.'</p>
              <p>United are four points clear of Arsenal at the top but have played a game more and face a stern test at Liverpool without Vidic, who is suspended, and Rio Ferdinand, who will not be back from injury. Wes Brown and Chris Smalling are likely to play in central defence.</p>

              <p><strong>One item of consolation for United was Ryan Giggs, who came on as a substitute to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 606 League appearances.</strong></p>
              <p>'He's a phenomenal man,' said Ferguson. 'He deserves all the accolades because he's an example to the game and to any young player.'</p>

              <p>Does this make Atkinson a worse referee than Clattenburg? Come on, referees are human. Humans make mistakes all the time. Both officials had their share of mistakes, but just because one made the decision that played to MUFC's advantage doesn't mean shit. At the end of the day, video replays are most accurate, and the FA can review that and take the necessary action.</p>

              <p>Arsenal MIGHT collapse, but Man U wont, based on past few seasons performances. But I think Arsenal also wants to fight BPL by removing their complancy and hopes that those key players are back in time.</p>

              <p>It is obvious that Berbatov can only shine against a smaller team, minus Liverpool of course. He might be top scorer but he's very inconsistent. He can score a hat-trick in one match and fail to score in the next 3-4 games.</p>
              <p>Rooney, on the other hand, had contributed 11 assists despite scoring only 6 times prior to the Chelsea game.</p>
              <p>I guess Rooney's all round play won him the vote before Berbatov.</p>
