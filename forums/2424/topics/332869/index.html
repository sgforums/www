              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED are poised to make an £18million swoop for Wigan ace Wilson Palacios.</h2>
              <p class="article">SunSport understands the champions could nab the midfielder as early as January, although the deal is more likely to happen at the end of the season.</p>
              <p class="article">We told you exclusively that United wanted Palacios, 24, last summer — but Latics boss Steve Bruce was desperate to keep him for one more year.</p>
              <p class="article">A close pal of Palacios said: “You know the rapport between Steve Bruce and Alex Ferguson. They’re very close.</p>
              <p class="article">“United have been following Wilson closely for some time. Steve benefited from his rapport with Sir Alex and was able to keep Wilson for six months or a year more.</p>
              <p class="article">“Nothing is signed but there’s a moral agreement. Wigan have set the bar high, £18m. It’s possible it could be done in January.”</p>
              <p class="article">Honduran Palacios has been a revelation in the Premier League since Wigan bought him for £1m from Birmingham last January.</p>
              <p class="article">So have United recently — shrugging off their sluggish start with wins against Bolton and Blackburn plus a Euro triumph over Aalborg in the past 10 days.</p>
              <p class="article">And Ferguson has warned his rivals they will be even <strong>BETTER</strong> after the international break.</p>
              <p class="article">The United boss said: “We never usually settle until the international breaks are over. We’ll get back into the rhythm with West Brom at home.</p>
              <p class="article">“Then in November you can expect us to really start going.”</p>

              <p>carrick is out with broken bones, scholes is retiring, anderson is still raw, hargreaves is mr glassman, fletcher is good, but quality is doubtful.</p>
              <p>we really need a keano, to be our anchor.. at the moment we are not there.</p>

              <p>Of the 5 midfielders United have... Scholes, Anderson, Carrick, Hargreaves and Fletcher, Only Anderson and Hargreaves are more likely to be compare to this Palacios. Carrick is expected to take over Scholes and Giggs very soon.</p>
              <p>Anderson is good and still very young at 19 or 20... Hargreaves is good too but seems like they said his this injury problem will never go away... It will come and go come and go type. He is not someone who you can expect to play 40 matches a season... Moreover he is already 28. So they do need another defensive midfielder as cover or backup who could eventually take over. Fergie has been keeping an eye on him since last season... I think he wants to see if he can keep the good form and be consistent...</p>
              <p>Anyway, going out and buy one from Europe or that Sporting Lisbon guy would cost $20m too... So why not get someone who is familiar and doing well in the epl...</p>

              <h1>Palacios not United bound - Bruce</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Wigan boss Steve Bruce has rubbished reports claiming a deal has been agreed for Wilson Palacios to join Manchester United.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Speculation has suggested
              that Latics will sell the Honduras international to the Red Devils for
              £18million in January or at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Latics boss Bruce, who spent almost a decade at Old Trafford as a player, can understand why such rumours have surfaced.</p>
              <p>Bruce accepts that it will become increasingly difficult to keep
              Palacios, who has produced a series of impressive displays this season.</p>
              <p>However, he has insisted that no deal is in place for the 24-year-old to move on.</p>
              <p>Bruce told the Wigan Evening Post: "I'm never going to be able
              to stop speculation like that as everyone knows my connections with
              United. But there is no deal done, I can tell you that.</p>
              <p>"The way Wilson has been playing, he is going to attract the attention of other clubs.</p>
              <p>"But certainly nothing is in place at Christmas or next summer."</p>

              <p>Owen just joined the squad leh, a bit too early to replace him with a big money signing... I suppose it is to provide cover in central midfield. Another attacking option after Scholesy goes. </p>
