              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed John O'Shea will get the reward for all his patience by confirming him as a starter for Manchester United in next week's Champions League final.</strong></p>
              <p>Although it is nearly a decade since O'Shea made his United debut at Aston Villa, the Republic of Ireland international has rarely been a regular in Ferguson's first-choice line-up.</p>
              <p>Yet, with Patrice Evra ruled out for various stages of the season through injury and suspension, O'Shea has made frequent appearances at left-back this term. And, when Gary Neville joined Wes Brown on the injury list later in the campaign, Ferguson turned to O'Shea's experience when he did not feel teenage Brazilian Rafael was the right man for the job.</p>
              <p>Now the United boss has assured O'Shea of his place in the side that will tackle Barcelona in Rome's Stadio Olimpico.</p>
              <p>"John takes his place in Rome because he deserves it," said Ferguson. "Because of the injuries to Gary Neville and Wes Brown, he has become a permanent fixture. He is ahead of everyone now."</p>
              <p>O'Shea has never been one of the most talked about players in the United squad, although he has not been short of admirers elsewhere and it is a fair bet the Waterford-born star could have moved on if he had chosen to do so.</p>
              <p>Instead, he preferred to battle on with the Old Trafford outfit, for whom he has now made 341 appearances, including a few minutes in goal when Edwin van der Sar got injured at Tottenham in 2007 after Ferguson had used all his three substitutes.</p>
              <p>An unused substitute in last year's penalty shoot-out triumph against Chelsea, it appeared O'Shea was destined to remain a bit-part player until this season's dramatic turn of events.</p>
              <p>"To my mind John is one of the unsung heroes like we had when Denis Irwin was here," said Ferguson. "We used to say Denis was an eight out of ten player every week but didn't get the celebrity status of a lot of Manchester United players. John O'Shea falls into the same category.</p>
              <p>"He can play anywhere for me and has done, all across the back four and in midfield. He has even played in goal. "His performances have improved simply because he has been playing consistently.</p>
              <p>"He is a fantastic type of person. He is well mannered and well brought up. "He is an intelligent lad with a great work rate. I am really pleased for him."</p>

              Injuries to Brown and Gary Neville, provide O Shea an opportunity to consolidate the RB berth, plus Rafael is a tad young for fergie to play him regularly. He has done well when called upon to play and he has not looked back since.
              
              But next season, I dun think O Shea will be no 1  at RB, as Brown and Rafael may challenge him for the RB position if they stay clear of injuries. As for gary, he is getting older and more injury prone, so he will not be getting more games for next season.

              <p>actually prefer Rafael given his speed and attacking ability, but Oshea is a safe bet.</p>
              <p>cause Barca won't play much high balls so pace may be better than height.</p>

              <p>Rafael started very well and showed great potential... But maybe its over-confidence or sometimes else, cos I find his game was exposed a few time towards the end of the season... Perhaps it was the "pressure cooker moment" that he makes more mistakes than usual...</p>
              <p>I notice towards the last 10 games or so, he is always out of position... Either he gone up and didn't do enough to make it back to his right-back position on time or he drift into the centre area between the 2 centre-backs...</p>
              <p>That match against Porto, he was like nowhere to be seen in his right-back spot... So I guess against fast attacking sides, he hasn't learn how to deal with it yet... But he is still very young and will improve with these things... So I guess its down to experience... which O'Shea has more than him...</p>
