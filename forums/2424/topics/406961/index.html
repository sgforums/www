              <p><strong>Manchester United midfielder Anderson has been involved in a car crash in Portugal and was pulled from the wreckage moments before it burst into flames, according to reports.</strong> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">Anderson is reported to have spent hours in hospital after the crash, which occured at around 7am on a rural road in Braga, but sustained only minor injuries.</div>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"> </div>
              <p><em>The Guardian</em> quoting local sources, claim that the 22-year-old had spent the night at the Sardinha Biba nightclub before leaving in a £125,000 Audi R8 and witnesses say he was pulled ''lifeless'' from the wreckage before it went up in flames.</p>
              <p>The paper also claims that two companions - a man known as Victor, and a young Brazilian woman, whose details have not been released - All three were taken to St Mark's hospital but discharged by late morning after being treated for concussion, whiplash and shock. "They had only minor injuries," a hospital spokesman, Roman Fresco, said.</p>
              <p>Anderson ruptured his cruciate ligament in February and has been out of action ever since. The Portuguese press quoted the Gestifute agency, which represents Anderson, as saying the Brazilian would now return to Manchester to continue his rehabilitation after suffering an "almighty scare".</p>

No need for Fergie to worry too much about the new rule selection dilemma as Anderson will be out cold and Hargreaves is out too.

              <p><strong>Anderson, 22, faces the possibility of a police investigation in Portugal after it emerged he was driving the Audi R8 car that crashed and burst into flames at 7am on Saturday as he and two companions returned from a nightclub in Braga.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian, who is expected to make his comeback from a cruciate ligament injury next month, was treated for superficial injuries but police want to know if he had been drinking before the crash.</p>
              <p>Anderson told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span>: ‘I am very lucky because the accident was serious. I knew the road well. But the car lost control at a curve and we crashed against a wall. I remember people coming to help, which I am very grateful for.</p>
              <p>‘I just want to tell United fans I am fine and I will continue my rehabilitation so I can help the team. I’ve had lots of calls and have assured my friends not to worry, but it was a very big scare for me.’</p>
              <p>Onlookers said Anderson, who was fined two weeks’ wages by Ferguson for returning to Brazil without permission in January, lost control of the Audi which hit a wall in a nearby field and then caught fire. Even though it is a two-seater, there were two passengers who needed hospital treatment.</p>
              <p>One witness who helped Anderson said: ‘I thought he was dead. My brother dragged him out of the car, and we put out the flames.’</p>

              <p>no way in hell with a car, that low centre of gravity, fat tyres, enough grunt and stability to get out of tricky situations, "lose control" like that...</p>
              <p>oh yah.. can you actually comfortably fit 3 people in the R8?</p>
