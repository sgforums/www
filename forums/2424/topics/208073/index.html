            <div class='col-md body'>EVERTON boss David Moyes may sue Wayne Rooney over claims in his book but proceedings have not yet been issued.<br><br>Moyes' solicitors have already started proceedings against the Daily Mail, which published extracts of "Wayne Rooney: My Story So Far'.<br><br>And while no action has been taken against Rooney or publishers HarperSport yet, it could be imminent.<br><br>Moyes' lawyer Mel Goldberg said: "Proceedings have been issued against the Daily Mail.<br><br>"Separate action will be taken against the publishers and presumably Wayne Rooney as well because he is the cause of the publication.<br><br>"But at this minute legal proceedings against Wayne Rooney have not been issued."<br><br>Moyes is particularly upset by Rooney's claims that the Scot broke his confidence by leaking details of a personal nature.<br><br>"There were several comments," said Goldberg.<br><br>"The main headline (in the Daily Mail) was Rooney claiming that David Moyes forced him out which is not true, and another comment that 'David Moyes was jealous of me' - that was not true.<br><br>"And there was a comment which we regard as very serious which is that David Moyes broke professional confidence by leaking stories which he had been told. That's not true either.<br><br>"Moyes went out of his way to cover up, over a long period of time, about that and other matters as well.<br><br>"What a player tells a manager in confidence is something which is special and if other players feel a manager is going to blow the whistle on him to other people, no player would ever speak to his manager in confidence and that has greatly upset him," said Goldberg.<br><br>Regarding possible outcomes, Goldberg said: "We've been corresponding with the Daily Mail an apology has not been forthcoming.<br><br>"As far as the paper is concerned proceedings have already been issued. So far as the book publishers are concerned that will happen shortly, I've no doubt.<br><br>"Matters are always begun by a writ but often they are settled before they get to court so it's possible that this matter will be settled. But there's no settlement been discussed."<br></div>
