              <p>I'm more than happy to see Rafael and Fabio on the wings instead of Bebe and Obertan. Who's with me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I was like "OMG, WTF is this lineup?". I think United lacked a passer in midfield. So often have we seen Rooney dropping deep to support and play the passes. Gibson is thrash and O'Shea cant pass!</p>
              <p>I think we'll get to see Valencia soon enough and maybe a little of Giggs and Scholes.</p>

              <p>Van Der Sar is unbeatable today. Top performance from this World Class Goalie. Can we successfully replace him? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"> My personal preferred choice would be Manuel Neuer.</p>
              <p>Rafael and Fabio showed Bebe and Obertan how to cross. The latter should be ashamed of themselves, being outdone by 2 wing backs.</p>
              <p>Evra is off form today, his marking was so slack that Sagna's crosses are always sent to the dangerous area if not because of the tall and composing centre backs Vidic and Smalling, whom have been equally outstanding as Van Der Sar today.</p>
              <p>Brown did a decent job at right back, O'Shea is still as clumsy.</p>
              <p>Gibson is thrash, Scholes is fast loosing his focus with those wild challenges. He could have been sent off in all the recent matches he participated.</p>
              <p>Giggs of old would have scored at least 2 goals but we cant deny the fact that his experience was essential.</p>
              <p>Rooney was everywhere today: Attack, Midfield and Defence, he was a man on a mission. He helped the midfield when O'Shea and Gibson proved to be goondu at passing. He helped Evra and then O'Shea at blocking Sagna's cross. He even scored a well controlled header. My Man of the Match today.</p>
              <p>Chicharito should work on his ball control, offside beating runs and passes. His positioning sense is second to none, a goal poacher instinct but often he is caught offside or failed to control the ball.</p>
              <p>As usual, United are really strong at home, but meekly weak when playing away. Why ar?</p>

              <p>Conclusions...</p>
              <p>Hernandez definitely deserved a goal for all his hard work.</p>
              <p>A makeshift formation coupled with brilliant tactics can still churn out results. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>Vidic is Smalling's talisman.</p>

              <p>Don't blame the way Fergie had to put out that midfield cos he didn't have much option as the news is Park, Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick are all injured or unwell and would also be out for Tuesday's Champions League game against Marseille...</p>
              <p>Of course some probably didn't knew this at the time of the line-up but Fergie had to improvise as he only had Gibson, a 35 yrs old Scholes &amp; a 36 yrs old Giggs available in midfield. Scholes and Giggs we know cannot run much so to start them would be really bad especially against a fast moving Arsenal side...</p>
              <p>The plan was to ask Fabio and Rafael to give everything they got for the first 45 to 60 mins cos Arsenal was at its most dangerous during this time as players are fresh... Running up and down covering lots of areas but in doing so, they couldn't last the full match and that's where Giggs and Scholes came in.</p>
              <p>On another note, I think Rooney can be convert into an attacking midfielder cos his passing is very good and at his age, he can still play from box to box... Fabio and Rafael has a future as wingers... lol.</p>
              <p>And finally, Valencia's return at this time is a real bonus. I thought when he came back, he would need sometime to get it going again but he looked as good as before. That's great news for United. Can't wait to see Nani and Valencia playing together again. Man! one on the left, one on the right... Fantastic attacking option...</p>

              <p>To me, what's really encouraging about the match was not the 2-0 result but a number of things.</p>
              <p>1) Utd bounced back</p>
              <p>2) I thought Valencia was Nani until I had a closer look!</p>
              <p>3) Da Silva brothers will rule the wings for years to come</p>
              <p>4) Smalling was very steady as usual, together with Vidic</p>
              <p>5) Rooney made the least mistakes this match the entire season</p>
              <p>6) Hernandez 110% has the knack of running into the right places in the box</p>
              <p>For point 6), that is a very vital skill for strikers. Very often, wingers would make crosses into the box without looking up or even if they did, the ball is overhit or underhit....but hernandez has this natural instinct to run and meet the ball almost always. Amazing. Just hope we solve the away form mystery and march on to the next title.</p>

              <p>If away match, how? 360 degree change again...... The only lousy home matches they had performed: vs West Brom and Crawley. The other matches played and won convincingly.</p>

              <p>That one no idea man. Utd have somehow conditioned themselves to feel invincible at home this season but sorely lacking on confidence when away. I'd expect that trend to continue. I think they key hinges on losing as little as possible when away for the remaining games and winning ALL home games.</p>
