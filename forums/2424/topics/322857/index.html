              <p><strong>Manchester United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz was last night weighing up a £1.5million-a-year offer to become coach of Portugal.</strong></p>
              <p>Officials of the Portuguese Football Federation were in Manchester last night and reports in Lisbon claimed Queiroz has accepted the post.</p>
              <p>Those reports remain unconfirmed but the offer to Queiroz is concrete and the highly-rated coach must now decide whether to stay at Old Trafford or take control of his own national side in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson credits his assistant with guiding the club to last season's successes in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League and will instruct his board to do everything they can to keep Queiroz.</p>
              <p>But Queiroz, who was born in the then-Portuguese colony of Mozambique, will certainly be tempted by the chance to become his own boss once again for the first time since his ill-fated year in charge of Real Madrid in 2003-04.</p>

              <h2 class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15">Carlos Queiroz is set to become Portugal's manager</h2>
              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00301/carlos-360_301264g.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="185"></p>
              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"> </p>
              <p><strong>SIR ALEX FERGUSON has lost the first of his two major battles to keep key personnel after it emerged Carlos Queiroz is to accept an offer to become Portugal’s next manager. Ferguson is resigned to losing Queiroz, a crucial figure in Manchester United’s rebirth as European champions, and now faces the headache of finding the sixth No 2 of his 21-and-a-half-year reign. The manager remains adamant, however, that Cristiano Ronaldo will not be going to Real Madrid — despite fears that Queiroz’s departure will weaken United’s powers of persuasion with their unsettled star.</strong></p>
              <p>Queiroz, described by Ronaldo as “like a father”, is set to sign a four-year contract with Portugal worth around £1.2m a year, a salary similar to the amount he is paid by United. He is thought to have told Ferguson of his intentions after talks on Tuesday with Gilberto Madail, the president of the Portuguese Football Federation. It will be the second time Queiroz has managed Portugal, having coached his national team from 1991-94. He also had a spell as manager of South Africa, and was the FPF’s first choice to succeed Luiz Felipe Scolari from the moment the Brazilian announced he was leaving to join Chelsea during Euro 2008.</p>
              <p>United can expect a hefty sum in compensation for Queiroz, below, who is on a one-year rolling contract, but money will do little to salve their dismay at losing a figure recognised within the club to have been vital to its most recent successes. Queiroz was first Ferguson’s No 2 in 2002-03, when United were Premier League champions. He was credited with restoring organisation to a defence that had leaked 68 goals in 2001-02. His return in 2004, after an unsuccessful season as Real Madrid manager, coincided with the start of the building of United’s current European Cup-winning side. For four years Queiroz has overseen most training matters and Ferguson has allowed him major input into tactical strategies.</p>
              <p>Brian McClair, highly regarded by Ferguson for his work as the club’s academy director, is among those likely to be considered as a replacement, although United may also look at up-and-coming Championship managers, such as Barnsley’s Simon Davey, Simon Grayson of Blackpool and Swansea’s Roberto Martinez.</p>
              <p>Queiroz’s value to United extended far beyond his coaching acumen. His scouting network in Portugal put United first in line to sign Ronaldo, Nani and Anderson. Ferguson had hoped Queiroz would play a key part in persuading Ronaldo to abandon his “dream” of joining Real Madrid, but the coach is likely to have left United by July 14, the date Ronaldo is due to report back.</p>
              <p>The player is about to undergo surgery to correct a longstanding problem with his right ankle and is expected to miss the start of the Premier League season, which kicks off on August 16. Reports in Portugal claim he could be out for as long as three months.</p>
              <p>It is understood that Ronaldo’s injury has done nothing to cool Real’s interest but United reiterated yesterday that he is “not for sale at any price” and confirmed, despite contrary suggestions, that Real have made no contact with them about a transfer. Claims in the Spanish media that Real had offered £67m, and have been told the winger is theirs if they returned with a bid of £80m, were dismissed by United as “laughable nonsense”.</p>
