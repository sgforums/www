              <div id="yeusp-article-related"><strong>Chief executive David Gill has warned <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> fans to prepare for a "busier than normal" summer in the transfer market.
              <div class="caption"> </div>
              </strong></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With </span><span style="color: #000000;">Edwin van der Sar</span><span style="color: #000000;"> due to follow </span><span style="color: #000000;">Gary Neville</span><span style="color: #000000;"> into retirement, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Paul Scholes</span><span style="color: #000000;"> yet to confirm whether he will extend his career by a further season and major doubts hanging over senior figures such as </span><span style="color: #000000;">Michael Owen</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Wes Brown</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Owen Hargreaves</span><span style="color: #000000;">, changes are inevitable at the Premier League champions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Gary has retired already. Edwin is retiring and Paul has to decide what he wants to do," Gill told MUTV during the annual Manchester United players' awards ceremony at Old Trafford. "We have been working very hard over the course of the last 12 months to plan which positions we need to fill, identifying those players and trying to work on it."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It does appear youngsters </span><span style="color: #000000;">Danny Welbeck</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Tom Cleverley</span><span style="color: #000000;"> will be given their chance after impressing during loan spells with </span><span style="color: #000000;">Sunderland</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and Wigan respectively. However, Gill has given the clearest indication yet that United supporters can expect at least one big-</span><span style="color: #000000;">name</span><span style="color: #000000;"> arrival, and the likelihood is there will be more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"What Alex Ferguson has done very successfully for nearly 25 years is to reinvent the team slowly and integrate them within the established stars," he continued.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"That is what we will continue to do.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"It gives a buzz to everyone at the club when you bring in high quality players. It is something we look forward to with relish."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">United have been heavily linked with Atletico Madrid's 20-year-old goalkeeper </span><span style="color: #000000;">David De Gea</span><span style="color: #000000;">, although it would go against Ferguson's preference for a goalkeeper with great experience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Aston Villa</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s </span><span style="color: #000000;">Ashley Young</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has long been viewed as a potential United target, although more latterly Internazionale playmaker </span><span style="color: #000000;">Wesley Sneijder</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has come into the reckoning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Dutch </span><span style="color: #000000;">World Cup</span><span style="color: #000000;"> finalist would be an obvious replacement for Scholes, whom Gill admitted last weekend might opt to call time on his stellar career after the Champions League final with Barcelona at Wembley on May 28.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> confidently expect to begin their summer transfer business by signing Raphaël Varane from </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Lens</strong></span><strong> in a continuation of their policy to recruit potential stars of the future rather than established category-A players.</strong></p>
              <p>Varane is regarded as one of the outstanding young players in the French game after breaking into the Lens team at the age of 17. Now 18, he was unable to stop them being relegated from Ligue 1 but has been commended for his mature performances after establishing himself in the side over the past two months.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's scouts have been regular visitors to the Stade Félix-Bollaert during that period. Formal talks have opened between the clubs and, subject to a fee being agreed, the deal is described as being very close. Lens initially asked for around £10m for a player who signed a new contract in February to tie him to the club to 2015. United want to pay less and the latest discussions have centred on reaching a compromise and the structure of the payments.</p>
              <p>After that, Varane's advisers have floated the possibility that he could go on loan to another club, possibly Paris Saint-Germain, next season. The player's concern about moving to Manchester is that he will not get many first-team opportunities, but the early feedback from Old Trafford is that Ferguson wants him to get to know the English game.</p>
              <p>Varane, a France Under-21 international who has also represented his country at Under-18 and Under-17 level, is described by the Lens youth-team coach, Eric Assadourian, as a "truly first-class player". Fast, strong and competitive, he stands at 6ft 3in and his ability in the air is reflected in the headed goals he has scored from corners in two of his past three games.</p>
              <p>Varane played those matches as a defensive central midfielder but it is his performances as a centre-half that have brought him to the attention of Ferguson at a time when Rio Ferdinand can no longer be guaranteed to play a full season and Wes Brown is out of contract next summer and contemplating ending his long association with the club.</p>
              <p>As well as Nemanja Vidic, Ferguson also has Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans to provide extra competition for the centre-half places. Yet Ferdinand's recurrent injury issues have meant the 32-year-old is used sparingly these days while Brown, at 31, has played only seven league games this season, not even qualifying for a championship medal.</p>
              <p>In Varane's case, there was a need for United to act quickly, in the knowledge that Arsenal's manager, Arsène Wenger, is also acutely aware of the teenager's emergence. The player has had other offers from France, Spain and Germany and Lens have no appetite for trying to persuade him to stay now they have been demoted to the second tier of French football.</p>
              <p>The fact Varane can also play in a holding midfield role will also appeal to Ferguson, especially as Owen Hargreaves's contract at Old Trafford runs out next month.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has placed particular emphasis on United's scouting network since it became clear the newly crowned champions no longer have the financial muscle to challenge Manchester City and Chelsea in the transfer market. The emphasis now is on identifying young players who can form part of the club's future without necessarily costing vast sums of money. Cristiano Ronaldo is the prime example and, more recently, Smalling is also in that category, costing £10m from Fulham but relatively unknown when the deal was arranged in January last year.</p>
              <p>If everything goes according to plan with Varane, the emphasis will switch back to finding a replacement for Edwin van der Sar. United's interest in David de Gea of Atlético Madrid has cooled a little in the past few months because of his erratic performances and Van der Sar is recommending the club go for the man who has replaced him in the Holland team, Maarten Stekelenburg of Ajax.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson is set to launch a spectacular treble summer transfer splash that could exceed £60million.</strong> </p>
              <p>Ferguson must deal with the retirements of stalwarts Gary Neville and Edwin Van der Sar, and knows Paul Scholes could well follow suit, and wants to replace them with high-profile signings. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The champions are close to landing Atletico Madrid goalkeeper David De Gea</span> after having a £16m bid accepted, and Fergie also wants a high-class attacking midfielder and - to compensate for the potential departure of Michael Owen - another forward. </p>
              <p>Dutch World Cup star Wesley Sneijder is the midfield player he covets the most, and United will not be put off by a possible £30million price tag - though they have other alternatives if his club, Inter Milan, refuse to do business. </p>
              </div>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">The Old Trafford club have watched Napoli's highly-rated Marek Hamsik, and also kept tabs on Everton's England Under-21 star Jack Rodwell, as they look to strengthen an area that has been a concern, given the now strong possibility that Scholes will announce his retirement after the Champions League final next weekend. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">Ferguson has also made discreet enquiries about Karim Benzema, the Real Madrid striker he tried and failed to sign two summers ago and who could be available at the end of the season for a cut-price £20million. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">As ever, the United manager will refuse to stand still despite another successful campaign and has also targeted several youngsters, with Blackburn's Phil Jones and Raphael Varane of Lens - both still in their teens - on his radar.</p>

              <p class="storycopy">Ferguson will sit down with United chief executive David Gill this week to decide the futures of several players in what is likely to prove the biggest squad overhaul at Old Trafford for several years.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Paul Scholes is set to follow Edwin van der Sar and Gary Neville into retirement while Owen Hargreaves has been released after his three-year injury nightmare.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Dimitar Berbatov’s future is uncertain after he was left out of the Champions League final squad, while Michael Owen is out of contract and unlikely to be offered a new one, although he has indicated he would like to stay.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">There are also doubts about the futures of Tomasz Kuszczak, Wes Brown, Darron Gibson, Gabriel Obertan and Bebe.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">United have an £18.3million deal in place for Atletico Madrid keeper David de Gea, although it is understood nothing will be finalised until his contract with his current agent expires on June 30 and he links up with Portuguese ‘super agent’ Jorge Mendes, who represents Jose Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo among others.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">United want Wesley Schneider or Luka Modric as a replacement for Scholes and Ashley Young for Ryan Giggs. Everton midfielder Jack Rodwell is another target while Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley will return from loans at Sunderland and Wigan respectively</p>
