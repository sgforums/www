            <div class='col-md body'>Patrice Evra feels he is finally getting to grips with English football, which he believes will result in more performances like his impressive display against Fulham on Sunday.<br><br>In the 5-1 victory at Old Trafford, the 25-year-old French left-back produced his best showing in a United shirt since arriving from Monaco in January.<br><br>He is single-minded in his ambition to be a regular starter for the Reds. On the evidence of SundayÂ’s performance he will be a valuable member of the squad this season, but he refuses to get ahead of himself.<br><br>"Against Fulham, it was one good game. But I need to keep learning and prove myself in training,Â” he told MUTV. "I know I have to take my chances when they come because Gabby Heinze and Mikael Silvestre are challenging for the same position.Â”<br><br>Evra saw his opportunities limited towards the tail end of last seaso, but that period was part of his acclimatisation to English football. He revealed he has been working hard to adapt his game.<br><br>"I understand English football better now,Â” he explains. Â“In France, when you have the ball you are relaxed. Football in England is very quick and you have to be strong. I go to the gym all the time and I want to be strong in the tackle. I'm learning all the time.Â”<br><br>He is candid about improving his defensive qualities. "Sometimes in France I would do well in my attacking play but not so well defensively,Â” he admits. Â“I want to find a balance - the equilibrium - between defending well and attacking.<br><br>"I want to be a good defender. In France I was attacking all the time. Now I know that I have to defend well first, then attack.<br><br>"All the team are helping me to become a better player by giving me advice. I have to listen. Every day when I wake up I thank god that I am playing for Manchester United.<br><br>Â“My target is to play regularly," he adds. "But it's important I continue to learn and team keeps on winning."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, he is getting better... When SAF first bought him and after watching him &amp; Vidic play, i wondered why did they pay $6m for him? After all, Vidic did play rather well from the start. But after watching the 2 games that he has played so far, I must say he really worth the $6m...<br><br>He has almost got use to the English game now... If you compare him to A. cole, as some would say the best left-back currently, his speed is as fast as cole, his going forward to attack seems better than cole... only thing his defensive part is still lacking compare to Cole...<br><br>Anyway, he has improve alot since he first arrive... and for $6m and salary maybe around 20,000+, he definitely is a good buy when you consider A cole is priced at $25m and salary most lightly 80,000 per week.</div>
