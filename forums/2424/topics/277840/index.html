            <div class='col-md body'>Smudge thanks United fans<br><br>Former Reds striker Alan Smith has paid tribute to United fans for accepting him so readily, despite his deep affiliation with rivals Leeds United.<br><br>The England forward, who departed United for Newcastle this summer after three years at Old Trafford, revealed his disappointment at being unable to say farewell amid the swift nature of his move.<br><br>Smith told The Sun: Â“The only disappointment for me was that I didnÂ’t have a chance to say goodbye to the United fans who were great to me all the time I was there.<br><br>Â“When you consider I came from Leeds and the clubsÂ’ supporters are not exactly the best of friends, it was a big thing for them to accept me the way they did.<br><br>Â“They knew Leeds were the team IÂ’d always supported but they never held it against me. I still have a lot of friends at Old Trafford and will be looking out for their results."<br><br>Smith also revealed that, since leaving United, he has received a letter from Sir Alex Ferguson thanking him for his contribution to the club.<br><br>"I must have done something right when I was there for the manager to take the time to send me a message like that," said Smith.<br><br>"I was really pleased to get the letter. He thanked me for my contribution to Manchester United and told me what a difficult decision it was to sell me.<br><br>Â“I understand that. There are no hard feelings. But IÂ’ve been lucky to move from one big club to another and, hopefully, I can help bring some silverware to Newcastle after so many years without a trophy."</div>
