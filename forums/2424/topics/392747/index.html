              <p>Manchester United biss Sir Alex Ferguson insists he is ready to let Owen Hargreaves take the next step on his road to recovery.</p>
              <p>Hargreaves was due to play in a reserve team encounter with Manchester City last night and end a near-18 month absence following a double knee operation.</p>
              <p>But United officials confirmed on Wednesday night that the England international would not be involved, as it interfered with his training regime.</p>
              <p>It seemed a strange explanation. And Ferguson has clarified the situation, pointing out that Hargreaves in fact went to see a specialist for the latest update.</p>
              <p>However, as the verdict was positive, Ferguson believes an end to Hargreaves' lengthy spell on the sidelines is in sight.</p>
              <p>"Owen went to see a specialist yesterday," said the United boss.</p>
              <p>"There is nothing wrong and the idea is for him to play in the next game.</p>
              <p>"He has to play in the next game because he is ready to play."</p>
              <p>United's reserve side is next due in action on Thursday, when they entertain Burnley at Altrincham's Moss Lane ground.</p>
              <p>However, given this week's events, nothing should be taken for granted until the 29-year-old actually makes an appearance.</p>

              <p>After so long on the sidelines, Owen Hargreaves was elated to be back in action for United Reserves. MUTV's Mark Sullivan caught up with the United midfielder for an exclusive dressing-room chat at Moss Lane after his 45 minute cameo...<br><br><strong>Owen, finally you got onto the pitch... how did it feel?</strong><br>It was lovely to be back in a team environment. It's been about 16 months, I think, while I've been having surgery and individual rehab, so having team-mates around you, getting used to playing on a bigger pitch and having opponents was great. It's been a very long time and it was great to do that first step.</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>It's the first step on the road to recovery, but an important one psychologically to get out on the pitch and play in a competitive match...<br></strong>Absolutely. I don't think I could have anticipated the rehab and the whole thing taking as long as it has. It's been incredibly frustrating but I guess you just have to deal with it, take it step by step, try to be patient and and try to do what's best. Sometimes you can't force things. Today was the first step and hopefully I can kick on from here.</p>
              <p><strong>There's a lot of work you have to do in your rehab, isn't there? A lot of training on your own, lot of fitness work and this hard work is starting to pay off now... can you see light at the end of the tunnel?</strong><br>Well it's been an incredibly long 16 months! I've invested a lot of time and so have a lot of people who have become very close</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>potentially would have expected just to be available for the squad, so I'm looking forward to getting back into a more normal training pattern and hopefully get back to playing some games.</p>
              <p><strong>And you can see by the number of fans that have turned up here tonight how much they want to see you back in a United shirt. That's got to be pleasing for you, to see them?</strong><br>Well the reception has been fantastic. It's been disappointing for me, really. I came and we had a good first season and I came back early to do some training to hopefully be fit for the start of my second season and it just didn't work; it had an adverse affect to it and it just snowballed from there. The fans have been great. Always when they see me they ask when I'm going to be playing and tell me they want to see me play. I've been doing my utmost to be able to play, so I look forward to being able to run out on Old Trafford again in front of the fans and being able to repay the faith the fans have shown.</p>
              <p><strong>So what's the next step for you now?</strong><br>Well I think I'm doing some injections, actually, which is part of my training and part of the whole protocol, so I think we'll try and get as much training in me as possible with this treatment and just continue on as I have. Obviously this was the first step and from here we should try to progress and go further. That's the plan.</p>
              <p><strong>And do you think first team football between now and the end of the season is a possibility for you?</strong><br>I would like to think so, absolutely. That's what I'm aiming for. I'm not to me as well. They've helped me a lot. But it has been a lot more time than I coming back just to be back, I want to come back and have just as much of an impact as I did in my first season. It means a lot to me, so those are my targets and it will happen when time's ready.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>First and foremost we want to see you in a red shirt, but there's a World Cup at the end of the season - is that a realistic possiblity?<br></strong>A lot of people talk about it and it's obviously a topic. You know... we'll just see. I just have to take it day by day. In a perfect world, obviously I'd love to be a part, but I have to do what's best for me, best for Man United and then England. Then we'll see. Obviously it's something I would like to be able to do and I'll just see how I progress in the next month.</p>

              <p><strong>The 29-year-old midfielder, who has undergone double knee surgery since his last competitive outing against Chelsea in September 2008, emerged unscathed from 45 minutes against Burnley reserves at Altrincham’s Moss Lane ground.</strong></p>
              <p>Hargreaves produced an energetic performance before being replaced and, with England’s World Cup opener against the USA just 85 days away, he admits that he is remains hopeful of returning to senior action for club and country this season.</p>
              <p>Hargreaves said: “This was the first step in what has been an incredibly long ordeal and I am very happy to be back.</p>
              <p>"It was nice to play in a match with a referee and proper opponents on a proper pitch!</p>
              <p>“The World Cup? It’s there, but how it will materialise, I don’t know. I’d love to have the opportunity to play again for England, but I’ll have to see how I progress.</p>
              <p>“If I’m there, I’m there. I would love to help."</p>
              <p>Hargreaves is now set to play again for the reserves, again against Burnley, at Accrington next Thursday.</p>
              <p>He said: “Ideally I would like to play as soon as possible for the first-team. That has been my target from day one and I have geared my rehab around that.</p>
              <p>“Obviously it didn’t materialise that way and you have to re-evaluate, but I’m fit and I’ve been training incredibly hard.</p>
              <p>“I’ve missed games and not been able to have an impact, so it’s unfinished business for me.”</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves may never be pain-free despite hitting the comeback trail in the reserves last week.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>After 18 months out of action following major operations on both knees, Hargreaves finally got back on the pitch again last Thursday when he turned out for Manchester United's second string at Altrincham.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old is hoping to build on that 45-minute outing against the same opposition at Accrington on Thursday.</p>
              <p>However, it is not all plain sailing for Hargreaves.</p>
              <p>Renowned Colorado-based surgeon Dr Richard Steadman told the midfielder his knees were in a worse state than he had ever come across in 35 years of practicing.</p>
              <p>And, although Hargreaves has reported a vast improvement, he still experiences discomfort and there is a chance he will never be fully clear of the problem.</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't say I am pain free and I don't know if I can play through it," said Hargreaves.</p>
              <p>"My training has improved over the last weeks and that is a very positive sign for me. I believe that it will continue to improve and progress.</p>
              <p>"But I am still in the process of getting some injections to try to manage the pain because if I didn't have any I would have played at the beginning of the season.</p>
              <p>"It's about training, getting these injections and trying to go forward."</p>
              <p>Having listened to the so-called experts offer their verdict on an injury that first surfaced during his last season at Bayern Munich, Hargreaves managed 25 games during his debut Old Trafford campaign.</p>
              <p>Yet as time progressed, he knew the injury was getting worse. It wasn't until he placed his trust in Steadman, who salvaged the careers of Roy Keane and Ruud van Nistelrooy amongst others in his more regular field of cruciate ligaments, that Hargreaves realised how great the extent of the damage truly was.</p>
              <p>"Tendons are something that a lot of people think they know about, but don't really," he said.</p>
              <p>"My first season at United I had the pain and was able to play through it but basically I shouldn't have been playing.</p>
              <p>"In the end, the pain was just too high and I had to have surgery.</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't wish it on anyone. There were massive operations, very severe, and a lot of the treatments since have been slightly experimental. You have to try what works."</p>
              <p>Even now Hargreaves struggles to explain the exact nature of the problem.</p>
              <p>Far more obvious is the frustration felt by the Calgary-born star, who fulfilled a childhood dream when he joined United three years ago, and appeared to have so much in front of him.</p>
              <p>"It's difficult to describe the pain. It's just pain," he said.</p>
              <p>"At least the surgery did it's job because before the operation my tendons obviously weren't in the greatest condition.</p>
              <p>"I would like to progress from this point even more. Hopefully I will be fit this season, and going forward I will be able to play another six, seven or eight years."</p>
              <p>Merely getting back out on a pitch last week represented a triumph of sorts.</p>
              <p>After all, when you have been out for so long, doubts start to creep in about whether it will ever happen.</p>
              <p>"It is only human to think that way," he admitted.</p>
              <p>"The longest injury before that was when I broke my leg at Bayern Munich and I was out for a couple of months.</p>
              <p>"Football is a physical game and injuries are part of it. But I could never imagine having one that has impacted on me so much.</p>
              <p>"I thought - everyone thought - I would be fit for the start of the season. It didn't materialise.</p>
              <p>"It has been a pretty humbling experience and I am sure many people doubted me, but anybody who knows me, knows that what I set my mind to, I get."</p>
              <p>Judging by Sir Alex Ferguson's forthright reaction to talk of Hargreaves making England's World Cup squad, the latter statement may not be totally accurate.</p>
              <p>Hargreaves does have a plan though, and it goes way beyond Thursday night's reserve game, returning to the first-team, or even going to South Africa this summer.</p>
              <p>He wants to be the player that brought him to United's attention in the first place.</p>
              <p>"I had better get there," he said. "I am not coming back to just be one of the guys and fill a spot.</p>
              <p>"I have never been that way and, if that was case, I would rather walk away.</p>
              <p>"I am coming back to have an impact."</p>
