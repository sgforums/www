              Sir Alex Ferguson is confident he would be able to rely on Jonny Evans if Rio Ferdinand was ruled out of Manchester United's date with Arsenal.
              
              Although X-rays have confirmed Ferdinand did not crack a rib in the Champions League semi-final first leg at Old Trafford on Tuesday, he experienced a lot of discomfort after crashing into Edwin van der Sar and ended up spending the night in hospital after coughing up blood. 
              
              With bruising on his lungs, the 30-year-old has been ruled out of United's trip to Middlesbrough, although Ferguson is confident Ferdinand will be available for the Emirates, when the Red Devils look to defend their slender lead. 
              
              But even if Ferdinand was not available, Ferguson is content that Evans would handle the pressure after figuring in six European games already this term. 
              
              "Jonny has got the temperament and ability," said Ferguson. 
              
              "His record so far for us has been outstanding. 
              
              "He has played against Chelsea twice this season, plus a lot of big European ties, including against Porto, Villarreal and Inter Milan. 
              
              "So he has had the preparation for tomorrow and Tuesday if required." 
              
              Roy Keane was desperate to get the Northern Ireland international back to Sunderland this season, a move Evans would have been happy to make, fearing for his chances at Old Trafford this term. 
              
              As it turned out, the 21-year did not have to worry. 
              
              His late substitute appearance on Wednesday night took him up to 30 appearances for the season. 
              
              Not that there was any chance of Ferguson letting Evans leave anyway. 
              
              The Scot had already accepted the departure of Gerard Pique to Barcelona, a move that has had the remarkable effect of catapulting the Spaniard into first Barca's team on a regular basis and now the national side. 
              
              Ferguson felt Evans boasted similar qualities, so there was no way he would countenance the loss of both men in one summer. 
              
              "We were always aware of Jonny's ability, that is why we turned down big offers for him last year," said Ferguson. 
              
              "There was no way we were letting that boy go. 
              
              "We already had a quality young defender in Gerard Pique, but the circumstances were quite different. 
              
              "Gerard was coming into the last year of his contract and he wanted to move back to Barcelona. 
              
              "He knew Barcelona wanted him and the attraction of going back to his home city team was pretty big - particularly with his family connections. 
              
              "Under the circumstances, there absolutely was no way we could let two outstanding young centre-backs go."
