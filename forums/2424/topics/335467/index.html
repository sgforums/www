              <h1>Ramon Calderon accuses Sir Alex Ferguson of senility in row over Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
              <h2>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has told Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson that he is "going senile" after the Scot recently criticised the Spanish champions once again for their pursuit of Cristiano Ronaldo.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01017/marca_1017684c.jpg" alt="Ramon Calderon accuses Sir Alex Ferguson of senility in row over Cristiano Ronaldo" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In an interview with GQ magazine, Ferguson claimed Gabriel Heinze, who moved from Old Trafford to Madrid for £8m last summer, was simply a pawn in Real's "obscene" hunt of his close friend and former team-mate Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson said: “I knew their bid was coming (for Ronaldo). “When we sold Gabriel Heinze to Real Madrid we knew it was going to happen because Ronaldo was very close to Heinze. I don’t believe they were interested in Heinze, good player though he is.</p>
              <p>"The end game was to get Ronaldo. What made it really obscene was that Madrid, as General Franco’s club, had a history of being able to get whomever and whatever they wanted before democracy came to Spain.”</p>
              <p>Calderon has since claimed Madrid's pursuit of the winger is over <strong>"forever",</strong> and in response to Ferguson's comments, told <em>Marca</em>: "I won't waste time answering him. I admire his history but recently he has gone a bit senile."</p>
              <p>Ferguson has also been insulted by the front cover of Marca, which has a series of pictures depicting the 66-year-old morphing into General Franco, under the headline 'Calderon loses his patience with the "Little Franco of Manchester".</p>
              <p>Calderon's remarks are the second attack on Ferguson in the last 24 hours. Arrigo Sacchi, a former director of football at Real, has suggested it is Ferguson who should take a long, hard look at himself over United's pursuit of Giuseppe Rossi.</p>
              <p>The Italian forward has since been sold to Villarreal, and Sacchi said: "I was surprised when I read about Sir Alex complaining Real are not a gentleman club. "But he was out of order saying Real always get what they want because they are a club who belonged to General Franco.</p>
              <p>"He took Rossi at the age of 16 when he was playing for my club Parma. "We were struggling financially but Sir Alex robbed us. They knew we needed money and help. But they acted in a sneaky way and took our star player."</p>
