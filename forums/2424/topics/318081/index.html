              <p>Wayne Rooney is confident Carlos Tevez will pledge his long-term future to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The Argentina international has indicated he would be keen to stay on at Old
              Trafford when his loan deal expires next year.</p>
              <p>'I don't see why that shouldn't happen,' said Rooney. 'Carlos enjoys
              playing his football here.
              'He's got his wife and child with him, who don't live too far away from me.
              'He's a nice quiet lad who gets on with his job and he's enjoying his
              life.'
              In the space of 12 months Tevez has gone from saving West Ham from relegation
              to winning a Barclays Premier League title with United.</p>
              <p>He has formed a good understanding with Rooney and the respect is mutual ahead
              of the Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow on Wednesday.
              'Carlos is a great player and works really hard for the team.</p>
              <p>I had no doubts
              at all we could play together,' said the England striker.
              'From his first day in training with us, you could see the qualities he had.
              'I couldn't wait to play alongside him.</p>
              <p>He's been brilliant, he's a battler,
              he works so hard for the team - it's been unbelievable.'
              It is a big time in Rooney's life, both professionally and personally as he is
              due to marry Coleen McLoughlin next month.</p>
              <p>Beating Chelsea and getting a winners' medal would be a perfect early gift, he
              admits.
              'Yes, it will make the wedding a bit better,' said Rooney. 'Of course, I'll
              enjoy the summer more if I win.
              'However it wouldn't be unbearable if we lost because you have your football
              and your family life.
              'They are two different things and you can't really let it upset you too
              much.
              'You've still got people there around you and you don't want to be sitting
              around grumpy.
              'When I am with my family, football doesn't get mentioned that much.'</p>
              <p>United retained their Premier League title on the last day and edged out
              Chelsea by two points.
              Rooney is well aware of the threat posed by their league rivals, especially
              when it comes to striker Didier Drogba.
              'He's big, strong, he scores goals - left foot, right foot, headers - at
              times he is unplayable,' said Rooney.
              'Sometimes it seems as if his head's not quite right but when he's at his
              best he's an unbelievable player.
              'I hope it's like a Premier League game, an open game and end to end.
              'If Chelsea go one up it is very difficult to get back at them as they are
              more defensive than us.
              'If we go one up, we'd keep trying to get a second goal. That's the main
              difference between the teams.
              'To win the Champions League on the back of winning the league would be a
              great achievement - we just have to go there to enjoy it.'</p>
