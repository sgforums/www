            <div class='col-md body'>Brazil coach Dunga has given Ryan Giggs the ultimate praise by saying the Welsh winger would grace the Brazilian shirt.<br><br>Giggs showed his class in a 45-minute cameo in Tuesday's 2-0 friendly defeat to Brazil at White Hart Lane.<br><br>And Dunga said: "Any manager in the world would like a player like Giggs in their side, and I am no different.<br><br>"But frankly I wouldn't know where to play him, we have so many good players. If he was Brazilian, it would give me far too many problems."<br><br>Giggs created Wales' best scoring opportunity on Tuesday with a sublime back-heel pass which sent Rob Earnshaw through on goal.<br><br>Earnshaw failed to beat the on-rushing goalkeeper, as Wales' wastefulness in front of goal continued from Saturday's Euro 2008 defeat to the Czech Republic.<br><br>But Giggs said Wales can take heart from their performance against the Brazilians after holding out for an hour before conceding two goals.<br><br>Giggs told BBC Wales Sport: "We got a lot of positives out of the game.<br><br>"It was a chance for us to go out and enjoy ourselves and express ourselves against the best players in the world.<br><br>"We acquitted ourselves well for an hour. The pressure was off so we tired to relax and enjoy ourselves.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ryan outshines Ronaldinho<br><br>Ryan Giggs produced a brilliant 45-minute display for Wales in their friendly against Brazil as he outshone the likes of Ronaldinho and Kaka with a display of experience and guile.<br><br>So good was his performance that it prompted new Brazil coach Dunga to declare the 32-year-old would have no problem commanding a place in the Brazil team. He said: "Any manager in the world would like a player like Giggs in their side, and I am no different.Â”<br><br>Giggs has never played in a major international tournament but, for the first half, he proved Â– if proof was needed Â– that he can mix it with the best.<br><br>The United star played as part of a midfield three, and was the teamÂ’s clear creative influence. He orchestrated numerous clear-cut chances, once in particular when he won possession and then played in Welsh striker Robert Earnshaw with a perfectly weighted and brilliantly disguised backheel.<br><br>Unfortunately, EarnshawÂ’s shot was saved, and when Welsh boss John Toshack decided to take the national skipper off at the break, Brazil turned on the style to eventually run out 2-0 winners thanks to goals from Marcelo and Vagner Love.<br><br>Toshack defended his decision to only give Giggs 45 minutes saying he did not want to overexert the national skipper, mindful of his importance to United at a busy time of the season when the Reds face Tottenham, Celtic and Arsenal inside eight days.<br><br>"Ryan did very well in that company,Â” said Toshack. Â“We decided to give him just 45 minutes, because he had a hard game against the Czechs and he will be involved in the Champions League next week.Â”<br><br>However, Toshack says it was his decision alone, not one enforced by United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. He said: "I have not chatted to Sir Alex about him, I know what to do. Ryan only had a short time against Bulgaria recently as well, it is to our advantage just as much as Manchester United's not to overuse him. We have some big games coming up next month we will want him for.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=360776&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=360776&amp;page=2</a></div>
