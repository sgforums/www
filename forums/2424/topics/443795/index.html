              <p><span>Keane lambasted Fergie's flops after they dropped out of the Champions League to FC Basle, but the United boss was quick to hit back at Keane's management record.</span></p>
              <p><span>The former United skipper - who left Old Trafford in 2005 - also revealed his former employers threatened to take legal action against him in April 2008. </span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen7588" class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item"><span>The move came after Keane criticised the club following his move to Celtic which in turn led to him snubbing the 25th anniversary celebrations of Sir Alex's tenure in charge.  </span><br></div>
              </div>
              <p><span>'I couldn't have gone and sat there like everything was great,' he told <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sunday Times.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span>'He (Ferguson) would come and we all stand up and clap, I couldn't have done that.'</span></p>
              <p><span>He continued: 'You could question every pundit's managerial skill in relation to his and come up short. </span></p>
              <p><span>'But I would also say that without players like myself, maybe he wouldn't have such a good managerial record because … it's soon forgotten that we put bodies on the line for him.'</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Keane also accused Ferguson of failing to stand by him following his abrupt exit from the club in 2005.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'People say he stood by me in difficult times. but (he didn't) when I was 34, not when I was towards the end and had a few differences with Carlos Queiroz.</span></p>
              <p><span>'All of a sudden then "Off you go, Roy, and here's the statement we've done".'</span></p>
              <p><span>Keane claimed United 'got what they deserved' after they crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage earlier this month.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson then hit back at his former skipper's damning assessment. The unimpressed United manager said: 'He had an opportunity to prove himself as a manager too. It is a difficult job.'</span></p>

              <p>He is still bitter over his sacking and upset Fergie siding with assistant manager rather than with him a senior player.</p>
              <p>Anyway, his managing skills is still a long way from the average joe. While fergie blast his players at times, he aso care and protect them against the outside world. Keane seems like he only use threats, anger and bullying... and it seems he likes to hang the youngsters out to dry whenever things are not going well. Like this no player will even be loyal to him.</p>
              <p>Imagine this guy once criticized Ronaldo, Fletcher and a few others... This guy will never groom a youngster into a star.</p>

              <p>well, Keano is never afraid to voice his opinions.</p>
              <p>And his opinions about how MUFC faring poorly in the UCL and how talks about the young guns performing hits the mark. However, not at the right time, when MUFC is licking his wounds.</p>
              <p>Seemingly, SAF protecting his team, lashes back esp at Keano's managerial career.</p>
              <p>Well, it takes both hands to clap.  Keano would have been a fanastic player, but without SAF, he would have won nothing, and vice versa.</p>

              <p><br>I wouldn't agree that without Keane, Fergie wouldn't have won anything either that part... Fergie's United started winning even before Keane arrived.</p>
              <p>If there were anyone more qualified to speak, it's Cantona and definitely not Keane. Now complaining about putting bodies on the line for him is even more ridiculous when he was paid handsomely over the years to play. Had he not done so, he would have lost his place in the team to someone else so he was also doing it for himself.</p>
              <p>The club treated him well and rewarded him too when he refused to sign a new deal until they made him their first 100 thousand pound per week player. Now he is sticking his foot in everytime an opportunity arises to put the club down. </p>
              <p>This guy is an opportunist, I can still remember well during the early Ronaldo transfer rumours, he was the only one urging Ronaldo to leave... saying things like the club only treat you like a piece of meat and will get rid of you when they don't need you anymore kind of stuff... From that moment on, I know this guy is and knowing his character, will remain bitter for a long time to come. And to think Fergie still helped him during his first managerial job at Sunderland by loaning and giving him first option to United's players... What an ingrate who is so full of himself even till today when he is no longer playing...</p>

              <p>he is entitled to his own opinions, whether that reflect reality is another issue.</p>
              <p>we all know the history of keane, dun we. he ended the career of that norwegian player (what was his name, already long forgotten) in the late 90s for revenge for accusing keane of play acting when he broke his knee.</p>
              <p>hahaha this is a classic I remembered in 1991, when he was called up by Jack Charlton, republic of ireland manager for the first time to the squad. the whole squad was waiting for keane to board the team coach and he was very late. Jack asked him why was he late when all are waiting for him to go to the airport to catch a flight. his answer was, I didnt asked you to wait for me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p class="storycopy">Keane, who had watched a game at the DW Stadium only weeks before, even offered to buy a season ticket on the spot, but after giving the turnstile operator “a bit of lip” security was called.<br><br>Former Manchester United captain Keane – out of work since being sacked by Ipswich – says he has started to go to weekend matches to lessen his agitation at being at a loose end on Saturday afternoons.<br><br>He chooses to watch games incognito at Wigan because he does not want to<br>go to Old Trafford following his rift with Sir Alex Ferguson and also because he would be recognised.<br><br>He said: “I was down to Wigan four weeks ago, when they played Blackburn. Wigan’s a good club for me because there are generally spare seats in the far stand, away from the main one.<br><br>“Dressed in jeans, cap over my ears, scarf over my chin, I went to the woman at the window and said, ‘Can I buy a ticket?’</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“She said, ‘Can I have your details?’ I said, ‘Do you have to?’ and she then said it was OK and I handed over my £20, got my ticket.<br><br>“Good value, I thought. Watched the game, enjoyed it, pie at half-time, six goals, no one recognised me, didn’t have to make small talk, good day.”<br><br>But when Keane returned to the same ticket window and the same woman for the Arsenal game two weeks later, he ran into problems.<br><br>“With my cap and scarf, she didn’t know who I was,” he said. “‘Listen, I was here two weeks ago and bought a ticket then, can I buy one now?’<br><br>“She said this was a different category game and she needed my details. I gave my name and address.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“‘You’re not on the system,’ she said. “‘I know,’ I said. ‘But I bought a ticket two weeks ago and you said it was OK’.<br><br>“‘That was for Blackburn,’ she said. ‘OK,’ I said, ‘I’ll buy a season ticket’.<br><br>“She said it wasn’t possible. ‘You’re not on the system’. And I said, ‘I think your club is £37million in debt and you don’t want my money’.<br><br>“I did give her a little bit of lip and she said she would call security. ‘Call them,’ I said. The security guy came along and put his hands on my arm.<br><br>“‘Get your hands off me,’ I said. He did.<br><br>“I strolled back to my car and drove home.”<br><br></p>
