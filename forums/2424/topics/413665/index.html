              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/wayne-rooney?cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> has signed a new five-year contract with Manchester United, ending speculation about his future.</p>
              <p>It brings to an end an amazing ten days of claim and counter claim coming out of Old Trafford which began with Rooney refuting manager Sir Alex Ferguson's claim that he was suffering from an ankle injury and seemed set to culminate with the player being sold in January.</p>
              <p>After 24 hours of high-level talks between the player's representatives, Sir Alex Ferguson, chief executive David Gill and the Glazer family, Rooney has decided to stay with the club and immediately penned a new deal through to 2015.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney said: "I'm delighted to sign another deal at United. In the last couple of days, I've talked to the manager and the owners and they've convinced me this is where I belong. I said on Wednesday the manager's a genius and it's his belief and support that have convinced me to stay.</p>
              <p>"I'm signing a new deal in the absolute belief that the management, coaching staff, board and owners are totally committed to making sure United maintains its proud winning history - which is the reason I joined the club in the first place.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure the fans over the last week have felt let down by what they've read and seen. But my position was from concern over the future. The fans have been brilliant with me since I arrived and it's up to me through my performances to win them over again."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson tried to explain the situation after a week at the centre of a media storm.</p>
              <p>"It's been a difficult week, but the intensity of the coverage is what we expect at Manchester United," said the United boss. "I said to the boy that the door is always open and I'm delighted Wayne has agreed to stay. "Sometimes, when you're in a club, it can be hard to realise just how big it is and it takes something like the events of the last few days to make you understand. I think Wayne now understands what a great club Manchester United is. "I'm pleased he has accepted the challenge to guide the younger players and establish himself as one of United's great players. It shows character and belief for what we stand for.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure everyone involved with the club will now get behind Wayne and show him the support he needs to produce the performances we know he is capable of."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>what a U-Turn by Rooney. I am wondering what makes him change his decision in a matter of days, after saying united ambitions does not match his. so how much was he offered? was he and his agent playing a game of brinkmanship, to see and test the reactions of the board and the fans and ultimately offering him a higher package?so its a game of bluff, I suppose. I think united may be offering him somewhere between 140k to 160k a week. what do you guys reckon?</p></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><p>After all these,i thought...the negative statement he made may be a ploy by his notorious agent..read around that football players' agents are one $ face lot especially the one Rooney has engaged.Another surprise is this is definitely the FIRST time we see ferguson surrender to player power...maybe he's desperate.Players like Keane RVN stam beckham crossed the line as off the wind they go,but looking at the seriousness of this saga,its defnitely a big surprise that this guy is allowed to stay on in the club amid all the revelations we've seen for this week.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney has agreed a new 5 year contract to stay at Manchester United until at least June 2015.<br></strong><br>The agreement follows intensive discussions between the Club and the player’s representatives and means that by the end of his contract Wayne will have been a Manchester United player for 11 years.</p>

              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Cheshire police were called to Wayne Rooney's house on Thursday night to break up a demonstration which included a banner reading 'If you join City you die'.</p>
              <p>Around 30 Manchester United supporters, many hooded and wearing balaclavas, stood outside Rooney's Prestbury home and invited the player to come out.</p>
              <p>When he declined, they unveiled a banner reading 'If you join City, you're dead' as he watched from an upstairs window.</p>
              <p>Police soon arrived at the scene and the crowd dispersed but no arrests were made</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>United later sent their own private security team, who arrived in stab vests, to stand guard after the protesters had left.</p>
              <p>A Cheshire Police spokesperson said: "Cheshire Police can confirm that at 8.30pm today a call was received from a resident in Prestbury regarding 20 to 30 people assembling outside the address.</p>
              <p>"Officers attended the scene and the group dispersed peacefully, no offences were committed."</p>
              <p>The demo has been linked to the so-called Manchester Education Committee, who led a similar protest at Rio Ferdinand's house during his protracted contract talks in 2004.</p>

              <div class="small bold">STAYING ... Wayne Rooney has handed Alex Ferguson a boost by pledging his future to Manchester United</div>
              <p><br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED boss Alex Ferguson has revealed that Wayne Rooney has apologised to him and his team-mates.</h2>
              <p>Rooney performed a sensational U-turn earlier today by agreeing a new five-year deal to <strong>STAY</strong> at Old Trafford — just two days after announcing he would quit the club.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old's decision ends one of the most amazing weeks in United's history, which started with hints at unrest and included Rooney's own concerns about the club's ambition.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson said: "The impact and the response about how big Manchester United has resonated with Wayne quite a lot.</p>
              <p>"He had second thoughts and apologised to me this morning — and the players.</p>
              <p>"We've all been hurt by events, but it shows a quality to say sorry and realise he's made a mistake.</p>
              <p>"I admire that in young people. Now we have to put it behind us, get him back on that pitch and playing the way he can.</p>
              <p>"It's a message to all our fans we are the biggest club in the world."</p>
              <p>Only yesterday, it seemed unthinkable that Rooney would change his mind and stick with the team he joined from Everton in a £26million deal in 2004.</p>
              <p>But after crunch talks with the United hierarchy, Rooney has been persuaded to extend his contract — which will expire in June 2015.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: "It's been a difficult week, but the intensity of the coverage is what we expect at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"I said to the boy that the door is always open and I am delighted Wayne has agreed to stay.</p>
              <p>"I am pleased he has accepted the challenge to guide the younger players and establish himself as one of United's great players.</p>
              <p>"It shows character and belief in what we stand for.</p>
              <p>"I am sure everyone involved with the club will now get behind Wayne and show him the support he needs to produce the performances we know he is capable of."</p>
              <p>Rooney recognises damage has been done, with team-mates Patrice Evra, Darren Fletcher and Nemaja Vidic all criticising his actions.</p>
              <p>And United supporters will also need to be won over after thousands bombarded internet message boards and radio stations to vent their fury at his behaviour earlier this week.</p>
              <p>Rooney also understands the need to improve his form, which has suffered so badly since he sustained an ankle injury against Bayern Munich in March, the last time he scored a goal for his club in open play.</p>
              <p>He said: "I am delighted to sign another deal at United.</p>
              <p>"In the last couple of days, I have talked to the manager and the owners and they have convinced me this is where I belong.</p>
              <p>"I said on Wednesday the manager is a genius and it is his belief and support that have convinced me to stay.</p>
              <p>"I am signing a new deal in the absolute belief that the management, coaching staff, board and owners are totally committed to making sure United maintains its proud winning history - which is the reason I joined the club in the first place.</p>
              <p>"I am sure the fans over the last week have felt let down by what they have read and seen.</p>
              <p>"But my position was from concern over the future.</p>
              <p>"The fans have been brilliant with me since I arrived and it's up to me through my performances to win them over again."</p>

              <p>what a U-Turn by Rooney. I am wondering what makes him change
              his decision in a matter of days, after saying united ambitions
              does not match his. so how much was he offered? was he and his
              agent playing a game of brinkmanship, to see and test the reactions
              of the board and the fans and ultimately offering him a higher
              package?so its a game of bluff, I suppose. I think united may be
              offering him somewhere between 140k to 160k a week. what do you
              guys reckon?</p>
