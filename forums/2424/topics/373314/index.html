              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United midfielder Anderson has been told he can quit Old Trafford after a furious bust-up with Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian star left Fergie fuming after reacting badly to his failure to make the starting line-up for the Community Shield defeat by Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The Scot was so angry he later confronted Anderson over his actions and was stunned by the 21-year-old’s refusal to back down.</p>
              <p>Anderson insisted he was good enough to be in the team and was frustrated at being overlooked, with rookie Darron Gibson taking his place in the squad. And with the Brazilian international claiming he would prefer to quit rather than sit on the sidelines, Ferguson is willing to grant him his wish.</p>
              <p>Anderson’s flare-up has seen him barely feature this season. He played 59 minutes stuck out on the left wing in the defeat at Burnley and hardly made an impact. He didn’t even make the bench for the 5-0 win over Wigan, with Gibson being handed the job of shoring up the centre of midfield when Paul Scholes tired.</p>
              <p>The row is a major blow to Ferguson who hoped the former Porto star would mature into a key player this season. But having seen his close pal Cristiano Ronaldo leave for Real Madrid in the summer, Anderson could soon be following him out of the Old Trafford door.</p>
              <p>United paid nearly £18m for Anderson in May 2007 after Ferguson’s scouts told him the midfielder was one of the best prospects around.</p>
              <p>He fired one of the shoot-out penalties in the 2008 Champions League final win over Chelsea after coming on as a sub, and started the defeat by Barcelona in last season’s competition, but he now faces an uncertain future.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><strong><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United </span></strong><strong>midfielder Anderson been told to work harder in training by manager Sir Alex Ferguson but has stressed that he wants to stay and fight for his first team place.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The young Brazilian has only started one game so far this season - the defeat to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/burnley.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Burnley</span></a> last week - and clashed verbally with </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> after being left out of the team for the Community Shield against<span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Chelsea</span> at Wembley. It is understood that </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> had not been enthused about </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Anderson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">'s pre-season training, something the 21-year-old has now vowed to put right. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Anderson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> told Sportsmail: ‘I believed that I would play in the Community Shield but that is forgotten now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I thought that, without Cristiano Ronaldo around, I could to play more and that has been my challenge from pre-season onwards. But the coach decides the teams and to discuss this with him is foolish because he is the chief. I do not want to leave United. No.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘Sir Alex Ferguson has demanded a bigger effort from me and I accept that. Because to get in to this United team is very complicated and difficult for any player.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/25/article-0-061D1D12000005DC-819_468x432.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="432"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p class="imagecaption" style="margin: auto 0cm;"><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Managerial decision: Sir Alex Ferguson clashed with Anderson after he left the Brazilian out of the Community Shield against Chelsea</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p class="imagecaption" style="margin: auto 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br> </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Anderson is not the only player to experience the flipside of Ferguson's rotation policy, though, as players like Michael Carrick and Michael Owen have been used sparingly so far. </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Anderson</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> added: ‘I do not have a problem with </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> although it is normal that I want more minutes on the field. I never have asked for explanations, though. </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> knows each player and he knows what to do.’</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">United's defensive problems have worsened this week as Jonny Evans has been unable to train due to an ankle problem. With Rio Ferdinand already out of Saturday's big Barclays Premier League game with Arsenal at Old Trafford, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was hopeful that Evans would be able to struggle on with a problem that has bothered him for the last month.</span></p>

              <p>hmm...its quite impossible to get them, but I will name them anyway. </p>
              <p>Essien, Pirlo, Wesley Sneider, Daniele De Rossi, Jermaine Jenas, Xavi.</p>
              <p>Among them can get Jenas from Spurs realistically speaking.</p>

              <p>Don't think Jenas deserves to be mentioned in that bunch.</p>
              <p>He's just like Carrick. Goes about doing his job, puts in average performances...nothing more, nothing less and occassionally scores an important goal.</p>
