            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United wing ace Cristiano Ronaldo says he'll continue introducing new tricks to his game.<br><br>Ronaldo told the Daily Mail: "I was born with my ability. The stepover, for example, is something I did as soon as I started in my first teams. I used to play football on the street when I was a boy, and every day I tried to do different things.<br><br>"I always tried to invent new dribbles, new moves. Things would come into my mind and I'd try them. I think this attitude stayed. I always looked to have my own identity. That was my dream.<br><br>"The tricks came with me. I didn't watch football on television. But, of course, other players inspire you. I used to go to watch my cousins and brothers, and sometimes I would try and do the same things as them. My father was a kit man for the local club; I was always with him, watching the matches.<br><br>He added: "I wasn't always big. Even when I left Madeira at 13 I remember people saying I couldn't become a professional because I was too short. Then, suddenly, between 15 and 18 I jumped up and became as tall as I am now.<br><br>"But in the days playing in the street, it was always against older, much bigger, boys. I suffered because I had good ability and I dribbled a lot, suddenly I'd be pushed or tackled hard and I was out of the game. Sometimes when I tricked them, they didn't like it. They beat me sometimes.<br><br>"But it never stopped me being the player I am. I've always had a strong personality, because when a defender tackles you hard or challenges you mentally, you can't show weakness. You have to try and get over it and beat them with the ball."<br><br>Ronaldo has more end-product to his skills now, too.<br><br>"Nowadays it doesn't matter what tricks I do, they have to be of use to the team.<br><br>"If you want to be one of the best players in the world, which I want to, you have to learn all the time. Another thing I have to do is finish better and get more goals. If you are a good scorer people see you in a different dimension. In a couple of years, if I'm scoring more, people will think better of me."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is very good with his bag of tricks oreadi and I felt he could have practice more on his final passing/delivery of the ball instead. Also, if he has the opportunity to shoot, get on to it.<br><br>In the last match against AC Milan, KaKa &amp; Ronaldo represented some of the best players out there... and the main difference between the two?... KaKa grabbed his scoring chances well. He din dwell too much on the dribbling, he shoots when he sees a opening.</div>
