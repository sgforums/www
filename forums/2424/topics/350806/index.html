              <p>Manchester
              United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted that he has become
              frustrated by the growing speculation that Argentine striker Carlos
              Tevez will be leaving the club in the summer.<br> <br> The Red Devils boss also stated that all the talk regarding Tevez's future has been blown all out of proportion.<br> <br> Tevez
              arrived at Old Trafford on a two-year loan deal, after a permanent deal
              was deemed to complicated to sort out with Tevez's owner, Kia
              Joorabchian.<br> <br> However, the idea that Tevez would sign a permanent
              deal with the Red Devils has come seriously under threat this season,
              with the Argentine's cries for regular first team football falling on
              deaf ears with the United hierarchy.<br> <br> The club have failed to
              agree personal terms or a deal with his third party owners, and it is
              now believed that Tevez will leave the club in the summer when the loan
              deal runs out.<br> <br> However, Ferguson is adamant that the 25-year-old
              striker remains in his future plans for the club and has defended his
              decision to rotate the squad, which he feels is necessary as he has so
              many world class players at his disposal.<br> <br> Speaking to <em>L'Equipe</em>, Ferguson said, <span class="main-content">"The Tevez thing, it is a media story.<br></span><br> "As he is not our player, everything that goes on with him is analysed on this premise.<span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"It's good for papers to say Tevez isn't playing. But when it is
              (Michael) Carrick, (Darren) Fletcher, (Ryan) Giggs or (Paul) Scholes,
              nobody could care less.</p>
              <p>"I have 23 players. Up front, I must choose between Tevez, (Wayne)
              Rooney, (Cristiano) Ronaldo, (Dimitar) Berbatov, Nani, Park Ji-sung,
              Giggs, Scholes and some youngsters.</p>
              <p>"You can't play them all together.</p>
              <p>"Players like Tevez, Rooney and Ronaldo are still progressing. For me, a player reaches maturity at 26-27."</p>
              <p>Tevez has made 53 Premier League appearances since his move from
              West Ham United nearly two years ago, and has helped the club pick up
              two league titles and a Champions League trophy in his time at Old
              Trafford.</p>
