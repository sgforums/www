            <div class='col-md body'>a comprehensive win.<br><br>damn unlucky on the injury front. saha out, vida out, oshea out. i can't wait for hargo to return fast enough. and g.neville, but if simpson continues to play like this, he could well be the successor to neville.<br><br>pique is an excellent prospect, we should let him develop further.<br><br>Simpson actually played pretty well. good cross in.<br>Pique too. Coupled with eagles, i guess these are the players who could actually have a future at united, but will not be guaranteed first XII places.<br><br>anderson has regained his confidence. He tackles, gave brilliant passes, has got pace and trickery and could finish. He is actually a good players, who is just lacking cnofidence and match-fitness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>and i actually thought rooney &amp; tevez deserved their goals for the effort they've put in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im really in awe of how this match really showcased our unpolished diamonds with the likes of Pique and Simpson. Simpson's surging runs really aided United in pressing on , pressurizing Wigan who were like playing 10 men behind the ball. Maybe people like him and Neville is what we had missed..Continue playing like this and we wont have to look elsewhere for Neville's successor alrdy..I really hope he can play in the coming few matches instead of Brown.<br><br>Think Pique next few matches starting alongside Ferdinand too if Vida's injury need some time to recover from...Any idea when VDS returning?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was most impress with Anderson in this match. He finally show signs of what a good player he will be... His tackles and ball winning style looks like Roy Keane and his vision to spot players in forward position and sending a through ball in remind one of a younger Paul Scholes... I belief if given time, his confidence will start to influence the whole of united's team... And he will be better than Gunner's Fabregas once he start playing more games... His ball controlling skills is also better than Fabregas and he has a stronger upper body too compare to Fabregas... After all, this was only his 3 game for United i think... and gunner's Fabregas has been playing for like 2 seasons already... A great player he will be... can equally defend and attack well.</div>

"We speeded the game up in the second half, the flow of the game was much better. It's coming together."<br><br><strong>Wigan manager Chris Hutchings:</strong><br><br>"We had a game plan which worked well in the first half. "But as as soon as they scored the first goal they upped the tempo and they could have scored a couple more. "It's always difficult but while it's 1-0 you have always got a chance.

Look at Vidic and Evra... They took about that long and today they are regular first team players. Tevez is beginning to look like his great West Ham form... Anderson and Nani will come good given time since they came from another league altogether.</div>
