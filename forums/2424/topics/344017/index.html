              <p><strong>Ryan Giggs has emerged as an ambitious target for Cardiff City.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United legend was outstanding in his side's 3-0 win
              over Chelsea on Sunday and has reinvented himself as a central
              midfielder after years of patrolling the left flank at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Although he is out of contract at the end of the season, there is
              every likelihood that United's record appearance-maker will see his
              deal extended as part of the rolling agreement he has with Sir Alex
              Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Cardiff have reportedly discussed the prospect of bringing the Wales icon to Ninian Park during the close season.</p>
              <p>It is difficult to imagine the 35-year-old ever representing another club but City are lining up a possible player-coach bid.</p>
              <p>"The fact people are prepared to believe we are capable of signing a
              player like Ryan Giggs does go to show how far Cardiff City has moved
              forward in recent years," chairman PeterÂ Ridsdale told The South Wales
              Echo.</p>

              <h1>Giggs Refuses To Rule Out Cardiff City Switch</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United's Welsh wizard is certainly open to the prospect of going 'home' soon.</h2>
              <p>Despite his Manchester accent, Ryan Giggs is a true Welshman who was
              born in the nation's capital, Cardiff. As his current Manchester United
              deal nears its end in the summer, Giggs hasn't ruled out concluding his
              illustrious career with his home-town club - as United's willingness to
              offer him a new deal is far from certain at this stage.</p>
              <p>Giggs has admitted to having a soft spot for the Bluebirds, but does not want to commit himself to anything concrete just yet.</p>
              <p>"I always look at Cardiff City's results because they are my home-town team," he told the <em>South Wales Echo</em>.</p>
              <p>"I'd like them to be in the Premiership. I have been asked many
              times whether I would play for my home-town team, although I don't know
              what the future holds for me.</p>
              <p>"My contract ends in May so we will see. At the moment there have not been any talks on a new deal."</p>
              <p>Cardiff today signed dashing attacker Chris Burke from Rangers, as
              they look to build a side that can at last mount a successful bid for
              promotion to the Premier League from the Championship. Their chairman,
              former Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, thinks that it is a measure of
              the club's startling progress that they are even linked with a player
              of Giggs's stature.</p>
              <p>"The fact people are prepared to believe we are capable of signing a
              player like Ryan Giggs does go to show how far Cardiff City has moved
              forward in recent years," said Ridsdale.</p>

              <p><strong>Ryan Giggs will be handed a new Manchester United contract in the wake of his man-of-the-match display against Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>Giggs, 35, is out of contract in June and had feared his glittering United career would come to an end. But Mirror Sport has learned that United are ready to hand Giggs an extension to keep him at Old Trafford until the end of the 2010 campaign.</p>
              <p>A United insider said: "Ryan will definitely be offered a new deal. He has kept himself in fantastic shape for a player of his age and he has proved that he still has a great deal to offer, with his wealth of experience."</p>
