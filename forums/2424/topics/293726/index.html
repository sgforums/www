            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Forward thinking</strong><br><br>Sir Alex faces a selection headache as United welcome Sporting Lisbon to Old Trafford on Tuesday.<br><br>"I'll make one or two changes," the Reds' manager told Manchester United Radio ahead of the game. "Players like Darren Fletcher and John O'Shea need some minutes on the clock but my biggest concern is what to do up front.<br><br>"Louis Saha played a full game on Saturday, his first full 90 minutes since last December. That was a big test for him. It was an awful lot to ask of him but we're delighted he got through the game."<br><br>Ferguson must now decide whether to call upon the Frenchman for a second time in four days. The only other fit first-choice striker, Carlos Tevez, has also been put through a punishing schedule in the last week, travelling to South America and back for Argentina's World Cup qualifiers.<br><br>At this stage, Sir Alex may not be sure who'll play up front on Tuesday night, but he does know Sporting Lisbon will be tough opponents.<br><br>"Sporting will come to win," Sir Alex said. "They have to win in order to catch Roma. We have to make sure we're on top of our game and use the atmosphere we know we can generate at Old Trafford. We have an opportunity to ensure we finish top of the group so we must take that chance."<br><br></div>

And in doing that, it gives the ball the uneven motion when travelling goalwards..<br><br>is that true? </div></blockquote>yea true.<br><br>although we cannot see the valve from here, just notice the paintwork on the ball or how they place the ball during a spot kick.</div>
