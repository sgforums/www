He is even willing to buy the Wales international and loan him back to the Championship side until the summer.<br><br>Saints chief executive Jim Hone said: Â“We have turned down an Â£8m package for Gareth.Â” The defender, WalesÂ’ youngest-ever cap, is also wanted by Tottenham and Arsenal but favours a move to Old Trafford to link with boyhood hero Ryan Giggs.<br><br>Southampton are holding out for Â£10m and have offered the youngster an improved Â£4,000-a-week contract to stay. Saints boss George Burley insists he is under no pressure to sell.<br><br>Burley said: Â“Gareth will certainly be here until the end of the season, hopefully longer.Â” Free-kick specialist Bale has scored five goals in 28 games since making his Southampton debut at 16 last year.<br></div>

Ferguson has admitted United's preference to do a deal with Southampton based on Bale's future progression could count against them.<br><br>"The bid we made for Gareth reflected his potential. There were a series of build-ups in it because we have to protect our own club's assets too," admitted Ferguson. "We offered an initial fee with add-ons depending on how many games he plays, international caps and so on."<br><br>But Ferguson has not given up hope of landing Bale and insisted he was not frightened by the staggering sums now being spent on emerging talent. "Anyone who guarantees a player first-team football every week is wrong," he said.<br><br>"There are so many examples of young players being given a chance at this club, no-one could dispute the fact they will get opportunities. Maybe the boy himself would need to assess that. "When you are talking about signing young players with potential, you hope your decision-making and your assessment of the player is correct."<br><br></div>
