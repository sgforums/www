              <p><strong>Real Madrid defender Gabriel Heinze believes it would be difficult for the Spanish giants to prise Cristiano Ronaldo away from Manchester United while Sir Alex Ferguson is still in charge at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>Media speculation in Spain continues to link the newly-crowed Primera Liga champions with Ronaldo, who has enjoyed a remarkable season with the Red Devils, who could yet complete a Premier League and Champions League double.</p>
              <p>But while the Spanish press might be optimistic about a successful swoop for Ronaldo, Heinze, who knows the Portugal winger well from his time at United, is less convinced about his former team-mate moving to the Bernabeu anytime soon.</p>
              <p>"I talk with him (Ronaldo) all the time and I tell him how great this club is and the nice things that Madrid has, but I know that is very difficult for him to come because he has a coach who had trust in him when he was younger," Heinze told Radio Marca.</p>
              <p>"Whilst Ferguson is at United it is very difficult. He is a fundamental part of their plans."</p>

              <h1 class="art-headline">We'll sign Cristiano Ronaldo for £100m, boast Real Madrid</h1>
              <h2 class="art-byline">By Martin Lipton <a title="View other stories for 13 May 2008" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/05/13/"> 13/05/2008</a></h2>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Cristiano Ronaldo's
              Manchester United future was cast into doubt again last night as Real
              Madrid insisted the Portuguese superstar could be ready to leave Old
              Trafford this summer.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">In
              a move guaranteed to infuriate Sir Alex Ferguson, sources at the
              Bernabeu were claiming that Ronaldo's representatives are holding the
              door open for a move.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"We
              are hearing there is still a possibility that Ronaldo will leave
              United," a spokesman at Real said. "Of course, it could still be a case
              of games being played, so that he can get the contract that he wants
              from United."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Ronaldo has
              bridled at the constant speculation and United maintain that no offer
              on earth would tempt them to sell the double Footballer of the Year.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But
              Real insiders are adamant that they have received soundings from
              Ronaldo's representatives that he is having second thoughts over
              committing himself to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">President
              Ramon Calderon is desperate to sign a talismanic player to spearhead
              next season's challenge Champions League challenge.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And
              the Spanish titleholders are ready to pounce by confirming their
              £100million valuation if Ronaldo hints at a desire to move on -
              especially when he is on Euro 2008 duty with Portugal in Switzerland
              and Austria.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">A Bernabeu
              source added: "The suggestion coming from Ronaldo's people is that he
              is not sure United will make good on the promises he has been made, and
              is starting to wonder of there is anything more he can do in England.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"We
              are talking about the best player in the world, who has won consecutive
              Premier League titles and could have won the Champions League as well
              by next week.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"If he is
              looking for the next challenge, then it can only come by leaving
              England and there could be no club better to go to after leaving Old
              Trafford than Real Madrid."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The news will annoy Fergie in the build-up to the Champions League final tomorrow week.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">United
              resume training today with a warning to concentrate on beating Chelsea
              in Moscow "Once we've finished our celebrations, it's the start of
              winning the European Cup," said Fergie.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"We've
              got a great chance against Chelsea. The mood generated by winning the
              title at Wigan sees us in a very confident position."</p>
