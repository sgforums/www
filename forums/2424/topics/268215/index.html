            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Alan Curbishley has hit out at Sir Alex Ferguson over his comments about Carlos Tevez.</strong><br><br>West Ham and Manchester United have found themselves at loggerheads over the controversial transfer of Tevez.<br><br>United are confident of wrapping up a deal for Tevez when he returns from the Copa America even though the wrangle over his ownership continues.<br><br>Ferguson expects the move to be tied up soon and he has upset Curbishley with his comments that Tevez single-handedly kept West Ham up last season.<br><br>Curbishley, who has admitted Tevez is unlikely to link-up with his side for the tour of Austria, has slammed Ferguson's comments as being disrespectful to the rest of the team.<br><br>"I was a bit disappointed with Alex's comments about Tevez keeping us up," Curbishley told the Sunday Express.<br><br>"There were ten other players out there and a lot of them were big performers for us.<br><br>"There was a lot more going on that just Carlos Tevez. Every day has been a Tevez day for the last two months.<br><br>"I have kept my own counsel and got on with it. But I was disappointed to hear Alex say that.<br><br>"I expect we are going to Austria and he is not going to be with us.<br><br>"But please don't keep talking to me about Tevez because there is nothing I can do about it."<br><br>Curbishley also hit out at Yossi Benayoun after the Israeli left Upton Park for Liverpool earlier this week.<br><br>The Hammers chief believes Benayoun was happy to stay at the club until he heard of Liverpool's interest.<br><br>"I was disappointed with Yossi because he had signed a new contract and it turns out he hadn't," added Curbishley.<br><br>"When Liverpool came in for him it changed everything.<br><br>"I didn't want Yossi to go and we didn't need the business."</div>
