            <div class='col-md body'>DAVID BECKHAM has admitted how much he misses Manchester United as his Real Madrid career hangs in the balance.<br><br>Becks, 31, will snub a new two-year contract and head for the Real exit if he is unable to win back his place under boss Fabio Capello.<br><br>Clubs in England, Italy and America are on standby to move for Beckham, who can leave for free at the end of the season when his current deal runs out.<br><br>Beckham, who unexpectedly missed training yesterday, has made it clear he would only return to England if it was to rejoin United.<br><br>Becks knows boss Alex Ferguson would have the final say.<br><br>But he has stepped up the peace process by absolving Fergie for their infamous boot bust-up shortly before he left in 2003.<br><br>He added: Â“It was an accident. IÂ’ve known Ferguson since I was 12-years-old and we have had one or two problems in that time.<br><br>"Maybe he didnÂ’t want me to leave. I donÂ’t think there is any desire on his part for me not to have success. In every way, I hope my luck changes.Â”<br><br>Becks has also revealed his disappointment at how RealÂ’s players hardly mix.<br><br>He added: Â“I have friends Â— Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Michel Salgado Â— but we donÂ’t go out together enough.<br><br>Â“At Manchester I was there 15 years and every day, every match, we were united, win or lose.<br><br>Â“Every 15 days we went out together to dinner with all the players, including times when Ferguson and all the coaches came.<br><br>Â“In the three years IÂ’ve been here we have done that four times.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and given the mood that the team has at the moment, I would gather they build on it. I am unsure how a beckham would add to the equation.<br>not that I doubt him, but just that we may have to alter plays just to accomodate his style given that he is already a molded player.<br><br>however for someone like owenH, he will come in and do all he can to win.<br>I prefer raw passion and determination to succeed.</div>
