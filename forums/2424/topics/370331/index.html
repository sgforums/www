              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Michael Owen insists he has nothing to prove - but believes Sam Allardyce and Dave Whelan may end up "embarrassed" about snubbing him publicly.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>The Manchester United forward was left kicking his heels for a while this summer after leaving Newcastle and appeared likely to end up at Hull or Stoke until Sir Alex Ferguson took him to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Blackburn boss Allardyce and Wigan owner Whelan distanced themselves from a move for the England striker - and Owen, 29, believes they will realise they were wrong.</p>
              <p>"If that was how they were perceiving me, fine, because the greatest accolade I could have is that Sir Alex Ferguson didn't think about that," Owen told FourFourTwo magazine.</p>
              <p>"I can quietly sit here and and look around where I am now - and if anyone else wants to look at what they've said, then they might feel embarrassed. I don't feel I have to impress these people.</p>
              <p>"I only need to prove things to people who believe in me. I want to show Sir Alex was right to believe in me."</p>
              <p>Owen is unfazed about the challenge of filling the gap left by the departures of Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>"The team has lost two players - Tevez, who scored a few, and Ronaldo who got lots over the last two seasons," he said.</p>
              <p>"There's a big hole to fill, and I hope I can help plug it in terms of goals. I can't do it on my own - but I will help out.</p>
              <p>"When you sign for United you get excited about a lot of things. One of them, I hope, is scoring a lot of goals - because I am going to get a lot more chances here than at other teams."</p>
              <p>Owen insists his international ambitions remain stronger than ever as he contemplates next summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p>"My mind's been thinking about that since I was three years old in the back garden, and nothing has changed," he said.</p>
              <p>"Winning the World Cup is the ultimate - it's still my dream."</p>

              <p><strong>Owen blows his chance<br></strong>Fabio Capello spent 80 minutes at Old Trafford and the England coach headed back to London having seen nothing that he did not know already. Wayne Rooney remains his best attacking player going in to World Cup year and Michael Owen and Ben Foster still have something to prove to him. Rooney was at his engaging, feisty best, his mood swaying gently from a little grumpy to rather angry and back again. Whether Owen can do enough to feature in the squad alongside the man with whom he has played 29 times for England remains to be seen. Capello has steadfastly ignored the 29-year-old so far but his pre-season form at his new club had done much to suggest that we may be about to witness the second coming of one of the country's most gifted goalscorers. On his Old Trafford debut - he was less convincing, missing two first-half opportunities and another shortly after half time just three days before the man in the directors' box names his squad for next week's friendly against Holland in Amsterdam. "He should have scored four," said Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. "But his movement was fantastic."<br><em>Ian Ladyman, Daily Mail</em></p>
              <p><em>The Daily Express </em>tips goalkeeper <strong>Ben Foster </strong>to take advantage of <strong>Edwin van der Sar's </strong>enforced absence and stake a claim for regular action with United and England. <em>The Mail</em> echoes this sentiment, claiming he will be fast-tracked into <strong>Fabio Capello's</strong> World Cup plans.</p>
              <p><em>The Guardian</em><strong> </strong>raids the Valencia edition of <strong>United Review </strong>to quote <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson </strong>on the Reds' transfer activity: "Maybe it is the Scotsman in me but I believe in value, even when I am spending someone else's money, and the asking price for players we were looking at just wasn't realistic."</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Bryan Robson is sure Michael Owen can once again form a productive partnership with Wayne Rooney and win his place back in the England side.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Owen is unlikely to be named in Fabio Capello's England squad for next week's friendly with Holland in Amsterdam.</p>
              <p>Although the 29-year-old has looked reasonably sharp in pre-season, Capello did watch him draw a blank against Valencia in midweek and with no competitive action under his belt, the odds are against a call-up.</p>
              <p>However, former England captain Robson feels it is only a matter of time before Owen is selected again, particularly as he is confident both the former Liverpool man and Rooney can benefit from working together at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Four years ago people were raving about Owen and Rooney when they played together, so it would be a real bonus for everybody if they could get going like that again," said Robson.</p>
              <p>"At Newcastle the team were having a bad time, which did not suit Michael's game. He had to keep coming back to the halfway line because the opposition had more possession.</p>
              <p>"At United he will be on the front foot because they always have more of the ball, which just plays to his strengths.</p>
              <p>"His timing and intelligence at finding space is as good as anyone's in the game.</p>
              <p>"If he gets chances, he will score goals and I believe this move gives him a great opportunity to get back into the England squad."</p>
              <p>Aside from the dilemma over Owen, the most interesting aspect of Capello's latest squad will be his goalkeeping trio.</p>
              <p>Robert Green got the job for the less-than-taxing World Cup double-header against Kazakhstan and Andorra, yet there is an argument for the West Ham star not even making the squad this time around.</p>
              <p>David James is Capello's established number one and has now recovered from a shoulder operation, so his selection would appear automatic.</p>
              <p>The same could also be said of Manchester United's Ben Foster, who would almost certainly have been James' replacement had he not been forced to have surgery on a thumb problem.</p>
              <p>It means Green will probably be battling it out with Joe Hart for the third slot.</p>
              <p>Hart was an England regular - making his debut in the friendly win over Trinidad and Tobago in June 2008 - but lost his place when Shay Given arrived from Newcastle to oust him from the Manchester City side.</p>
              <p>However, his loan move to Birmingham is bound to bring him back into contention, even if it would be extremely harsh on Green if he was shunted out at this stage.</p>
