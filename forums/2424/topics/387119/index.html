              <p><strong>The presence of Rafael and then Fabio Da Silva on the United team-sheet in the past five days could be a sign of things to come. <br><br></strong>The first half of the season for both twins was blighted by injury, but their involvement in the Wigan Athletic and Leeds United matches offers encouragement for the year ahead. Rafael scored his second goal for the club in the 5-0 romp against the Latics, while Fabio was arguably one of the Reds' better performers during Sunday's FA Cup defeat.<br><br>"Rafael was outstanding against Wigan and showed fantastic energy and desire," said Sir Alex, in a press conference prior to the Leeds match.<br><br>"We’ve always thought highly of Rafael and his brother. You couldn’t split them in looks or ability – they’re equally good and it's impossible to tell the difference without seeing the numbers on their shorts!</p>
              <p>"Patrice Evra is a terrific example for them, but then again you can’t set Brazilians any targets. There's every possibility they’ll be our first-choice full-backs in five years."<br><br>Rafael and Fabio are now in contention for the Carling Cup semi-final against Manchester City. If they play, they'll be the latest United brothers to appear in a Manchester derby following Gary and Phil Neville in the '90s and Brian and Jimmy Greenhoff in the '70s. <br><br>"It'll be a hard game against City, a local derby with the usual ferocity and intensity," said Sir Alex, previewing Wednesday's first leg at Eastlands. "Hopefully we'll have almost everyone fit by the second leg (on 19 January) and we'll come through."</p>

              <p><strong>Summer signing Antonio Valencia has become the first man to win back-to-back ManUtd.com Player of the Month awards for a year-and-a-half.<br><br></strong></p>
              <p>The Ecuadorian garnered 45 per cent of the vote to top December's poll after also taking home the November award. The last player to win consecutive POTM accolades was Carlos Tevez, in May and August 2008.<br><br>More than 12,000 fans around the world voted in our most recent poll, with nearly half (5586) naming Valencia’s contribution as the most crucial to the Reds’ December form.<br><br>The former Wigan winger added three more goals to his tally during the month, taking his total to seven. He's now scored as many in six months at Old Trafford as he did in three years at Wigan. His first of the month came in the 4-0 demolition of West Ham, where he slotted home from close range. He then put the icing on the cake by firing home the third against Wolves, while his 75th minute strike against Wigan was United’s final goal of 2009.<br><br>As well as goals, he's provided a constant threat on the Reds’ right, consistently outfoxing defenders and proving his ability to whip in an early, deadly cross.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United fans will be hoping for plenty more goals from Antonio as the business end of the season fast approaches.</p>

              <p>reminds me of a certain Russian winger we once had.. Andrei Kanchelskis.</p>
              <p>Do hope that he can developed more for currently, he is a bit one dimensional and seemingly predictable. Not going to be so easy when he faces the big guns in the UCL.</p>
