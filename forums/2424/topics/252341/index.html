            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United's Treble dream is over. Now Ryan Giggs is targeting double glory for the Red Devils.<br><br>United have been given little time to dwell on their dismal Champions League exit in Milan by the Premier League, who rejected a request to put the Manchester derby back by 24 hours.<br><br>Instead, much to Sir Alex Ferguson's disgust, they have forced them to face Manchester City at Eastlands on Saturday lunchtime.<br><br>Ferguson knows he must rouse his team for what could turn out to be a pivotal weekend.<br><br>After extending their lead over Chelsea at the Premiership summit to five points, United know a win over their neighbours will leave Jose Mourinho's men requiring a victory at Arsenal 24 hours later just to keep the championship race alive.<br><br>And Giggs does not believe his team-mates will have any problem lifting their spirits given the stakes are so high.<br><br>"There is still so much to play for," said the Wales captain.<br><br>"The character of the team is being tested but we have shown all season we can bounce back from situations like these.<br><br>"We are greedy. We wanted to win everything this season. We are out of the Champions League now, so we have to try and win the double.<br><br>"The City game was always going to be a big one, no matter what the result was against Milan.<br><br>"But obviously, there is more emphasis on it now because we have to go there and try to get a positive result to put pressure on Chelsea for Sunday.<br><br>"If we can do that, we will be a lot closer to winning the league. We still have the FA Cup to come as well, so there is an awful lot still to play for."<br><br>Having lost on three of their last four visits to City, United will be taking nothing for granted.<br><br>However, with their opponents still reeling from Joey Barton's training ground attack on Ousmane Dabo which has seen the England international suspended and knowing City have failed to score a league goal on home soil since New Year's Day, it would be a major surprise if United were to slip up now.<br><br>Alan Smith is expected to earn a recall, as is Rio Ferdinand, who remained on the bench throughout Wednesday's 3-0 defeat at the San Siro as Ferguson took a calculated risk on the fitness of Nemanja Vidic.<br><br>Former United boss Tommy Docherty branded Ferguson's decision to hand Vidic a starting spot 'a disaster'.<br><br>Yet Ferguson is adamant placing his trust in the Serbian, who broke a collarbone against Blackburn on March 31, was the right move.<br><br>"There was an element of risk but I could not play both Nemanja and Rio and the lesser risk, without question, was Vidic," said Ferguson.<br><br>"I have to take the long view and hopefully, we now have Rio available until the end of the season."</div>
