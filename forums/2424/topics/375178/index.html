              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DIMITAR BERBATOV was told not to join Manchester United - because of their 
              'ungodly nickname'.</h2>
              <p class="article">Bulgarian Berba's uncle is an exorcist who advised the striker not to sign up 
              for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p class="article">The Â£30.75million buy from Tottenham said: "He is a priest and exorcist back 
              home in Bulgaria - a powerful man who drives out demons and bad spirits.</p>
              <p class="article">"When I moved to United he had a problem with their nickname.</p>
              <p class="article">"As a godly man, he does not like the name Red Devils."</p>
              <p class="article">But now the same uncle has come to be thankful that Berbatov ditched White 
              Hart Lane for Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">The Bulgaria superstar - who today faces his old club at the ground where he 
              became a hero - explained: "He has told me that his church has grown a lot 
              bigger. People are football crazy in Bulgaria and if his church is ]more 
              full as I now play for Manchester United, then that is great.</p>
              <p class="article">"It doesn't matter what gets them to church as long as they get there to learn 
              from him."</p>
              <p class="article">Family loyalties run thick through Berbatov's veins. Believe it or not, he 
              finally decided to walk out on Spurs after a long talk amongst the cabbages 
              and potatoes on his grandfather's allotment.</p>
              <p class="article">Behind all the fame and fortune as he leads the United front line in pursuit 
              of a fourth straight Premier League title, he claims to be a simple, 
              home-loving boy who owes everything to his mother and grandparents.</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov, 28, said: "I credit my success to my mother. Her prayers and support 
              are everything to me.</p>
              <p class="article">"I know all she does for me and I know nothing I do can ever pay back the 
              amount of support she has given me.</p>
              <p class="article">"My grandparents are very important too, my grandfather is a very wise man and 
              a great man to talk to.</p>
              <p class="article">"When I am home in the summer I will go to his allotment and help him dig, 
              then we will take the fresh produce home to my grandmother and she will make 
              the most wonderful food.</p>
              <p class="article">"The allotment has been the place for some great chats and it was there where 
              we talked about me moving to a club where I could win major trophies and I 
              asked him what he thought about Manchester United."</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov is looking forward to the return to Spurs.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "I enjoyed my time there and the fans were very good to me. But when 
              you hear a club like Manchester United are interested and you have the 
              chance to play in the Champions League, it is impossible to say no.</p>
              <p class="article">"I have ambitions and at my age it was the right time to try and achieve 
              those."</p>
