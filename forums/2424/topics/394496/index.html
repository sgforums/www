              <p>Ferguson has been impressed by the way Neville has fought back from a career-threatening ankle injury and believes the 35-year-old can play for another season at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The United boss also says Neville's invaluable experience will help his squad win their fourth successive Barclays Premier League title.</p>
              <p>''I can certainly see Gary playing on next season,' said Fergie. 'He's a player of great willpower. He's got where he is in life because he has the will to do it.</p>
              <p>'When you're out of the game for a-year-and-a-half like he was, it's not easy to come back. We don't play him every week because of the nature of his body. But he's showing incredible drive for a 35-year-old. I think he's a great example.'</p>

              <p><span class="italic"><strong>Fabio - staying at Man United.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Manchester United defender Fabio Da Silva has signed a contract extension that will keep him at Old Trafford until 2014.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian teenager has made 13 appearances for the Old Trafford outfit this season and is viewed as a major talent for the future.</p>
              <p>"Fabio is a natural footballer who will make a fine Manchester United player in the years to come," said Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He has had some bad luck with injuries but he will make a fine Manchester United player."</p>
              <p>Brother Rafael signed a two-year contract extension last season, although it should not be long before he gets a more longer-term one as well.</p>
              <p>Certainly the pair are viewed as likely United full-backs of the future given their attacking instincts, with not even a sending off against Wolves in the Carling Cup earlier this season dampening Fabio's enthusiasm for life at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Playing for Manchester United is every young player's dream," said the Brazilian.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy and proud to commit my future to the club.</p>
              <p>"In the time I have been here, I have learned a lot from the world-class players that I train with and I hope that as time goes on, I can contribute more and more to the success of this great club."</p>

              <p>Manchester United defender Fabio da Silva has indicated he would jump at the chance to join Sporting Lisbon on loan.</p>
              <p>Reports in Portugal claim Sporting are keen on signing the 19-year-old on a temporary basis as they look to bolster their squad in the summer.</p>
              <p>Fabio, who completed his switch to United in 2008, has had less chances to shine than his twin brother, Rafael, at Old Trafford, which has restricted him to just one start in the Premier League this season.</p>
              <p>The Fluminense product has now said he would not mind being sent on loan to Sporting to gain more first-team experience.</p>
              <p>"If I have to be loaned out, I want it to be to Sporting," he told <em>Abola</em>. "Sporting are a big club, with a big tradition.</p>
              <p>"Here in England and in Brazil, Sporting are very known and respected. Who would not like to play at Sporting? If it is to have more playing chances then there is no problem.</p>
              <p>"The coach would like me to continue in the squad but my agent thinks I will not have many opportunities and so he has advised me to play elsewhere.</p>
              <p>"A meeting is scheduled for the end of the season, so we can determine all that."</p>
