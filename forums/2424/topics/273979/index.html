            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferguson: Tevez will start<br>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson says Carlos Tevez will start against Portsmouth on Wednesday.<br></strong><br><br>The champions stalled on the grid on Sunday by failing to beat Reading on home soil, an outcome accompanied by the awful news that Wayne Rooney had fractured his foot in an accidental collision with Michael Duberry, and will be out for two months.<br><br>"Carlos will start on Wednesday," revealed Ferguson. "Ideally, I would have preferred to wait for the Manchester City game on Sunday - which would have given him a few more days' training. But for the forthcoming few weeks, he will fill the position Wayne would have occupied."<br><br><strong>absolutely brilliant</strong><br><br>Although Tevez was confirmed as a United player only on Friday, he has been training with the Red Devils for almost a fortnight. Ferguson accepts the Argentina international may be slightly rusty, having not played a game since his country reached the final of the Copa America four weeks ago. However, the United boss has seen enough in training to feel Tevez can make a positive contribution at Fratton Park.<br><br>"There is no doubt in my mind Carlos was the major reason why West Ham stayed up last season," said Ferguson. "His performances in the Premier League last season is the foundation on which our opinion of him is based.<br><br>"But sometimes you get more of a feel from training, and he has been absolutely brilliant. I have been very impressed, not just by his aptitude for work but the receptive manner in which he has approached the sessions."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tevez feels no pressure<br><br>Carlos Tevez is counting on one thing having completed his move to United - enjoying his football at Old Trafford.</strong><br><br>At times, it must have seemed like his protracted transfer to Old Trafford may never materialise with so much red tape surrounding the deal.<br><br>But, now that the deal has finally been pushed through and a United debut against Portsmouth beckons on Wednesday at Fratton Park, he is determined to make the most of the opportunity.<br><br>And, even though Wayne Rooney's injury-enforced absence has placed greater emphasis on his contribution up front, Tevez certainly isn't showing signs of feeling the pressure.<br><br>"I have never felt pressure when I play football," he told reporters during his official unveiling at United's Carrington training headquarters. "Whenever I go on to the pitch all I try to do is enjoy myself.<br><br>"This is a massive step for me. It hurt me to leave West Ham anyway, but the lure of Manchester United was just too much," he added.<br><br>It had been hoped that Tevez would form a formidable partnership with Rooney, but due to the Englishman's metatarsal injury, that link-up has been put on hold until October.<br><br>"It is a big blow to lose Wayne," he said. "He is a great player and he will be very difficult to replace. But at a big club like Manchester United you hope to have a number of players who can slot in.<br><br>"Now I need to write my own piece of history at the club and do everything I can to help Manchester United be successful."<br></div>
