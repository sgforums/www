              <p>Wayne Rooney should be banned from head tennis, kept in isolation away
              from anyone carrying a winter virus and have his boots reinforced if
              United's Treble bid is to be revived.<br> <br>The
              Rooney factor has become the Old Trafford talking point after the
              champions lost their fourth Premier League game of the season in the
              derby.<br> <br>The 22-year-old England striker has been the only senior regular absent from those setbacks.<br> <br>In
              the autumn, his broken foot sustained against Reading cost him five
              matches during which the Reds lost the Eastlands derby 1-0 against the
              Blues.<br> <br>They also dropped two points in the Fratton Park draw with Portsmouth.<br> <br> <strong>Ankle</strong> <br> <br>In November, he damaged his ankle after an over-zealous game of head tennis at the end of a training session at Carrington.<br> <br>That put him out for three matches and United lost 1-0 at the Reebok against Bolton.<br> <br>At Christmas he was KO'd by a virus for two games and the Reds were beaten 2-1 at Upton Park by West Ham United.<br> <br>Last
              Sunday, a one-match ban for picking up five yellow cards this campaign
              cost him his appearance in the derby and the Blues did the double over
              the Reds.<br> <br>In all, without Rooney, United have dropped 14
              precious League points. That would have easily swallowed up Arsenal's
              current five-point advantage.<br> <br>In matches without Rooney this term, Sir Alex Ferguson's side have scored just one goal per game (11 goals in 11 matches).<br> <br>With the England striker in the side they have scored 2.5 per match (57 goals from 23 games).<br> <br>Most of United's defeats without Rooney have been lifeless efforts by the Reds.<br> <br>Coincidence or significant?<br> <br>Former United forward Lou Macari believes without Rooney, the Reds lack a spark or `a Sparky'.<br> <br>"Any team is going to miss a top player," Macari told MEN Sport.<br> <br>"No
              side is packed with 11 superstars and there are different types and
              different levels of performers. But even amongst the very best you can
              have players who have more of an influence when things are not going
              right and Wayne Rooney is one of those players.<br> <br>"I am not
              having a pop at anyone else or saying that a side can be a one-man team
              because of it but there are, and always have been, certain individuals
              whose styles are vital on any occasion and can be more effective than
              others on an off colour day.<br> <br>"I think back to Mark Hughes and I see the same vital ingredients in Rooney.<br> <br>"Even on a bad day, Sparky would be pushing and shoving people about. 
                  <br> <br>"He would be making defender's lives uncomfortable even if things weren't going quite right for United.<br> <br>"United could be having a poor time but Mark could always do same damage and ensure that opponents never felt they could relax.<br> <br>"His
              late volleyed goal at Wembley in the FA Cup semi- final against Oldham
              that rescued United was a typical example of what I mean.<br> <br>"He pops up with a half chance when defenders probably thought there was nothing on and had relaxed.<br> <br>"I think Wayne gives United that same commodity now and it is vital," added Macari.<br> <br>"It is the nuisance factor. Even when he or United or both are off form he will still be an irritation right to the last minute.<br> <br>"He's aggressive and always wants to make a defender's life difficult.<br> <br>"He can be a pain in the backside for them and you need that battling style when things are not going well.<br> <br>"There
              are players in every side who are a big influence but when things are
              not happening it collapses and they can't provide that spark but Wayne
              Rooney can always have that one moment when he upsets a defence.<br> <br> <strong>Frustration</strong> <br> <br>"Some of it can be borne out of frustration but whatever it is he won't let things rest. He is special in that respect.<br> <br>"In
              the derby last Sunday, for instance, United needed a player who could
              upset people in a blue shirt. There was only one booking in the derby
              and that summed the game up from United's point of view.<br> <br>"As a physical contest it was a non-event. You needed someone to make a crunching tackle or knock the centre half about.<br> <br>"It needed someone who would put the City back four on edge. Rooney would have done that right to the very end.<br> <br>"There
              are certain players you cannot do without in certain situations and
              Wayne is one of those players when the chips are down and you need an
              injection of urgency to shake up team-mates and disrupt opponents."</p>
