Real Madrid made their intentions known again last week, when Pedrag Mijatovic, the clubÂ’s sporting director, announced that they would not give up trying to sign Ronaldo.<br><br>United believe that RealÂ’s brazen courting of the player is unacceptable, but while the idea of loading a formal complaint to Fifa has been mooted, the club are thought to be ready to target the Â“outside influencesÂ” whom they believe are to blame for stoking the fires, rather than refer the matter to the sportÂ’s world governing body.<br><br>A well-placed source at United told The Times: Â“Real MadridÂ’s remarks about Cristiano arenÂ’t helpful, but they are getting their information from certain people whose credibility we intend to undermine.Â” </blockquote></div>
