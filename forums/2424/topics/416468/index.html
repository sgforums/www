              <p><strong>West Ham boss Avram Grant hailed an "unbelievable" result as holders Manchester United were dumped out of the Carling Cup with a 4-0 thrashing at Upton Park. </strong></p>
              <p>Jonathan Spector and Carlton Cole scored two goals each as United crashed to their heaviest defeat since 2001 and their first loss of the season.</p>
              <p>The Hammers are in the semi-final finals of the League Cup for the first time in over 20 years and Grant hopes the result can help inspire a move out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone.</p>
              <p>"I thought we could win but this is still an unbelievable result. We continue our progress," he said.</p>
              <p>"We scored four goals and could have scored more. But for me four is enough.</p>
              <p>"To be in the semi-finals is very good for this club. We are trying to build something step by step. We have done the right thing.</p>
              <p>"We have played many more good games without winning so the players maybe have lost confidence.</p>
              <p>"But the most important is to show mental strength and tonight was so unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"The gap at the bottom of the Premier League was five points and is now three points.</p>
              <p>"We have many games left and I'm sure that this shows we can be good in the future."</p>
              <p>Grant praised man of the match Spector and Cole, who has been criticised for his form in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>"Spector is a good professional and always tries hard. I changed his position in training to midfield," said Grant.</p>
              <p>"I think that he saw the Barcelona performance against Madrid last night and thought that he can do that as well!</p>
              <p>"For Cole the best way to do things is to do it on the pitch. Cole worked hard from the first minute and he knows how to do it.</p>
              <p>"Every striker has bad times but you need to look back at the end of the season to see how he coped."</p>
              <p>The defeat marked the end of United's 29-match unbeaten run and <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong> was angry with the manner in which his side conceded the goals.</p>
              <p>West Ham had an early goal by Victor Obinna correctly ruled out for offside, but they were incensed and Ferguson felt the perceived sense of injustice provided inspiration.</p>
              <p>"I didn't expect that, that's for sure. If you analyse it the goals we gave away were absolutely too soft," he told MUTV.</p>
              <p>"We didn't expect that, they were terrible goals for us.</p>
              <p>"We had one or two half chances and Gabriel Obertan had a shot saved by the goalkeeper (Robert Green) which then hit the post.</p>
              <p>"The goals killed it. You can't just give goals away at this level.</p>
              <p>"That first goal was a break for them. We were in control in the early part, played some good football. But goals change games.</p>
              <p>"The thing that sparked it was the goal that was disallowed because it got the crowd up.</p>
              <p>"It was clearly offside because it came off one of their players into the net.</p>
              <p>"It was clearly offside but they celebrated for so long. It spurred them up."</p>

              <p>I think this cup is traditionally used as training ground for reserves and as you can see, United's reserves is really nothing.</p>
              <p>Especially when you see O'Shea and Evans playing together. Guarantee at least 2 goals packed, wraped and presented to opponents. Finally Fergie realises Evans is crap and sub him off for Brown. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
