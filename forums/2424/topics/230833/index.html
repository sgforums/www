            <div class='col-md body'>No lah, very much depends on how they bounce back. Man U has also suffered 5-2 (if i not wrong) against Newcastle in the league.<br><br>Such 'freak' results happen.  However, it will be cause for concern if the team went spiralling thereafter, hitting lows.  Because it does not make sense to just fire the manager because of one or two freak results.<br><br>I mean the situation may be different if now, say Liverpool is flirting with relegation or has not won in 15 matches or players are generally unhappy with the manager, stuff like that.<br><br>As said Benetiz has won them the CL before, thats already a big brownie point.  How many English teams has won the CL?  Not even Chelsea has managed to do that having an obsence transfer budget.  Hence, I think Beneitz won't be sacked so easily one.<br><br>Liverpool not like Chelsea or Real Madrid so 'demanding'.  I think Benetiz's KPI this season (looking at the how they have been playing &amp; injuries to key players) is probably a 3rd place finishing (no hope of getting second liaoz) and probably a semi-final or final in CL bah....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup, freak results happen every now and then, even our recent draw with west ham was also considered a freak result. but like what others mentioned, we can;t just fire SAF, the club owes him that much for the success that he brought into United and the way he groomed young players in the academy to world class players. No we dun fire SAF jus because of these results, just like Liverpool, they shouldnt fire Benitez for the recent results.. he brought them the CL Cup remember?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, I don't denied that he brought them the 5th Holy Grail and maybe a FA Cup along the way. But put that aside..and view them in totality, Liverpool has not progressed as a whole.<br><br>1) past seasons, they survived on their defence, and this season, they decided to add pace to their forwards, but how many times you seen Bellamy or Pennant play? His transfers are questionable.<br><br>2) and comparing squad strength, their 1st team lost to the 1st of Arsenal who is transitioning from youth. they lost 3-1.<br><br>3) and their 2nd team lost, 6-3. Yes, it is a freak result. But for me, alarms will be sounded.<br><br>Comparing him to someone like MartinJol,  Paul Jewell, David Moyes or even Sam (Bolton), you can see progress, step by step. But for Liverpool, I really don't lor.<br><br>Even as a MUFC fan, I do admire Gunners' youth policy. MUFC seems a step behind. Yes, we won't have another class of greats like in the 90s, but we should have one or two pushing through. We do have the 2 best young players, but they are also bought, not found &amp; developed. So in the long run, if we don't produce excellent players or buy correctly. The team that will dominate is Gunners...<br><br>Last question, I heard one comment in the net that their infamous song of "you'll never walk alone" is not actual theirs, but "stolen". Anyone got any fact on that?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this present lot will show improvement after this season, unless Benetiz went crazy to buy the wrong players and sell players that he shldn't have sold.<br><br>They have good players in Gerrard, Kuyt, Pennant and Garcia (and Alonso) and Bellamy.  These shld be main stay. Players like Fowler, Dudek, Agger, Carragaher, Hypia, Diao, Cisse shld all go.  And they need a commanding central defender - Hypia was once good, but unfortunately, he's over the peak.</div>
