Batistuta Â— who bagged an astonishing 56 international goals in 78 appearances Â— has been carefully monitoring events in England from the other side of the world and is convinced Tevez will become an Old Trafford legend. </strong><br><br>He said: Â“Carlito is definitely at the right club at the right time in his career. Â“Playing alongside Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, he can achieve everything he wants. Â“It is much better to be playing with other world-class players than just to be the best player in your side. Â“At West Ham last season, Tevez did a brilliant job and helped the club to stay up. But he had to do a lot of the hard work on his own.<br><br>Â“At Manchester United, having players of the quality of Rooney, Ronaldo, Giggs, Vidic and Ferdinand to help him will make his life much easier. Â“DonÂ’t forget that Tevez is still quite young and has only been in Manchester for a few months. Â“It will take him a bit more time to show everyone what he can really do. But he is already a fantastic, world-class talent and at his new club he has every tool required to become a true Argentine great.Â”<br><br>Batistuta, 38, finally retired from football three years ago after scoring 184 Serie A goals during his 12 seasons in Italy with Fiorentina and Roma. And he admits he envies TevezÂ’s opportunity of playing in England and believes the striker, 23, could pave the way for more Argentines to move to the Premier League.<br><br>Batistuta added: Â“IÂ’ve always loved the atmosphere of English soccer and often thought of coming here during my career. But when I was at my peak, the Premier League was not of the same standard as it is now. Â“Then there were only one or two teams who stood any chance of winning the title and that was not very exciting for me. That is why I always stayed in Italy.<br><br>Â“But now I watch the English league and it has improved so much. Many of the worldÂ’s best players are over here now and there are no longer any guarantees that Manchester United or Liverpool will win the title. Â“Before, all the Argentines went to Spain or Italy. But with Tevez going so well at Manchester, others might now think about also going to England.Â”<br><br>BatistutaÂ’s admiration for English football is not just limited to the Premier League Â— and he is saddened to see the national team in such dire straits.<br></div>
