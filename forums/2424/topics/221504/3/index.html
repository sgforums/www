            <div class='col-md body'>its two points lost for Man U.  Thus far, Man U has failed to beat any of the title contenders at home, now I fear for their title challenge.  You absolutely need to beat your fellow contenders at home.  Man U have failed to beat Arsenal and now, they fail to beat Chelsea.  I did not mention Liverpool because they are out of title contention already.<br><br>its a fabulous goal by Saha, the boost that he need after his jaded showing against Celtic.  But then, the tempo and pressure that we see in the first half din carry on to the second and they allow Chelsea to come at them, once, twice, thrice and sooner or later, if you allow such teams as Chelsea to come back at you, they are bound to score.<br><br>Don't understand Man U's thinking, instead of chasing the game further, they are contended to sit back and let Chelsea come at them.  Its a good result for Chelsea, they have gained a point from a difficult ground and keep Man U's lead in check.  Can Man U do the same away at Stanford Bridge? I doubt.<br><br>Moreover, Saha and Ronaldo limped off, and with Man U not having anymore strikers left to call upon, its bad news, as the commentator said, Man U lack the  depth that Chelsea has at their disposal.<br><br>Oh my, Man U just threw away two points that would have let them have a 6-point lead coming to Christmas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in this way it brings more excitement in epl..<br>n if ManU lead too much pts so early in the season,<br>i believe they will ended up being catch up by e blues..<br>therefore a small gap between them will keep ManU on alert at all times..<br>rmb how many times in epl when a club start to lead too much pts by retaining 1st place ended up being catch up??<br>so it actually makes ManU be on alert week in week out..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fergie: United are top dogs</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson felt his Manchester United side proved they are currently the best team in England despite drawing 1-1 with Chelsea at Old Trafford.<br><br>The Red Devils had a great chance to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points after Louis Saha opened the scoring with a well-executed finish, but ultimately had to settle for a draw when the striker diverted Ricardo Carvalho's header away from Edwin van der Sar after 69 minutes.<br><br>Following the game, Blues boss Jose Mourinho felt the draw played into the hands of his reigning champions as they seek to overcome a fierce title challenge from Old Trafford.<br><br>However, Ferguson is sure that over the course of an exciting 90 minutes United justified their status as the current top dogs in The Premiership.<br><br>"We proved we can compete and that when we reach the high levels of performance we are the best team in the country at the moment," said Ferguson.<br><br>"The test for us now is to step forward from this because winning championships is about beating other teams.<br><br>"If we want to win the title, consistency is the name of the game."<br><br>However, Ferguson was disappointed to see United concede from a second half corner and allow their winning position to slip against the Londoners.<br><br>"It is disappointing to draw because we were in a winning position and allowed them to get an equaliser," Ferguson added.<br><br>"They had a lot of possession but didn't create a chance. We did well on the counter-attack and had two magnificent opportunities to get a second.<br><br>"But the longer the game goes on everyone starts to get a bit nervous. Even so, they weren't causing us any bother until the goal and I thought Edwin van der Sar had it covered until Louis headed it in.<br><br>"In games like these, you need a little break at times - and we didn't get it."<br><br>The first half strike was particularly significant for Saha after his penalty miss against Celtic in midweek, and Ferguson revealed the French international was desperate to make amends at Old Trafford.<br><br>"Good players do that, they can't wait for the next game, and all week in training you could see that," Ferguson added on Sky Sports.<br><br>"He was like a caged animal, dying to get into the game, taking penalty kick after penalty kick after training yesterday, which demonstrates his eagerness to eradicate his miss from the other night and I'm sure that if he does take another one he won't let us down."<br><br>Michael Carrick was named man of the match to signify his growing influence after a summer move from Tottenham Hotspur, and Ferguson believes his summer signing is maturing into a key player at United.<br><br>"Absolutely I thought he was fantastic, he is getting better all the time," said Ferguson.<br><br>"He did a marvellous job for us, he is improving because he is getting more mature.<br><br>"He is still a young man but he is at a big club and he is rising to the challenge and that is pleasing to see."<br><br>One sour note for The Red Devils was two late injuries sustained to both Saha and Cristiano Ronaldo, with both players being substituted with four minutes to go.<br><br>Ronaldo picked up an injury after a hefty tackle from Ashley Cole, whilst Saha pulled up almost simultaneously, but Ferguson is hoping the duo can be fit for Wednesday's game at home to Everton.<br><br>"We will have to wait and see," he said.<br><br>"We will do our best to get them fit for Wednesday. We have to go again. That is what champions are made of."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't believe it.. First half was Man U's moment.. Blitzkrieg as some might put it.. Chelsea was caught unguard, inorganize and Man U was playing their football, although the tendency to play that long balls which most of the time leads to possesion lost. STOP PLAYING LONG BALLS THERE"S NO MORE BECKHAM! Second half was a disaster. Its as if they swop shirts. Chelsea was threatening and with introduction of wingplay through Robben and Joe Cole makes things worst. Can definitely see that Man U was outplayed. Ronaldo, I don't know seeing that 4-5 chelsea players chase after him wouldn't that makes space for other Man U players just pass the friggin ball. And it has always been a problem for Man U, they are no good at defending crosses whipped in from free-kicks, corners, and from normal play. Basically, Chelsea started wrongly. So greedy want to include all 4 players, Essien, Makelele, Lampard and Ballack. If they had played wing play right from the start, the whole game would have been Chelsea's. And Man U looked super tired in second half.<br><br>As much as I'm a hardcore Man U fan, but sadly to say, its not unlucky of Man U to draw but more of LUCKY Man U scored first and got a draw out of that match..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
