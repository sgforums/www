But I have my own ambitions for my own team and I hope to win on Sunday."<br><br>The row is something Ronaldo could probably have done without given the constant booing he received on his return from the World Cup has only just subsided.<br><br>Although he has reached a World Cup semi-final and a European Championship final for Portugal, the 22-year-old's medals with United amount to a single FA Cup win and last season's Carling Cup triumph over Wigan.<br><br>Victory on Sunday would put United in pole position to win their first Premiership title since Ronaldo arrived from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, although despite the relative lack of silverware, the wide-man insists he is happy with life in Manchester.<br><br>"I am enjoying myself a great deal," he said.<br><br>"The team are playing well, which helps. I feel I am learning and improving every year.<br><br>"I am becoming more mature and more consistent. I understand what it means to play for Manchester United a lot more. I feel great and I want to keep it going."<br></div>

Â“We have a fantastic support who, when theyÂ’re really fired up, are the best. And they need to be that on Sunday because itÂ’s such an important game.Â”<br><br>The manager said his players would have no trouble preparing for the occasion and dismissed suggestions that victory over Chelsea meant less than the scalps of traditional rivals like Liverpool or Manchester City.<br><br>Â“If youÂ’re playing someone whoÂ’s top of the league alongside you then thereÂ’s a significance there. That doesnÂ’t change, whether they wear blue, red or green. The only concern I have is that weÂ’ve got 76,000 people in that stadium on Sunday and theyÂ’d better shout.Â”<br><br>Victory is vital and would put the Reds in a commanding title position. Â“We have the prospect of going six points clear and have them chasing us, rather than us chasing them,Â” he added.<br><br>Â“When youÂ’re competing with a team at the top of the league, youÂ’re praying that other teams can help you by taking points off your immediate challenger. But we have an opportunity to do that ourselves this time. It should be a fantastic game.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cole: Something has to give</strong><br><br>Joe Cole insists both United and Chelsea will aim to bounce back from midweek European defeats with victory at Old Trafford this Sunday.<br><br>Both sides slipped to single goal defeats, against Celtic and Werder Bremen respectively, and are charged up for what promises to be a massive top-of-the-table encounter.<br><br>Â“We lost in Bremen and I'm sure they're disappointed with their loss at Celtic," Cole said. Â“But big clubs canÂ’t lose two games in a row. Chelsea and United are huge clubs."<br><br>Jose Mourinho's side currently trail the Reds by three points, and Cole is refusing to contemplate suffering a defeat which would stretch the gap to six points, saying: Â“We donÂ’t want to lose any more ground, simple as that."<br><br>Regardless of Sunday's outcome, team-mate Didier Drogba believes United will push Chelsea all the way for the title after recognising renewed vigour in the Reds this season.<br><br>Chelsea stormed to successive in the last two seasons through their relentless consistency right from the off. But United have been quickest out of the traps this season, which leads Drogba to believes the Blues will have to win every game to stay in touch.<br><br>"This season United are doing well and havenÂ’t conceded many points," he told Channel Five. "We know we have to win all our games because Manchester want to be champions this year more than last season and two years ago."<br></div>

According to Actim Index stats, Drogba is the Premiership's in-form forward having scored eight goals in 13 Premiership appearances, while United forward Rooney is third with seven goals in 10 league appearances.<br><br>The Premiership's official statisticians award points for making a positive impact on games. Drogba currently has 287 points compared to Rooney's 239.<br><br>Rooney possesses the better goal ratio, however, and so far this season he has had 29 shots, made 153 passes, 14 crosses, 17 tackles, and gone on 20 dribbles.<br><br>Drogba has undoubtedly been the most dangerous player for Jose Mourinho's side this term. He has had 30 shots, made 129 passes, nine crosses and nine dribbles. He has also chipped in defensively with 12 tackles, 11 clearances and three interceptions.<br><br>The statistics merely confirm United's superior start to the season. And, if there is anything to be gleaned from such figures before a match where reputation and standing is likely to go out the window, they indicate the Reds are in a better position to take all three points on Sunday.<br><br>Sir Alex's men have five players in the Actim Index Top 20 (Rooney, Edwin van der Sar, Louis Saha, Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand), compared to three Chelsea players (Drogba, Andriy Shevchenko and Frank Lampard).<br></div>
