              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Ben Foster has admitted he expects to be dropped for <span class="iAs" style="border-bottom: medium none ! important; font-weight: normal ! important; font-size: 100% ! important; text-decoration: none ! important; padding-bottom: 0px ! important; color: darkblue ! important; background-color: transparent ! important;">ManchesterÂ United's</span> Premier League trip to West Brom on Tuesday night.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>For the first time in a
              United career that is over three years old, Foster has completed
              successive games, following up an appearance in the Carling Cup
              semi-final win over Derby by helping the Red Devils advance to the FA
              Cup fifth round by beating Tottenham at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>But while the 25-year-old appears to have edged ahead of Tomasz
              Kuszczak in the pecking order, both men know they are currently
              battling to be understudy to Dutch veteran Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>And Foster fully anticipates Van der Sar will be called upon to
              keep out the Baggies as United look to consolidate their position as
              Premier League leaders.</p>
              <p>"It is a couple of years since I last played two games in a row," said Foster.</p>
              <p>"That is a long time, so it is nice for me and has given me a bit of extra confidence.</p>
              <p>"Long may it continue, although I doubt it will. I don't expect
              to keep my place because Edwin has been doing fantastically well."</p>
              <p>Foster does not feel he has edged ahead of Kuszczak in the battle to become Sir Alex Ferguson's second choice.</p>
              <p>That picture should become much clearer on March 1 as Van der
              Sar is not expected to feature in the Carling Cup final against Spurs
              at Wembley as he has not been involved in any of the previous rounds.</p>
              <p>For Foster, who missed virtually all last season after damaging
              cruciate ligaments right at the end of his second year on loan at
              Watford, it is a question of maintaining concentration and being ready
              for the challenges when they present themselves.</p>
              <p>"Usually the manager pulls you over at the end of the week before you are going to play and says you are in," said Foster.</p>
              <p>"It gives you three or four days to prepare.</p>
              <p>"It is a difficult situation for the goalkeepers because we have
              three good ones all vying for the same spot, so you have to expect at
              some time in the season you are going to be left out.</p>
              <p>"Fortunately I have had a little run in the team but I am sure Tomasz will have them as well, if he hasn't already."</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper is the one area of Ferguson's squad that has not been
              affected by a chronic injury list that will leave him without a dozen
              men on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Teenage duo Fabio and Danny Welbeck are the latest to limp out
              of the fray, the Brazilian in particular enjoying a splendid debut
              until he suffered a calf strain that has put him back on the sidelines
              to where he was consigned after a recent shoulder operation.</p>
              <p>Not that Foster is going to be using a lack of manpower as an excuse should United fail in their trophy hunt.</p>
              <p>"Most teams are worried that injuries will catch up with them
              because most teams are struggling," said the former Stoke keeper, who
              was a target for Spurs boss Harry Redknapp, only to be told by Ferguson
              there was no chance of a deal.</p>
              <p>"Tottenham have a lot of injuries and we have quite a few but that is just the way it is.</p>
              <p>"You know the rules at the start of the season.</p>
              <p>"You need a team to last the whole season. If you have not got the squad to see it through it is your own fault."</p>
