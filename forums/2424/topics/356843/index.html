              Shut it!
              Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafa Benitez have been handed a humiliating ultimatum: Quit your war â€” now. The Manchester United and Liverpool bosses were told their battle has put the game in the gutter. The clash reached crisis point yesterday when League Managersâ€™ Association chief Richard Bevan sensationally stepped in to try to defuse the situation. Their war of words reached a head last Friday when Fergie accused Benitez of being rude and arrogant for calling Everton a small club and for a gesture he made during Liverpoolâ€™s win over Blackburn. Yesterday Ferguson refused to back down and said: â€œI made my point about it. I donâ€™t understand why he did it. I donâ€™t want to go on about it any more. I made my point. There is no point carrying it on. Itâ€™s plain for everybody to see now. I have made my issue about it.â€� - Neil Custis, The Sun
              
              Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright believes if Benitez and Sir Alex continue to tear strips off each other, then the real winners could be Chelsea. 
              
              Sir Alex must try to lift Dimitar Berbatov after admitting the striker was upset by his fluffed penalty. The Reds boss says Berbatov was down in the dressing room at Wembley in the aftermath of Unitedâ€™s shoot-out defeat to Everton.
              
              The Daily Mail features quotes from Fabio and Rafael da Silva who reveal that they turned down the chance to join Arsenal before they made the switch to United.
