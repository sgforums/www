              Manchester United's hopes of overturning Darren Fletcher's red card have been dashed by UEFA, who state that overturning the Scot's suspension for the Champions League final would open a "Pandora's Box". 
              
              UEFA have confirmed that a protest against a sending off would only be allowed on the basis on mistaken identity - and not on whether the referee had been too harsh.
              
              Head of communications Rob Faulkner said: "Manchester United have the right to file a protest within 24 hours of the match however a protest against a caution or sending off is only admissible if the referee's error was to mistake the identity of the player."
              
              United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had hoped referee Roberto Rosetti would have admitted it was a mistake to give Fletcher a straight red card for a foul on Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas in the box.
              
              "He's one of the most honest players in the game and to miss the final, it's a tragedy," said Ferguson.
              
              "In respect to the referee in this situation he might look at it himself without anyone asking him."
              
              Although the English FA have moved towards a position where referees regularly rescind red cards, both UEFA and FIFA strictly maintain the rules that match officials' decisions should remain sacrosanct.
              
              A UEFA source added: "It opens Pandora's box if you can challenge every decision. And if you rule that it is not a red card, then you are also saying it is not a penalty, and therefore not a goal, and what do you do then - start changing the results of matches afterwards?"
              
              Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also admitted the red card was "very harsh" after television pictures clearly showed Scottish international Fletcher - a non-playing substitute at last year's final - played the ball.

              United beat Arsenal 3-1 at the Emirates on Tuesday night to reach the Champions League final, but celebrations were soured after Darren Fletcher's red card means the Scot will miss the match.
              
              Fletcher was dismissed on 75 minutes after Italian referee Roberto Rosetti adjudged the midfielder had brought down Cesc Fabregas inside the Redsâ€™ penalty area. TV commentators and pundits all agreed the decision was harsh, while Sir Alex said Fletcher had been â€œterribly unluckyâ€�.
              
              â€œYou can see the ball has moved in a different direction, away from Cesc Fabregas,â€� the boss told ITV.
              
              â€œI think Darrenâ€™s been terribly unlucky and unfortunately we canâ€™t appeal the decision.
              
              â€œThe refereeâ€™s probably one of the best in Europe but unfortunately thereâ€™s nothing we can do about it.
              
              â€œYou saw his performance tonight and in all the big games over the last few years Darrenâ€™s always been key for us. I couldnâ€™t tell you what my team would be in the final â€“ it depends on who the opponents are, of course â€“ but youâ€™d have thought Darren would have figured in it.â€�
              
              Wayne Rooney admitted the mood in the dressing room after the final whistle had been affected by Fletcher's dismissal.
              
              â€œEveryoneâ€™s gutted for Darren,â€� Rooney told MUTV. â€œI think he won the ball, too. To miss a a big game like the Champions League final is heart-breaking.
              
              â€œBut weâ€™re all proud of this achievement. When we set out at the start of the season our aim was to retain the trophy and now weâ€™re so close.â€�

              <p>Its really tough la..think ppl should let this incident subside abit..but poor boy..for every champs league finals we have players missing out.Last yr was park..1999 was keane &amp; scholes.</p>
              <p>we can still cope.Fergie's midfield trio will continue and scoles will most probably replace fletcher in the midfield diamond formation if he still intends to use it in the finals.But he has stated already it would depend on opponents.</p>
