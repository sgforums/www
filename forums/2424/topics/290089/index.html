            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Neville wants Euro resolution<br><br>Gary Neville will be cheering United as loud as any fan when Dynamo Kyiv come to Old Trafford on Wednesday night.</strong><br><br>A win will see the Reds secure early qualification to the Champions League knockout phaseÂ… and, Neville says, improve his chances of adding to his appearance tally.<br><br>"We're now in a really strong position where we just need to win one gameÂ… then maybe those players who haven't been playing for the last eight months can get on the pitch for the matches that don't matter so much!" the United skipper told Manchester United Radio.<br><br>Neville's not played a first-team match since March after damaging his ankle against Bolton Wanderers but played almost 60 minutes for United's Reserves in last week's 6-1 win over Stockport County in the Manchester Senior Cup.<br><br>Meanwhile, Sir Alex's side beat Dynamo Kyiv 4-2 a fortnight ago and many have tipped the Reds to continue their free-scoring form on Wednesday night. Neville's certainly confident United can beat the Ukrainian champions, although he's not convinced we'll see a glut of goals.<br><br>"I think Kyiv will play a completely different game at Old Trafford. They'll sit behind the ball, play on the counter attack and it will be more difficult to break them down because they won't have the same kind of attacking ambitions this time.<br><br>"When you're in front of your home fans you're almost forced to attack but they won't have that same pressure on them this time.<br><br>"This time we're expected to win and why shouldn't we win? We're playing well, we're confident and this is a great chance for us to qualify at such an early stage of the competition.<br><br>"But we can't get carried away. We were in a similar position last year and made it hard for ourselves. And I remember when Kyiv came here in 2000 and nearly scored a late goal to knock us out of the Champions League. We have to be careful."</div>
