              <p>Young has already agreed personal terms and, if everything goes according to plan, an official announcement could take place on Thursday. United will not release the transfer value but it is thought to be around £15m.</p>
              <p>Young's arrival will give Sir Alex Ferguson more variety in attack, with the 25-year-old capable of playing as a two-footed left-winger or operating as a centre-forward.</p>
              <p>He will be United's second summer signing following the arrival of Phil Jones earlier this month from Blackburn Rovers in a £16.5m move, possibly rising to £20.5m. A deal has also been put in place for the Spain Under-21 international goalkeeper David de Gea to join from Atlético Madrid, taking United's spending to about £50m and marking them out as the major movers in the transfer market so far this summer.</p>
              <p>Young, who began his career at Watford before signing for Villa in 2007, had also attracted strong interest from Liverpool but decided, much like Jones, that he would rather move to Old Trafford.</p>

              <p>However, we need a good dead ball striker, we are missing Ronaldo - who was good at scoring from free kicks....but we havent had a good fk/corner taker since Beckham!!</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Ashley Young has completed a £16million move to Manchester United after signing a five-year deal with the Premier League champions.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The England winger put pen to paper after undergoing a medical at Manchester's Bridgewater Hospital on Wednesday and immediately set his sights on helping United win their 20th domestic title.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The opportunity to come and play for one of the biggest clubs in the world is one I couldn't turn down,' Young told MUTV.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It's a chance to hopefully become part of the history by helping to win the 20th title.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It's a prospect I always looked at from being a child - to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I've got that opportunity now so I've just got to take it with two hands.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Young becomes Sir Alex Ferguson's second signing of the summer after the capture of England Under-21 international Phil Jones from Blackburn for £16.5million.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A club statement read: 'Manchester United is delighted to announce it has reached agreement with Aston Villa for the transfer of Ashley Young.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The player passed a medical in Manchester this week and has agreed a five-year contract.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Villa signed Young from Watford in January 2007 in a deal eventually worth £10million and he went on to score 38 goals in 190 appearances.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>However, he made it clear to Villa he would not be signing an extension to his contract, which was due to expire next summer, and the club had little alternative but to sell one of their prize assets.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Ashley has made a terrific contribution for Villa over the past four and a half seasons and everyone at the club wishes him the best for the future,' new Villa manager Alex McLeish said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He has become an important player in the England team during that time and I'm sure he will be looking forward to this new challenge.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A deal was put in place before the 25-year-old flew to Las Vegas on holiday two weeks ago and United striker Michael Owen has already backed Young to be a great signing for the champions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Owen, who committed himself to United for a further year earlier this summer, believes Young is an exciting addition for the Barclays Premier League champions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I see Ashley Young has undergone a medical today. Let's hope everything goes well as he would be a great signing for us,' he told Twitter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rio Ferdinand took to the social networking site to hail the arrival of his England team-mate, describing Young as 'another top, hungry and young player'.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Former Old Trafford favourite Dennis Irwin believes Young will offer the solution to the missing link left by Cristiano Ronaldo's departure to Real Madrid in 2009 labelling him as a 'real threat'.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I think it’s a great signing and I expect him to be a really good player for us,' said Irwin, speaking to the club's official website.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He’s got good ability and is a real threat from set-pieces, which is something we’ve been missing in the last couple of years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He can play anywhere behind the front man and his delivery into the box is fantastic. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He’s got a real eye for goal too and, given the opportunity, I think he’ll chip in with a few goals next season.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">United manager Sir Alex Ferguson missed out on the signature of Leens teenage defender Raphael Varane but he is set to continue his summer spending spree with the prospective arrival of Spain Under 21 goalkeeper David de Gea.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">De Gea is expected to finalise his switch to Old Trafford following Sunday's European Under 21 Championship final in Denmark with a £17.8m deal in place with La Liga outfit Atletico Madrid.</span></p>

              <p class="storycopy"><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United’s </span><span style="color: #000000;">£16 million signing quit </span><span style="color: #000000;">Aston Villa</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to sign a five-year deal at Old Trafford yesterday and become </span><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson’s</span> second big-money arrival of the summer.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But it is understood mega-rich neighbours City, as well as rivals Liverpool, were prepared to pay the England winger more money to sign for them.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But Young, who has doubled his wages in a contract worth £120,000 a week, had always set his sights on joining the champions as they offered him the best chance of winning trophies.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">After fulfilling his “childhood dream” of signing for United, Young now wants to be part of a squad who make history as they target a 20th top-flight league title next season.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">He said: “The opportunity to come and play for one of the biggest clubs in the world is one I couldn’t turn down. It’s a chance to hopefully become part of history by helping to win the 20th title.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“It’s a prospect I always looked at from being a child. I’ve got that opportunity now so I’ve got to take it with both hands.”</p>
