              <p><strong>FIFTEEN years ago today United were embroiled in accusations of
              indiscipline that threatened to wreck the 1994 Dream Team's double
              ambitions.</strong><br> <br>Eric Cantona was being labelled the 'enfant
              terrible' after two red cards in the space of four days at Swindon and
              Arsenal. The Reds drew both matches 2-2.<br> <br>United's French talisman was banned for five matches as a result.<br> <br>Premiership leaders and title holders United had won just one game in five matches in that bleak period.<br> <br>Roy Keane was also booked at Highbury and his yellow card haul forced him to miss the FA Cup semi-final against Oldham.<br> <br>Old
              Trafford's crime sheet was the topic of the moment in spring 1994 as
              Sir Alex Ferguson's powerful machine was in danger of self-destructing.<br> <br>Fast forward to the present day, and those discipline demons have surfaced again to threaten the quintuple bid.<br> <br>Three players have been sent off in two matches and Nemanja Vidic, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney are banned for the next match. 
                  <br> <br> <strong>Heated</strong> <br> <br>After United's heated night in London against Arsenal 15 years ago, Fergie was asked about the discipline problem.<br> <br>"We've not been doing anything any different. Maybe the referees are reading the papers," the United boss replied.<br> <br>And
              Paul Parker, who was right back in that Dream Team, believes Ferguson's
              words then are as relevant today and it should serve as a warning to
              the United squad as suspensions begin to eat into their numbers.<br> <br>"I
              remember Eric deserved to go against Swindon because of a tackle on
              John Moncur but against Arsenal I don't think he should have been sent
              off," Parker told M.E.N. Sport.<br> <br>"But referees are human. They read newspapers. They watch TV and disciplinary incidents are bound to get imprinted on the mind.<br> <br>"Certain
              players will be planted in the back of their minds because of recent
              situations. They are not biased against individuals but things stick in
              the mind. They are very reactive. I am sure that is what happened in
              Eric's case in the second match at Arsenal. If a player has a bit of
              moodiness about him or fire in his belly then opposition fans get up
              for it and referees react.<br> <br>"Wayne Rooney, for instance,
              will have had the Liverpool defeat in his head all last week. He's a
              big football supporter and, as an ex-Evertonian, the thought of handing
              Liverpool the title initiative and ultimately maybe even handing them
              the crown will have eaten away at him. He then comes on as sub at
              Craven Cottage with United losing and all that will be in his head. <br> <br> <strong>Intention</strong> <br> <br>"It
              can be a time bomb. If he says he didn't throw the ball at Phil Dowd I
              accept his word but once you point the gun the intention is there.<br> <br>"Fans want to see players hurting after a defeat like the 4-1 against Liverpool. 
                  <br> <br>"Everyone
              would soon be on their case if they didn't react and didn't look like
              it was painful for them. And take away the fire in Rooney and would he
              be the same player?<br> <br>"But all that said, you cannot put
              your team at risk with petulance or dissent. And players have to
              understand their responsibilities."<br> <br>As the reality of back-to-back defeats set in at Fulham, Cristiano Ronaldo also began wobbling on a disciplinary tightrope.<br> <br>His
              animated reaction to tackles, retaliatory challenge on Danny Murphy and
              persistence in showing the mark made on his thigh when he was caught by
              defender John Pantsil added to the tension by enraging the crowd.<br> <br>The
              World Player of the Year tested referee Phil Dowd's patience and the
              official yellow-carded him for the Murphy lunge and warned him he was
              close to a red following the tantrum over the Pantsil incident.<br> <br>"Ronaldo is not helping Manchester United or helping his team-mates by generating that kind of atmosphere," added Parker.<br> <br>"Stamping
              your feet or exaggerated hand gestures just wind up the opposition fans
              even more and undermine your own concentration.<br> <br>"It is not show ponies that are needed at this stage of the season, it is shire horses who will work hard.<br> <br>"Nine
              times out of ten you don't play great football during a title run-in.
              It is a battle and you have to stand up and be counted. This time of
              the season is do or die and the last bit of the season makes or breaks
              you as a Manchester United player. It is how United have reacted in
              this period of the campaign that makes the difference between a United
              player and an average Premier League player.<br> <br>"It was a nasty atmosphere when we went to Swindon for that match when Eric was sent off. It was horrible. 
                  <br> <br>"Being
              reduced to ten men was a handicap but players stood up to be counted
              and we got a late equaliser to draw 2-2. Sleeves were rolled up and we
              got something from it.<br> <br> <strong>Message</strong> <br> <br>"United
              need a Gary Neville at the moment on the pitch. I think he would have
              sorted Cristiano out on Saturday. I don't mean he would have physically
              got him by the scruff of the neck but he would have got the message
              across and told him a few home truths that his reactions were not
              helping the cause. Referees have a difficult job. We might think some
              of the rules are petty but they have to implement them. <br> <br>"It is their job and they want to progress so they
              have to work with the guidelines they have been given. They have to
              come down on petulance and dissent so the message to the players is:
              `Don't load the bullets. Don't make it easy for referees to punish
              you.'"<br> <br>Fergie had around half an hour with his squad at Craven Cottage before they dispersed for the international break.<br> <br>Parker says they will have left "with a flea in their ear".<br> <br>"Everybody wants to see the gaffer come out in public and have a go at them but that is not his style," Parker added.<br> <br>"The
              players have got to be told to calm down and he will do but it will all
              be done in private. Fergie spoke to Eric Cantona after his
              misdemeanours but he didn't announce it to everyone. But he will have
              got the message, believe me.<br> <br>"He won't allow any indiscipline to continue. 
                  <br> <br>"He'll
              be demanding commonsense and calm from his players. He will make them
              aware of the fact that they mustn't allow opponents and opposition fans
              to get under their skin.<br> <br>"The `94 team cracked a bit at
              that point because of the indiscipline but we quickly recovered because
              it was a team full of strong men.<br> <br>"We refocused on the job and won the double. 
                  <br> <br>"This team now needs to learn their lessons and pull together. Individuals don't win trophies, teams win trophies.<br> <br>"Sir Alex has been there many times before and he'll get a reaction."</p>
