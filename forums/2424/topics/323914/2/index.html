              <p class="articleHeading"> </p>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p class="introcopy"><strong>DIMITAR BERBATOV is to plead with Tottenham to grant him his dream move to Manchester United this week.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Bulgaria striker Berbatov, who is with the Spurs squad at their Spanish training camp, is desperate to complete a switch to Old Trafford after United tabled an opening offer of £20million.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was fully aware his first bid would fail, having seen Manchester City’s £30m approach rejected earlier this year.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">But Ferguson is confident he has sent a strong enough signal to Berbatov, 27, for the player to now force Spurs to lower their £35m asking price.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Ferguson is so sure a deal will be agreed that he will fly with United to their tour of Africa on Wednesday and allow chief executive David Gill to tie up the loose ends.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“I can tell with certainty that Manchester United have expressed an interest in Berbatov. I cannot comment on the issue further,” said Berbatov’s agent, Emil Dantchev.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">United’s bid has thrown Tottenham’s transfer strategy over Berbatov into the air. They would prefer to sell him abroad and were confident of pricing United out of the market.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">When City came calling, Spurs could turn them away in the knowledge Berbatov was not interested in their advances.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">United have been interested in him for more than a year, but Tottenham were hoping Barcelona, Real Madrid or AC Milan would firm up their interest and start a summer auction.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">With Barca, Madrid and Milan prioritising other players, however, Spurs are now stuck in the awkward position of negotiating with the one club Berbatov has always made it clear that he would love to join.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Even if Barcelona were to call off their chase for Arsenal’s Emmanuel Adebayor and rival United’s bid for Berbatov, the Bulgarian is unlikely to  change his mind.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">After former manager Martin Jol left Tottenham last season, he revealed: “I always had a good relationship with Dimitar. But the trouble is he wanted to go to Manchester United.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“It was in his mind and I could do nothing about it.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Following the appointment of new boss Juande Ramos, Dantchev flew to England in November to hold talks with Spurs’ sporting director, Damien Comolli, about his client’s future.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Dantchev made it clear Berbatov wants to be playing in the Champions League next season, but agreed he would shelve any plans to move on and fire the club’s bid to qualify for the UEFA Cup again.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Now, having helped Tottenham win the Carling Cup and secure their place in Europe, Berbatov believes he has kept his end of the bargain and should not be prevented from joining United.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">He has not handed in an official transfer request but will ask Spurs to let him leave for Old Trafford and count on their co-operation in getting a deal done as quickly as possible. United are looking at a £30m package made up of £25m plus add-ons and, although Tottenham will initially reiterate they want £35m, that should be enough to clinch Berbatov, who could play his last game for Spurs in Spain today.</p>

              <h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fergie Cancels Ronaldo Visit To Focus On Berbatov Bid</span></h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/06/240/Alex-Ferguson-Cristiano-Ronaldo_954647.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has reportedly cancelled plans to fly to Lisbon for peace talks with Cristiano Ronaldo in order to focus his attention on the task of buying Dimi Berbatov from Tottenham.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A week after returning to work following a one month holiday in the south of France, Ferguson was due to travel to Portugal for his first meeting with Ronaldo since a party at Old Trafford on May 22 to commemorate their Champions League triumph. It is thought that Ronaldo and Ferguson have not spoken, even on the telephone, since then, and the Manchester United manager has stubbornly refused to acknowledge Ronaldo's apparent desire to leave the club for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, according to The Times, Ferguson was 'ready to spring into action by flying to Portugal this morning to try to end the unedifying stand-off, but that trip has been cancelled, seemingly because the United manager has other priorities'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That includes recruiting Berbatov, with United set to table a second and improved bid for the Bulgarian after Spurs rejected their opening offer of £20m on Friday. Berbatov, who is currently in Spain at Tottenham's pre-season training base, has made no secret of his wish to move to Old Trafford.</p>
