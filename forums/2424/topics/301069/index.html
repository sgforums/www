It's probably more of a traditional number in South America for the best players to wear No 10 compared to here and when you look at the players who have worn it, it feels great to have the number.<br><br>"Hopefully when I've finished people will look back and say the same thing about me."<br><br>While he was younger, it was Liverpool's No 10, Michael Owen who caught his eye.<br><br>"Michael Owen is probably the No.10 I remember watching the most. Even though he played for Liverpool, I still always enjoyed watching him," he told the magazine.<br><br>Rooney singles out Pele and Maradona as two of his greatest idols.<br><br>He said of Pele: "I've watched lots of videos of him and you can see what a brilliant footballer he was. He had two great feet, was strong in the air and also a very good athlete. He's rightly up there as one of the best players of all time."<br><br>Of Maradona, he says: "He's definitely the best player there's ever been in my eyes. He had pace, great skill and an unbelievable desire to win."<br><br>Former Old Trafford legend Denis Law finally presented Rooney with his No 10 shirt.<br><br>He said: Â“He was an unbelievable player, who scored so many goals for the club and for him to hand the shirt over to me was a real honour.<br><br>Â“He was a player who could score any kind of goal. He wasn't the tallest but he was very good in the air. He was also a very brave player and a real goal poacher inside the box.Â”<br><br>Rooney says he changed the way he plays this season moving further up front rather than behind the main striker and he credits team mate Carlos Tevez with helping him.<br><br>Â“I'd probably say I've enjoyed that role more as you seem to get more chances and hopefully that means I'll end up with more goals.<br><br>Â“He's a great player and he's done really well since he joined the club and I think we're working well together. I think our partnership proves that all good players can play together no mater how similar you are.Â”</div>
