              Tevez, Nani and Park set to be ditched
              Sir Alex Ferguson will reshape his humiliated Manchester United squad after their Champions League debacle against Barcelona. Shell-shocked Fergie has decided he will not take up the option to buy Carlos Tevez,  while Nani and Ji-Sung Park could also be high-profile victims of the Rome drubbing. The United manager believes Lyonâ€™s Karim Benzema represents better value for money than Tevez â€“ and to meet Lyonâ€™s Â£30million asking price there will be fall guys. Nani has failed to impress in his second season at United, while Park may be sacrificed so Fergie can bring in Wiganâ€™s Â£15m-rated midfielder Antonio Valencia, a long-term target. Goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak is on his way out this summer after failing to impress in three years, with Fergie keen to give England goalkeeper Ben Foster more first-team opportunities next season. United will not take up the option to buy Tevez unless the playerâ€™s advisers, led by Kia Joorabchian, lower their asking price by a third to around Â£18m.
              David McDonnell &amp; John Cross, The Mirror
              
              Meanwhile, The Sun claim Cristiano Ronaldo is about to "throw Manchester United into turmoil and demand a move out of Old Trafford". If he does, The Express believe he won't be going to Real Madrid. The paper report Madrid have stopped their pursuit of the Reds winger.
              
              There's some surprising news in The Guardian and The Mail, with claims that Paul Scholes is considering a player-coach role at Stoke City. Scholes has recently admitted he would relish the challenge of management in the future.

              <p>well, over the course of time where SAF was the manager, he did mould and shape the MU team a few times.</p>
              <p>Given how this team was outplayed in the centre, he would have realised he need something more and hence he is out to get it.</p>
              <p>I do have confidence that he knows what he is doing.</p>
