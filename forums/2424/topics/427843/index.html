              <p><strong>Although <a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Wayne-Rooney.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> is unavailable for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final nobody will ever forget the indelible mark he made on the most recent Manchester derby with his <a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2011/Feb/Video-Watch-Waynes-winner.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">stunning overhead kick</span></span></a>. </strong></p>
              <p>It was a moment of sheer genius from our No.10 and one that was a subject of debate when <strong><a href="http://www.themagazineshop.com/all-titles/inside-united"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Inside United</span></span></em></a></strong> caught up with the man himself and team-mates <a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Michael-Carrick.aspx"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Michael Carrick</span></span></strong></a><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Wes-Brown.aspx"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wes Brown</span></span></strong></a>...</p>
              <p><strong>Can you talk us through your goal Wayne…<br>WR</strong>: It came off my shin didn’t it?! [Laughs]<br><strong>MC</strong>: That shin-pad deserves a lot of credit!<br><strong>WR</strong>: I just remember Nani’s cross taking a deflection and the ball coming over and just hitting it. You’re always working on your technique, but goals like that are just instinctive. When I was in the air, I remember Berba shouting towards me as if to say ‘what are you doing?!’ Then I turned round and it was in the top corner.<br><strong>MC</strong>: He was just gutted because you’d taken Goal of the Season off him! [All laugh]</p>
              <p><strong>How many times have you watched it?<br>WR</strong>: [Smiles] A few! It’s amazing the amount of the people who have come up and asked me to sign pictures of it since. To score a goal like that in a Manchester derby was a great feeling and it’s definitely one of the biggest buzzes I’ve felt after a goal.<br><strong>WB</strong>: It’s one of the biggest buzzes I’ve felt after a goal and I wasn’t even playing!</p>
              <p><strong>Where does it rank in terms of goals you’ve scored?<br>WR</strong>: It’s the best I’ve scored in a game but if you ask the lads they’ll tell you I score goals like that every day in training. So it was nice to do it in a game this time!<br>[All laugh]<br><strong>WB</strong>: No chance.<br><strong>MC</strong>: I’ve been here nearly five years and I’ve never seen him score a goal like that in training!<br><strong>WB</strong>: Don’t forget about that goal against Newcastle Wazza [volley in 2004/05]…<br><strong>MC</strong>: The City goal was more important though.<br><strong>WB</strong>: Yeah it was but I wanted to mention the Newcastle goal so I got a mention because I scored in that game too!</p>
              <p><strong>The celebration was Cantona-esque…<br>WR</strong>: Rio asked me to do it before the game. I don’t know why I remembered, but as I was running away to celebrate it came into my head to do it.</p>
              <p><strong>What about you guys, what was your view of it? Michael you were just about to come on and Wes you were on the bench… <br>MC</strong>: I was close to doing a Mourinho-style celebration down the touchline but I didn’t have my suit on! Me and Michael Owen were standing pitchside and I think MO ran all the way down to you didn’t he?<br><strong>WR</strong>: Yeah he did.<br><strong>MC</strong>: I didn’t really know what to do or where to run, I just went mad where I was stood like every other United fan inside the ground. The emotion of that moment was unbelievable. I had to remember to calm myself down though because I knew I’d be coming on pretty much straight away.<br><strong>WB</strong>: I completely lost the plot in the dug-out. I was jumping on Chicha and then I started grabbing Strudders [Tony Strudwick]! For that two or three seconds after you’re just lost in the moment.<br><strong>MC</strong>: Yeah I think everything comes to you in that one instant - the importance of the game, the goal you’ve just witnessed and the fact it’s a derby.<br><strong>WR</strong>: I remember waving up to the box where my family sit just after the goal because Coleen had brought Kai to the match, but when I saw Coleen afterwards she said she’d had to leave about a minute before I scored. I couldn’t believe it!</p>
