              <div class="KonaBody">Powell has been closely monitored by a number of Premier League suitors throughout the year, and his move to Old Trafford was confirmed earlier in the week, with the two clubs agreeing an initial £3 million fee. <br><br>Gradi - who has spent almost 30 years at Grestly Road - has overseen the development of a number of talented players in his time at the club, but believes Powell is among the best to have graduated from Crewe's widely heralded academy.<br><br>He told <em>MUTV</em>: "Nick Powell is a match winner. He doesn't rely on other people to make the goals for him. He's not a six-yard box player. In fact, we've been trying to encourage him to get in that six-yard box more. But he picks the ball up, runs at people and finishes with a goal. He wins matches on his own."<br><br>Crewe's youth system has produced a number of top-level players over the years, such as David Platt and former West Ham striker Dean Ashton, however Gradi believes Powell is a different type of player to those who have rolled off the club's conveyor belt in the past.<br><br>He added: "We've had some terrific players at Crewe who went on to play for England, but Nick's not the same as any of them. He does a similar job to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain."<br><br>Gradi also revealed that while a number of clubs were interested in acquiring Powell's services, Sir Alex Ferguson's personal approach to the matter helped the Red Devils secure his signature.<br><br>"There were [other clubs interested] but I have to say Sir Alex wanted Nick more than anybody else did and worked harder at it," Gradi said. <br><br>"I was very impressed with the way Sir Alex went about it and what he said. <br><br>"If he was trying to sign me, I'd have signed!

              <p>I agree but I think united are signing too many youngsters. I think they will need to make at least 1 big name signing. A creative midfielder, else we fucked.</p>
