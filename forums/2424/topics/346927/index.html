              <h2>FERGIE LAUDS CARRICK INFLUENCE</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/01/240/Michael-Carrick-Mikel-Arteta_1857100.jpg" border="0" alt="Carrick - praise from Ferguson."></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Unsung hero Michael Carrick returns to West Ham on Sunday at least aware the man who really matters is fully aware of his contribution to the Manchester United cause. It is now almost five years since Carrick quit the Hammers for Tottenham, having helped steer the east London club out of the Championship, where they had dropped under Glenn Roeder.</strong></p>
              <p>At the time Carrick's talents were overlooked as attention remained on the perceived superior attributes of Joe Cole and Frank Lampard. When he moved to Spurs nothing much changed in a team that contained Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe and the anonymity has continued at United and with England.</p>
              <p>Despite boasting two titles and a Champions League medal, when talk surfaces about the main influences at the Red Devils, Carrick's name is hardly ever mentioned.</p>
              <p>And Fabio Capello hardly picked the Wallsend-born star as debate raged over the midfield partnership between Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.</p>
              <p>Some stunning recent performances, for England in Germany and, last week, for United against Everton, may have finally awoken some minds to Carrick's contribution. But Ferguson feels the 27-year-old is destined to be one of the many players he has had at United whose true value is not always obvious.</p>
              <p>"People have their favourites and when you are supporting a club like United where there are players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney, it is easy to declare your allegiance to the ones who are in the limelight all the time," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes other players get overlooked. "It has happened to quite a few in my time, especially the quieter ones. "Denis Irwin gave me eight or nine out of 10 every week but he never had the celebrity status of people like David Beckham or Eric Cantona. Michael Carrick may come into that category because football clubs are all the same."</p>
              <p>But Ferguson knew exactly what he was getting when he spent Â£18.6million on the midfielder, who also spent time on loan with Birmingham and Swindon. But the Scot has not been content just to use Carrick's vision. He has made the player work on the less honed parts of his game too. And, when Capello names Carrick in his squad to face Spain next Wednesday, Ferguson feels he will be getting one of the best defensive midfield players in the game.</p>
              <p>"Michael was already good enough for me to sign him because what he always had, from his young days at West Ham, was vision and a good range of passing that could open up defences.</p>
              <p>"Since coming to United, he has developed physically and improved tremendously in defensive terms. "In that department he is top drawer now.</p>
              <p>"He fills positions really well and nips off threats going towards the back four. That is an area that maybe people don't recognise because they just expect him to be playing football and making passes.</p>
              <p>"But overall, he is an excellent player."</p>
