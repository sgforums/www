              <p>Liverpool are back to full form with the likes of Torres, Gerrard, Mascherano and Agger taking Trafford pitch.</p>
              <p>Manchester Utd are too, back to full form.</p>
              <p>It will definitely be an intriguing match, but I can't imagine Liverpool fans singing ' You'll Never Walk Alone' in Old Trafford. Man Utd fans would be wishing that they can bash up some Pool fans during the 3-4 minutes of singing.</p>

              <p>this time i guess man utd would finally win after losing their last few games against them.</p>

              <p>but then torres is off form and fergueson might not use vidic knowing vidic cmi against torres and always like to collect red cards against pool. hoho</p>

              <p><strong>United angry as Liverpool's Steven Gerrard escapes FA probe</strong></p>

              <p class="caption">Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, left, vies for the ball with Portsmouth's Michael Brown. Photograph: Tim Hales/AP</p>
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Steven Gerrard" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/steven-gerrard"><span style="color: #005689;">Steven Gerrard</span></a> has escaped disciplinary action over for the use of his forearm against Portsmouth's Michael Brown in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a>'s 4-1 win yesterday. The decision has incensed <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> and led to allegations that the Football Association has employed double standards. Had he been found guilty of violent conduct, Gerrard would have been banned from Liverpool's trip to Old Trafford on Sunday. The collision with Gerrard knocked Brown to the floor.</p>
              <p>United's anger stems mostly from the fact that the defender Rio Ferdinand was banned for three games for swinging an arm into the face of Craig Fagan during a 4-0 win against Hull in January. That punishment was increased by one match after Ferdinand appealed. The champions will not make official comment on Gerrard's case but privately they have admitted to being surprised by the verdict and not understanding why the Liverpool captain has been let off. The ruling is also likely to go down badly among Liverpool's rivals for the fourth Champions League place.</p>
              <p>The FA says it cannot act because the referee concerned, Stuart Attwell, has maintained that Gerrard's offence did not merit a booking or a red card.</p>
              <p>In Ferdinand's case, the incident was missed by the referee, Steve Bennett, who said that he would have shown a red card had he seen it. Attwell has told the FA that he was satisfied with how he dealt with the incident, by awarding Portsmouth a free-kick and speaking to Gerrard.</p>
              <p>The United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, feels that his team are punished more severely than other clubs. At Ferdinand's hearing United's legal team cited the FA's failure to charge Liverpool's Javier Mascherano over a similar incident involving the Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford at Elland Road in September.</p>
              <p>Attwell's view that he was in control of the incident is unlikely to improve his reputation. The youngest <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> referee by some distance, at 27, he has become known for mistakes, most notoriously the award of a "ghost goal" in a match between Watford and Reading in September 2008.</p>
              <p>Gerrard escaped punishment from the FA last week after making a two-fingered gesture towards the referee Andre Marriner in a 1-0 defeat at Wigan. Rafael Benítez, the Liverpool manager, responded to Monday's incident by substituting his captain.</p>

              <p>one thing, Rio and Vidic just can't deal with Torres one on one, so they need to clamp him together.. Vidic seems to drop to a low whenever he faces torres.</p>

              <p><strong>United hungrier for Sunday crunch</strong></p>
              <p>Anybody worried by Liverpool’s apparent return to form on Monday night? No. I didn’t think so.<br><br>Although the scoreline - 4-1 to Rafa Benitez’s also-rans - may make your blood run cold with memories of last March’s meeting at Old Trafford, that’s about the only modicum of apprehension you could draw from their home win over rock-bottom Portsmouth. (Given their previous losses to Wigan and Lille).<br><br>Okay, so Fernando Torres scored twice and we all know what he did last spring to Nemanja Vidic, but he has another game to play before coming to OT on Sunday. Surely a knife-edge tie with Lille on Thursday night - and the requirement to overturn a first-leg deficit – is the last thing the Spanish striker needs after his struggles with injury this season.<br><br>Liverpool playing twice this week while United can either rest or sharpen up tactics on the training ground, whatever the manager may decide, could lead to moans from Merseyside about the unfair fixture list. But the pile-up is a problem of their own making – entry into the Europa League being a forefeit for Champions League failure.<br><br>Therein lies my biggest bugbear about European football’s other competition… that teams who couldn’t cut the mustard at the top table are given seconds at another sitting.<br><br>How must it feel to be Fulham, who’ve battled admirably through 12 games in the Europa League since July, only to have a Champions League flop fall squarely in front them. And if the likes of Juventus or Liverpool go on to win the trophy, will it not be a hollow triumph? They’re only there because they failed elsewhere. They didn't set out their stall last summer to win it.<br><br>That’s my personal view on the Europa League, and while the format irritates me, it might work out to United’s advantage given the heavy schedule that’s been imposed on Liverpool. It remains to be seen what side Benitez will put out against Lille – which is more important to him, the need to stay in the hunt for fourth place with a positive result at OT, or the mission to avoid yet another trophyless season?<br><br>Whatever the Spaniard’s selection on Sunday, I doubt the Merseysiders will be able to live with United this time around. Even if Steven Gerrard is free to play after the FA's decision not to punish him for his clash with Pompey's Michael Brown on Monday night.<br><br>The on-fire Wayne Rooney would love nothing more than to notch one or two more goals against the old enemy as he chases the 42 mark and the desire to end a hoodoo of three consecutive defeats, including last season’s freak result at OT, will burn fiercely in the home dressing room.<br><br>In short, Sir Alex’s men will want the points more – for the sake of the title, and that’s something the opposition stopped playing for weeks, if not months, ago.</p>

              <p>Liverpool need to play in Europa league tommorrow, so they have less time to receover than United, who has a week to rest and recover.</p>
              <p>that said, I think either rafa may think that either the europa league or the united match has to give. given the importance of qualifying for 4th place, he may well sacrifise the europa league against Lille, even though it is held at Anfield. He pay rest the regulars like Torres and Gerrard and play the likes of Ngog and Babel.</p>
