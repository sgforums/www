              <p>Manchester United midfielder <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8871"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Darren Fletcher</span></span></a> expects Liverpool to raise their game when they visit Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Despite beating Portsmouth at home on Monday, Rafael Benitez's side have endured a frustrating campaign. After finishing second last season, they are now chasing fourth place in the table rather than the title.</p>
              <p>Liverpool lie 15 points adrift of league leaders United but will be comforted by the 4-1 victory at Old Trafford a year ago and Fletcher, 25, says they will have to be on their guard.</p>
              <p>"It would be very dangerous to think this is a poor Liverpool side coming to Old Trafford because they are anything but," he told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.</p>
              <p>"It would be a huge mistake to think that Liverpool are not a threat. They maybe haven't had the season we expected after last year but they are still a dangerous side.</p>
              <p>"They are still in the main the same team. We know what they are capable of and pushed us all the way and dished out that defeat here and the one at Anfield this season. They are still fresh in our memories.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool still have a lot to play for because they are battling for fourth spot. They are capable of beating anyone.</p>
              <p>"We have to learn the lessons from last year's game. The warnings are there. If you are not 100% focused and you make mistakes they will punish you.</p>
              <p>"It is a real surprise to me they haven't been up with us, but they will still be fired up to win at Old Trafford again."</p>

              <p><strong>Fergie perplexed by 'crazy' FA panel</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has accused the Football Association of running a "dysfunctional" disciplinary system.</span></p>
              <p><span><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/08/330/Fergie1_2345006.jpg" alt="" width="386" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Ferguson: Baffled by disciplinary panel</em></span></p>
              <p><span><span id="intelliTXT">Less than two months after Rio Ferdinand was handed what turned out to be a four-match ban for an attack on Hull's Craig Fagan at Old Trafford that was not spotted by referee Steve Bennett at the time, Ferguson has seen Steven Gerrard twice emerge from incidents that could have landed him in hot water. </span></span></p>
              <p>United would have expected Gerrard to be charged at least once after appearing to make a gesture towards referee Andre Marriner during Liverpool's defeat at Wigan last week and then catching Portsmouth's Michael Brown with a late challenge at Anfield on Monday.</p>
              <p>Instead, Gerrard is free to play in Sunday lunchtime's duel between the Red Devils and Liverpool at Old Trafford, and potentially play a pivotal role in this season's title race.</p>
              <p>A long time critic of the FA's handling of disciplinary matters, Ferguson claims to no longer care about their handling of individual issues.</p>
              <p>Clearly though, the Scot is perturbed.</p>
              <p>"I didn't expect them to be charging Steven Gerrard simply because I think it is a dysfunctional unit, the FA," he said.</p>
              <p>"I don't think they know what they are doing.</p>
              <p>"There is no consistency for a start. I didn't expect to get any.</p>
              <p>"I am not too bothered about it. They can do what they want down there. It is crazy at times."</p>
              <p>Ferguson must put all that to one side though as his side look for three points that would keep them at the Premier League summit.</p>
              <p>At the start of the season, the clash at Old Trafford was billed as a potential championship decider.</p>
              <p>However, instead of building on their second-placed finish last term, Liverpool have crumbled, not even certain to claim a Champions League spot.</p>
              <p>Not that Ferguson is entirely surprised.</p>
              <p>Although he gave Rafael Benitez plenty of credit for masterminding Liverpool's challenge last term, the Scot always had a feeling it was the best that Reds team could manage.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you peak with a particular team and it is difficult to do it again," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"Everyone expected Liverpool to do better. But they are not.</p>
              <p>"Their challenge, along with quite a few others, is to get that fourth spot, which seems to be a league of its own."</p>
              <p>Not that Ferguson's observations extend to any sympathy for Benitez, just an acknowledgement, in the week Phil Brown lost his job at Hull, that the management game is now a very tough one.</p>
              <p>"The word sympathy is a bit strong," he said.</p>
              <p>"You feel for any manager who doesn't do well.</p>
              <p>"Phil Brown was sacked during the week. Yet given the players and potential of his team, I am not sure anyone expected that Hull would be in anything other than a dog-fight this season.</p>
              <p>"It happens every season. It is not something new."</p>
              <p>It is a long time since Ferguson was sacked, and it is inconceivable it will happen again.</p>
              <p>The United boss, who has Ryan Giggs available this weekend after the veteran Welshman recovered from the broken hand he suffered at Aston Villa last month, is currently gunning for his 12th title, and a record 19th for his club, which would also represent an unprecedented fourth on the trot.</p>
              <p>An end to Liverpool's three-match winning streak in these fixtures, all of which have ended with the dismissal of Nemanja Vidic, would allow United to maintain their present momentum.</p>
              <p>Ferguson certainly believes there will be no repeat of the 4-1 defeat United suffered at the hands of their old rivals in the corresponding game last term.</p>
              <p>"Last season was a one-off," said Ferguson. "It won't happen again. I can assure you of that. Absolutely no chance."</p>
              <p>An unknown factor has been added to the title picture following Chelsea's surprise elimination from the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Ferguson cannot be certain how that disappointment will affect the Londoners.</p>
              <p>He just knows staying on top at this stage of the season is vital.</p>
              <p>"Being on top of the league at this stage of this season would make us difficult to get back at," he said.</p>
              <p>"I don't place that much importance on the 19th title. The more important one would be the 20th. This club is capable of doing that.</p>
              <p>"We could also win four titles in a row. No-one will do that in a hurry. That is something to ponder on."</p>
