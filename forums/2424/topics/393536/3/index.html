              <p>neville high leg never yellow card even.</p>

              <p>ref seems to be always on MU side.</p>
              <p>but torres also lousy in 2nd half. missed two golden opportunities first one was trying what scissors kick.</p>
              <p>at least this means pool hard to go get CL spot then torres will leave. go chelsea best. and get rid of anelka he is invisible with drogba around.</p>
              <p>can see pool standard is lousy. look at their defenders all are youngsters. midfield ppl like aqua man is like dont know what role he is supposed to be: not attacking or defending, &amp; all the midfielders save gerrard and benayoun have no clue to attack or penetrate defence. </p>
              <p>even park is better than benayoun and ben is considered one of the better pool players already.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United came from behind to clamber back to the Premier League summit, trampling on Liverpool's top-four hopes in the process. Park Ji-sung headed home the winner after an hour, securing the spoils after Wayne Rooney's 33rd goal of the season had controversially levelled Fernando Torres' fifth-minute opener.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although victory was not achieved without a nervy ending, during which Torres spurned a glorious chance to equalise, the result kept United's noses in front of Arsenal and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>For Liverpool though, fight was not enough. When they scored four times in the corresponding fixture last season, it appeared to open the door to that championship Holy Grail.</p>
              <p>Not only has that been proved fool's gold, a 10th defeat of the season leaves them requiring slip-ups from Tottenham and others just to finish in a Champions League spot.</p>
              <p>What Rafael Benitez claimed before Christmas was a guaranteed fourth-place finish could hardly be further away.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson once claimed that a game of tiddlywinks between what the majority still believe to be England's biggest clubs could trigger the deepest of passions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/21/article-1259581-08CF6A1E000005DC-279_468x295.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="468" height="295">

              <p><strong>Certainly there was no sense of inferiority from the visitors despite their present status, and with good reason. It was the Merseysiders who had won the last three meetings - each of which featured the dismissal of Nemanja Vidic, who it seems in Torres has found someone he simply cannot handle.</strong></p>
              <p>Such is the mystique surrounding that duel there was an audible gasp the first time Torres ran at the Serbian. Like so much of the opening period's final half-hour, it petered out disappointingly. The spark had been ignited long before that, although Torres was the one who flicked the switch.</p>
              <p>By his very demeanour, Torres gave the impression of being a man on a mission.</p>
              <p>Five minutes into the contest, he seized on the loose ball after Michael Carrick had lost possession, sending Steven Gerrard away at top speed with an inspired backheel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/21/article-1259581-08CF666A000005DC-445_468x320.jpg" alt="Fernando Torres" width="468" height="320">

              </div>
              <p><strong>As Gerrard found Dirk Kuyt to his right, Torres continued his own run, United's defence never set properly to ensure the Spaniard remained under their control.</strong></p>
              <p>By the time Kuyt dug out his cross, Torres was on his own. Park's wayward effort from a similar position later on proved the goal was anything but the routine effort it looked to be as the Spanish star guided the ball out of Edwin van der Sar's reach.</p>
              <p>Quite apart from falling behind against such fierce rivals, an increasingly enthralling title race demanded a United comeback. For Liverpool, the equaliser came far too quickly. The controversy was immediate too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/21/article-1259581-08CF52BB000005DC-10_468x286.jpg" alt="Rooney " width="468" height="286">

              <p><strong>Benitez argued Javier Mascherano's attempt to haul back Antonio Valencia was outside the box, which, indeed, was where the infringement began. Ferguson countered the combative midfielder had prevented a clear goalscoring opportunity.</strong></p>
              <p>The managers - no friends these two - continued their finger-jabbing row long after Wayne Rooney had tucked home the rebound from a spot-kick awarded by Howard Webb and saved by Pepe Reina.</p>
              <p>That was it for the goal threat until the hour mark arrived. During his long career, Gary Neville has gone on plenty of unselfish runs down the right wing, knowing David Beckham or, more latterly, Cristiano Ronaldo were never going to give him the ball.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher is not quite of that attacking calibre but Neville must have sensed his run was purely to provide space for the Scot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/21/article-1259581-08CF686C000005DC-48_468x347.jpg" alt=" Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafa Benitez " width="468" height="347">

              </div>
              <p><strong>So it proved. As Neville flew past on the overlap, Emiliano Insua edged to his right. In an instant, Fletcher had exploited the gap and curled over a cross.</strong></p>
              <p>As Rooney and Jamie Carragher tussled and tugged, Park arrived behind them, launching himself at the ball like a guided missile and powering the diving header into the corner of Reina's goal.</p>
              <p>Rooney had one more chance before the end, which he fired wide. Torres was on the end of a far better one when Steven Gerrard drilled over a low cross near the end.</p>
              <p>For once against United, the Spaniard miscued and Yossi Benayoun headed the loose ball straight at Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>United could celebrate, Neville and Ferguson doing the cheerleading. Liverpool's money men are staring at a big black hole marked Champions League,<br>Benitez is failing on his guarantees.</p>

              <p><br>wont be surprised if chelsea finish 3rd in EPL this season. ancelotti methods either are make or break. do well or blow up in face. if they lose to wigan and draw with west ham you know something is wrong.</p>
              <p>ancelotti does not play to win from the starting whistle. to win need to score goals right off the bat but he sort of like rojak his team and strategy and see how it turns out. only at 70 mins then put on more attackers: have-beens like cole and kalou. what a dumbass</p>
              <p>he losing or lose also forever that bo chup face.</p>
              <p>hope abromavich also gave him the 'are you a good manager or just a high paid manager' talk.</p>

              <p><strong>Battling spirit delights Fletcher</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/10/03/330/Wayne-Rooney-goal-Manchester-United-v-Liverpo_2433938.jpg" alt="" width="393" height="257"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Darren Fletcher praised the way Manchester United were able to "grind out" victory over Liverpool to go back to the top of the Premier League.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Fernando Torres gave the visitors a fifth-minute lead, only for Wayne Rooney to equalise in controversial fashion, tucking home the rebound from a penalty given for a Javier Mascherano foul on Antonio Valencia which had started outside the area.</p>
              <p>In a second half of few clear-cut chances, Park Ji-sung headed home the winner after an hour when he came through a crowd of bodies to finish Fletcher's superb cross.</p>
              <p>The Scotland international hailed the character of Sir Alex Ferguson's men, who are chasing a record fourth successive championship.</p>
              <p>"It was a difficult game, with not much football played," Fletcher told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>"You want to win the title with flowing football, but sometimes you have to grind out results and show character - that is what we did."</p>
              <p>Fletcher maintained referee Howard Webb was right to give a penalty.</p>
              <p>"I definitely thought it was a foul," said the United midfielder.</p>
              <p>"He was pulling Valencia and the contact with his legs was right on the edge of the box.</p>
              <p>"The keeper saved it, but Wazza (Rooney) is so composed that he was able to tap it in afterwards."</p>
              <p>United returned to the top of the table, ahead of Arsenal by two points, with Chelsea, who still have a match in hand, set to face Blackburn this afternoon.</p>
              <p>"The team which puts the most consistent run together will probably be champions, and we are making a good fist of it," Fletcher added.</p>

              <p>well, I see it from another angle, the team who go behind first but who can find an answer will win.</p>
              <p>MU did find it, yes, they did not play spectularly, but they got the results. Y? Pool's first priority is to negate MU, and not to impose themselves. Hence I can sense Agger's outcry cause he is not seeing anything moving, and thus he unleases a few shots that almost went out of OT.</p>

              <p>torres is really a gem, his movement, strength, pace, he is really awesome.</p>
              <p>but now on top of his head, he seems more focused to get his views across than to stick to his primary task.</p>
              <p>Look @ how he kick out at the penalty spot b4 Rooney were to place the ball, a petty ref would have given him another card.</p>
              <p>like per what i read, he seems to want the EPL season to end impatiently, but worse for him, he will find himself in a galaxy of stars with medals/trophies..</p>
