            <div class='col-md body'>Wayne Rooney is getting back to his best, according to Ryan Giggs, who believes his team-mate was influential in the 3-1 win over Wigan on Saturday.<br><br>The 20-year-old forward hasn't scored in two months since his double against Fulham on the opening day of the season. But Rooney, like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ryan Giggs, was an outstanding performer as the Reds responded to a poor first half display with a match-winning secong 45 minutes at the JJB Stadium.<br><br>Rooney hit the bar and had several close attempts against Paul Jewell's side, but United fans and Giggs were heartened by his display.<br><br>"Players go through spells like [Wayne has been], it doesn't matter who you are," said Giggs.<br><br>"The thing about him is that he is working hard and that is the key if you are not playing unbelievably every week. You work hard to get out of troughs but he has never shown things were bothering him.<br><br>"Against Wigan he was brilliant. He could have scored four or five times. When things are going for you, some of the shots he had go in.<br><br>"But the goals will come and the lads are confident he will continue to produce performances like the one on Saturday."<br><br>Welsh winger Giggs came on at half time as United switched to a more effective 4-4-2 for the second half and immediately made an impact.<br><br>Clever touches, intelligent movement and winding runs caused Wigan no end of problems down the left flank.<br><br>It was the 32-year-old's first outing since damaging his hamstring against Celtic in the Champions League a month ago. Giggs now plans to play the full match against Copenhagen on Tuesday.<br><br>"I could still feel the hamstring a little bit but it is not too bad," he said. "A half was what I needed really and hopefully, I might get a full game against Copenhagen. That is the plan."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With an eye on this weekend's crucial match against Liverpool, I think SAF will look to rest some players.<br><br>FC Copenhagen shld be relatively easy given also they are playing @ OT.  If Man U don't screw up, they shld breeze past and ensure qualification with this win.<br><br>Now, SAF better prep the players properly cos Man U need to win to ensure they are still in the lead, with Arsenal in resurgent form and Chelsea ever so strong.  I certainly don't want to hear the stupid excuse that the players overstretched themselves playing in CL (like what SAF said after their loss to Arsenal).<br><br>Chelsea have a tough match against Barca, and its a good opportunity for teams to gain points against Chelsea since Cech is not around...yeah.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
