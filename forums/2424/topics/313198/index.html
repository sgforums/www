              <p>Roma midfielder David Pizarro rates Cristiano Ronaldo as a great player but reckons the Manchester United winger has a lot to learn regarding sportsmanship.</p>
              <p>Pizarro accused Ronaldo of showing arrogance and a lack of respect towards his opponents in United's 2-0 Champions League quarter-final first-leg win in the Eternal City on Tuesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo, who scored the opener with a stunning header and almost made it 3-0 when he hit the bar, was booed by the home crowd for teasing opposing defenders with his tricks on the pitch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Despite the fact that he is a great champion, he is very arrogant,' said Pizarro. 'He does certain spiteful things on the pitch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'This is the ugliest thing for a player. In the return leg I will have something to say to him.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Portugal international defended his actions after helping his team put one foot in the semi-finals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It's nothing against my rivals,' said the 23-year-old. 'Those plays are just part of my way of interpreting football.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I have always done them, even three or four years ago when I was younger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'But there are plays that I do for the good of the team and never to ridicule my opponents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I tried to do the best for Manchester United and not to make a show. It's just a part of who I am.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo believes Roma have improved since last year - when United eliminated the Giallorossi with a humiliating 7-1 defeat at Old Trafford at the same stage of the competition - but says United have also also grown stronger in the last 12 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I don't think we can talk about a Roma weakness but rather about the strength of Manchester United,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Last season we didn't know Roma but this time, we have been perfect in defence.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite his team having taken a giant step towards the last four, Ronaldo prefers to remain cautious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It would be bad to think we have done the job,' he warned. 'We have next week's game and although a win away from home gives us confidence, we still have to seal qualification</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well i saw some nasty challenges on ronaldo when he was doing those spiteful tricks..perhaps pizzaro could'nt take the humilation..</p>

              <p>if the tricks are to get pass a player or entertain, I have nothing against, but if used to insult and taunt, then not too welcome.</p>
              <p>I would still recall the one that nani did, which was perfectly okie as his back was to the player and he was actually trying to bring it away from the opponent to then turn.</p>
              <p>saying which, rome was sacked.. so I would keep quiet if I am pizarro and maybe use that energy for the return leg.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">THE ITALIANS really have the hump with Cristiano Ronaldo. Roma’s players did not take kindly to him embarrassing them with his silky skills in front of their own fans in the Olympic Stadium. But that will not worry this fella when Manchester United take them on again in the return at Old Trafford on Wednesday because he is as brave as they come.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">There’s no way he’ll be intimidated into hiding from defenders with a grudge. He’s not just physically courageous, he’s mentally tough as well. He always wants the ball, even when the opposition are angry and going for him.</p>
              <h4>Ronaldo has the lot</h4>
              <p class="article">And you can forget all this rubbish about him showboating to humiliate defenders. The fact is Ronaldo does his tricks ALL the time, not just when the game is won. That’s what makes him so effective. He has such a repertoire of ways to beat opponents that he simply leaves defenders chasing shadows.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Pace, power, athleticism, skill, awareness, courage, he’s got the lot. If they were voting for World Player of the Year right now, Ronaldo would walk it. When he first arrived in England people complained he was always diving for free-kicks. But that was simply down to his culture.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">In Spain, Italy and Portugal the skilful forwards punish bad defending. If someone is clumsy enough to dive in and make a rash challenge, they will go down, especially around the area. Now defenders realise they have to be certain they’re going to win the ball before they commit themselves.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">A lot of people wonder why teams don’t man-mark Ronaldo. That would be fine if United were a one-man team but they have so many exceptional players. It was the same with George Best. You could not put all your efforts into stopping him because Denis Law or Bobby Charlton would hurt you instead.</p>
              <p class="article">The great thing about Ronaldo is he is inspiring Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez to match his achievements. Those two have stretched themselves to new levels this season. Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool have had to raise their game to stay in touch with United. The clubs below them are also improving and so on and so on . . .</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">There has never been a better time to watch club football in England and that is something to celebrate. We all applauded Arsenal’s beautiful football and now United are doing the same thing — and scoring at the end of their wonderful approach play.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Roma are just as free to show their ability at Old Trafford as Ronaldo. Trouble is, they haven’t got anyone to match him. It’s not anger on Roma’s part — it’s jealousy.</p>

              dismissed moaning Roma over the showboating of Cristiano Ronaldo on
              Tuesday night.</span>
              <p><span> Ronaldo's sparkling display and brilliant goal
              earned him only rebukes from Roma players and officials, who branded
              him disrespectful with his tricks.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Ferguson said: "The most important message
              Cristiano is giving out is that he is a great player who is not afraid
              to take the ball and beat a man.</span></p>

              </table>
              <span>"That is what he is saying in whatever fashion
              he does it. He has ability and expression in his play and we encourage
              that with all the players.</span></p>
              <p><span>"In this modern day it's a breath of fresh air and he will not be afraid to do it.</span></p>
              <p><span>"That is what people pay to see. Perhaps it annoys opponents he is prepared to take the ball to them."</span></p>
              <p><span>Roma, as many other teams have done, tried unsuccessfully to kick, barge and elbow Ronaldo, 23, out of the game.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Ferguson has a warning for them - and any
              Middlesbrough player who might fancy trying it tomorrow in the league
              clash at the Riverside.</span></p>
              <p><span>He insisted: "Ronaldo is a winner. They cannot kick him out of the game.</span></p>
              <p><span>"He will always get up and carry on playing.</span></p>
              <p><span>"It will not worry him if Roma come looking for him in the second leg." </span></p>

              <p><strong>Roma coach Luciano Spalletti has apologised for comments the Italian club made about Cristiano Ronaldo in the wake of Manchester United's 2-0 Champions League win in the Olympic Stadium last week. Roma midfielder David Pizarro and club director Bruno Conti both accused Ronaldo of showboating in last week's game.</strong></p>
              <p>But speaking at Old Trafford ahead of Wednesday's return leg at Old Trafford, Spalletti said: "Some of the things said by our club after the game were perhaps said in the heat of the moment, because we had the bitter taste of defeat in our mouths.</p>
              <p>"Our comments had the bitterness of defeat in them. "We were disappointed after that game. "Sometimes we may say things that we normally would not. That is what happened. " Cristiano Ronaldo is an excellent player. It is something that he has shown through his game. "He is a very exuberant player and a very fair player. He is a very correct player. Thats what he does on the pitch."</p>
              <p>Rome must score at least twice to have a chance of stopping United reaching the last four. Spalletti added: "It would be presumptious of me to come here and say that we were going to impose ourselves on United and do this or do that. "It is important to be humble. Humility is a very important quality.</p>
              <p>"We need to work hard against a team like United, a team that has players who are prepared to give everything for their team. "If I sat here and said what we were going to do to them it might provoke them and then it could rebound on us. "But I believe my players are capable of overturning any score.</p>
              <p>"I know them very well and they can do this. Anything can happen. I look at Sir Alex Ferguson. He is a wonderful example for all managers."</p>
