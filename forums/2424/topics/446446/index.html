              <p><strong>Ravel Morrison signed for </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">West Ham United</span></strong><strong> from </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span></strong><strong> for an initial £650,000 fee that could rise to £2m including add-ons, with the 18-year-old also agreeing personal terms related to his performance. Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager, hopes that Morrison can help the Championship leaders to seal automatic promotion to the Premier League following relegation last season.</strong></p>
              <p>The deal finally went through at around 8.30pm after Morrison passed a medical. Morrison's salary will start at around £12,000 a week with this possibly increasing to as much as £65,000. The rising sliding scale will be triggered only if West Ham regain their Premier League status. Then, after a certain number of top-flight starts, his salary would rise incrementally towards the £65,000 ceiling.</p>
              <p>Morrison's contract at United was to expire in the summer and they decided to sell now rather than having to go before a tribunal at the end of the season. United had reportedly offered Morrison a new deal which the player was considering when West Ham's bid was accepted.</p>
              <p>As Morrison had his medical with West Ham, Allardyce said: "Ravel is a talented lad and if he really wants to be a player then we will help him as much as we can along the way. Perhaps a change of environment will be beneficial to him and help him make that step up to first-team football quicker than perhaps would have been the case at Manchester United. There is no doubt he has exceptional talent."</p>
              <p>Although Ferguson and the coaches at United's Carrington training base admired Morrison's technical ability, the midfielder's firstâ€‘team chances were limited to three Carling Cup appearances and he has also attracted attention for a number of off-field issues.</p>
              <p>"I'm really pleased to have signed," Morrison said. "The move has happened very quickly and I'm looking forward to hopefully moving up to the Premier League with West Ham soon. I'm an attacking player and I'm hoping to get the fans on their feet."</p>

              <h1>Ravel Morrison seeks salvation with West Ham after rejection by Manchester United</h1>
              <h2>The self-titled Academy of Football tends to produce its own starlets. On transfer deadline day it gambled on one from the mighty Manchester United youth factory as 18-year-old Ravel Morrison laid down his baggage at West Ham in the hope of turning his life around.</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>One of the most gifted United young midfielders since Paul Scholes, Morrison dropped from the Premier League to the Championship and passed from the care of Sir Alex Ferguson to Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager: a mentor to some of the game’s more awkward and unusual characters. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Morrison passed his medical on Tuesday after an initial reported fee of £650,000 rising to £1million had been agreed with United. Newcastle United was his other possible refuge but for once he is thinking several steps ahead. Sources close to the deal say Morrison is desperate to play regularly to help keep him out of trouble – and believes he can achieve a regular starting place in a side who are hot favourites for promotion.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Either way, Morrison’s rejection by <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> is a rare setback for a club who have framed their identity around guiding the best boys from the training fields of Carrington to the turf of Old Trafford.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>But Morrison is not like Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville or Scholes. Witness intimidation and a dispute with his girlfriend that ended with her mobile phone being thrown through a window are on his police file and magistrates have warned him he will go to jail if he offends again.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Away from the courts Morrison was frequently AWOL for training and used Twitter to express disdain for a club awards dinner and anger at what he saw as his lack of first-team opportunities. Ferguson’s coaches gave up on him: a rare acceptance of defeat at a club where youth cultivation is a religion.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Morrison scored twice in the 2011 FA Youth Cup win over Sheffield United and dazzled observers with his poise and skill. Two days later he was being fined £600 for throwing his girlfriend’s phone. At 15 he scored in an FA Youth Cup tie against Chelsea and made his first-team debut in 2010 in the Carling Cup against Wolves.</p>
              <p>But his disciplinary lapses blocked his path and now Allardyce has invited him to settle in a stable team coasting towards promotion. He said: “Ravel is a talented lad and if he really wants to be a player then we will help him as much as we can along the way. Perhaps a change of environment will be beneficial to him and help him make that step up to first-team football quicker than perhaps would have been the case at Manchester United. There is no doubt he has exceptional talent.”</p>
              <p>West Ham have always cleared space for free spirits and mavericks. Ian Bishop and Paolo Di Canio are just two examples of Upton Park idols who tended towards nonconformity.</p>
              <p>Allardyce is a mostly functional coach who likes to roll a dice around the margins. He added Jay-Jay Okocha to a long-ball Bolton team and took Joey Barton to Newcastle. At West Ham he has dismissed the old conceit of losing prettily in favour of a more muscular and calculating approach. Over the summer — before Morrison and Ricardo Vaz Te entered his thoughts — Allardyce recruited the likes of Abdoulaye Faye, Kevin Nolan, Papa Bouba Diop and John Carew.</p>
              <p>This romance-kicking pragmatism has propelled West Ham to the top of the Championship and the acquisition of Morrison is a cheap investment in the kind of midfield artistry the Hammers will need if they come back up in May. The initial risk runs to £650,000 and £10-£15,000 a week in wages. There is little danger of Morrison upsetting the promotion push. If he returned to his old ways the senior pros would merely ostracise him and plough on with their jobs.</p>
              <p>Seldom do United’s educational and coaching programmes run into such insurmountable obstacles. Boys from deprived or troubled backgrounds are often transformed at Carrington. Many move successfully to lower league clubs.</p>
              <p>The FA Youth Cup-winning player is especially valued. Matt Busby’s babes won the competition five times and Ferguson’s class of ’92 was the launch pad for David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Giggs. Scholes and Phil Neville were also of that generation.</p>
              <p>Morrison leaves behind Will Keane, Ryan Tunnicliffe and Paul Pogba, team-mates from last year’s victory over Sheffield’s Blades. The idea is that playing regularly will be his salvation while the move to London liberates him from the bad influences of his youth.</p>
              <p>There will be no entourage heading south, his aides say: just a teenager with a nose for trouble and the kind of fluent, instinctive skills United have built a tradition around. Big Sam Allardyce loves a test. He will want the good angels on his side.</p>

              <p><span>The FA have written to the 19-year-old, who has yet to play for West Ham following his £650,000 move from Manchester United, asking for his ‘observations’ on the matter. Morrison has until Monday to respond. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The midfielder has deleted the offending tweet, but still faces an FA charge.</span></p>
              <p><span>The FA’s guidelines on social networking, published earlier this year, state: ‘Any comments which are deemed improper, bring the game into disrepute, or are threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting may lead to disciplinary action.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Comments which are personal in nature or could be construed as offensive, use foul language or contain direct or indirect threats aimed at other participants are likely to be considered improper.’</span></p>
