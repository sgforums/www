              <p>Honestly, I don't really care what the stadium is called. A name of the stadium is only that... a name. It doesn't help the team very much if it just remain the same for 50 to 100 yrs when there are good opportunities to help the club. If it can give the team $10 to $20m a year, then it make sense to call it whatever...</p>
              <p>Bayern isn't the richest club in Germany for nothing... Their stadium is called the Allianz Arena, one of the biggest insurance companies in Europe. Stuttgart was called Neckarstadion... How does it help them? it doesn't... Today they are called The Mercedes Benz Arena, and they get extra income to buy players or pay salaries... Whatever, the club just gets that extra income from a new source.</p>
              <p>Bolton's is known as The Reebok stadium, perhaps they got the extra money over the years that helped them compete and gave them the advantage against fellow struggling clubs. And I guess almost everyone know Arsenal's... Emirates. What I am saying is, if it helps the team, why not? Football is changing, No point being sentimental and lose out on a good chance to help the team.</p>
              <p>A name is only that. After a while, people will get use to the new one as well... So no point keeping the same name if your team keeps losing... I rather they keep winning and whatever the name of the stadium, it isn't important.</p>

              <p>Thats why I said there is no point being sentimental... The Glazers isn't from Manchester either, so are a lot of the owners who are not from the town of the clubs they own.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I won't mind if someone changed Newton hawker centre to Reebok Food Place or East Coast beach to KFC Isle if it helps the customers and provide a cleaner and more beautifully environment with the money they pump in.</p>
              <p>Even is Sg, a lot of names have been changed... Street names, Shopping Mall names, School names... Even where we stay the GRC names keep changing. But like I said, with time, we get used to it.</p>
              <p>It's not as though the club name is being changed, its just a stadium name... If the team continue to perform well, who cares where they play... What matters is the team have the extra resources to continue to do well and compete at the highest level... This is the foremost important aspect of the club. And not what the stadium is called.</p>
              <p>No point complaining next time when there isn't enough money to buy better players while others around are doing so... and the club start to slide down the league... Cos the fans were too sentimental to move ahead...</p>
              <p>Manchester United itself wasn't known as it is today, they changed the entire club name and even the jersey colours once upon a time... So if those fans back then didn't allow it, or were too sentimental, we might not seen a successful club today. And we are only talking about a stadium name now...</p>
              <p>Hell, I don't even mind if they change their stadium name to 'The Coop'... lol. If KFC gives them $20m a season to invest in new players. I will say go for it... The name Old Trafford isn't anything that special either...</p>

              <p>Yes, we argue about newton, mrt, etc..more of us are nonchalant about the name  change, because we have slowly lost the identity and links to these places, and what we used to call our own.We simply doesn't care anymore, as long as it provides us services, and cheap.And this is dangerous.</p>
              <p>Sadly, one day, with the glaciers, MUFC will slowly lose all the naming rights, even the training academy, the stadium.. it is just the beginning of the end, a slow death.</p>

              <p><br>I think you are badly mistaken... A stadium name and a club name are 2 totally different things... They are miles apart to be precise...</p>
              <p>And yes, I agree with you that it will take an outsider or a businessman to see and make the smart choice as the home born or fans will be too emotional to make the smart call.</p>
              <p>History has shown us that clubs that stay stagnant will eventually slide off bit by bit...</p>
              <p>Martin Edwards was once considered greedy by some fans for profiteering from the sale of his shares he inherited... But had he not listen to the board and not made United the first public listed club on the stock exchange in 1991, United's success this last 20 years might not have happen...</p>
              <p>Looking back today we might say its no big deal... But you can imagine it certainly wasn't easy being the first club to be listed... No one have ever done it before, it could have easily gone downhill. The fans can't be too pleased... cos anyone could own a small part of the club... Even Man City fans could say they own part of United... Or the club was touting themselves in the stock exchange for money... Had the fans got in the way... the new funds wouldn't have came in and the stadium would remain about half their today's capacity as there wasn't enough funds for stadium improvement works to happen and the improvement to the team wouldn't have been possible too.</p>
              <p>Like I said, maybe the Newton Heath fans wasn't happy with the change of name... But had it not happen, there wouldn't be a Manchester United today right?</p>
