              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED fear Wayne Rooney will NOT sign a new contract.</h2>
              <p>The striker defied Alex Ferguson by claiming the boss was wrong to suggest an 
              ankle injury had kept him out of action.</p>
              <p>After England drew 0-0 with Montenegro on Tuesday, Rooney insisted: "I've had 
              no problems with my ankle all season."</p>
              <p>And when asked why Fergie had said he did, the hitman replied: "Don't know."</p>
              <p>That is only fuelling concerns talks over a new five-year deal will fall flat.</p>
              <p>Out-of-form Rooney has missed United's last two games following allegations he 
              slept with a prostitute.</p>
              <p>Roo's current contract finishes at the end of next season and United indicated 
              six months ago they were keen to fast-track him to a long-term deal.</p>
              <p>Yet there have been only two preliminary meetings and it is believed Rooney 
              has asked for talks to be put on hold.</p>
              <p>His advisors will look for a hefty pay rise to take him from £90,000 a week to 
              around £150,000.</p>
              <p>But Real Madrid want to sign him and can top any United offer while Spanish 
              tax laws are also more favourable to high earners.<span><a style="color: #003399;" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3179061/Manchester-United-fear-Wayne-Rooney-may-quit-the-club.html#ixzz12KhqQxDK"></a></span></p>

              <p>Rooney is a good player, no manager in the right frame of mind would let him go....unless it's about money....give the lad some time and we'll see him terrorising defences again.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Throwing the towel in: Wayne Rooney is believed to be planning his departure from Manchester United</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney has told Manchester United he wants to leave Old Trafford as soon as possible after a massive fall-out with manager Sir Alex Ferguson. </strong></p>
              <p>The troubled England striker has told his employers he will not sign a new contract and would prefer them to let him leave when the transfer window reopens in January.</p>
              <p>He has complained that his relationship with Ferguson has completely disintegrated, and likens it to the split that occurred between the United manager and David Beckham in 2003. </p>
              <p>On Sunday, United were surprisingly swift in denying reports that it was their intention to sell Rooney, issuing a statement to that effect.</p>
              <p>But Sportsmail understands the initiative is actually being taken by Rooney, who feels aggrieved with Ferguson for what he sees as a lack of support over the recent turmoil in his private life. When news first broke of the scandal involving Rooney and two prostitutes, Ferguson chose not to play him at Everton, publicly citing a recurrence of the ankle injury the striker suffered in Munich last season.</p>
              <p>But Rooney considered the decision to be more of a punishment than an effort to protect him, and was similarly unimpressed with Ferguson's decision to leave him out of the team for the encounters with Fulham, Sunderland and Valencia.</p>
              <p>It came to a head when Rooney then publicly defied Ferguson by telling reporters after England's game against Montenegro last week that he was not even injured.</p>
              <p>'I've had no ankle problem,' said Rooney, which contradicted statements he had made in recent weeks. Ferguson responded by leaving him on the bench for 70 minutes of Saturday's 2-2 draw with West Bromwich.</p>
              <p>Rooney has 18 months left on his contract and the club may have to sell or risk losing him for nothing. When he cost close to £30m, that would be hard for the Glazer family to accept.</p>
              <p>United said suggestions they had already decided to sell Rooney were 'nonsense'.</p>

              <p>It is said that well-placed United sources are suggesting that Rooney is refusing to sign a new contract to stay at Old Trafford and that irreconcilable differences with manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></span></a> are said to be at the root of his desire to leave the club he joined in 2004.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rooney was a mere substitute, and an ineffective replacement when coming on with just 18 minutes to play of Saturday's 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion. That team selection came after Rooney had denied in midweek that he has been suffering the ankle injury that Ferguson had stated was the reason behind his repeated absence from United's line-up.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old is yet to reignite the form that saw him win the PFA Player of the Year award in the 2009-10 season, and has looked rather more akin to the ailing figure of the summer's World Cup finals. He has also been under a heavy media glare after tabloid revelations about his private life were splashed across newspapers in September.</p>
              <p><em>The Daily Mail</em> suggests that Rooney was telling England colleagues before the Euro 2012 qualifier with Montenegro that his time at United is coming to an end, and that Rooney has been unhappy about his non-selection against Fulham, Everton, Sunderland and Valencia.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is no stranger to fall-outs with his leading stars, and, with Rooney having just over eighteen months on his contract then it is highly possible that if any such rift continues then he may even be sold in January 2011.</p>
              <p>Sunday morning reports planted the seeds of such a schism between Rooney and the club he has repeatedly said he would like to stay at for the rest of his career before an official United statement dismissed the reports as "nonsense".</p>

              <p>If he cannot accept being a bench player, then that is what he will be if he joins Real... The guy is good but let's face it, he isn't Ronaldo or Messi... Remember Ruud? wasn't happy with being on the bench at United because of Saha's good form? He ended up being on Real's bench more often than not... </p>
              <p>I wouldn't mind United letting him go and if they can get a $40m sum for him I would be happy enough... But with only 18 months left on his contract, even $30m would be not bad cos the guy have not been able to score since March... And he seems to have quite a few long spell of these...</p>

              <p>To be honest, I was hoping that it would not be true. I thought he has matured, changed. But giving up just like that... Sigh.</p>
              <p>No big loss if he can be sold for a profit. Many other very capable and young players. The team does not revolve around one player.</p>

              <p>Wayne Rooney believes the fact Manchester United will not meet his new contract demands is a symptom of the club's decline.</p>
              <p>He wants the Red Devils to invest in him and the rest of the team, so they can push again for domestic and European glory.</p>
              <p>Instead, debts approaching £800million under the Glazers are dragging United down and friends say Rooney is not prepared to go the same way.</p>
              <p>The fact there is a Blue Moon rising across at Manchester City, where they have endless millions to spend, makes those concerns even more acute.</p>
              <p>So what price Rooney joining City just like Carlos Tevez did?</p>
              <p>Astonishingly, some bookies make Rooney more likely to be at Eastlands next season than Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He is 5-2 to be at City and 7-2 to still be at United. If City really want Rooney they can blow anyone out of the water - Real Madrid and Barcelona included - and meet whatever wage demands the player's camp throw at them.</p>
              <p>It is not as if Rooney bleeds United red, either. He is still an Evertonian, even though he no longer plays for them.</p>
              <p>Football is Rooney's job and he will go where he believes is best for his career and his bank balance.</p>
              <p>United do not have to sell, of course, but Rooney's market value will decline considerably with only 18 months left on his current contract.</p>
              <p>When Rooney and his advisers began exploratory talks with United about a new deal, figures ranging between £150,000 a week and £200,000 a week were being bandied about. Rooney was United's hottest talent following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and expected to be rewarded as such.</p>
              <p>But United were not prepared to push the boat out and go the extra mile for him or any other new arrivals. What irks Rooney is that manager Alex Ferguson seems to have accepted the situation without protest.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has not gone to the board calling for them to break the bank to keep Rooney, nor has he asked for a truckload of cash so he can get back to competing at the very top table.</p>
              <p>In fact, Ferguson has publicly praised the Glazers more than once, most recently insisting: "They've been great owners. They have supported me every way I've asked them."</p>
              <p>As far as Rooney is concerned, Fergie has not been asking enough. United, he fears, will become Premier League also-rans while the rivals across town emerge as the major force. Rooney's own form and off-the-field behaviour do not help his arguments, though.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old has not scored for United in open play since March, was a disaster with England at the World Cup and is doing little to prove he is worth a place in the team for either club or country.</p>
              <p>And he has been attracting all the wrong headlines at the front end of the newspapers.</p>
              <p>But friends claim you would see a different Rooney if he thought the club was going forward and they had enough faith in him to offer the type of contract the world's best players have come to expect.</p>
              <p>One pal said: "The bottom line is that it seems United don't love Wayne enough to pull out all the stops to keep him.</p>
              <p>"Do they really think they would be better off without him?"</p>
              <p>There is a view that Fergie is so angry with Rooney for dabbling with prostitutes that the Scot is making him suffer for sullying the United name. But a source close to United's board members and Ferguson insisted the furore over his sleeping with hookers is a sideshow.</p>
              <p>Even before the sordid revelations, the contract discussions were floundering. The source told SunSport: "This is about money, pure and simple. United don't think Rooney is worth what he is asking, particularly in the form he is in now - and it is hard to see that changing.</p>
              <p>"They also think he might be pushing them to get a reaction with the way he is claiming he's never been injured. "They haven't decided whether to sell him yet and they certainly don't want to let him go in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>"However, if a ridiculous bid comes in, you can never say never." Chelsea, Real and Barca have all been linked with Rooney but the striker is not a huge fan of Madrid boss Jose Mourinho's style.</p>
              <p>It is also hard to see him adapting to a new culture in Spain when he has found it difficult enough moving 40 miles to Manchester.</p>
              <p>A London bolthole might appeal but Chelsea are much more realistic in their transfer dealings these days.</p>
              <p>Rooney is boxed into a corner. It's looking like City or bust.</p>

              <p>frankly, I hope what's happening is just a bad dream.</p>
              <p>Rooney is quality, not only his ability but all other things too.Imptly, he is our tailsman in more ways than one.</p>
              <p>I am just awaiting what SAF has to say on this. what's his take on rooney? that's the key.</p>
              <p>many critics have said that SAF painted the bad ankle to move the spotlight from rooney and it seems to backfire now.</p>
              <p>We all know how berba is a "seasonal" scorer so I hope that Rooney can come back and blast those goals to get a better contract.</p>
              <p>to lose him to city, i don't think SAF will allow that given how he engineered Henize to go to spain instead of Liverpool.</p>
              <p>let's finger's crossed that this bad dream will go away.</p>

              <p>Wayne Rooney will be out for three weeks with an ankle injury, after he agreed a new deal to stay at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Rooney was carried out of training on Tuesday as the storm over his future raged. And Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed Rooney will now be out of action until the middle of next month.</p>
              <p>''Wayne will be out for three weeks,'' he told radio station <em>Key103</em>.</p>
              <p>Significantly, the timescale would see him ruled out of the first Manchester derby of the season on November 10, while Rooney will also miss the Champions League return against Bursaspor a week earlier, next week's Carling Cup tie with Wolves, plus Premier League games against Stoke on Sunday, Tottenham and Wolves again when they visit Old Trafford on November 6.</p>
              <p>Rooney has already sat out matches against Valencia and Sunderland prior to the international break amid confusion over his injury.</p>
              <p>It was Rooney's claim that he was not suffering from an ankle problem - which completely contradicted the words of his manager - following England's draw with Montenegro 10 days ago.</p>
              <p>But after he made a brief appearance against West Brom on Saturday, a training ground tackle from Paul Scholes has put him on the sidelines.</p>
