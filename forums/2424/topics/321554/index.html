              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has hinted very strongly that he is looking to leave the European champions for Real Madrid this summer.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <span style="line-height: 19px;">The 23-year-old, following Portugal's 3-2 defeat </span>to Germany in the quarter-finals of Euro 2008, spoke about his club future.
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              'In two or three days time I will announce my future because the tournament is over for me,' he said in Portuguese after the game.
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              'I will speak to Manchester United.
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              'I will try to reach an agreement and we will see.'
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              Ronaldo helped fire United to a Premier League and Champions League double this season.
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              When asked if he has made a decision regarding a move to Real Madrid, he replied: 'No, not yet.'
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 4px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
              The winger, one of the world's top players, is still under contract with the Red Devils but Spanish champions Real have been in hot pursuit of him since the end of the season.<p></p>

              <p>Don't belief what all the Press say at the moment lah... I belief if he wanted to go he would have said so already... There's still a chance he could or would not go to Spain.</p>
              <p>I belief he wants a better deal and to be fair, he deserve a better deal even tho he has just signed a new contract last season on a $125k per week... To be honest, if United are truely keen to keep him, they should at least increase his salary to $145 or $150k per week or what's Kaka is getting at AC Milan... He was United's best player last season but he is currently not United's best paid player... So of course he will feel unfair or under appreciated... If they don't than probably they will lose him.</p>

              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo, the Manchester United winger, said last night that "the possibilities" of a transfer to Real Madrid were "great", but that no announcement would be made for 48 hours.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Portugal bowed out of Euro 2008 yesterday, beaten 3-2 by Germany, after which Ronaldo spoke of his future plans and his need for a minor foot operation. Asked about a move to Madrid, Ronaldo replied: "The possibilities to go are great, but as I have always said it doesn't always depend on me.</p>
              <p class="story">"In the next few days we will see if we can arrive at an agreement. I have many desires and in the next few days they will become clear."</p>
              <p class="story">Madrid have been pursuing Ronaldo for some time, and may now launch a £50m bid for a player whose United contract runs until 2012. "I will make an announcement on my future in two or three days," insisted Madrid's No 1 target, adding: "I have had a small problem with my foot for about three months, so I am going to have an operation now."</p>
              <p class="story">Clearly distraught at the final whistle, Ronaldo headed straight down the tunnel at the final whistle, a real shame as two sets of competitors were embracing respectfully behind him. As United wait nervously for Ronaldo's announcement.</p>

              <p class="story"><em>One good thing that came out of last night's result is... At least now he won't be in the company of Luiz Felipe Scolari who is trying to influence him to leave United...</em></p>

              sometimes you got to look at the players' perspective....like anyone else, they are always looking for new opportunities, just as you would in your job...to them it's a career, to the fans, they only see the club..die die is the club and never the players.....
              
              of course the players are also earning way too much...even mediocre players in the top leagues can drive porches, so rightly many fans are angry for reasons of envy.....so personally, i now refuse to pay anything for football, including cable, so i turn to the free free world of the net as and when i choose to watch....

              <p>I think he should go lah. Even though I'm a United fan, I have to say i don't think he can continue doing what he had done in the past 2 season. Since a mind-boggling move is possible, maybe SAF should just cash in. Let's say transfer fee 60-75 million, it's already 5-7 folds of profits already.</p>
              <p>It's enough to buy 2-3 world class players already.</p>
              <p>And if we don't like him go, he also don't have the heart and soul for the club liao. Why need such a player right?</p>
              <p>A committed player is better than a player that is aiming for a move away.</p>
              <p>But I have to say, this guy don't know how to repay the faith shown in him.</p>
              <p>Who was there for him after the World Cup?</p>
              <p>Who made him the player he is today?</p>
              <p>He said all about dreams for playing for RM. I just want to feel that he wants to go there for the money.</p>
              <p>125k per week at united still not satisfied, i wonder why footballers are so greedy.</p>
              <p>One reason i think United doesn't wanto increase his salary is to ensure that he's not given special status in the team? or that his wages would cause fractions in the team? Well, I don't know.</p>
              <p>I just hope ronaldo leave and mark the start of a new galatico era for RM.</p>
              <p>And all United fans will be there to see the policy fail again.</p>
              <p>And please Glazers, we understand that you all are serious about the club. BUT, dont bench ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Isn't there some sort of article 17 in FIFA regulations that allow players to play for 3 year and buy out their contract?</p>
              <p>We might as well cash in rather than risk losing him by free transfer or a few millions of his contract?</p>

              know.</p>
              <p>I just hope ronaldo leave and mark the start of a new galatico
              era for RM.</p>
              <p>And all United fans will be there to see the policy fail
              again.</p>
              <p>And please Glazers, we understand that you all are serious about
              the club. BUT, dont bench ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Isn't there some sort of article 17 in FIFA regulations that
              allow players to play for 3 year and buy out their contract?</p>
              <p>We might as well cash in rather than risk losing him by free
              transfer or a few millions of his contract?</p>

              <p>dude, agree with you.</p>
              <p>this is getting so lengthy and so tiring. just sell the bugger if he wants to leave and be done with it. in the meantime, get a good return and invest in others.</p>
              <p>Read about how tevez is ignored, well he plays his heart out for the reds and deserve a contract.</p>
