ArsenalÂ’s Dutch strike ace faces a week on the sidelines after suffering a knock in training. But his absence means Togo hitman Emmanuel Adebayor, who bagged the winner at United in September, is being lined up to start at The Emirates. Boss Arsene Wenger is hoping Van Persie Â— who has bagged five goals in six games Â— will be back for the Carling Cup clash with North London rivals Spurs next Wednesday.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Steve Brenner, The Sun</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cesc: Scholes is just Fab</strong><br><br>CESC FABREGAS has hailed Paul Scholes as the player he most admires in England.<br><br>ArsenalÂ’s Spanish midfielder will pit his skills against Manchester United in SundayÂ’s Premiership showdown and Fabregas is relishing the chance to go head-to-head with his hero.<br><br>Rumoured to be the man who put the pizza into Pizzagate when the clubs clashed at Old Trafford two years ago, Fabregas showered his rival with compliments yesterday.<br><br>The Gunners star, 19, said: Â“Paul Scholes has had a fantastic season.<br><br>Â“He is a very complete, spectacular footballer. He always fights for the ball and tries to lose his marker to help his team-mates Â— either to defend or to have a shot on goal.<br><br>Â“For any football player in the Premiership, Scholes is a player you want to emulate.<br><br>Â“One player does not make a team but there is no doubt that the presence of some players add extra motivation and confidence.<br><br>Â“Scholes is a player with character and is capable of transmitting that mental strength to his team-mates.<br><br>Â“I would happily end my career with the medals that Scholes has. He has six league titles, four FA Cups, one European Cup and one Inter-Continental Cup to his name.<br><br>Â“I am young and I hope that I will be able to surpass him Â— but it is not going to be easy.Â”<br><br>Arsene WengerÂ’s side trail the Premiership leaders by 15 points but Fabregas believes he has seen enough improvement at United to suggest they can beat Chelsea to the title.<br><br>He said: Â“United are very strong. After two years in England where Chelsea have dominated it seems that they can take them on this time to win the Premier League again.<br><br>Â“They have a very complete squad and, right now, they are the team to beat.<br><br>Â“They have gained solidity and consistency and they are scoring lots of goals with ease.Â”<br><br></div>

His touch was awful, by his standards and he just didn't look like his old self.<br><br>It might be off-the-field problems or it might even be the fact that Ronaldo is getting all the headlines, but something looked to be up.<br><br>I am sure Sir Alex Ferguson will have had a word because although they are still winning, they are going to need Rooney at his best for the run-in.<br><br>Of course, his workrate didn't drop and you wouldn't bet against him having a say here, but I just think the whole Arsenal side is right on its game right now, which is why I can see them edging this.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank goodness man u didn't buy Jon Obi Mikel... I think Darren Fletcher is far better than him... Luck chelsea snatch him away from man u...  now they can use the money chelsea paid to help pay 2/3 of the purchase of Hargreaves.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

However, Arsenal themselves need points too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lets go for a 9 point lead.....<br><br>ballack is massively ordinary considering he is one of the best midfielders in the world while at bayern. shevchenko is faring even worse. mikel looks ordinary. wonder whats the fuss over him? actually SWP is a handful while on the right. pity he aint the 1st choice at chelski.<br><br>anyway on to tonight. fabregas vs scholes... interesting. i must say he is quite fantastic. but w/o gilberto and gallas, think man utd shld use giggs and ronaldo for penetration. keep henry quiet and man utd shld win.<br><br>the fixture in aug last yr was quite bad. losing to a solitary goal. i thought a draw would have been fair. oh well, looking forward to tonight</div>
