              <p>Manchester United defender <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21931/Patrice-Evra"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Patrice Evra</span></a> has dismissed Arsenal as a "football training centre" ahead of Monday's meeting at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, currently one point clear of United at the top of the table but having played an extra game, have not won a trophy since the FA Cup success of 2005 as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=5"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Arsene Wenger</span></a> has kept faith with his academy players.</p>
              <p>The Gunners remain in contention for four trophies this season but Evra, who famously said the 2009 Champions League semi-final between the teams was "11 men against 11 boys", has played down their chances of success.</p>
              <p>"For me, Arsenal is a football training centre," he told <em>Canal+</em>. "You watch the match, you enjoy it, but are you going to win a title afterwards? That's what people remember.</p>
              <p>"It has been five years since they won anything and, for a big club like Arsenal, that is a crisis.</p>
              <p>"We can lose against them on the 13th but, at the end of the day, what is there (for Arsenal)? There is nothing. There are no trophies, there is nothing.</p>
              <p>"Our real enemy is Chelsea. We are more concerned with Chelsea's results than those of Arsenal, even if we know Arsenal are a great team who can beat Chelsea, us (United) or anyone."</p>
              <p>Wenger is well-known for adhering to his principles of attacking football regardless of the opponent.</p>
              <p>"When we play against Arsenal, it is really fun," Evra said. "They are a team that plays football who will not come to Old Trafford with 11 men behind the ball.</p>
              <p>"We also play football, but the difference is that we also have strength. Sometimes, they cannot kill off matches. We are more efficient."</p>
              <p>United have been handed a boost with the news that Evra has been passed fit to face Arsenal along with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8860/Paul-Scholes"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Paul Scholes</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7825/Rio-Ferdinand"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a>.</p>
              <p>"Everyone is fit," Sir Alex Ferguson told <em>Key 103</em> on Friday. "Paul Scholes started training yesterday. It was just light stuff but hopefully he will be available for Monday and Rio should be fit as well.</p>
              <p>"Jonny [Evans] and Wes [Brown] have had a bit of a virus that has been going around the place [but] we should have a full squad for Monday."</p>

              <h2>NASRI UNDAUNTED BY OLD TRAFFORD TRIP</h2>
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/12/240/Samir-Nasri-Snood_2539514.jpg" border="0" alt="Samir Nasri - no Old Trafford fear factor now."></div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Samir Nasri claims Old Trafford has lost its fear factor as Arsenal look to stay top of the Barclays Premier League with victory over title rivals Manchester United on Monday night. </strong></p>
              <p>While both managers Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson have attempted to defuse the tension ahead of the showdown, United defender Patrice Evra lit the blue touch paper by branding Arsenal nothing more than a "training centre" and claiming the Gunners were in "crisis" having not won a trophy since 2004, while midfielder Park Ji-sung has raised further question marks about the London club's ability to sustain a title challenge.</p>
              <p>Arsenal last won at Old Trafford in September 2006, but Nasri maintains the current United team lack the same aura of recent seasons.</p>
              <p>"For me Manchester United is not the same team as before, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Tevez it was a little bit scary to play at Old Trafford," Nasri declared.</p>
              <p>"Now I don't think offensively they are the same as before, but still they are a good team and when they are 1-0 up is very hard to beat them.</p>
              <p>"We will see, but we are really confident to get a result out of this game."</p>
              <p>Arsenal may have struggled for consistency at home, with three Premier League defeats already, but away Wenger's men have won five times - including an impressive 3-0 victory at Manchester City.</p>
              <p>"The difference when we play away is that we defend much better. Our discipline and shape is more efficient when we play away," Nasri said.</p>
              <p>"I am quite confident because we can play our game and we know we can score at any moment away.</p>
              <p>"We have to reproduce this kind of game at home and to be more efficient at home as well."</p>
              <p>Nasri took his tally to 12 goals with another well-executed strike in the midweek Champions League win over Partizan Belgrade at Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old - who had a spell on the sidelines earlier in the season following knee surgery - believes his absence from the ill-fated World Cup squad proved to be a positive.</p>
              <p>"I had a good break this summer for the first time in my life. I had a rest for two months," he said.</p>
              <p>"I am used to playing in the Premier League now, I have my mark, I am confident and all my team-mates are confident with me so after that I feel ok."</p>
              <p>Wenger believes Nasri's extra summer break allowed him to play with a new-found freedom.</p>
              <p>"The French players who were away at the World Cup had to overcome mental heaviness in their heads and on their shoulders because they were not welcome back to France. He never had that handicap," the Arsenal manager said.</p>
              <p>"What is good enough for me is that he is playing very well."</p>
              <p>Wenger has seen a mental change in the midfielder.</p>
              <p>"For a long time when you play football, if you are not convinced you can score goals you accept it somewhere," he said.</p>
              <p>"When you get that taste for goals that reinforces you and that is what I believe has changed.</p>
              <p>"He knows now that he can score goals in every single game so he doesn't give up that idea during the game."</p>

              <p class="full-line tweet tweet_button">With one point between these sides at the top, and Patrice Evra turning up the heat on a rivalry that always threatens to boil over, this should be a feisty affair. <span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span> will probably make the trip to Old Trafford without their captain, Cesc Fábregas, after Arsène Wenger said the Spaniard has only a "small chance" of facing United. They could also have a problem at left-back with Kieran Gibbs out until the new year and Gaël Clichy a doubt. The hosts have slight concerns in defence over Rio Ferdinand and in midfield regarding Paul Scholes.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>• 10 of Dimitar Berbatov's 11 top flight goals this season have been scored with Wayne Rooney on the pitch</strong></p>

              <p><strong>• The last time Arsenal lost a <span style="color: #000000;">Premier League</span> game with Howard Webb as the referee was at Old Trafford in April 2008 – they have won six of nine matches officiated by him since then</strong></p>

              <p>I thought United ought to win with so many more attempts and the hunger to win was so much more than Arsenal's, who has seemed to be affected by Evra's trash talks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Evra really raised his game after all the talking to prove that his theory was right.</p>
              <p>Van Der Sar wasn't troubled at all, all night, but i felt that his mistake for palming the ball straight at Chamakh might be costly if not for Vidic resolute defending.</p>
              <p>Rooney missed a soft penalty which i personally feel that shouldn't be awarded cos Clichy was using his hands to cushion his fall and Nani struck the ball to his hands instead, and Rooney still hasn't scored from an open play this season. <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Couple of missed chances to put the game beyond doubt but overall an entertaining match. Is this the required momentum to push United all the way for the title come May?</p>

              <p>I don't think Rooney should be subbed out because he's so good as a targetman upfront as compared to either Berbatov or Chicharito, although he did not perform up to scratch today but his layoff to teammates are top notch, recall the pass to Anderson?</p>
              <p>I thought Anderson was doing great, box-to-box dynamo.</p>
              <p>I thought Carrick ought to be subbed out though and Giggs really calmed the players down when they were desperately defending in the 70-80th minute, hitting awkward long ball forward to Rooney but no one else to receive his layoff. Giggs chose to play short one-two passes with great effect as Arsenal players by then are frustrated, kicking out at United players, especially Evra. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <div></div>
              <h2>1<strong> United's Anderson has reinvented himself</strong><br></h2>
              <div>When <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Manchester United</span></span></a> signed Anderson in 2007 the fee was never officially disclosed but widely put at £18m. It largely passed under the radar that Porto's accounts later revealed they had received €30m (£25.3m at today's exchange rates) for the Brazilian, making him the fifth most expensive player Sir Alex Ferguson has ever bought (behind Dimitar Berbatov, Rio Ferdinand, Juan Sebastián Verón and Wayne Rooney). It is a lot of money for someone who has scored only two goals in 110 appearances for the club but Anderson is, at least, now playing with the drive and purpose that should be expected. He was full of energy here, one of the outstanding performers of the night.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>2<strong> Arsène Wenger will live to regret not having a better goalkeeper</strong></h2>
              <p>Perhaps there will come a time when Wojciech Szczesny's presence in goal will not fill <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Arsenal" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Arsenal</span></span></a>'s supporters with a sense of foreboding. The Pole, to give him his due, is entitled to feel he could do little about Park Ji-sung's goal and, overall, he handled his first league start without showing too many nerves. It is a strange set of circumstances, however, that Wenger is trying to win the title without a goalkeeper on his books who inspires confidence. The shootâ€‘onâ€‘sight policy operated by United's front players in the opening stages, in particular Nani, showed they were encouraged to find a relative novice (albeit one with three Poland caps) between the posts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>3<strong> Arsenal need to keep Cesc Fábregas fit</strong><br></h2>
              <div>Of all the Spaniard's qualities, he also plays with a big-game mentality. Arsenal were over-run at times in the midfield, particularly in the first half, and though Jack Wilshere is a vibrant and gifted footballer there will be a reassuring feel to the side for Wenger when Fábregas is able to resume his place in the starting line-up</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>4<strong> Sir Alex Ferguson's words were wasted</strong><br></h2>
              <div>United's manager made his point in his programme notes. "Before we get under way," he wrote, "could I make a special appeal to that small section of our fans who seem to get perverse pleasure from taunting Arsène Wenger with crude chants? He deserves better, much better." He had said the same on television and radio and the club followed it up in a text message to their season-ticket holders in the morning but on the first occasion Wenger left the dugâ€‘out, after 69 minutes, the same abuse began, as loud as ever. "We're Man United, we'll do what we want," they sang.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>5<strong> Nani: potential footballer of the year</strong><br></h2>
              <div>He will always jar with the way he looks for free-kicks and exaggerates injuries but the Portuguese has been the club's outstanding footballer so far this season and he made it a difficult evening for Gaël Clichy, usually an accomplished opponent. Samir Nasri, Arsenal's best player this season, took longer to get into the game. The Frenchman was involved in many of Arsenal's more penetrative moments but Nani had the greater impact, his cross setting up Park's goal and his menace leading to Clichy's handball for the penalty. <strong></strong></div>

              <p>Should be 3-0 to united.If not for nani and rooney's over confidence in shooting,shots high and wide.The defence was absolutely flawless.I bet either Rio or Vidic would have bagged the MOM.Maybe some1 could fit in this piece of info.</p>
              <p>Anderson was competent.I hope this is his season like what has happened so far for our dear Nani.With his combative play,physical presence and daring to play and pass attitude,this could be his best season yet in a red jersey.</p>
