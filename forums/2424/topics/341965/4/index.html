              <p>I don't think we missing nani/anderson. but what SAF did was quite smart.he put in scholes and GNV at the right time for the old heads just stablises the team.in one move, he anchored the right wing, and open up the midfield.</p>
              <p>Park is industrious but I hope he doesn't get too rolled up in the contract and take it upon himself to prove his worth cause if then, he will become too selfish.</p>
              <p>one thing, I feel berba holds up the ball too long. it is good if he can release faster cause he spoils the tempo.. but then, unsure whether it is SAF's intention.</p>

              <p>i also notice the tempo thing...</p>
              <p>it seems that the play is slower or more sluggish then the direct bombardment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it because of berba influcencing with his laid back style or is it just that the team is too lethargic...</p>
              <p>even the energetic tevez and park seems like they are running in circles rather than connecting this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but park always converts a cross that is too deep into a chance, already done that more than once this season</p>

              <h2>Berba breaks resistance</h2>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/JonMC/berb-350.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="350" height="200"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester United made hard work of dispatching Middlesbrough at Old Trafford but after missing a glut of chances Dimitar Berbatov spared their blushes with the only goal.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian volleyed home from close range in the 69th minute after Michael Carrick's left-wing cross had bounced back off Boro defender David Wheater.</p>
              <p>Berbatov, who replaced Boxing Day's match-winner at Stoke Carlos Tevez after he returned to Argentina on a ''family issue'', was one of the guilty culprits in the first hour of the match.</p>
              <p>But he was not the only one with Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Rafael, Nemanja Vidic and Ji-sung Park all squandering chances against a determined Middlesbrough side.</p>
              <p>United will probably have few games this season as one-sided as this but they were in real danger of stumbling in their bid to close the gap on Barclays Premier League leaders Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Credit must also go to Middlesbrough, especially goalkeeper Ross Turnbull, who put in a disciplined performance which very nearly paid off with a point.</p>
              <p>An indication things were not going United's way was when Park's shot was stopped by Vidic from Rooney's left-wing free-kick.</p>
              <p>Moments later the South Korea midfielder was denied again from long range by the outstanding Turnbull, with Ronaldo driving wide on the turn from United's next attack.</p>
              <p>But Berbatov finally made the breakthrough in the 69th minute when he volleyed home from close range after Carrick's cross from the left had rebounded off Wheater.</p>
              <p>Park then produced a contender for miss of the season when he somehow ballooned over from three yards from substitute Gary Neville's cross.</p>
              <p>However, United had done enough to close the gap on Liverpool to seven points with two matches in hand.</p>

              <li><strong>Fergie worried over wasteful United</strong>
              <p> </p>
              Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson admitted his side's wastefulness in front of goal is becoming a concern after they scraped a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough.
              <p> </p>
              Dimitar Berbatov scored the solitary goal in the 69th minute in a largely frustrating evening for United at Old Trafford.
              <p> </p>
              "We have missed a lot of chances. That is a big concern," Ferguson told Setanta Sports 1. '' The win was United's second narrow 1-0 success over lowly opposition following their victory at Stoke on Boxing Day and Ferguson acknowledged the importance of grinding out results.
              <p> </p>
              He added: "(Wins like this) are just as important. Three points are the name of the game. But I have to say how well Middlesbrough played tonight."
              <p> </p>
              Ferguson also paid tribute to Berbatov, saying: "He is a marvellous player and he has taken his goal very well - and at a crucial moment."
              <p> </p>
              United are now seven points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Liverpool.
              <p> </p>
              The United boss added: "We are are a good position come the turn of the year. We have two games in hand, both at home. We have played more games away. When we have played the games in hand that will be level. It will be a great run-in."
              <p> </p>
              United also have two games in hand on Chelsea, who are just four points ahead, but asked if he thought Liverpool posed a greater threat than the Blues, Ferguson said: "I don't think so."
              <p> </p>
              Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate refused to be downbeat after watching his side put on a battling display.
              <p> </p>
              "We looked bright, our attitude was fantastic and there was a lot of healthy performances. I'm not displeased. Only one team has taken a point from here so there's no disgrace in that."
              <p> </p>
              The former England international refused to dwell on the fact his club are only spared the ignominy of spending the new year in the drop zone by dint of better a goal difference than Stoke.
              <p> </p>
              "There's 18 games to go, and there's 10-12 teams in the bottom section of the table," he told Setanta Sports 1. "It's about keeping our heads. We've got big games coming up, we've been here before and worked steadily out of it and we have to do it again."
              <p> </p>
              Southgate also shrugged off speculation his job at the Riverside Stadium could be on the line.
              <p> </p>
              "We don't take our position for granted but we understand the situation we are working in," he said. "We're competing - five or six games ago we were in a healthy position. Two wins would change things, there's no panic here. I'm prepared to give everything I have."
              <p> </p>
              The Boro boss had a final word on the future of winger Stewart Downing, who has been linked with a move in the January transfer window.
              <p> </p>
              He said: "We're not looking to sell our best players. He's not for sale."

              <p>Actually I disagree with those that say Nani was missed as I feel he is, currently, still a bit of a show pony and wastes too much possession.</p>
              <p>Maybe Fletcher should not have started. Fletch may have improved leaps and bounds this season but I feel he will be of greater effect against stronger teams where his workrate will stifle their creative/attacking midfielders rather than against teams like Boro at home as Utd easily bossed the midfield. Maybe that was why Scholes was brought on, to add a bit of creative spark.</p>

              <p>Actually that should be the way as far as yesterday's squad was concerned. After all, Berbatov is no striker like Van Nistelrooy and perhaps Fergie was hoping that by playing slightly behind the firing line, he can spray passes left and right and exploit the pace of Utd's wingers Ronaldo and Park or even Rafael.</p>

              <p>idk lol, i always felt that rooney plays best in the space between the midfield and striker.</p>
              <p>i dont think bbt suits that role cause as someone said earlier, he slows down the tempo.</p>

              <p>well, berba may be put there cause he seldoms loses possession..</p>
              <p>I do agree, Nani is far from finish product like Ronaldo.  Park should start as he is more industrious and willing to pass more. also, he seems to have rapport with Rooney.</p>
              <p>btw, I guess Ronaldo was totally distracted and hence unable to play his best. It seems teams are starting to target and infuriates him and this does cause MU to strumble..</p>
