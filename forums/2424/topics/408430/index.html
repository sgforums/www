              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON has revealed he broke the habit of a lifetime to complete Bebe's fairytale move to Manchester United.</h2>
              <p>The 20-year-old became Ferguson's third signing of the summer when he joined in a £7million deal from Vitoria Guimaraes. But it was the fact Bebe spent time on the streets as a youngster and used to play for a team organised by CAIS — the organisation responsible for Portugal's Homeless World Cup Team — which made headlines. He then ended up joining the Red Devils after spending only five weeks with Vitoria after impressing United's Portugal-based scout.</p>
              <p>Bebe was virtually unknown 12 months ago as he turned out for Portugal third division team Estrela Amadora. But with Real Madrid and a number of top clubs in Portugal starting to take a keen interest, Ferguson decided to make a move, even though he had never seen the striker play, even on video.</p>
              <p>The United boss said: "On this occasion I didn't watch him. It is the first time I have done it. "Normally I see plenty of video footage but our scouting department is very good and sometimes you have to go on instinct.</p>
              <p>"Our scout in Portugal was adamant we must do something quickly. "You look at the material. You look at their age and whether they're bringing pace, balance, desire to play. "You've got to trust your staff at times, so I sent David Gill down there to do the deal."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Bebe will likely have to wait until a Carling Cup third-round clash next month before getting an opportunity to make his debut. And for a player whose previous biggest game was a cup-tie against Benfica, following the path so successfully navigated by Cristiano Ronaldo is not going to be easy.</strong></p>
              <p>But with fellow countryman Nani already at Old Trafford and another Portuguese speaker on hand in Anderson, the settling in process should be made simpler.</p>
              <p>When asked what his greatest strengths were, Bebe revealed: "I am fast, I kick well and I score a lot of goals."</p>

              <p>nani has a big big shadow on his back that he needs to step out of b4 he excels. and last season, he is slowly maturing.</p>
              <p>this fella is practically unknown. Not sure whether it is business sense to snap him with RM sniffing around or pure footballing sense.</p>
              <p>don't think he will turn out to be david bellion as he doesn't really look that pacy to me, but would be glad if he can do more of drogba, mix power and shooting..</p>

              <p><strong>Summer signing Bebe will pull on the United shirt for the first time tonight when he lines up for the Reserves against Aston Villa at Moss Lane, Altrincham.<br><br></strong>The Portugal Under-21 international arrived at Old Trafford in August but his involvement so far has been restricted to the training pitch at Carrington. Tonight, however, he looks set to start for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's second-string against a strong Villa side. The visitors' 16-man squad boasts nine players with senior experience, including Nathan Delfouneso and Barry Bannan.<br><br>There's more good news for United fans, with Gabriel Obertan also named in Solskjaer's side. The Frenchman hasn't featured at any level since injuring his ankle during the Reds' pre-season tour. The Reserves have played three Manchester Senior Cup fixtures already this season – against <a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=6651630"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Manchester City</span></span></a>, <a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=6651868"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Oldham Athletic</span></span></a> and <a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=6652195"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Stockport County</span></span></a> – but tonight marks the beginning of United's league campaign.<br><br>The action kicks off at 19:00 BST – you can watch live on <a href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUTV </span></span></a>and see highlights on <a href="http://www.manutd.com/video"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUTV Online</span></span></a> from 21:30 BST. <br><strong><br>United:</strong> Sam Johnstone, Scott Wootton, Ritchie De Laet, Corry Evans, Reece Brown, Oliver Gill, Gabriel Obertan, Ravel Morrison, William Keane, Magnus Eikrem, Bebe, Marnick Vermijl, Conor Devlin, Robert Brady, Nick Ajose, John Cofie <br><br><strong>Villa:</strong> Elliott Parish, Eric Lichaj, Derrick Williams, Ciaran Clark, Shane Lowry, Jonathan Hogg, Moustapha Salifou, Isaiah Osbourne, James Collins, Nathan Delfouneso, Barry Bannan, Durrell Berry, Andy Marshall, Arsenio Halfhuid, Daniel Johnson, Danny Devine</p>
