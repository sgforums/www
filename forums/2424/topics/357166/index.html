              Lee Martin admits he is loving life back at United, and in the central midfield berth in which he began his career.
              
              The 22-year-old has spent his entire professional career seen as a winger, but has thrived in a central role between midfield and a lone striker in the Reserves since returning in January.
              
              Goals and assists have flowed forth from the former England youth international, who has also operated as a makeshift striker with great success - scoring the second goal in Monday's Lancashire Senior Cup semi-final win over Preston.
              
              "I came up as a central midfielder, and (former Reserves manager) Ricky Sbragia put me out wide purely because we had so many central midfielders," Martin told ManUtd.com. "I ended up doing a good job while I was filling in and being one of the better players that season. Once you cement that spot, itâ€™s hard to get out of it.
              
              "In the 2004/05 season I was playing left wing in the Barclays Premier League and central midfield for the Pontinâ€™s League team. That was hard, juggling those roles, but Iâ€™ve come back and credit has to go to Ole and Warren for noticing that I can do a job in midfield.
              
              "I feel Iâ€™m definitely more suited to that area, Iâ€™m more involved and getting a few assists too. Sometimes when Iâ€™m told to stay in one position itâ€™s difficult because I naturally tend to roam, find little pockets and gaps to receive the ball in. Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at my best."
              
              Martin has operated as an out-and-out winger in all six of his loan deals - which took him to Royal Antwerp, Rangers, Sheffield United, Stoke City, Plymouth Argyle and Nottingham Forest - but enjoyed limited opportunities.
              
              Now back to his best in his reprised role with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Warren Joyce's side, Lee admits the gap between United and other clubs can be a hard one to bridge.
              
              "Sometimes youâ€™ve got to play a position that youâ€™re not accustomed to for 90 minutes," he said. "Here itâ€™s more about expressing yourself, but then youâ€™ve got better players around you here.
              
              "No offence to the clubs Iâ€™ve been at, but youâ€™d have to go a long way to find a club to match the standards on show here, even among the young lads.
              
              "Thatâ€™s perhaps why it can be difficult for lads going out on loan, because here youâ€™re used to the ball rarely leaving the floor, and suddenly you can be in a Championship game where the ballâ€™s in the air for 45 minutes. Itâ€™s tough."
