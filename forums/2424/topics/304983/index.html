Manchester United are still battling on three fronts, with an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Tottenham coming up at Old Trafford on Sunday. Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney are all on fire in front of goal. </strong><br><br>Yet boss Ferguson is convinced the comeback of 33-year-old Scholes, fit again after a knee operation last October, will take the side up to another level. Ferguson said: Â“I am more confident now Scholes is coming back. He brings a bit of class at important times in matches. Â“ThatÂ’s what Scholes is probably best at producing, moments that turn games. So itÂ’s a big bonus for us having him back.Â”<br><br>The United veteran has clocked up 548 appearances for United, scoring 138 goals. Ferguson added: Â“ScholesÂ’ great asset down the years has been appearing in the box late. Â“The number of goals he has scored for us from midfield is unique. Â“His other big assets are his passing, his composure and his thinking during a game.<br><br><strong>Sprints </strong><br><br>Â“At 33, I regard him just as highly as I did when he was 23. Â“Players like him and Ryan Giggs, who look after themselves, give themselves extra years. Â“Look at Giggs. HeÂ’s flying this season. Giggs came on at Reading and the stats show he made 45 sprints in the second half. ThatÂ’s incredible for a player of his age.Â”<br><br>Giggs, at 34, remains a key figure in UnitedÂ’s squad, after picking up a record nine titles for the club. Ferguson cannot envisage Old Trafford without the pair. He declared: Â“What IÂ’ve come to realise with these two players is I can no longer see an end to their careers. In fact, I donÂ’t expect to see an end!<br><br>Â“There must come a day when it will end. But the way itÂ’s looking now, I canÂ’t see that end coming. I think IÂ’ll be away from the club before they will. Â“Bearing in mind their longevity, they must be the best two players IÂ’ve had.<br><br>Â“Giggs has been here since the age of 13 and Scholes is the same. They have both been here as long as I have.Â” As well as being UnitedÂ’s most decorated player, Giggs is now well on course to beat Sir Bobby CharltonÂ’s all-time United appearance record and could even do it this season.<br><br>Charlton notched up 759 games, Giggs is on 742.<br><br>Ferguson said: Â“We have 15 games left in the league, so a lot depends on the cups. Â“I hope it happens in the Champions League final!Â”<br></div>
