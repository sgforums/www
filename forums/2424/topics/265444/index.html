            <div class='col-md body'>Of the 3 new buys Anderson, Nani and Owen Hargreaves, i am most concern with is Anderson... He could be the one that may not have the best of next season.<br><br>Hargreaves i belief he will do well and Nani should do ok too but Anderson... I still have my doubts if he is really good enough... Hopefully he will prove my doubts to be wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i think anderson will be better then nani.<br><br>just that the central midfield spots is harder to get a spot especially amc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I already had doubts on Anderson's purchase when his and Nani's double captures were announced. Now we don't lack of central midfielders, with Carrick, Scholes, Hargreaves, Fletcher and even O'Shea are fighting for the 2 spots.<br><br>I dont see why Anderson is being bought to the club. United needs a striker more than a central midfielder so Fergie's decision to sign him comes as a surprise.<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

And if SAF is not plunging into the transfer market for a new striker anytime soon, be prepared to watch him revert to his experimental 4-4-1-1 formation, incorporating his new midfield purchases and Rooney as a lone striker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the key is scholes is not getting any younger, and either fletcher, owen, carrick are consistent scorers...<br><br>And anderson may proves to be a younger version of scholes in that he can grap 10-15 goals per season.<br><br>given that he is young, and with scholes back to guide, may have a chance for him to prove himself.</div>
