            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Wayne Rooney has heaped praise on Sir Alex Ferguson for keeping faith while his form in front of goal dipped earlier in the season.<br><br>The England international made a slow start to the season following his exertions at the World Cup finals and went on a 10-game run without a goal during September and October.<br><br>Rooney's form was questioned by sections of the media, but Ferguson's support was unwavering and the youngster has thanked his manager for not losing faith.<br><br>"I didn't let it get me down. I look back on those 10 games and there were times when the keepers would make brilliant saves to deny me, or I'd get myself in great positions and it just wouldn't come off," Rooney said exclusively in this week's Sport Magazine.<br><br>"(Ferguson) just told me to keep playing and keep it simple, and that the goals would come soon enough. He wasn't concerned about it at all.<br><br>"It would have been worse if we weren't winning games - I think we went through those 10 games without getting beaten.<br><br>"That was the main thing, that other players were weighing in with their own goals and we were winning the games. It didn't matter that I wasn't scoring."<br><br>Rooney admits it was nice to end his drought with a stunning hat-trick against Bolton.<br><br>He added: "It's brilliant to score goals, though, and I was happy to see that first one go in at Bolton - if only to shut a few of the newspapers and the so-called experts up.<br><br>"I know my game's not all about goals, which is all that matters.<br><br>"I like to create goals as much as I like to score them and I'd happily go through the whole season without a single goal if it meant us winning the league." </span></div>

But not the kind of volcano that got him sent off during the WC...like stamping his foot on another player.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>He needs to balance his fiery temper with a level of maturity that only expresses the anger in appropriate situations.
