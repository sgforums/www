With nine league championships, five FA Cups and a European Cup Winners' Cup to their name, their Goodison Park home has been graced by some of the game's greatest talents, such as legendary striker "Dixie" Dean.<br><br>Dean started his career across the water with Merseyside's third League club, Tranmere Rovers who have forged a reputation in recent seasons as the nation's most feared cup giant-killers.<br><br>The city's achievements on the football field are matched across the sporting spectrum. Already boasting a packed programme of activities, Liverpool is limbering up to deliver a range of both long established and new events from grassroots level to regional, national and international standards of performance.<br><br>Liverpool is and always has been a boxing city, producing many national and international champions such as John Conteh, Alan Rudkin and Paul Hodkinson. Employing the UK's only boxing development officer, Liverpool has established partnerships with local clubs, volunteers and the ABA of England.<br><br>At the forefront of British amateur boxing, the city provided national champions in four of the 11 weight divisions of the 2005 ABA Championships and is set to host the 2008 European Boxing Championships - an official qualifying event for the Beijing Olympics later that year.<br><br>A knockout on the tennis court, Liverpool offers one of the UK's largest and longest established tennis development programmes and plays host to world-class players such as Martina Navratilova, Pat Cash, Ilie Nastase and Mansour Bahrami at the annual International Tennis Tournament. Dubbed the Wimbledon of the North, it is the largest exhibition event in Europe.<br><br>With a fine tradition in track and field, Liverpool has played a part in the careers of many outstanding athletes including Olympians Curtis Robb, Steve Smith and Diane Allergreen, and gymnasts such as former world silver medallist and Commonwealth Games champion Neil Thomas and the current British Champion and gold medallist at the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games, Beth Tweddle.<br><br>Elsewhere in Merseyside, the Grand National at Aintree is the world's most famous steeplechase attracting annual crowds of 80,000 while Haydock in Newton-le-Willows is the most visited racecourse in the country. Sefton-based Waterloo Rugby Club in Blundellsands has developed some of the top talents in Rugby Union such as Ben Kay, Austin Healey, Will Greenwood and Kyran Bracken.<br><br>And in July 2006, the Open Golf Championship will return to Royal Liverpool for the first time in 39 years, a highlight for our fourth themed year 'Liverpool Performs' as the city celebrates its sporting achievements.<br></div>
