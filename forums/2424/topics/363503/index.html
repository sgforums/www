              <h1>Real switch sights to Ronaldo</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/dw3udz.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The ink is barely dry on the
                  multi-million Euro contract of Kaka, but Real Madrid president
                  Florentino Perez has already turned his attentions to another of his
                  club’s favourite pursuits.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is once more uppermost in the Spanish giants’
                  thoughts, with Perez claiming that he will do everything he can to
                  bring the Manchester United number seven to Madrid.</p>
              <p>Perez, who was installed as president for the second time earlier
                  this month, was insistent, however, that he would not compromise
                  further the already soured relations with United after Ramon Calderon
                  invoked the fury of Sir Alex Ferguson who famously remarked that he
                  would not sell Real Madrid 'a virus'.</p>
              <p>“I am going to do everything possible to get Cristiano Ronaldo to play for Real Madrid,” Perez told Onda Cero.</p>
              <p>“I have read that the player came to an agreement with his team to sign a clause.</p>
              <p>“Of the famous contract that they speak about and that there is an
                  amount agreed to sign him I know nothing because I haven’t seen it.</p>
              <p>“Players appear more expensive and then they are cheaper. The main thing is that his club want to sell him.</p>
              <p>“What I want is to maintain a good relationship with the clubs.”</p>
              <p>Real have also courted Liverpool playmaker Xabi Alonso, but Perez
                  did not sound optimistic about the possibility of a deal being done.</p>
              <p>“He is a great player. Having said that, he plays in a great team and we don’t know either if they want to sell him."</p>
              <p>Arjen Robben, meanwhile, has been mooted as a possible new arrival
                  at Anfield and Perez did admit that new signings would inevitably lead
                  to departures.</p>
              <p>“If we want to bring some in, then others will have to leave," added Perez.</p>
              <p>"Sneijder and Robben are two players that have a good reputation in Europe and many teams in Europe have an interest in them.”</p>

              Utd would need to replace Scholes, Neville and Giggs. 
              
              Maybe we have the replacements in the form of Carrick/Anderson, Rafael and Nani? 
              
              But I still think we should sell Nani. 
              
              If Tevez goes, we'll need to bring in at least 1 quality striker to replace him. Benzema anyone? 
              
              I don't mind Franck Ribery but I'm not so sure if he's able to take the hard knocks of the EPL. 
              
              Pls don't waste money on Antonio Valencia. I think he's only an average player. 
              
              I would prefer David Silva, but I have my doubts. (as per Franck Ribery).

              Lets not blame Ronaldo, he has done his best for United these last few years... United have won many titles with him and now he is leaving for a world record fee which will benefit United...
              
              Actually, United have been setting themselves up to sign Antonio Valencia since Jan... So I think they already knew what they were doing... 
              
              For me, if this deal happens, I will just wish him all the best in Spain...

              Well, lets be fair to the fellow... If someone is willing to pay you $200,000 a week after tax compare to what he is getting at $120k before tax... Which would you prefer?
              
              He has done his job at United, he could have demanded to leave last season but he stayed back... And, if United can't afford to pay him $400k per week before tax, they shouldn't stop him or get in his way... Better to take the $80m now than to wait another year and his value will drop cos his contract will have lesser time on it by then.

              Money plays a part in his decision, but I think he felt that he has won everything in BPL in England and wanted another challenge in winning trophies and living in another country like Spain, who is closer to his country in Portugal, the weather and lifestyle.
              
              The career of a footballer is short and he is already 24, he has 6 more years before he turned 30, by then he would have reached his peak.
              
              With Kaka and Ronaldo at RM midfield, its really incredible, with 2 of the best midfielders in the world, but whether they are able to gel, is another issue. It may take a season or two to gel on the pitch, but it's still an awesome midfield partnership.
              
              RM may now strongly challenge Barcelona for the Liga title and one of the favourites for CL title surely.

              Not sure if how Man Utd will fare in the BPL and CL after Ronaldo and Tevez departure will have an impact,especially with new additions to the squad, will take time to gel with the current players.
              
              If Man Utd dun retain the BPL title, many critics would said the sale of Ronaldo affected them.
              
              Read that RM is willing to sell Robben for 7m pounds, maybe Man Utd should buy Robben, who is injury prone like Giggs was in the past, probably due to the way he runs.

              I hope Fergie go out and buy Ribery, Benzema, De Rossi, Robben.
              
              This would be an awesome lineup for next season :)
