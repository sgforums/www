              <h1>United striker Tevez left mystified as permanent United deal stalls</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/06/article-0-02C561FE00000578-802_306x423.jpg" alt="Carlos Tevez" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>On the bench: Tevez has not started in United's last two games</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Carlos Tevez is growing frustrated and mystified about why </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> have not asked him to sign a permanent deal. The Argentina forward is beginning to wonder if he is fully appreciated by last season’s double winners and is puzzled as to why promises of a long-term deal have not been fulfilled by the club.</strong><br><br>Tevez and his representatives were told by United in July that moves to turn his two-year loan arrangement into a permanent £32million transfer were imminent. They were subsequently encouraged when chief executive David Gill went public on the club’s intentions.</p>
              <p>‘We have spoken to Carlos and see him as part of our long-term squad,’ said Gill during United’s pre-season tour of South Africa. ‘The only issue is that we would have to sort out a long-term contract for him. ‘But it’s not a problem. We can do it in September, October, November or December. Sir Alex Ferguson has explained it to him and he is very comfortable with it.’ <br><br>At that stage, Tevez was indeed relaxed about his situation but the £31m arrival of striker Dimitar Berbatov and the fact the Bulgarian was handed the No 9 shirt has caused Tevez to question his place in the pecking order.</p>
              <p>It has also now been made clear to Tevez and his agent Kia Joorabchian that a long-term contract will not be placed in front of him until next summer.<br><br>United boss Ferguson said recently: ‘As I understand it a permanent deal will happen at the end of the season. There is no doubt in my mind Carlos Tevez will be here next season and signing the contract.’<br><br>United stressed last night that there had been no change of heart regarding Tevez’s future. Nevertheless, the club did not explain why assurances given to Tevez in the summer have not been backed up by a firm offer. The financial terms of a £32m transfer were put in place in summer 2007 when Tevez came to United after a season at West Ham. All that needs to be agreed is Tevez’s wages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/06/article-0-02D1DF0800000578-247_468x344.jpg" alt="Carlos Tevez" width="468" height="344"></p>
              <p><em>Battle: Tevez is no longer clear first choice</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But with football being affected by the credit crunch, it is thought United are not keen on committing to a contract until absolutely necessary, though they will today announce a renewal of their sponsorship deal with Budweiser until 2010.<br><br>Also, Tevez will probably seek a pay increase on his £80,000-a-week deal and United see no reason why they should negotiate one until nearer the end of the loan arrangement. Tevez remains content at the club and has privately laughed off stories linking him with United’s newly-rich neighbours Manchester City.<br><br>If the 23-year-old does decide to leave United his likely destination will be Spain. Tevez said: ‘Ever since I came here I have wanted to sign a permanent contract. I had a very happy first season and I would be very happy if the chairman would put a permanent contract in front of me. I would sign it without a doubt.’<br><br>Nevertheless, the former Corinthians player fears privately that he is not as valued as some of his more glamorous colleagues, simply because his style of play is not always as exciting.<br><br>Tevez has admitted in public recently that his goal threat has diminished because of the worker’s role he is asked to play at United and he is now wondering if this is beginning to influence the club’s attitude towards him. Tevez is fighting for a regular place in the United attack. He did not start against Blackburn at the weekend or at Aalborg in the Champions League last Tuesday but was in the team that beat Bolton 10 days ago.</p>

              <p><em>One-off: Paul Ince has told the Old Trafford faithful not to compare Berbatov to Cantona</em></p>
              <p><br><br>Meanwhile, Paul Ince has warned United fans not to expect Berbatov to have the same incredible impact at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona. The Blackburn boss claimed comparisons with the flamboyant Frenchman would not help the 27-year-old make his mark.<br><br>‘It’s a bit unfair to put that pressure on him straight away,’ said Ince. ‘Berbatov is fantastic but Cantona was a one-off for me. Dimitar has to put the Cantona comparisons to bed by being himself. His qualities are different to Eric’s.’</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To be honest, Tevez seemed a little surplus liao now. Not that he is no good, just that Rooney and Ronaldo are better playing together. And with Berba in now, Tevez will get lesser games... Its a lot to pay for a sub striker tho. But should still keep him lor... But it no choice, must lose one then bo pian lor...</p></div>

              alamak, sign him on permanent deal leh..he is good.  Remember how he single handedly keep West Ham in the league?  
              
              Actually Fergie can tweak the lineup to accomodate Tevez what.  He can be the guy behind the two strikers or something...as a creative midfielder.
              
              Cos recent games see Berbatov not so willing to attack, prefering to pass the ball.

Tevez's current contract have about 9 months left and should he get a serious injury on his 7th or 8th month, he could be without salary for the next year or two... Or worse, if he gets a career ending injury, he could be left with nothing... And from the owner's point of view... his valued $30m player can become $0 value overnight... That's the risk players take when they run out their contracts...</p>

I believe there is a gentleman's agreement between him, the Kia bloke and the club for a permanent deal when they confirmed the loan one, the United accountants must have all that in place even when we signed Berbatov. We let him go, we have to spend another 20m to get a player of his quality unless we can pluck out a Ole which is difficult. Tie him down, and our strikers are sorted out for the next 5 years at least. We can concentrate on other areas to improve the team.</p></div>
