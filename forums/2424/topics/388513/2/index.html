              <p>Basket..... I switched off the TV and went to bed when the score was 3-0.... didn't think that Rooney could score another goal.</p>
              <p>Anyway, while 4-0 is a good scoreline by any measure, it doesn't mean that Man U played all that well.</p>
              <p>The scoreline could have gone up to 6-0 or 7-0 had their finishing been better (Owen in particular being the villain here), and once again, they seem to be over-reliant on Rooney.</p>

              <p>Glad to see Fergie playing Nani in his correct position. Please start him on Wednesday. Hmm Valencia says that he sometimes played centrally in Wigan hmmm.</p>
              <p>But lets rest Valencia for Arsenal and lets find out whether Nani is a one-trick pony or whether he can replicate his form against City. He has a lot of potential to be a really good winger. Never understood why Fergie keeps playing him on the left. You play Valencia on the left and you will see a tremendous dip in his form IMO. Please stick to players in their prefered roles.</p>

              <p><strong>One for all, and all for one… it’s a terrible cliché but nevertheless it does sum up one of the essentials for success in team sport. The family of Manchester United is under pressure as a result of all the issues and controversies surrounding the ownership and financial situation of our club that have been stirred up in the media.<br><br></strong>Everyone is entitled to their opinion and to express their disapproval if they don’t like what they see around them, just as it has always been the right of fans to let it be known if they are not happy with the way their team are playing. I’m not slow to express disapproval myself if there is something I don’t agree with, even in the boardroom with the directors, but once I walk out of the meeting I get on with my job as manager of the team.<br><br>Some of our fans are clearly unhappy with the financial position but we mustn’t allow the situation to become divisive. The danger as I see it is that we could be presented as being split, which would be harmful and inaccurate because I believe the vast majority of United fans are behind us and appreciate the importance of standing together in support of the team.<br><br>I could see our opponents rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of watching us fall out among ourselves if we don’t all think carefully about what we are doing. We must not lose our focus, which from where I stand is about building a strong football team that will win trophies. That’s what we are about, or at least should be.<br><br>We must remain loyal to the cause of Manchester United. The staff and players should be quite one-eyed about that and stay true to the history of the club and all the work done by Sir Matt Busby and the other managers who have contributed to creating the great club we have at Old Trafford today.</p>
              <p>This is not about stifling criticism; it’s simply a plea to stand together rather than take action that will damage ourselves more than anyone else. Manchester United is bigger than me, the players, the directors, officials, and the fans, and at this critical stage of our season particularly we need to pull in the same direction. It would be a shame to lose our concentration now because I can really see light at the end of the tunnel as we ready ourselves to push for the championship.<br><br>Getting Edwin Van der Sar back last weekend for the Burnley game was an important moment that I hope will be soon followed by the return from injury of more of our defenders. Rio Ferdinand is well on the road to recovery and Nemanja Vidic is not far away. I have got to say that in their absence Jonny Evans and Wes Brown have been brilliant but there has been no back-up, other than midfield players playing out of position.<br><br>It is perhaps significant that when we had 14 clean sheets last season we had a settled back four. That’s what we want again and when we achieve consistency in defence I’m sure we will get consistency in results. The way Edwin came back to perform against Burnley after only five days training speaks volumes for his professionalism. The Dutchman is becoming one of United’s real legends. I certainly count myself very fortunate to have worked with Edwin and Peter Schmeichel, great personalities and two of the best goalkeepers in the world.<br><br>Edwin’s composure under pressure not only helps his own goalkeeping but the performances of those in front of him. We certainly send our best wishes to his wife, Ann Marie, and wish her a speedy recovery from her illness after bravely allowing Edwin to come back to play for us. Incidentally I must say that restoring Edwin to the team must not be taken as a reflection on T</p>
              <p>games. It was not easy dropping Tomasz but it was the right thing to do because Edwin’s experience behind a relatively new centre back pairing is such a big help. <br><br>We didn’t find Burnley easy and if they had been able to take their chances we could easily have been in trouble. We were rather flattered by the 3-0 win but we will be a bit fresher this afternoon as we welcome Hull City, a team that will also battle all the way. Phil Brown’s men picked up a good point at Tottenham last weekend with their goalkeeper, Boaz Myhill, turning in a brilliant display.<br><br>They dug deep last season when they saved themselves from relegation on the last day of the season and you can be sure that they will battle for their lives again today as they scrap to escape a similar situation this year. We must recognise that, and as I say, we will need to pull together, both on an off the field, if we are to mount a title charge.</p>

              <p>mho, nani played well, cause he was willing to release the ball early, and his crossing improved tremendously. I tot he was valencia in disguise.</p>
              <p>Also Owen may not be the best partner for rooney, and despite his full hearted tries, seems to be missing that yard of acceleration.</p>
              <p>Was quite glad to see Rooney walking away from the tangle/foul with Hunt. He deservedly got the yellow but glad that he did walk away.</p>
              <p>Good to see Rio back, but don't think he was severly tested by Hull, the game vs Gunners will test him more. And then we can see how much he is back. Luckily, Fagan did not make a meal from that "elbow/punch", but not sure whether there will be any investigations from video evidence.</p>
              <p>Fletcher is going himself into the ground, and into a lot of tackles. Surely, that may take a toll on his body. Hopefully, that won't ruin his playing games for later more important games.</p>

              <p>ya he is water carrier in midfield, where he does the dirty jobs like tackling, chasing and heckling the opponents. but he need to improve on his passing though. Makelele is a world class defensive midfielder for chelsea, where he sits and protect the back 4 very well. his passes were also very accurate as well.</p>
