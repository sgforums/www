              <p><strong>Rooney wants new strike partner</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00065/rooney_happy_516x350_65017a.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney wants Manchester United to sign a hit striker this 
              summer to help boost their bid for trophies next season.</strong></p>
              <p>United 
              head into the final day of the Barclays Premier League season having 
              scored 82 goals this campaign, 14 more than last year but 13 less than 
              rivals Chelsea. The defending champions look likely to lose their crown 
              to Chelsea on Sunday and Rooney feels they need to bolster their front 
              tine if they are to reclaim the title.</p>
              <p>In an interview with The 
              People, he said: "If we can bring in two big-name players in it would 
              give us a good chance of getting the League back if Chelsea do win it."</p>
              <p>He
               added: "If you look at the team in 1999 that won the Treble we had four
               forwards, all capable of scoring goals.</p>
              <p>"Now there is me, 
              (Dimitar) Berbatov and Michael Owen. There is Federico Macheda too, but 
              if we can get one more top forward in it would give us the right 
              balance."</p>
              <p>Speculation is rife that a number of clubs are planning 
              audacious attempts to prise Rooney away from Old Trafford - although 
              United are highly unlikely to sell him at any price. And the 24-year-old
               is happy to remain in Manchester.</p>
              <p>He added: "I have two years 
              left on my current contract so talks haven't started yet on a new one. 
              But I am sure after the World Cup we will sit down and speak about a new
               deal."</p>
              <p>Rooney, who is recovering from ankle and groin injuries, 
              has had a fantastic season which has seen him notch 34 goals in all 
              competitions.</p>
              <p>His stunning form means United have barely 
              registered the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo, who left to Real Madrid 
              last summer, and Rooney is expecting more of the same next year.</p>
              <p>"I've
               been disappointed with the last month of the season with injuries but 
              overall I am more than happy with the number of goals I have scored this
               season," he added. "The manager told me he would be playing me more up 
              front and I knew that with Ronaldo and (Carlos) Tevez leaving I would 
              have to score more goals."</p>

With a few Oldies (Ryan Giggs, Pual Scholes, Neville) going to be expiry soon, and with Dimitar Berbatov needing 100 chances to score 1 goal ( haha.. ) Fergie will need more miracle (More Panadols) in 2010/11 in order to keep his job after next season....  Good Players who scores goals normally cost more than 20million pounds nowadays.. secondly, he has to be young... ( at least good for 5-6 years )..  Selling players like Dimitar Berbatov should be a TOP Priority as 30 yo is consider OLD !!! but maybe at a discount of 50%.... Lelong Lelong.. before Fergie buys big !!!</p></div>
