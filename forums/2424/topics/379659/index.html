              <p>http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/oct/22/gary-neville-manchester-united-liverpool..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Over the last few years Gary Neville has laid bare his dislike of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a>,
              he has been fined by the Football Association for deliberately goading
              their supporters and was lucky to escape injury when a group of
              vengeful Liverpudlians spotted him in his car after a game at Old
              Trafford – and tried to overturn it.</p>
              <p>Neville even inspires a tribute chant to celebrate the fact that "he hates Scousers", but the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> captain was in a diplomatic mood as he looked ahead to the clubs
              renewing hostilities at Anfield on Sunday, and the potential damage a
              fifth successive defeat for Liverpool could do to their title hopes.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool
              haven't had the best start to the season but even if we beat them it
              would be too early to write off their championship challenge," Neville
              said. "We cannot knock them out of the title race; that is not an
              interest of ours. There are only nine games gone so it is far too early
              to talk about that.</p>
              <p>"We've still got 29 games to go. We say this
              every year at our club because we have the experience of going through
              it. You can't make any predictions at all until January or February.
              Any team in the top four is capable of winning six or seven games on
              the run and they'll be back up there again."</p>
              <p>This did not sound
              like the man who once declared to a United fanzine: "I can't stand
              Liverpool, I can't stand Liverpool people, I can't stand anything to do
              with them."</p>
              <p>Never one to hold back with his opinions, Neville was
              so flagrantly anti-Liverpool that his father, Neville Neville,
              interrupted one of his rants a few years ago to switch off an
              interviewer's tape-recorder, apparently fearful that his son was
              talking himself into trouble. Neville Jr is said to have responded:
              "But I do hate them, Dad."</p>
              <p>Neville, however, now wants to clarify
              his position. "I've never said I don't respect Liverpool," he says.
              "You have to respect a team that have been as successful as they have
              and have the history and tradition they have. But I'm a United fan and
              the rivalry is well documented. United fans want United to win and
              Liverpool to lose, and it's the same the other way.</p>
              <p>"There are a
              variety of reasons why this fixture is so important – the cities are
              very close yet have different cultures, both clubs have enjoyed great
              periods at different times in the past 40 years, and now we're level on
              the number of championships won.</p>
              <p>"It's always been a really great
              game to play in. We never want to lose, but it's the same for both
              teams. Liverpool has been the biggest game of the season for a long
              time, going back 30 years or more. Our rivalry with Liverpool is bigger
              than with Manchester City. They are the best games to play in, but also
              the hardest to lose."</p>
              <p>United suffered that experience twice last
              season, including a 4–1 thrashing at home in April, but a victory for
              Sir Alex Ferguson's side would put them 10 points clear of Rafael
              Benítez's team. "I wouldn't say we're looking for revenge," Neville
              said. "When the top teams play against each other, it seems to go
              through cycles that teams have good results and bad results. We know
              that anything can happen in these kind of games, so the main thing is
              not losing.</p>
              <p>"These games are always a one-off. They can go either
              way against Liverpool. The fact they lost at home in the Champions
              League and we won away won't really matter. They'll be in front of
              their own fans and we have to be on the top of our game to make sure we
              do well. It is always the same. The most important thing at the end of
              the season is winning the league, and we're delighted that we won it
              last season. We'd rather lose both games again and win the league than
              beat Liverpool and not win the league."</p>
              <p>As for the reception that
              awaits him, Neville still knows he will also be a popular target for
              the crowd, even if most of the hostility is directed towards Michael
              Owen this year on the back of the former Liverpool player joining their
              arch-rivals.</p>
              <p>Owen has already accepted that he will be given a
              tough time and Neville, too, knows it is par for the course. "I don't
              get a great reception at Anfield, I must say," he said. "I'm not their
              favourite son. No United players get a good reception at Anfield, but
              it's the same for their players at our ground, and it is to be expected.</p>
              <p>"The
              atmosphere at Anfield is great, and it's the same when they come to Old
              Trafford. The first thing to try and do away from home is silence the
              crowd because the fans are passionate."</p>
