              <p>Amazing goal worthy of winning the match... </p>
              <p>A Great result today... Honestly, I thought United would drop at
              least 2 points today or maybe even 3 possible...</p>
              <p>Phew... They got all 3 points and City's title chase is at
              least... A little further away for now. Only Arsenal are
              serious contenders at the moment...</p>

              <p>seriously, I think City has narrowed the gap between the two clubs. and if they continue to improve and buy big, it won't be long before they do better than now.</p>

              <p>I think man city played slightly better :) Scholes looked shaky
              last night and rooney's performance was forgettable if not for his
              moment of brilliance. That for me was the goal of the decade.
              Curling fast paced cross, he had to turn his body to hit the ball
              with his boot at the correct angle and power; only people like van
              basten could have done that.</p>
              <p>On a side note, good thing tevez was shut out hehe.</p>
              <p>But question is why berba was on the bench? And i think o'shea
              was out there because of his big match experience. Rafael might
              have gotten two yellows ha.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>with only one striker, it was pretty easy for City to man-mark and out muscle him. It shows how much Fergie 'trusts' berba despite his many goals.</p>
              <p>Rooney's resurgence on the way?? I hope so, man.</p>

              <p>Well was it THE greatest goal ever scored at Old Trafford?<br> <br>Sir Taggart insists that it was. The Rooney Monster says it was the best goal of his career. 
                    <br> <br>So who am I to argue then? It was, in truth, a wonder goal. A 
              moment of sheer blinding brilliance which will be talked about and 
              replayed for years to come. 
                    <br> <br>I wonder what Rooney felt when that spectacular overhead kick zoomed past Joe Hart like a tracer bullet. 
                    <br> <br>My guess is that he felt relief rather than elation. Relief 
              that his God-given talent hadn’t deserted him for good. Relief that he 
              could still score goals which lesser players can only dream about. 
                    <br> <br>I’m also guessing that in a quiet moment on Saturday night 
              Rooney wished that he had scored a goal like that wearing the blue shirt
               of Everton against Liverpool. 
                    <br> <br>Because we all know that deep down Rooney is an Evertonian. 
              And can anything be better than scoring a wonder goal against your 
              genuine derby rivals – in his case Liverpool?<br> <br>You see, the disappointment for me is not that the Blessed Blues were beaten by the Reds on Saturday. 
                    <br> <br>The disappointment for me is that from a playing perspective a
               Manchester derby these days has very little to do with Manchester and 
              its surrounds. 
                    <br> <br>How many of those players on both sides who walked out of the 
              tunnel at Old Trafford at lunchtime on Saturday were born or raised in 
              the Greater Manchester area?<br> <br>The answer is two – and both were wearing red shirts. 
                    <br> <br>The first is Ryan Giggs who was born in Cardiff but brought up
               in Salford. The other is Paul Scholes who was born in Salford but 
              brought up in Langley, North Manchester. 
                    <br> <br>I thought there was a third in Micah Richards until I 
              discovered that the City full-back was actually born in Birmingham and 
              raised in Leeds. 
                    <br> <br>So just two local lads among the 22 players who started 
              Saturday’s match. Can that be described as a Manchester derby? For the 
              fans, absolutely yes. For the vast majority of those players, absolutely
               no. Just another game like any other. 
                    <br> <br>Saturday’s encounter saddened me because I’m old enough to 
              remember when a Manchester derby was exactly what it said on the label.<br> <br>Fans of my generation can still picture Nobby Stiles (Moston) 
              dumping Neil Young (Fallowfield) into the third row of the main stand. 
                    <br> <br>We can still wince at the memory of Mike Doyle (Reddish) and Brian Kidd (Collyhurst) kicking seven bells out of each other. 
                    <br> <br>Because back then in the sixties and early seventies that was 
              what Manchester derbies were like. Local lad against local lad fighting 
              for pride as much as points. 
                    <br> <br>In the run-up to Saturday’s derby Giggs said that if his team 
              lost to the Blues he would lock himself away in his house for the next 
              week. 
                    <br> <br>Ryan, of course, was joking. But in the sixties and seventies 
              that’s exactly what the losing players in a Manchester derby would do. 
                    <br> <br>They would go into hiding for a week. They would steer clear 
              of their local pub or favourite restaurant for fear of running into fans
               who still hadn’t swallowed the disappointment of a derby defeat. 
                    <br> <br>Do you think that Carlos Tevez imprisoned himself in his own house over the weekend?<br> <br>Had his team lost would Dimitar Berbatov have gone straight to
               bed on Saturday evening, vowing to remain there for the next seven 
              days?<br> <br>Of course not. And why should they? Tevez is Argentinian. 
              Berbatov is Bulgarian. How can they have the same feeling for a 
              Manchester derby that a home-grown player would?<br> <br>I suppose it’s just a sign of the times and I’m a grumpy old dinosaur who is still living in the past. 
                    <br> <br>But I’m proud of the fact that when the Blues won the First 
              Division title in 1968 every single member of that team was born and 
              bred in England. 
                    <br> <br>That’s never going to happen again, is it? And Manchester 
              derbies will never again be jam-packed with players born or raised in 
              this city. I’ve got to accept it. But nobody will ever make me embrace 
              it.</p>
