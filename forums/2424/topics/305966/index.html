              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo believes his stunning free-kick goal against Portsmouth could be the best of his career so far.</p>

              <p>In a post-match interview, United's leading scorer pondered: "It's difficult to say but maybe this one is the best. It's my style to shoot like that - sometimes it's a goal, sometimes not. I'm very proud to help my team."<br><br>Opposition goalkeeper David James could only shrug his shoulders after being beaten by the pearl of a setpiece. The former England goalkeeper looked awestruck and he wasn't the only player to feel that way.<br><br>Ronaldo's team-mate Michael Carrick told <em><a href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv"><strong><span style="color: #0066cc;">MUTV</span></strong></a></em>: "I was in the wall, trying to block David James' view. I just turned around and saw it go in the top corner. It was a fantastic free-kick, probably the best one he's scored. It was nice to see it fly in.</p>
              <p>"He practices an awful lot and obviously  the more you do that, the better you'll get. A few have flown in this season and I don't think that's down to luck. We all know the ability he's got. Hopefully he can keep that going for the rest of the season and score a few more."<br><br>Reds defender Nemanja Vidic added: "It was unbelievable. I think it was the best goal I've seen in a game I have played in."<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson also gave Ronaldo's 13th-minute strike top billing, telling <em><a href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv"><strong><span style="color: #0066cc;">MUTV</span></strong></a></em>: "That must be the best free-kick in the Premier League.<br><br>"It was a marvellous hit. It was within two inches of the junction of the crossbar and the post. No goalkeeper in the world could possibly save it."</p>

              <p class="article">But it was his superb 25-yard second which had the Old Trafford boss drooling.</p>
