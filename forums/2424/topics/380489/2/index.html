              <p>3 off the woodwork, Kiko did well! Alittle more time for him to mature and he can start fighting for a place with Owen! IMO Fergie should have subed Owen instead of Kiko.<br><br>I guess MoTM goes to CSKA's Goal and Goalkeeper! Lots of heart stoping saves he made.</p>
              <p>Fletcher didn't dive! The ref got it wrong there, but I guess from the distance the ref was at it look like he did?</p>

              <p>VDS is almost 40 years old, so he will need more time to recover from his physical exertions than the younger players. no harm giving him a rest instead of playing isnt it.</p>

              <p>I do agree, u are right.</p>
              <p>however, sometimes, U want to play a player so as to keep him on the knife edge, or to keep his mind/body in the top form. Cause once they drop, like a Rio, it is hard to push them back.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, next game is vs Chelsea, so it is crucial EDS is on top.</p>
              <p>However, there is a risk of players getting injured when played.</p>
              <p>So a fine balance if U asked me.</p>

              <p>Thrilling comeback, six goals and another dramatic fight to the finish.</p>
              <p>For the sake of his nerves, Sir Alex Ferguson will hope it is not like this at Chelsea on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Manchester United are through to the knockout stages of the Champions League with two games to spare and their season rumbles on in its own peculiar way. Results come while convincing performances remain elusive.</p>

              <p>Against Moscow, Ferguson's team provided another night of pure theatre. No team play with such ambition, confidence and purpose when the chips are down and, at 3-1 behind with only six minutes left, they were certainly down. From that perspective, United remain box office.</p>
              <p>It cannot go on, however. If United want to retain the Premier League and mount another creditable challenge in Europe they really must find a way to perform cohesively and more consistently.</p>
              <p>In other words, they have to become a little less exciting. Boring? Yes, perhaps that's the way forward. For now at least.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Afterwards Ferguson smiled a relieved smile and spoke of his team's fighting qualities. But he knows the truth.</p>
              <p>Much more of this and results - unlike the scrambled draw against Sunderland and the last-gasp win against Manchester City - will start to go against them.</p>
              <p>United were scintillating for the last 20 minutes For the previous 70 they had veered wildly from moderate to dreadful. Their defending - admittedly with a second-string back four - was shocking while their goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar all of a sudden looked his age.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/04/article-1225021-0712573B000005DC-932_468x301_popup.jpg"><span class="clickToEnlargeTop">Enlarge</span> <span class="clickToEnlargeButton"> </span> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/04/article-1225021-0712573B000005DC-932_468x301.jpg" alt="Milos Krasic" width="468" height="301"> </a>

              <p>Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, both absent with injuries, have had their difficult moments this season but they have never been this bad.</p>
              <p>With United all but through to the next stage and CSKA managing to fashion scoring opportunities only from long range, it had looked like being a rather mundane, pedestrian affair.</p>
              <p>One goal, though, changed everything. Centre forward Tomas Necid had looked dangerous and intelligent from the start and when he received a ball in to his chest from the left 20 minutes before half-time he laid it off expertly to set Alan Dzagoev clear on goal.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/03/article-1225021-07126BE8000005DC-568_468x294_popup.jpg"><span class="clickToEnlargeTop">Enlarge</span> <span class="clickToEnlargeButton"> </span> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/03/article-1225021-07126BE8000005DC-568_468x294.jpg" alt="Vasili Berezutskiy " width="468" height="294"> </a>

              <p>It looked as though the 19-year-old had taken the ball too far to the left as he tried to approach goal. But the ferocity of the teenager's left-foot shot took Old Trafford by surprise and the ball flew across Van der Sar's body and high in to the far corner.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/04/article-1225021-0712C527000005DC-409_233x266_popup.jpg"><span class="clickToEnlargeTop">Enlarge</span> <span class="clickToEnlargeButton"> </span> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/04/article-1225021-0712C527000005DC-409_233x266.jpg" alt="The Russian Kaka" width="233" height="266"> </a></div>
              <p>Replays suggested that Van der Sar's positioning could have been better and the Dutch veteran looked a little shell-shocked. Above all, though, it was a stunning finish.</p>
              <p>Stung by this, United needed to react quickly and to their credit they did. Owen had already spurned two very presentable chances, mis-kicking totally when set up by a Nani- Antonio Valencia one-two in the ninth minute and being denied by Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev when clear on goal just before the 20-minute mark.</p>
              <p>But Owen will always punish you eventually if you keep giving him chances and the 29-year-old swept the equaliser into the corner from ten yards with his right foot when Nani's clever flick found him.</p>

              <p>With Ferguson's team back on terms, it seemed the danger had passed. Not so.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/04/article-1225021-0712C5EF000005DC-380_233x482_popup.jpg"><span class="clickToEnlargeTop">Enlarge</span> <span class="clickToEnlargeButton"> </span> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/04/article-1225021-0712C5EF000005DC-380_233x482.jpg" alt="Manchester United v CSKA Moscow" width="233" height="482"> </a></div>
              <p>Within two minutes of conceding the goal, CSKA built an attack down the right and when Necid once again delivered a telling lay-off, midfielder Milos Krasic ambled in behind a static United defence, rounded Van der Sar and restored the lead on the turn.</p>
              <p>Ferguson had identified Krasic as a dangerous player after United won a tight game in Moscow two weeks ago but it seems his defenders were not listening.</p>
              <p>If Van der Sar had been culpable for the first goal, this time the responsibility was collective. Paul Scholes and Federico Macheda brought good saves from Akinfeev from distance as United came again just before half-time.</p>
              <p>But within minutes of the restart, CSKA struck once more as a deep free-kick from the left was allowed to drop on to Vasili Berezutski's head. It was a simple finish and another shocking goal for the home team.</p>
              <p>In the dug out, Ferguson had seen enough. On came new father Wayne Rooney and then Gabriel Obertan. The shift in emphasis came quickly.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher should have had a penalty, Owen saw a header saved and Macheda hit the post. Two Rooney follow-ups were saved.</p>
              <p>As the pressure built and the Stretford End sensed it may be worth staying to the end, CSKA began to wilt as many have before.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Scholes guided in a header from a free-kick with six minutes left and then - two minutes into added time - Valencia's shot from long range was deflected past the heroic Akinfeev by Georgi Schennikov.</p>
              <p>By now it was chaos and amid it all CSKA had Deividas Semberas sent off.</p>
              <p>It was hard not to feel sorry for the Russian team. Theirs has not been a good season and this would have been the highlight. For United there will be better days ahead. Won't there?</p>

              <h2>FLETCHER STUNNED BY BOOKING</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/11/240/Darren-Fletcher-Tripped-Man-U-v-CSKA-Champs-L_2380402.jpg" border="0" alt="Fletcher - booked for diving."></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Darren Fletcher has spoken of his disbelief at the booking he collected for diving during Manchester United's 3-3 draw with CSKA Moscow at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>When the Scot went down under Vasili Berezutsky's ill-timed tackle, it appeared a certain spot-kick.</p>
              <p>TV replays backed up that view but Portuguese referee Olegario Benquerenca showed Fletcher a yellow card for simulation.</p>
              <p>Fortunately for the Red Devils, goals from Michael Owen, Paul Scholes and a deflected strike from Antonio Valencia in stoppage time earned them the point to book their place in the last 16 - but the failure to award a penalty could have been costly.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has already called on UEFA to amend their rules to allow appeals in such situations, mindful of the fact Fletcher missed last season's final against Barcelona through suspension.</p>
              <p>And the Scotland star admitted he was completely stunned by the decision.</p>
              <p>"It is a penalty," he said.</p>
              <p>"I have turned and the lad has just swept me off my feet. I have not tried to fall or stay on my feet or anything.</p>
              <p>"When the referee blew his whistle I just thought "great, it is a penalty and we are back in the game". When I saw he was walking towards me with the yellow card I could not believe it.</p>
              <p>"I am not having much luck with these cards. Hopefully it will change in the later stages."</p>
