              <p>As a Liverpool fan for the last 25 odd years, it hurts to say Congrats to Man U. But its fair to say that over the season, Man U has proven that it is indeed a team with top pedigree. Liverpool for all its efforts and undeniably, arguably, much improved has also underlying issues with ownership, funds, players and whole lot of internal problems. I am very happy in the sense that it has been donkey years where I saw a Liverpool team seriously digging in and challenging for the league up till this late. ANd I seriously think with a couple of reinforcements, we can be up there again challenging with Man U next year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So while it hurts to say Congrats, I will still say it to the Man U fans out there, Congrats but do watch out, Liverpool will be back. Meanwhile enjoy the win because now we have not just one greatest team in England but now we have 2. Man U, under Fergie, is not a great team, it is a legend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Congrats</p>

                  was then asked who was important to him, on the path to the
                  championship, and displayed his T-shirt that said 'Oyster FC'.<br><br>"That's for my brother's, their Liverpool Sunday league team," he revealed.<br><br>Back on message, he continued, "The last three years are unbelievable, so hopefully we can continue this for the next few years.<br><br>"My goal tally? Yes, I'm delighted. I really enjoyed the season, so I'm looking forward to next year, too."<br><br>Rooney's striking partner, Dimitar Berbatov, was also in high spirits.<br><br>"This is my first title, so I hope there are many more to come," said the Bulgarian.<br><br>"This season for me? It was OK, but we won the title, and that's important."</p>

              <p>Actually, I don't think so. The Man U players just seem eager to get more. Gary Neville was already talking about doing it next year again. They just seem to want to get everything they can.</p>

              <p>spurs were still 2-1 up after the penalty was awarded, i would
              say it was a bad call by the referee on that one...but then
              mistakes happens everywhere...remember the phantom goal against
              chelsea?</p>
              <p>how was wigan kelong against united is far beyond my
              comprehension <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>ah well...season is over...united is the champion....in case
              benitez still dunno why united are the champions...please let him
              take a look the the table again</p>
              <p>its not what team u beat....its how many you beat</p>
