              Manchester Senior Cup Final
              Reebok Stadium, 12 May 2009
              
              BOLTON WANDERERS 0
              
              MANCHESTER UNITED 1
              Tosic 8
              
              United's Reserves retained the Manchester Senior Cup after Zoran Tosic's early goal proved enough to overcome Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium.
              
              The Serbian struck his first Reds goal since arriving in January after eight minutes, as his heavily deflected free-kick wrong-footed Trotters goalkeeper Adam Bogdan.
              
              United peppered the hosts' goal with shots on goal, with only inspired goalkeeping from Bogdan keeping the difference down to a single goal. That precarious advantage meant Bolton were always in the tie, however, and Ben Amos was required to make two fine saves himself midway through the second period.
              
              The Reds' intent to attack was signalled by a line-up which contained Kiko Macheda, Danny Welbeck, Lee Martin and Tosic as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Warren Joyce sought to secure the second trophy of their spell in charge.
              
              The early exchanges belonged to United, who immediately put the hosts under pressure. When Tosic struck from 20 yards, albeit via a sizeable deflection off the wall, it had been coming. Two minutes later, Macheda headed Martin's free-kick over from six yards.
              
              From there, Bogdan took centre stage. First he superbly finger-tipped a low Tosic effort wide, then fielded a powerful close-range effort from Martin before Macheda and Eckersley both fired narrowly off target.
              
              Martin seemed to have doubled United's advantage on 35 minutes as he raced onto Macheda's pass and slotted through Bogdan's legs, only for a late and slightly harsh offside flag to keep the scoreline intact.
              
              Another deflected Tosic effort dribbled just wide the post as United ended the first half on top, and the game continued in the same vein after the break as Bolton struggled to cope with the Reds' passing and ball retention.
              
              Tosic twice drew solid saves from Bogdan as a second goal seemed inevitable, but Bolton served belated notice of their threat in drawing two superb saves from Reds goalkeeper Amos around the hour mark.
              
              First Tope Obadeyi burst into the United area and only Amos' fingertips prevented the striker's shot from nestling in the bottom corner, but even better was the England youth international's superb reaction to turn Aaron Mooy's free-kick round the post.
              
              Those scares provoked a flurry of United half-chances, as Macheda, Welbeck and Danny Drinkwater all fired narrowly off-target, and only another superb save from Bogdan prevented substitute Magnus Eikrem from putting deserved gloss on the scoreline in the final minute.
              
              One goal was enough, however, and it was fitting that the impressive Tosic should seal a second trophy of the campaign for the Reds' Reserves. Next season will begin with the chance of another - the Lancashire Senior Cup final in August, in which Bolton will again provide the opposition.
              
              United: Amos; Eckersley, C Evans, De Laet, James; Tosic (Stewart, 87), Drinkwater (Eikrem, 87), Possebon, Martin; Welbeck (Gill, 74), Macheda. 
              Subs not used: Devlin, Dudgeon.
