We feel we have a progressive, maturing team that will only get better."<br><br>After showing signs of progress in his recovery from an ankle injury sustained on European Under-21 Championship duty with Portugal, Nani could make his first United appearance against FC Seoul on Thursday.<br><br>Hargreaves will miss out with a minor knee problem, although Ferguson is confident the England international will be fit to face Shenzhen in Macau next Tuesday.<br><br>With Dario Gradi vacating the manager's job at Crewe, Ferguson is now the longest-serving boss in the English game.<br><br>The secret of his success, he claims, is keeping things simple, having a long-term focus, and getting a bit of luck when it is needed.<br><br>"One advantage I have had as a manager is that I have played the game," he outlined.<br><br>"When I started as a young manager at the age of 32, that was the most important credential.<br><br>"I also prepared to be a manager. I did all my coaching badges and never missed one summer course in 10 years.<br><br>"I was committed to the job and once I went into it I maintained the same things I have today.<br><br>"I still have the same work ethic and I don't over-complicate the job.<br><br>"But there is some luck attached to it too. You have to be lucky to survive in football today."</div>
