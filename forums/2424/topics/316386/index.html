              <p class="introcopy"><strong>STEVE BRUCE last night hit back at John Terry and conspiracy theorists who fear his Wigan team will allow Manchester United to win the title.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Latics manager Bruce has been challenged by Chelsea skipper Terry to uphold the integrity of English football by going all-out for a victory at the JJB that would rob his mentor, Sir Alex Ferguson, and his former club of their 10th Premier League crown.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Bruce, as United’s second most successful captain and Ferguson’s on-field general of the Nineties, has come under scrutiny as the title scrap goes down to the wire. But Bruce, who won three FA Cups, three titles, the European Cup Winners’ Cup and a League Cup during his time at Old Trafford, is insulted by suggestions of any collusion between him and his old boss.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">He is being asked if Ferguson has been on the phone, just days after Chelsea boss Avram Grant questioned the determination of Alan Curbishley and West Ham to beat United last weekend. Bruce has been in Egypt on a scouting mission, but made it clear that Ferguson knows exactly what he is in for on Sunday.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“Sir Alex won’t be expecting me to do him any favours and he knows that he will not get any,” said Bruce. “For anyone to think otherwise, that is unacceptable. “The one thing that sets our league apart from all others is the honesty and integrity of it all. That is what makes it the best league in the world. It always has done. “We know that we have a responsibility to treat the game just like we have treated all the others this season and to try to win it. That is why we are looking forward to it so much.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“It has been a fixture all the fans have had their eye on, and we want to put on a show. Our fans have been magnificent all season and this is the perfect end to the season for us. “No one should have any worries about the way we approach the game and how we will go about it. All of the staff and players will be totally professional.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Chelsea need to win their match against Bolton at Stamford Bridge and hope that United drop points. Terry revved up what will be one of the most tense final games for many seasons, while Grant has made it clear that he expects Bruce to do all he can to try to upset United’s bid for another title.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Terry said he would be “disappointed” if Bruce and Co do not do the league justice and hopes that they will give Chelsea a chance. He has made it clear that Wigan have a duty to put on the same kind of committed performance against United as they did at Stamford Bridge last month. Bruce knows victory could earn him extra funds for the transfer market this summer as he looks to build on his club’s revival.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Despite spending most of the season in the bottom three, Wigan would finish 12th if they can beat United and Newcastle lose at Everton. That would be enough to gain the Latics, who currently lie 13th, £6.4million prize-money. But should they lose, they could finish as low as 15th which would net only £4.3m. Bruce said: “We have to be professional and we will be.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“The difference between finishing two places in the Premier League these days is almost £1.5m.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Bruce is seeking his first Premier League success over Ferguson in 10 attempts. He faced Ferguson nine times while he was in charge at Birmingham, with United winning seven times. The other two showdowns ended all-square.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">But Kevin Kilbane believes in-form Wigan can ruin hopes of a Premier League and Champions League Double for United and Ferguson. The Latics are unbeaten in five and head into the match on the back of an impressive 2-0 win at Aston Villa. Irish midfielder Kilbane said: “We wanted to be safe before we played United and this is now the case. “We were delighted with how things went at Villa, and the boss has done a terrific job. He has been the key.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Bruce hopes to strengthen his squad for next year by signing Egypt striker Amr Zaki. Wigan had a £4.1m bid for him turned down in January, and Bruce was in Egypt to check on the El Zamalek player, who turned 25 last month and has scored 21 goals for his country in 40 internationals. Zaki’s agent, Mohamed Sayed, has claimed the player is interested in moving to the JJB Stadium but is likely to use the Latics only as a stepping-stone. “Bruce believes Zaki can pull it off in England and the Premier League if he joined Wigan,” said Sayed. “Many European clubs are eyeing Zaki, which is great. But every footballer’s highest dream is to perform in the Premier League.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Sayed added: “Wigan are a mediocre team in the Premier League, but it is the perfect destination for Zaki as he could draw the attention of bigger clubs later.”</p>

              <h2>Should United risk Wayne Rooney against Wigan?</h2>
              <p>Wayne Rooney still appears to be recovering from the hip injury which kept him out of the wins against Barcelona and West Ham.</p>
              <p>But with United needing another victory this weekend he might well be needed on the pitch against Wigan.</p>
              <p>The question is should Rooney be rested again to make sure he is
              fully-fit for the Champions League final in Moscow in two weeks - or
              should he be powering United's forward line at the JJB this weekend
              first?</p>
