              <p><br>Actually its more like Carvalho wasn't playing then Terry got injured by Cech (who looked really bad in his new Guantanamo Bay jersey)... In the end they ended up having Alex and Essien in centre-back positions... And after they took the lead, Grant wanted to protect their lead and took Joe Cole off in the 78mins for a more defensive Obi when Bolton started to throw everything at them in the last 15 mins... Alex and Essien probably played in the centre-back positions for the first time together and it shows when Alex's poor clearance from Bolton's most deadliest style set piece fell to a Bolton player... Who made space and shot it through Alex's legs as well as Cech's...</p>

              <p><br>as long as a few chelsea players play half-heartedly (eg the strikers wont bother chasing for balls, midfielders dont come back defend). Left few defenders and gk who defend painskatingly also no use.</p>

              <p>Fergie played his mind games really well... Terry, Ballack, Carvalho, Mikel, Cech and Grant all came out and talk so early in the week then came Sunday, people forget already... Fergie waited until the last day then said Bolton “partying all week” when they only party one night on last Monday... lol</p>
              <p>That seemed to have talked Bolton into performing... If you watch the match you can see Bolton really going for it like that... rushing to close down on the chelsea players whenever they get the ball... and wasting time when they themselves have the ball... lol </p>

              <p>well, I think Mourinho changed the EPL altogether.</p>
              <p>He made teams more effective in that, they have to get points on the board from the moment the season starts, else Chelsea will have a big lead.</p>
              <p>And to some, he is a breathe of fresh air in the way he conduct himself, but sadly, to the oil-man, he is foul air so he got kicked out.</p>

              <p>Despite winning them the league title, I think Jose was a terrible starting manager for them... Honestly, i used to find chelsea a likeable club until Jose came along... Cos during Gullit and Vialli times... They were playing more attractive football and their PR skills were not bad too... But when Jose came in, all these changed... They became the most hated club on the planet until non united fans actually started supporting United just to see Jose fall... Its not the money Roman spent that made people hate them but more because of Jose's behaviour... The way he went about conducting himself was just despicable...</p>
              <p>Roman has done the right thing in getting rid of him but i am afraid the demage has been done and it will take a few years to repair it... But i belief they are on their way. I for one isn't surprise Real and Barce will have doubts in employing him as the "face of their club"... Cos their years of footballing heritage could all go down the drain if he continues to behave the way he was at Chelsea... Imagine if Real or Barce become the most hated club in the world... it can't be good for their marketing don't you think so?</p>
