              <p><em>Bryan Robson's arrival as United's British record signing was formalised on the Old Trafford pitch on 3 October 1981, ahead of a devastating display against Wolves...<br><br></em><strong>The Background: </strong>One of the stars in Ron Atkinson's West Brom team of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bryan Robson was one of England's hottest properties in 1981. Liverpool and United both went in for the talented young midfielder, but the Merseysiders' reluctance to bid more than £1million left the door ajar for the Reds. Their £1.5million bid secured Robbo's services, and an enduring bond between player and club was born.<br><br><strong>The Occasion: </strong>Now manager at Old Trafford, Atkinson's love for the razzle-dazzle, showbiz side of the game led to Robson completing the signing of his contract on the OT turf, shortly before kick-off between United and Wolves. Flanked by his new manager and chairman, a somewhat hirsuite Robson penned his deal and headed straight up to the stands. Whether naturally on song or galvanized by the presence of the expensive new-boy, United tore the visitors</p>
              <p>apart, winning 5-0 through a Sammy McIlroy hat-trick, and further goals from Garry Birtles and Frank Stapleton.<br><br><strong>The Aftermath: </strong>Robson made his debut four days later, in a League Cup defeat at Tottenham, and went on to enjoy one of the most distinguished careers in United history. 'Captain Marvel' made 461 appearances and scored 99 goals, and continues to command legendary status among United supporters, as well as an ambassadorial role for the club.</p>

              <p><em>In unusual circumstances, United's first appearance in the UEFA Super Cup took place on home soil, on 19 November, 1991...<br><br></em><strong>The Background:</strong> By virtue of United's win over Barcelona in the European Cup Winners' Cup Final, and Red Star Belgrade's penalty shootout victory against Marseille in the European Cup Final, the two sides met in the UEFA Super Cup. As war brewed in Yugoslavia, UEFA decreed the tie would be a one-off final at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p><strong>The Occasion:</strong> Watched by a paltry crowd of just 22,110, United were led a merry dance for much of the game by an incredibly skilful, fast flowing Red Star side. “Anyone who was at that game must still be wondering how we managed to win it,” Sir Alex Ferguson admits. “I know I am. In the first half, Dejan Savicevic was absolutely sensational and it was a miracle that we came in level at half-time." Brian McClair's deployment as a withdrawn striker in the second half stemmed the tide, and the Scot even popped up to pinch a close-range winner just after the hour. "They battered us, then somehow I managed to get the winner," recalls the striker. "It was a robbery."</p>
              <p><strong>The Aftermath: </strong>Red Star's much-fabled side had its brightest talents cherry-picked by European giants, while United would have to be patient in continental terms. Although the Premier League title followed within two years, it was 1999 before the Reds ruled Europe. In two subsequent Super Cup Finals, against Lazio (1999) and Zenit St Petersburg (2008), United have lost out by the odd goal each time.</p>
