              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Nani is capable of becoming one of the world’s very best players in the coming years.</strong> <br><br>Like most fans, Sir Alex has been thrilled by the winger's rapid transformation this season into one the most consistent and exciting players in Europe.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese international is now one of the first names of the manager’s teamsheet and, at 22, has plenty of time to break into the highest echelon of players in world football.</p>
              <p>"I don't need to trumpet Nani's improvement," Sir Alex told reporters on Friday. "He has been consistent all season. He is a match-winner; he creates goals and he scores goals.</p>
              <p>"He had seven strikes at goal against [Manchester] City and that is a high ratio for a winger, particularly in a big game, and he scored a goal as well. Every time he gets near that box you think something is going to happen.</p>
              <p>"He is starting to mature and be consistent. At 22 years of age, that gives him a good chance of getting to the level you are talking about."</p>
              <p>As Nani develops, it’s inevitable parallels will be drawn between him and compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo. While Nani may not yet be at Ronaldo’s level, the United boss believes the Reds’ number 17 has adapted to Premier League football sooner than his former mentor.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldo was exceptional, a once-in-a-lifetime player," Sir Alex added. "But it did take him time to settle and develop in the English game. I think Nani has done it a bit quicker."</p>

              <p>Anyway, don't say that nani cannot be as good as ronaldo. When ronaldo was making senseless dribbles and wayward crosses....no one expected him to be sold one day as the world's most expensive player.</p>
              <p>That little gut hunch tells me that nani may just do it. Let's wait and see. He has a lot of time on his side.</p>

              <p class="art-txt-first">Manchester United winger Nani is convinced the key to victory over Marseille in three weeks' time is to make a fast start.</p>
              <p>Wednesday night's goalless draw at the Stade Velodrome means United will almost certainly have to beat the French champions at Old Trafford on March 15 if they are to seal a Champions League quarter-final berth.</p>
              <p>It is not a task that looks beyond them on the evidence of Marseille's performance but it is clear Sir Alex Ferguson's men will have to play with a greater degree of urgency.</p>
              <p>"We need to make sure we are positive and strong from the start in the next game and do our best to try and score an early goal," said Nani.</p>
              <p>"Our performance last night wasn't the best.</p>
              <p>"We worked hard but sometimes things don't turn out how you'd hope.</p>
              <p>"We have another opportunity to get the job done in the next game and with our supporters behind us we know we have a fantastic chance."</p>
              <p>Before they get the opportunity however, United face a series of fixtures that will determine much about their quest for silverware on the domestic front.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, they head to Wigan looking to re-open a four point gap on Arsenal ahead of trips to Chelsea and Liverpool, before tackling the Gunners themselves on March 12 for a place in the FA Cup semi-finals, providing Arsene Wenger's men dispose of Leyton Orient next week.</p>
              <p>The magnitude of these fixtures is certainly not lost on Nani.</p>
              <p>"We have some massive games coming up," he said.</p>
              <p>"The next few weeks are going to be very important for us.</p>
              <p>"We are focused on winning every game because we know the results in the next few matches could prove decisive."</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson might dwell on what would appear a good first-leg European result but, hopefully, he will set aside little time to reflect on the performance. This was a game devoid of attacking intent, lacking creativity for long spells, and ended a poor advertisement for the competition when compared to the more attractive play served up by Arsenal, Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur over the last week.</p>
              <p>The frustration was that Marseille had appeared there for the taking. Sir Alex had split his front three, with Nani happy enough on the right and Rooney far less so on the left in a position to which he has grudgingly become accustomed to playing in European away games. The powerful Mbia held Berbatov but, while the home side's own three midfielders sat goalside and kept their shape, rarely risking a forward run, United still had one clear pressure point to tap. It came down their right, where Nani illuminated the match whenever able to race past the former United full-back, Heinze. The Portuguese had the beating of his man for pace and the visitors initially offered him a fair supply-line, floating balls beyond the defender for Nani to chase and collect while dragging either Mbia or Diawara out of the centre to intercept.</p>
              <p>The winger may not have maximized his obvious advantage in speed over Heinze, but the tactic offered United a threat in what was, for so long, a tedious stalemate. Yet, having used Nani as their main focus of first-half attacks, United ignored the Portuguese for long periods after the break when one thought they might have pressed home this advantage. Deschamps had clearly instructed the Argentinian veteran to get tighter to his man in the second period and, indeed, push further down the flank himself to force Nani to defend and assist O'Shea. Yet the fact Heinze was tighter actually meant there was more space at his back for United to exploit – vast areas that actually went untapped. Instead, Nani was starved of the ball and resorted to charging inside desperately seeking some second-half touches. His non-involvement felt like a waste.</p>
              <p>In truth, United's main consolation will be their clean sheet. Without Scholes from the start, as well as both Anderson and Giggs, they had needed real accuracy in their passing to impose themselves on the tie, yet Carrick, Rooney and Fletcher gave the ball away too carelessly. Their distribution was laboured at times and, despite bossing possession, they lacked incision and rarely tested Mandanda in the home goal.</p>
              <p>Marseille only raised their own ambition and pace a little after half-time when they sensed their opponents were still struggling to find any rhythm in their play, but United were always comfortable. Only Rémy and Ayew hinted at a threat. Valbuena's involvement from the start may give them some hope for the return leg, but there was nothing in this soulless occasion to suggest that, once thrown into the cauldron that is Old Trafford, Marseille will be able to prosper.</p>

              <p>I'm not surprised if Gabriel Heinze gets outruned, He's 33 this year, and should give someone who is of Nani's age to mark and track him. </p>
