            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><span style="color: red;">The departure of van Nistelrooy for Real Madrid has led to intense speculation about who should replace him.<br><br>Ferguson has signalled his intention to push Alan Smith back into a striker's role following the Yorkshireman's one-year experiment in central midfield but it was still anticipated United would bring in an extra forward to provide competition for Wayne Rooney and Louis Saha.<br><br>Yet, in confirming an ongoing interest in Michael Carrick, Ferguson rejected the idea he could try to poach two Tottenham players this summer.<br><br>"There has not been any interest from us (in Defoe)," Ferguson told MUTV.<br><br>"As far as the Tottenham situation is concerned, we made a move for Michael Carrick - but that is all we did.<br><br>"He is the only Tottenham player we are interested in at the moment and I think it will stay that way."<br><br>Instead, it appears Ferguson is ready to place his trust in rising star Giuseppe Rossi to be United's fourth striker this term.<br><br>On the Red Devils' recent South Africa tour, Ferguson admitted he wanted to let Rossi leave Old Trafford on loan for six months in an effort to further his footballing education.<br><br>The teenager immediately claimed he wanted to stay at United and try to force his way into the first-team on a regular basis.<br><br>Now, it appears he will get his wish.<br><br>"We want to see Giuseppe progress as a centre-forward and it is looking more likely he will stay with us now."<br><br>While many United fans will be alarmed by Ferguson's decision, believing it weakens the club's chances of catching Chelsea this term, at least they will be appeased by the long-serving manager's pursuit of a key central midfielder.<br><br>Although it was widely reported a deal with Carrick had been done, neither Tottenham nor United were willing to confirm the speculation.<br><br>Instead, Ferguson thinks the Old Trafford faithful may have to be patient in their wait for new arrivals.<br><br>"We have targeted several players but in my experience, these things take time," he said.<br><br>"We are not going to be stupid and just pay the price other clubs wants.<br><br>"You have to negotiate and sometimes, you have to be patient and wait for the moment when eventually, the two clubs agree."<br><br>Apart from Defoe, one man who will definitely not be arriving at Old Trafford is AC Milan's Gennaro Gattuso.<br><br>Ferguson was ready to make a move for the former Rangers star if Milan had suffered a similar penalty to Juventus in the Italian match-fixing scandal.<br><br>However, by being allowed to remain in Serie A and, unless UEFA decide otherwise, maintaining a place in this season's Champions League qualifiers, Milan's bargaining position leaves Ferguson acknowledging any bid for Gattuso would be useless.<br><br>"We were waiting to see what was going to happen with AC Milan," said the Scot.<br><br>"But they are still in the European Cup and Serie A, so there is very little chance of progressing that one."<br></span></div>
