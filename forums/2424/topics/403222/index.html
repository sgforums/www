              <p><strong>Joe fancies a move to United</strong></p>
              <p><br>Joe Cole has told pals he wants to join Manchester United. The England ace becomes a free agent next Wednesday when his Chelsea contract expires. The midfielder, 28, had been expected to join Arsenal. But now it seems Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is set to lose out to Old Trafford boss Alex Ferguson in the race for Cole's signature. Spurs boss Harry Redknapp and Real Madrid chief Jose Mourinho have both managed Cole in the past and are keen to do so again - but are also set to miss out. Chelsea skipper John Terry admits he is stunned at the move. Terry said: "It still amazes me how the club have come to the conclusion of letting Joe go."<br><em>Vikki Orvice, The Sun<br></em><br>Quite a few of the papers feature quotes from <strong><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BF9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114%7D&amp;newsid=6650085"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></span></a></strong> who has apparently told <strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> to "relax and enjoy" the World Cup after a difficult start for England.</p>

              <p><strong>United not interested in signing Joe Cole</strong></p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> have left the path clear for Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur to attempt to sign Joe Cole after it was confirmed they are not interested in the England international.</p>
              <p>Cole, released by Chelsea after failing to agree terms over a new contract, has repeatedly been linked with a free signing to United, but well-placed sources at Old Trafford have indicated there has never been any interest in the midfielder.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, has spoken on numerous occasions about his admiration for Cole, but the 28-year-old has had a season disrupted by injury and his wage demands would be prohibitive for United.</p>
              <p>The feeling at Old Trafford is that a lot of the speculation surrounding United's reported interest has been generated by people close to Cole in the hope of accelerating interest from other clubs.</p>
              <p>Cole's future now looks like a straight choice between Arsenal and Tottenham, the north London rivals having both initiated talks with the player's representatives.</p>

              <p>Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas says he is happy at the Spanish giants - but he has not ruled out the possibility of a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old Spanish international's consistent performances have attracted much interest, including from both Manchester United and City.</p>
              <p>While he been at the Spanish giants all his career and is happy at present, he does not rule out moving on some day.</p>
              <p>This may come sooner than later if a big money bid comes in for Casillas, especially as new Madrid boss Jose Mourinho has revealed he wants to buy a top-class keeper this summer.</p>
              <p>Casillas, who is currently on duty at the World Cup, told the <em>Daily Star Sunday</em>: "I am aware of the interest of both Manchester United and City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I'm always flattered whenever another club shows interest in my qualities as a goalkeeper. I have been at Real Madrid all my career and I still enjoy going to training every day.</p>
              <p>"I enjoy meeting the fans too - but we all know how uncertain things are in football.</p>
              <p>"I'm not going to say never. Right now Madrid would have to kick me out of the club before I consider a move.</p>
              <p>"Who knows what will happen, though, if a big money offer comes in."</p>

              <p>Manchester United look set to lure Panathinaikos starlet Sotiris Ninis to Old Trafford in a deal believed to be worth £9.6m.</p>
              <p>Ninis, 20, is one of the most sought-after prospects in Europe and impressed in Greece's poor World Cup.</p>
              <p>United expect to beat off competition from Italian giants Roma, Inter and AC Milan to bring the versatile midfielder to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>With Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs in the twilight of their careers, the highly-rated youngster is seen as an ideal replacement for the legendary duo.</p>

              <p>Spanish ace David Silva sealed a megabucks move from the World Cup to the Premier League last night. And there's plenty more dosh to be sploshed on the stars of South Africa 2012 as the giants of European football wait to move in. Sami Khedira gave Germany a new dimension after replacing crock Michael Ballack. Stuttgart would not accept anything less than £25m for the 23-year-old - and Manchester United may be keen.</p>

              <h3>GARY CAHILL has been told to expect a bid from Manchester United after the World Cup.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Bolton defender was watched closely last season by Sir Alex Ferguson and now United are preparing a £15million bid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sources close to the Old Trafford boss have indicated to the former Aston Villa star that he will make the long-awaited approach within a few weeks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cahill, 24, was virtually ruled out of contention for the England World Cup squad when he suffered an injury caused by a blood clot in his arm last autumn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He recovered in time to help Bolton to top-flight safety but boss Owen Coyle made it clear that he would not stand in the way of him leaving.</p>
              <p>United need English players to help comply with the Premier League's new ruling which states that clubs must have eight home-grown players in their squad from next season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cahill arrived at the Reebok from Aston Villa for £4million in January 2008 and his performances saw him tipped for international recognition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He was also monitored last season by Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp.</p>
