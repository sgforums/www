              <p>It was a very entertaining match last night with many opportunities for both side.. Sadly, Owen squandered 4 good chances.. I tink this is the first time pairing for Owen and Rooney throughout the friendlies.. Rooney settled in a deeper position behind Owen for the night.. I feel this is the best combination of striker throughout the post season friendlies..</p>
              <p>I have high remarks for Valencia after watching him play for 2 matches.. Another hardworking &amp; hardhitting workhorse that Old Fergie has spotted.. Im overall impress with the performance by the 2 newbies to Red Devils.. The right back (De Laet if im not wrong) for last night was also impressive.. Better in defence compare to Rafael imo..</p>

              <p>I was one of those who was very happy when Fergie signed him although I know a few other United supporters here had apprehension on him... I hope now they are convinced he is a good buy or at least a much better player than Nani... lol</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson admitted Michael Owen deserved a goal instead of drawing a blank for Manchester United in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Valencia.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>In front of England coach Fabio Capello, who names his squad to face Holland next week on Saturday evening, Owen squandered four excellent chances to find the target.</p>
              <p>While it could be argued merely getting in position to score was a plus, whether Capello will be as easily won over remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson was delighted with the striker's effort.</p>
              <p>"It would have been nice for Michael to score - he deserved one," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"He probably should have had four. He showed marvellous movement at times and when he took that great pass from Wayne Rooney, he put the ball over the keeper but just past the post."</p>
              <p>It was all United did have to complain about after a deserved triumph, in which another Old Trafford new-boy Antonio Valencia earned special praise from his manager.</p>
              <p>"It was a very exciting performance," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"It was a real winger's effort. He showed great speed, power and balance.</p>
              <p>"Coming to our club he has immediately taken on the challenge and we are very pleased with what we have seen from him so far."</p>
              <p>With Owen struggling to find the target, Rooney stepped into the breach, guiding home Valencia's cross seven minutes into the second period.</p>
              <p>The Ecuador wide man also provided Tom Cleverley with the chance to mark his first United appearance in pre-season with a goal.</p>
              <p>Cleverley is one of a clutch of United youngsters eager to make an impression in the game but knowing their immediate future lies elsewhere as Ferguson looks to expose them to more competitive football.</p>
              <p>The Basingstoke-born midfielder, who is 20 next week, spent part of last term on loan with Leicester, and Ferguson admits he is not sure if another spell away from Old Trafford beckons.</p>
              <p>"We don't really know what to do with Tom," he said.</p>
              <p>"A lot of clubs have been in for him, including one or two in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"Putting him out on loan is something we are looking at because these lads do need experience."</p>
              <p>Belgian full-back Ritchie De Laet falls into the same category despite an impressive performance at right-back.</p>
              <p>Ferguson confirmed John O'Shea will probably fill the slot on Sunday when United complete their pre-season preparations against Chelsea in the Community Shield at Wembley.</p>
              <p>Neither Nemanja Vidic nor Wes Brown will be available for the showpiece as they struggle to combat ankle and thigh problems respectively, although Ferguson still thinks both men have an outside chance of being involved when his side begin the defence of their Premier League title against Birmingham on August 16.</p>

              <p><strong>Second half goals from Wayne Rooney and Tom Cleverley gave United victory in an entertaining friendly against Valencia.</strong></p>
              <p>Deubtant Antonio Valencia played a major role in both goals as United's wingplay overpowered the visitors, who enjoyed their own opportunities in an open game littered with chances.</p>
              <p>Michael Owen, also making his Old Trafford bow as a United player, was desperately unfortunate not to find himself on the scoresheet, as he passed up a pair of chances in each half.</p>
              <p>While the finishing was off-key, there was much to admire in Owen's movement and, crucially, his link-up with England team-mate Rooney.</p>
              <p>Fielded together for the first time at club level, it took under 20 minutes for the duo to click in devastating fashion. Rooney's superb slide-rule pass released Owen, who stabbed his effort neatly over Cesar Sanchez, but also just past the upright.</p>
              <p>Rooney dragged perhaps an easier chance wide when he reached a cross from Ritchie De Laet, before Michel thundered a shot against Ben Foster's crossbar for the visitors.</p>
              <p>Valencia used the interval to make 10 substitutions, and were quickly cursing that decision as Thiago Carleto limped off within minutes of his introduction. Substitute goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya eventually replaced him, but by that point United had moved ahead.</p>
              <p>Valencia, who had caught the eye more for his ceaseless hassling down the right flank before the break, sped past two defenders</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>and curled in a superb cross which Rooney powered past Sanchez.</p>
              <p>Two minutes later, the Ecuadorian seized on a woeful backpass but was challenged by Carlos Marchena. As the ball ran loose, Owen latched onto it and hammered a left-footed shot goalwards, but watched it sped past the upright. Following on from another spurned opportunity, which he curled wide moments before Rooney's opener, it made for a frustrating evening for the former Newcastle striker.</p>
              <p>Owen was among a glut of substiutions midway through the second half, making way for Kiko Macheda. The Italian was involved from the off, and almost poked in another cross from the impressive Valencia on 72 minutes. The ball ran free, however, and it was another substitute - Cleverley - who shifted it away from the crowd and tucked home a neat finish.</p>
              <p>Game over, but United continued to forge openings. Darron Gibson came closest with a pair of stunning efforts. Firstly, his 20-yard effort from Macheda's pull-back cracked against the angle of post and crossbar, then Sanchez was forced into an excellent one-handed save from the Irishman's fizzing 25-yarder.</p>
              <p>All in all, a highly satisfying night's work for Sir Alex's squad. A sterner test of their progress will be provided by Carlo Ancelotti's Chelsea in Sunday's Community Shield, but the pre-season signs augur well so far.</p>

              <p>Fabio was playing right back yesterday.. i think he can play both sides..</p>
              <p>De Laet also, he played left back on loan now he plays on the lright... i think we have more than enough defensive cover, they just need more playtime</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Owen looks lost at old trafford, i think he needs to polish up his finishing.. damn frustrating to see a stiker like him missing chances..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ref is back from a demotion last season? New hairstyle... hahaha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If anyone noticed now we have a ex-everton and also a ex-liverpool strike force.</p>
              <p>Think both will be super happy to score at anfield. hahaha</p>

              had apprehension on him... I hope now they are convinced he is
              a good buy or at least a much better player than Nani...

              <p>Remember one Mr. Nani, his first pre-season tour, he was assisting and scoring goals for fun, come to league games his performances become average liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>

              <p>ritchie de laet is very promising. we've got another cover for full-back position.</p>

              <p><br>Don't compare him to Nani lah, Valencia has done it last season with Wigan and there is no reason why he can't do it again this season or perform even better than last year...</p>
              <p>From the way he run and cross alone, can tell he will be a useful player unlike Nani, that ball hogger still need to learn when to release the ball for best effect...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have Valencia and A Young in my fantasy team... One left, one right... lol</p>
