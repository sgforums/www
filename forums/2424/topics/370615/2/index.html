              <p><br> Don't compare him to Nani lah, Valencia has done it last season
              with Wigan and there is no reason why he can't do it again this
              season or perform even better than last year...</p>
              <p>From the way he run and cross alone, can tell he will be a
              useful player unlike Nani, that ball hogger still need to learn
              when to release the ball for best effect...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have Valencia and A Young in my fantasy team... One
              left, one right... lol</p>

              <p>His crossing has always been good.</p>
              <p>Whats quite worrying is his goalscoring prowess...hopefully with a new team he can start banging in the goals lor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>hmm, watched the first 45mins of the friendly, and I think it was a normal MUFC, frankly, nothing to shout about, IMHO. (Please pardon my critical angle.)</p>
              <p>Firstly, Rooney still track backs to MF to try to retrieve the ball, so I think he is still playing support striker. But he is one bright spot for MU in that he has not loses any of his touches, drifitng into spaces, and keen eye for providing balls for owen. He is key to MU's season.</p>
              <p>Owen is no "tevez", so he won't hound the opposing defenders. Yes, he will get more chances but hopefully, his strike rate over the season will be better in the 45mins I saw. And his fitness, I bet all MUFC phyios have their fingers/toes crossed.</p>
              <p>btw, did owen and rooney played in england b4?</p>
              <p>Okay, I do expect Valencia to be like Ronaldo, but after 45mins, I am pretty convinced he isn't. Yes, he has that explosive pace, but to me, he seems one dimensional-&gt; "Go to touchlines, and cross it in." No one-two touches with rooney or etc, to go into the six yard area and hammer. Maybe, still new.</p>
              <p>Tosic is a worry. Yes, he tracks back and helps Evra, but going forward, his attacking power is not very evident. He doesn't have much trickery to go pass people, and neither great pace. Size wise, he is not going to win many aerial balls. Only evident attribute hardworking, and willing to track back. But going forward, suspect.</p>
              <p>When that miguel (valencia, unsure spelling) hits the bar in the first half, he was pretty much alone and that raise a flag. It seems whenever opposing player have ball at either side of field, it will draw MU's defenders and even MFs to cover, leaving the middle free, and when that ball is pass back inside, the opposing player can run in and hammer. I can envisioned Gerrard waiting for ball to be passed back and running thru with his thunderbolts.</p>
              <p>Carrick has just too many mis-passes. Against Barca, where MU won't have much possession, this is suicide. Sadly, it seems, this is a residing problem.</p>
              <p>the defender Da-Laef is rather confident, getting many tackles in the six-yard area spot on. however, can see him beaten for pace, and effectively drawing a Rio or Vidic out to support. There was one incident where Valencia strings the ball down the flanks, and he got beaten. It causes a flashblack, cause it is one of Chelsea's favourite routine releasing ACole down the flanks to cross in. </p>
              <p>With this team, if we were in last year's European Finals and down 2-0, I wonder who can step up? A big worry, man.</p>
