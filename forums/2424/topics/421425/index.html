              <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar has announced that he will retire from football at the end of this season.<br> <br> The 40-year-old, who joined United from Fulham in 2005, has taken the 
              decision despite starting 21 of the club's 23 league matches this term.<br> <br> "It is now time to pay attention to my family,'' said Van der Sar, who 
              has been contemplating hanging up his boots since his wife Annemarie 
              collapsed with a brain haemorrhage in December 2009.<br> <br> "I cannot really identify a time when it [the decision] happened,'' said
               the former Ajax goalkeeper. "Let's just say that it was playing on my 
              mind from the moment Annemarie had her stroke.<br> <br> "She has fought back from it. We decided on another year in England and 
              thus to stay at Manchester United. But, once engaged in the season, the 
              thought of saying goodbye started to gnaw a bit more emphatically.''<br> <br> Van der Sar is poised to turn down the offer of a coaching role with the
               Red Devils, preferring instead to take a break from the game. "I will 
              hopefully not start coaching too quickly," he said.<br> <br> "I will try to have 18 months or two years for myself - and I've a family to do nice things with, too."<br> <br> The Netherlands international has won three Premier League titles at United, as well as one Champions League and one League Cup.<br> <br> Sir Alex Ferguson has already taken steps towards finding Van der Sar's 
              successor by signing Anders Lindegaard from Aalesund during the January 
              window.<br> <br> United goalkeeping coach Eric Steele believes Van der Sar will go down 
              alongside former Red Devil Peter Schmeichel as one of the club's greats 
              following his decisive penalty save from Nicolas Anelka in the Champions
               League final shootout against Chelsea in May 2008.<br> <br> Steele told Radio Manchester: "Edwin will retire at the end of the 
              season. It has been a mutual decision between the manager, the team and 
              Edwin.<br> <br> "He has been a fantastic servant. I was very lucky. I worked alongside 
              Peter Schmeichel at Villa and I worked with Edwin for two and a half 
              years. That penalty save in Moscow has elevated Edwin alongside Peter.''</p>

              <p>The 28-year-old has seen a number of his team-mates leave Liverpool over the last few seasons, as well as the manager who brought him to the club â€“ Rafa Benitez.</p>
              <p>With the departure of fellow Spaniard <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/854457-john-terry-rivals-should-fear-chelsea-after-fernando-torres-transfer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fernando Torres to Chelsea</span></a> on the final day of the January transfer window, reports claim the keeper is now considering his options at Anfield.</p>
              <p>There was speculation on Thursday, Reina has a buy-out clause within his current Liverpool contract which, if matched, could trigger his departure.</p>
              <p>Reina has been linked with a move to Arsenal in the past and there is now speculation Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson could be contemplating a surprise bid for the 28-year-old in the summer as he searches for a long-term replacement for <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/853877-edwin-van-der-sar-to-retire-in-may-as-manchester-united-track-hugo-lloris"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the retiring Edwin van der Sar</span></a>.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/854535-kenny-dalglish-liverpool-preparing-for-summer-transfer-spending-spree"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool fans</span></a> have taken to club forums and blogs this week to discuss the possible departure of Reina, with some pointing out that when he first joined the club there was a large group of Spanish players and back-room staff who have all, one by one, left leaving the goalkeeper as one of the only Spaniards remaining.</p>
