Nani is someone whom I wish to see. He's awesome and highly rated as an exciting prospect, similar to a certain C.

Hargreaves would give United that resilient, dogged quality in midfield.<br><br>The wide positions are well covered by the ageless Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo, with Darren Fletcher able to cover across the midfield.<br><br>Kieran Richardson is also an option - but this will be a make-or-break season for him. He will either finally show consistency or be allowed to move on.<br><br>ATTACK<br><br>This will arguably be the most fascinating aspect of United's summer recruitment policy.<br><br>Ferguson has had 20 goals each from Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, but with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer coming to the end of his career and Louis Saha's lack of appearances seemingly an increasing source of frustration, he will beef up his attack with a high-quality addition.<br><br>The question will be - what sort of player does he go for?<br><br>Will Ferguson go for the out-and-out goalscorer or a man who provides the best of both worlds?<br><br>If he goes for the natural predator, this may bring Tottenham's Jermain Defoe into the equation.<br><br>But watch out for a move for Newcastle's Michael Owen should he prove his fitness.<br><br>Ferguson has been a massive admirer for many years, and don't bet against the fiercely ambitious Owen being willing to leave Newcastle, despite having just spent 12 months on the treatment table.<br><br>Newcastle striker Michael Owen<br>Could Michael Owen be the shock name on Man Utd's shopping list?<br><br>Owen will still want the major trophies that have eluded him - namely the Premiership and the Champions League - and he will not get those at Newcastle.<br><br>Ferguson may go for the all-round option by attempting to sign a creator and a scorer in the form of brilliant Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov - or even finally persuade Atletico Madrid's Fernando Torres to try the Premiership.<br><br>One thing is for certain, he will buy a forward and Owen might be worth a punt for those fancying a bet.<br><br>If he lands the man he wants, Ferguson will have an array of riches, with Rooney the spearhead and Alan Smith on the road back to full fitness.<br><br>Ferguson has already handed his list to chief executive David Gill even before the Premiership trophy has been handed over.<br><br>He means business - because he knows his great rival Mourinho will be plotting behind the scenes to ensure there is no repeat of the scenes of celebration planned for Old Trafford this Sunday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after reading MUFC's fans analysis, came to some conclusion -<br><br>1) firstly, how many times have we been disappointed by this warchest thingy? Didn't David Gill promised two world-class signings but none materialised?<br><br>2) with OwenH, isn't he overpriced @ 20M? and Nani, @ 17.5M, an unproven talent. with both will cost 35M, where can we get a top striker @ 15M?<br><br>3) also berba of spurs has rejected MUFC before.. and Eto will be in African cup.<br><br>I think we should all hold our horses and see in August when the dust settles, who really put the signature down on that contract.<br><br>I hate to hear this infamous and familiar line again "We got the necessary team already, we got youth thus, we are not signing anyone" come august 07.</div>

And yea, its true Bayern Munich won't take part in next season's CL.<br><br>The teams that made it are... Schalke 04 (65), VfB Stuttgart (64) &amp; Werder Bremen (63). Bayern only have 54 points with 2 more matches to go to the end of the German Bundesliga.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

But tell me of these who you think would be useful...<br><br>1) Jermain Defoe<br>2) Owen Hargreaves<br>3) Fernando Torres<br>4) Samuel Eto'o<br>5) Micah Richards<br>6) Nani<br>7) Gareth Bale<br>8 Dmitar Berbatov<br><br>Others??<br><br>Now's here where it gets interesting..<br><br>comment by FusilliJerry<br><br>posted 8 Hours Ago<br><br>1) Not good enough for Spurs first XI: enough said.<br><br>2) Remember: the Scouse got Mascherano, twice the player, for half the money.<br><br>3) Hugely over-priced but could fit this United, which is all about pace (which is why performances dipped during the Larsson period)<br><br>4) Glazers would never cough up what it would take. Heaven forbid the Yanks at Anfield would.<br><br>5) Would make sense, but can't see significant funds being devoted to this position yet<br><br>6) Is he better than Ribery, or being looked at to keep his mate Ronaldo happy ?<br><br>7) What is the verdict on Chopper Heinze this season ? Guilty of some unforgiveable gaffes, or still a more solid defender than Evra, whose starting XI ascendancy is much more to do with his ability to supplement a slower-these-days Giggs going forward, rather than his abilities as a defender ?<br><br>8 Brilliant, and, crucially, proven in English football. But does he have the pace for this United's style of play ?<br><br>omment by red as tomatoes<br><br>posted 7 Hours Ago<br><br>1) Jermain Defoe: good player, inconsistent. taken to much time to refine his talent into actual production. as said earlier, not good enough for spurs, not good enough for united<br><br>2) Owen Hargreaves: suddenly he has become an unpopular choice. he is the best choice for united, english experienced in english and european football. suits united better than mascherano. an actual box-to-box player as opposed to the glorified defenders in midfield available. the price maybe steep, but business between rivals isnt easy<br><br>3) Fernando Torres: could be given enough, but started too hyped, at a decent price will be worth it. as with evry foreigner will need to adjust to english football.<br><br>4) Samuel Eto'o. perfectly good player if he was affordable<br><br>5) Micah Richards: good buy. if fergie was a risk taker, would buy him ahead of hargreaves since he can play both midfield and defence. highly versatile, but wonder how much more it will cost to sell to rival<br><br>6) Nani: i can come up with 4 better options in the prem. alone highly unproven, not half the player ronaldo was at this stage of development. not logical tbh<br><br>7) Gareth Bale. i really cant see the the use for him. maybe if he is a decent winger.<br><br>8 Dmitar Berbatov: good player, will not be worth whatever spurs will demand for him<br><br></div>
