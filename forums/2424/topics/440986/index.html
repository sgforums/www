              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/11/10/330/Jonny-Evans-Manchester-United-Sent-Off-Red-Ca_2669298.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p>Jonny Evans cannot accept total responsibility for Manchester United's six-goal capitulation against Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson described the result as "an embarrassment" which United will be reminded of for years, the pivotal moment coming when Evans was sent off at the start of the second half for a clumsy foul on Mario Balotelli.</p>
              <p>The Northern Ireland star does feel bad about his misdemeanour, but as the Red Devils were only a goal down when Evans made his premature exit, the 23-year-old cannot see how he can be blamed entirely for what happened afterwards.</p>
              <p>"When you go down to 10 men you don't expect to concede five goals," Evans said. "I felt guilty for the fans because obviously it is not nice.</p>
              <p>"I am a Manchester United fan myself. I know the hurt that was felt by the people who follow United around everywhere."</p>
              <p>Although Evans insists he was not worried Ferguson might make him the scapegoat, there must have been a nagging fear in his mind once he returned from his automatic one-match suspension.</p>
              <p>As it turned out, Rio Ferdinand made way for the return of Nemanja Vidic at Everton last weekend, Evans then retaining his place for the midweek Champions League win over Otelul Galati, when United kept a third successive clean sheet.</p>
              <p>"It was nice the manager stuck with me, although one red card doesn't make you a bad player all of a sudden," Evans added. "I didn't feel I would be used as a scapegoat. I knew the manager would make an honest decision.</p>
              <p>"I am not the type of player who would sulk about it if I got dropped. He is the greatest British manager of all time. Whatever decision he takes, I will happily accept it."</p>
              <p>What Ferguson would doubtless have been influenced by was the mature attitude Evans adopted to his setback.</p>
              <p>Even 12 months ago, the Belfast-born defender accepts he might have floundered. Not any more it seems.</p>
              <p>"Last season I had one or two games where I let things get to me," he added. "My confidence went a little bit.</p>
              <p>"I am stronger mentally now. I am more equipped to deal with those situations and I actually feel like my performances have been good this season."</p>
              <p>Evans cannot afford to rest on his laurels though.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand is clearly a man with something to prove at present, while Phil Jones has already done enough in his short time at United to show why Ferguson was prepared to pay Â£17million to prize the 19-year-old away from Blackburn in the summer.</p>
              <p>However, Evans has a special incentive to face Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday after spending two loan spells on Wearside before establishing himself at United.</p>
              <p>"I have a lot of fond memories of my time up there and it won't be easy," Evans said. "Sunderland have had a slow start to the season but Steve Bruce has brought a lot of new players in and it has taken them a while to gel.</p>
              <p>"I am sure they will put on a big performance because Steve's teams always seem to do well."</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney should be restored to a more advanced role on Saturday after his game in central midfield in midweek, with Darren Fletcher likely to be back in that position and Danny Welbeck among those hoping for a recall.</p>
              <p>Anders Lindegaard could also play in goal as Ferguson is mindful of the Dane's status as second choice for his country, meaning that he might not have a game for a fortnight.</p>
              <p>The overriding aim though is another three points to maintain some kind of pressure on Manchester City, who have failed to win just once so far this term.</p>
              <p>"We have played quite a lot of the big teams around us and I don't think City have really had that," Evans said.</p>
              <p>"They could go on and win all those games, you don't know. We just have to keep our own run going and hope they slip up."</p>
