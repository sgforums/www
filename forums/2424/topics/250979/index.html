            <div class='col-md body'>Cristiano Ronaldo thinks Jose Mourinho 'doesn't know how to admit his own failures' after the Chelsea manager's controversial comments about penalties.<br><br>Mourinho claimed last Sunday that 'new laws' on spot-kicks applied to Manchester United but not to Chelsea, after his side were denied a penalty in the goalless draw at Newcastle.<br><br>A day earlier United had been fortunate not to concede a late penalty against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford.<br><br>'We all know how he is,' Ronaldo was reported to have told Portuguese TV. 'He always has to say something when he is not happy.'<br><br>The PFA player and young player of the year added: 'Jose Mourinho doesn't know how to admit his own failures.'<br><br>Mourinho responded by reportedly telling RTP TV that Ronaldo will 'never reach the level that he wants to reach' unless he accepts 'facts'.<br><br>He is reported to have said: 'A player who wants to be the best one of the world, and he already may be, should have the uprightness and the sufficient maturity to verify that against facts there are not arguments.<br><br>'If he says that it is a lie that Manchester United have conceded some penalties this season which have not been awarded against them, he is lying.<br><br>'And if he lies he will never reach the level that he wants to reach.'<br><br>United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz was also quoted as saying: 'Mourinho has his own style, he always tries to divert everyone's attention to the points which are convenient for him.<br><br>'These are his tactics and that's the way he is.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Ferguson hits back over Moruinho's jibes</span></strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has launched a stinging attack on Jose Mourinho and says he is 'surprised' the Chelsea boss has not been called to account for his claims this season.<br><br>In the past week alone, Mourinho has claimed Premier League games are now being played to 'new rules', stating Chelsea were denied a clear penalty at Newcastle on Sunday, while United had not conceded two against Sheffield United and Middlesbrough.<br><br>Although Mourinho did not accuse any individuals, or outline who he felt was responsible for the 'rule change', it left Ferguson feeling the Blues manager was questioning the integrity of the English game.<br><br>Then, to further fan the flames, Mourinho labelled fellow countryman Cristiano Ronaldo 'a liar' after the Portugal winger launched his own counter-attack, claiming the former Porto chief cannot accept failure.<br><br>Now Ferguson has entered the debate, leaving Mourinho in no doubt he does not think much of his present behaviour.<br><br>'Jose Mourinho seems to be on some sort of personal crusade about regulations,' observed the Scot.<br><br>'I am surprised no action has been taken against him. He just seems to go on, and on, and on. Everybody gets bad decisions, you just have to get on with it.<br><br>'He is saying our game is suspicious. That is wrong.<br><br>'He abused Barcelona in the past, a Swedish referee (Anders Frisk), a German referee (Markus Merk) and the other night he said Liverpool players were going to hunt down Didier Drogba to get him booked. That is very disappointing.<br><br>'As for Cristiano Ronaldo, everyone is entitled to have a comment or opinion. That doesn't mean to say they are liars.<br><br>'He is on about changing regulations. Who is doing it? The FA? The Premier League? UEFA?'<br><br>Ferguson also said he hoped Everton boss David Moyes would call off his legal row with Wayne Rooney.<br><br>Moyes has launched proceedings against Rooney over comments the England striker made about his former manager in his autobiography 'Wayne Rooney - My Life So Far'.<br><br>The Everton manager claims Rooney alleged he had betrayed the player's trust and confidence by leaking sensitive personal information to the press.<br><br>The Scot felt so angered at the allegations, which he believes injured his professional and personal reputation, and caused him serious embarrassment and distress, he decided to pursue the matter with the courts and launched formal proceedings last week.<br><br>As it presently stands there appears no likelihood of either party backing down.<br><br>However, Ferguson is hoping the matter can be sorted out quickly.<br><br>'I am not sure where it stands at the moment but it is not nice to read about it,' he said.<br><br>'I am sure David Moyes will be getting proper legal advice I am sure, but I wish the case was dropped. I don't think it does anyone any good.'<br></div>
