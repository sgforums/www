              <p><strong>United will use the euphoria of Saturday's last-gasp win over Wolves to fuel next week's trips to Manchester City and Aston Villa, according to John O'Shea.</strong></p>
              <p>Ji-sung Park's stoppage-time strike papered over the cracks of a below-par display from a Reds side decimated by injury and illness, providing a timely boost ahead of a tricky week.</p>
              <p>“It was a huge goal,” O’Shea told <strong>MUTV</strong>. “The way the game ended was just such a high for us. It was a fantastic goal from Ji. He just sucked the defenders in to make the challenges and carried on going and tucked it away in the corner.</p>
              <p>“Hopefully we can look on that goal as a very special moment in the season. The focus beforehand was that we needed three points, then we could look forward to the City game. Thankfully we got that, now we recover and focus and hopefully we’ll get a few bodies back.”</p>
              <p>The Reds were deprived of several players by a virus which infiltrated Carrington during the week, while Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra and Paul Scholes all played despite suffering the after-effects of the illness.</p>
              <p>O’Shea is hopeful that reinforcements will be on hand for Wednesday’s trip to Eastlands, but conceded that United, injury-hit or not, were fortunate to beat a spirited Wolves side.</p>
              <p>“We knew yesterday we might be a few bodies down and then a few more disappeared,” he said. “But we managed to get a team and subs together. When we’re one-nil up we should be able to hold out and finish the game off, even if we’re not playing well.</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>“But that’s where you have to give credit to Wolves. They came with one upfront but it soon turned into a 4-3-3 when they broke. They played quite a good game and we were fortunate to come up with a fantastic goal to win it for us.</p>
              <p>“These things happen and hopefully we’ll have a lot more lads back for the next two games. They’re two tough away games and we’re going into them on a big high.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">Hargreaves made his first start for over two years against Wolves on Saturday, but he lasted only five minutes before being withdrawn with a hamstring problem.</div>
              <p>"We were at the stage where we knew Owen's knee was okay," Ferguson told <em>Key 103</em>. "His training performances for eight or nine days previously had been terrific.</p>
              <p>"He had done really well, which is why we took the chance, but maybe the tension in the build-up for the lad was too much and he suffered because of it."</p>
              <p>Hargreaves was pressed into service due to a lack of options, with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8853/Ryan-Giggs"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ryan Giggs</span></span></a> also sidelined with a hamstring problem and Nani struggling with a groin strain.</p>
              <p>"Ryan is out," Ferguson said ahead of the derby game at Manchester City on Wednesday. "Nani is doubtful. At this stage it doesn't look as if he will make it. It is not a great position for us to be in. We are counting heads at the moment."</p>
              <p>A virus has also swept through the camp and Ferguson says he is unsure who will be available for the trip to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>"We've no idea at all [on a side]," he said. "We've still got some players out with 'flu and we've sent some players home. We're not in a good position at the moment, but we have a strong squad. We just carry on."</p>

              <p>Roberto Mancini reckons it is about time Manchester United showed his club some respect.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson will ask veteran playmaker Paul Scholes to put any retirement plans on hold for another year.</p>

              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0415/carlostevezposter2009_412x232.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="232"></p>
              <p><strong><em>The poster that caused controversy at the start of last season</em></strong></p>
              <p>It is now arguably the most anticipated game in the Premier League. Manchester United travel to rich 'noisy neighbours' City in a clash that could go a long way to showing us who will be challenging at the top of the table come May, and there will certainly not be any lack of passion at Eastlands on Wednesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last season, their first league encounter was marred by incidents involving added time, Gary Neville's badge kissing and Craig Bellamy's fisticuffs with a pitch-invading fan, but the return game at Eastlands provided less drama, save for a last-gasp <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8860/Paul-Scholes"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Paul Scholes</span></span></a> winner for the away side. This year relations between the two clubs have been strained further, as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> looked set to leave Old Trafford - raising hopes that he may sign for City - before performing a U-turn and signing a new five-year contract at United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>City are certainly better prepared in terms of squad depth than they have ever been before, while United have suffered from criticism (not least from some of their own players) that investment into the side has not been as forthcoming as perhaps it should have been.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/100681/Mario-Balotelli"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Mario Balotelli</span></span></a> suspended, City can only count on £100 million worth of their summer arrivals: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/43815/David-Silva"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">David Silva</span></span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/26843/James-Milner"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">James Milner</span></span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/69277/Yaya-Tour%C3%A9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yaya Toure</span></span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/95290/Jerome-Boateng"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jerome Boateng</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/103939/Aleksandar-Kolarov"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Aleksandar Kolarov</span></span></a>. But, amid accusations of dressing-room unrest, three games were lost on the bounce before they turned the tide against West Brom at the weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Boosted by the return of their influential captain <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/72490/Carlos-T%C3%A9vez"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span></span></a>, City's main weapon could also prove to be their biggest distraction. When City snapped up Tevez after he chose to leave Old Trafford, billboard posters featuring Tevez and the slogan "Welcome to Manchester" appeared. It was a reference to the fact that United's ground is located in the Borough of Trafford, and that City fans view themselves as the only club in Manchester proper, and Tevez has since become a figure who represents City's elevation among the English elite (a painful truth for many in the red half of Manchester to accept).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, both United and City have failed to hit top form yet this season. Inconsistency has blighted some of their performances and, even though United remain unbeaten, a poor game for either side will ultimately prove crucial in the battle for bragging rights, and title credentials.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester City player to watch: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/72490/Carlos-T%C3%A9vez"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span></span></a>.</strong> The Argentine striker has made no secret of the fact that he is not the most committed professional around, reiterating a few times that he could, at any moment, walk away from the game. He may not have much of a passion for football these days, but Tevez's work rate on the pitch cannot be questioned and his strength and skill on the ball give City a new dimension up front. A bullish striker, he has bagged seven goals in ten starts so far this season and has returned from a recuperation period in his homeland after a minor injury. His forays will form the basis of City's threat in the attacking third and he will certainly be keen to prove that United should have signed him up on a permanent deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United player to watch: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/24529/Nemanja-Vidic"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nemanja Vidic</span></span></a>.</strong> Given the captaincy after <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7825/Rio-Ferdinand"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rio Ferdinand</span></span></a> and Gary Neville's recent injury woes, the Serbian defender leads by example and is a rock at the back for club and country. While United have suffered from a lack of concentration this season, giving away leads, Vidic has been largely blameless and his strength and commitment are vital if his side are to keep a clean sheet. With him alongside Ferdinand, the United backline looks a lot more solid and that frees Vidic up to provide an aerial threat at set-pieces as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Key battle: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/23601/Kolo-Tour%C3%A9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kolo Toure</span></span></a> v <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/12724/Dimitar-Berbatov"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></span></a></strong>. The two have clashed against each other in another of the Premier League's top derby games - Arsenal v Tottenham - but now find themselves on opposite sides of the Manchester divide. Toure has been an important player for City this season, even if he is now looking a little less impressive than the player who was so commanding for the Gunners. The defender has strength and excellent positional skills and will have to track the movement of Berbatov well, as the Bulgarian striker is a master at finding space. With the game coming too early for the injured <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a>, United will look to Berbatov for inspiration up front after he was rested in the win over West Brom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Only 20 players in history have ever played for both Manchester clubs and the latest, Carlos Tevez, has scored three goals in four games for City against his former club since he moved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Stats:</strong> There have been 156 competitive meetings between the teams. United have won 65 and City 42, the remaining 49 games finishing as draws. The biggest victory was 6-1 to City on January 23, 1926. Both teams have won 5-0 once (City in 1955, United in 1994).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Odds:</strong> Man City (2.62), Man Utd (2.75) and the draw (3.25) are on offer with <strong>Bet365</strong> but Carlos Tevez to score two or more goals comes in at 8.50.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Derby games are notoriously hard to predict, but one feels that City may just have enough to cope with their rivals. A City win could make the title race very interesting indeed.</p>
