              <p>Wayne Rooney has stoked the fires ahead of Manchester United’s title
              showdown with Liverpool on Saturday by stating his “hatred” of his
              boyhood side Everton’s arch rivals.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/jtrqiu.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The former Toffees forward’s comments appeared briefly on United’s
              official website on Thursday, before being altered to remove their
              potentially inflammatory slant.</p>
              <p>Rooney, who progressed through Everton’s youth ranks before
              graduating to their first team, will face The Reds at Old Trafford as
              Sir Alex Ferguson’s side look to hammer what would be the final nail in
              the coffin for Liverpool’s title challenge.</p>
              <p>"I'm very excited about the game because I grew up as an Everton fan
              hating Liverpool - and that hasn't changed,” said Rooney on United’s
              site, before his comments were hastily watered down.</p>
              <p>A United spokesman said yesterday: "In advance of the game we felt
              this was the best option as these kind of things can be misinterpreted
              and cause unnecessary problems.</p>
              <p>"The comments are open to wilful mis-reporting and neither the club, nor Wayne wanted that to happen."</p>
              <p>Rooney continued to explain his excitement at the “biggest game of
              the season”, and is aiming to end Rafa Benitez’s outfit’s fading title
              aspirations.</p>
              <p>"If we can beat Liverpool it will almost certainly put them out of
              the title race and that will be great for everybody at Old Trafford -
              and especially for me,” he said.</p>
              <p>"No other game is ever going to get in the way of United and
              Liverpool. For me, it's always our biggest game of the season. It's
              always a massive fixture and especially so this time with what's at
              stake.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool have put up a great challenge this season but it would be nice if we could end that challenge at our place.</p>
              <p>"Games against Liverpool are always anxious. I'm sure it will be
              frantic with a lot of challenges and it's going to be difficult for
              both teams."</p>

              <p class="article">The England striker's comments caused tension between the two clubs ahead of 
              their Premier League clash tomorrow.</p>
              <p class="article">But Ferguson claims former Everton ace Rooney simply used the wrong word.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “Hate is an easy word to say, easier than dislike. Maybe it is not 
              the right word.</p>
              <p class="article">“But Wayne has had plenty of stick from Liverpool fans over the years, so it 
              is understandable.</p>
              <p class="article">“He supported Everton as a kid and the rivalry between them and Liverpool is 
              pretty ferocious now.</p>
              <p class="article">"Since then he has come to Manchester United and he wants to win.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is nothing out of the ordinary really.”</p>
