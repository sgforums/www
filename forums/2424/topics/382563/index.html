              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Edwin van der Sar never intended to play into his late 30s so cannot quite believe he could be at Manchester United beyond his 40th birthday.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>The veteran Dutchman moved north from Fulham in 2005, six years after Sir Alex Ferguson first wanted to sign him as a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.</p>
              <p>Initially, Van der Sar signed a two-year contract, helping United win the Carling Cup in his first season before they ended a three-year Premier League title drought the following year.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar has subsequently signed three one-year extensions, the first two of which brought him more championship success, plus two Champions League final appearances, the first of which, last year, saw him enjoy a second success in the competition in 1995 with Ajax.</p>
              <p>The time is coming for Van der Sar to decide whether to commit his future to United for another year, which would take him beyond his 40th birthday.</p>
              <p>"I never really felt I wanted to go to my late 30s," he admitted.</p>
              <p>"When I first came to United I thought it was a nice chance to win a trophy for a couple of years.</p>
              <p>"This is the fifth season so I have surprised myself a little bit."</p>
              <p>On current evidence, Van der Sar will not quit just yet.</p>
              <p>Indeed, another major international tournament cannot be ruled out, even though Van der Sar quit Holland duty after Euro 2008.</p>
              <p>He did feature in a couple of World Cup qualifying games last season after a plea from Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk.</p>
              <p>However, with Henk Timmer announcing his retirement from the game and current number one Maarten Stekelenburg losing his place at Ajax, a shock recall could be on the cards ahead of next summer's tournament in South Africa.</p>
              <p>"It has not gone away completely, no," said Van der Sar, before declining to answer any more questions on the subject.</p>
              <p>The 6ft 5in keeper's motivation is easy to spot.</p>
              <p>Just as strikers take pride in the number of goals they score, so Van der Sar likes to collect clean sheets.</p>
              <p>They have been in limited supply this season at United, with Van der Sar collecting just two since his return from a couple of broken fingers a month ago.</p>
              <p>He realises it is a run that has to stop if the Red Devils are to make continued progress in the Champions League, even though they have already secured qualification for the knock-out phase ahead of Wednesday's meeting with Besiktas at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"When you concede goals, you always think you could have done better with certain things," he said.</p>
              <p>"Conceding goals is not one of the nicest things. That is why you try so hard to keep clean sheets.</p>
              <p>"In general it is going okay for me on a personal level this season.</p>
              <p>"But I am a team player, so I always feel better when we win instead of having an okay performance yourself and ending up on the losing side."</p>

              <p>he is a top top goalie. United should have bought him after schmeical retired, but he went to Juventus instead and rotted there and then fulham bought him in 2001.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if he joined united in 99, united will surely have won another 1-2 more CL than the current 2 won by fergie.</p>
