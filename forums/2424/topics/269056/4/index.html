            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, I am back!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Had the time of my life. Was sitting in the 2nd row on Utd's side, but the downside is had most of my view of the first half blocked by their dugout. So had to see the screen mostly for the 1st half action. 2nd half played mostly by the substitute guys, and to tell the truth, think their performance was a little bit disappointing. Maybe the heat got to them. It's one hell of a burning furnace over there. Fergie was wearing T-shirts and shorts!! First time see him so "lok" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I was hanging around the wall of the tunnel before the match started, and Giggs and Ronaldo and some of the rest were just standing there, metres from me!! I almost died from the excitement and exhilaration I tell you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Tried to take some shots but my hand shook too much from the excitement, only manage a blur shot of Giggs closed up   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Ronaldo was fantastic during the warm-up. Duno he showing off or wat  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> , but his dribbling and stepovers were just so amazing.... even more so to see it live! He was quite friendly, waving occasionally to the stands.<br><br>What I find really disappointing was the Macau fans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> . They don't seem as passionate about the sports and the team as we do, or the UK fans do. The game started at 8pm, and the guys came out for their warm-up around 7.30pm. You would expect a packed stadium to be welcoming them and cheering them. But they came out to a 20% filled stadium. Even when the whistle blew at 8pm, there were still visibly empty seats all around, and some pple only began streaming in at  8.15pm onwards. AND, they left before the final whistle! Perhaps to catch the ferry back to HK or what, but come on, it's Manchester United there, and their show of support (or lack of) is really disappointing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Dong came out to the pitch to parade the League Cup before the game started....but to a half-emtpy stadium. Those that were there barely clapped or anything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>When the trophy presentation came about 20 minutes after the match, there were only trickles of fans left, less than 500 fans, I think. I'm just so disgusted with their utter lack of support. And the fans were soooo dull during the game. Hardly any chantings, no yells of encouragement. Only feeble chants of "ka yau" (Jia you in canto) from a small group of fans from the HK fan club. They tried to do the wave, but it always died before going even a quarter round the stadium.<br><br>And the stadium....errmm...it was quite old and lok-cok. Something like our Jalan Besar. Capacity of 15,000.<br><br>No doubt some of the empty seats were from the black market guys who din manage to sell their tics. I asked the guy whom I bought the tics from how come he's not going to the match. He said the tics were from friends who can't make it, and admitted he had more tickets available.<br><br>Back to the players...saw Hargreaves sitting at the dugout during the entire game. He looked really bored. Alan Smith got a new Mohawk hairstyle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ronaldo and Rooney disappeared back into the tunnel about 10 minutes into the 2nd half, after they were substituted. And never appeared again. Some of the guys still mingled around after the game to do a spot of running on the pitch and even signed T-shirts for the fans who were still standing around.<br><br>Who were the friendliest? Van Der Sar, Eagles, Carrick, Silvestre all made the effort to walk to the stands to mingle with the fans. I was standing on the other side where there was a barrier, sigh...so could only watch and drool while they signed autographs with the fans at the other side of the tunnel. Eagles' really nice, even walked up the stands. Alan Smith waved a few times, and before he disappeared into the tunnel, threw his jersey to the waiting and screaming fans. He was the only one who did.<br><br>Kuszczak was very dao. Totally ignored all the fans and walked straight into the tunnel. Fergie was quite friendly actually, smiled and waved.<br><br>The game, think you guys got all the first-hand news from the net and stuff already. Nani had a really good game. So excited to see him play!<br><br>The guys left almost immediately after that in their coach. There was an army of security guys there, and no less than 5 patrols escorted them off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Manage to take some shots, but not very closed up and some quite blur. Will put them up shortly.<br><br>Still very shack from the trip, just got back early this morning...reach home 3am. Okay, going back to zzzz....will see if I can put up the fotos tonite  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
