              <p><strong>Manchester United keeper Tomasz Kuszczak insists the battle with Ben Foster to be the club's long-term number one is not over. </strong></p>
              <p>Foster was named Man of the Match in the Carling Cup final win
              over Tottenham and followed up an impressive 120 minutes with a superb
              penalty save from Jamie O'Hara as the champions emerged victorious in
              the shoot-out.</p>
              <p>The former Watford loanee has overcome injury problems to
              assert himself as the logical successor to veteran Edwin van der Sar
              and Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he feels the 25-year-old is the
              future at United.</p>
              <p>However, the Polish media feel Foster is given unfair
              preferential treatment in the English press because he is viewed as a
              great hope for Fabio Capello's national team.</p>
              <p>Kuszczak rarely lets The Red Devils down when called upon but
              does not radiate confidence and is now likely to be considered third in
              the pecking order.</p>
              <p>"In Manchester, it is not journalists but Sir Alex who will
              determine who will come into the first team," declared Kuszczak to the
              Polish media.</p>
              <p>"Before the match with Tottenham, I was prepared [for the news] that I can not play.</p>
              <p>"I do not want to say that I have a bad press here but no, I am not an Englishman."</p>

              <p>do you mean in terms of technical abilities? temperament wise i thk foster has the edge. the article is also true in pointing out that he does not radiate confidence within the team when playing... too bad there can only be one and both would not accept 2nd place once vds is gone that's for sure one of them would surely leave</p>

              <p>To be honest, till date I still have not been able to decide which is better... They are about the same to me and in my opinion, still not good enough yet...</p>
              <p>True, Foster had a decent game but I thought it should be expected on what he did... I actually thought he didn't distribute the ball well at all... Always trying to get the play started by throwing the ball long only for it to go beyond the United player and it ended up with a quick Spurs counter-attact move...</p>
              <p>Foster if he is to be United's No.1, he still need to improve a great deal... I think he is only about 1 yr younger than Cech but somehow he doesn't give the same confidence Cech brings... Hopefully he continue to improve for United's good... And yeah, I agree the English Press is making too big a deal out of it... I guess its because he is English... </p>
