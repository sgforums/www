              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DAVID DE GEA can still go on to be one of the great keepers for Manchester United.</h2>
              <p>He is only 20 and has gone straight into the team after arriving at the club for a lot of money.</p>
              <p>Yet any mistakes he makes are always going to be highlighted, because he is at arguably the biggest club in the world. The spotlight will always be on him.</p>
              <p>When you have had great keepers like Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar, it is always going to be difficult to follow in their footsteps.</p>
              <p>United had a couple of slip-ups with Fabien Barthez and Mark Bosnich - and even Schmeichel had a tough couple of games when he first arrived.</p>
              <p>But Alex Ferguson knows what he is doing and the fact he has thrown the Spaniard in so quickly has made me question why others think he should have been held back.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that a 20-year-old is playing in goal for United. But I would look at him alongside the other young players they have brought in, like Chris Smalling and Phil Jones.</p>
              <p>If Ferguson thinks you are good enough to merit paying out that sort of money to bring you to Manchester United, then there is really nothing to worry about.</p>
              <p>From what I have seen of De Gea, as long as he can keep going and limit his mistakes - because all goalies make mistakes - he will be fine.</p>
              <p>I think that he will go on to be one of the great goalkeepers at Manchester United, without a doubt.</p>
              <p>He has the backing of Ferguson and will have the time and support to get it right.</p>
              <p>All De Gea has to do is get the experience - and playing for United in a goldfish bowl, he will get that very quickly.</p>
              <p>I think if Fergie felt he needed an older, more experienced keeper as back-up, he would have got him.</p>
              <p>Maybe if Van der Sar could have been persuaded to stay for an extra year, you could have given De Gea more time to settle in.</p>
              <p>But Van der Sar has retired and, if Fergie thinks De Gea is good enough to throw straight in, I am not going to argue with him.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> manager will not panic and has no reason to. But after two games and two — arguably three — mistakes from young Spaniard David de Gea, Ferguson will hope his most important summer signing will settle down soon.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It is difficult to carry goalkeepers who are low on confidence in the Barclays Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>This - among other things - is why previous United keepers such as Massimo Taibi and Mark Bosnich were jettisoned so quickly.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A guy who has the jitters between the posts will spread nervousness throughout the ranks of those in front of him, especially now with Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic absent through injury. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There was evidence of some of that as United won narrowly 2-1 at West Bromwich on Sunday.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But, with difficult games against Tottenham, Arsenal, Bolton and Chelsea coming up, former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel insists 20-year-old De Gea will find his sea legs despite the intense pressure of being at United.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'This is United and Old Trafford. It's different,' said the Dane. 'I have watched De Gea play in Spain and every time I saw him I was very impressed. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'He was impressive in the Under 21 Championship in the summer, too. But, as I say, this is different; even if you played at a club with a lot of pressure, like Atletico Madrid.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Such was Schmeichel's own standing at United on his retirement in 1999 that subsequent goalkeepers like Taibi, Bosnich, Tim Howard, Roy Carroll and, to a lesser degree, Fabien Barthez found it too much to try to replace him.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>De Gea, for his part, must replace Edwin van der Sar. But Spain No 1 Iker Casillas said: 'He is only 20. He has a long road ahead of him but he is a great person and a good professional.'</span></p>

              <h2>Sir Alex Ferguson is ready to stand by error-prone goalkeeper David de Gea as Manchester United attempt to replicate Javier Hernandez's strengthening programme in order to fast-track the Spanish youngster's acclimatisation to English football.</h2>

              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>De Gea, an £18.3 million signing from Atletico Madrid, was at fault for both of Manchester City's goals in </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>'s Community Shield victory at Wembley and conceded another soft goal during Sunday's 2-1 </strong></span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Premier League</strong></span></a><strong> win at West Bromwich. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>De Gea's fallibility when dealing with crosses and high balls into the six-yard box was also evident at The Hawthorns, but United manager Ferguson is understood to have no plans to drop the youngster in favour of Danish understudy Anders Lindegaard for Monday's clash with Tottenham at Old Trafford.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>But while Ferguson believes De Gea's mistakes so far stem from positional issues which can be eradicated quickly, the Scot is aware of the need for De Gea, 20, to improve his physique in order to avoid being outmuscled by opponents.</p>
              <p>United have already mapped out a personalised training programme to accelerate De Gea's physical development.</p>
              <p>Under the guidance of senior fitness coach Tony Strudwick, De Gea is expected to follow a similar programme to that laid down for Mexican forward Hernandez last season.</p>
              <p>Hernandez bulked up significantly and Patrice Evra and Cristiano Ronaldo have also benefited from fast-track fitness regimes at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>De Gea, who appears some way short of his alleged 6ft 4in frame, will be given similar treatment, with special emphasis on his diet.</p>
              <p>During the club's pre-season tour of the United States, Strudwick admitted the need to pay close attention to the individual needs of players, particularly new arrivals such as De Gea.</p>
              <p>"The Premier League is not the same as La Liga," said Strudwick. "What the modern player can expect now is personal attention. They deserve that.</p>
              <p>"The days of coming in at 9.30am, having a slice of toast, then jogging onto the training pitch are gone."</p>
              <p>Iker Casillas, the Spain and Real Madrid goalkeeper, has spoken highly of his young rival, claiming that ''he will pension us all off,'' but De Gea has shown signs of weakness that have already been noted by his team-mates.</p>
              <p>At The Hawthorns, both Phil Jones and Anderson were seen raising their arms to the goalkeeper in order to highlight the need for De Gea to be prepared to combat flailing arms, an issue which is unlikely to go away when United travel to unforgiving opponents such as Stoke City and Blackburn Rovers.</p>
              <p>Off the pitch, De Gea is taking daily English lessons and has flown his girlfriend, the Spanish pop star Edurne, over to be with him in Manchester.</p>
              <p>But with a trip to the Britannia Stadium looming on Sept 24, the youngster will be expected to find his feet quickly if he is to settle on the pitch as well as he is settling off it.</p>

But he better build-up some muscle fast as the Premiership is more tougher, and there are more high balls into the box on average and the strikers and central defenders especially, when they attack the ball, they really go in hard.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I can't imagine how is he going to handle the likes of Kevin Davies</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Zat Knight</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Kenwyne Jones</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Andrew Carroll</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Emile Heskey</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Drogba, Terry, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Bobby Zamora kind... Or </span><span style="color: #000000;">Rory Delap's long throw when they meet Stoke...</span></p>
              <p>I am guessing United will drop some unnecessary points before Fergie decide to give Lindegaard a chance...</p>
              <p>Anyway, how come he can be so skinny? I wonder if he is the skinniest keeper in the Premiership right now?</p>

              <p>Plus, I think he's feeling nervy too. Remember him pushing away a shot which he could have held and it fell onto the feet of a west brom player.</p>
              <p>Let half a season go by then we judge la.....lol. VDS also not that beefy right but still imposing. He needs to learn his english and start acting as if he owns the area. 20 years old and in goal for united, fergie must either be blind or blessed with astute vision.</p>

              <p>I understand we have to give him some time but United didn't went out to buy a $7m or $8m keeper, they got the 2nd most expensive keeper in the world and that record was standing for like more than 10 yrs... So one expects better I guess...</p>
              <p>I honestly hope he does better from here on but I also have to call a spade a spade when I see one no two ways about it just because he is a United player... From my observation, his mistakes got from bad to worse... The first City goal was bad, the 2nd was worse... The one against West Brom the worst... I am not asking for a spectacular performance, just an above average one can liao for now...</p>
              <p>One of the question i cannot not think of is... After the period of putting up with him over the next few years and the cost it takes (Not sure how many trophies United will miss out cos of him)... One fine day, 5, 6 yrs down the road when Fergie finally retires and he finally becomes a good keeper, he might say I am tired of England and wants to return to Spain the moment Real or Barcelona comes calling... Afterall, <span style="color: #000000;">Iker Casillas and</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">Victor Valdes both are in the 29/30 age now so those 2 will need a new keeper in 5 yrs time as not everyone is a VDS who can stay quality until 40yrs old...</span></p>
              <p>And 5 yrs from now it's really quite a long time but if he really comes good, you can bet your bottom dollar that those 2 will come calling for sure... And the signs are, they normally prefer to go back after a few years... Whether the reason they give is the food, the weather, the traffic (Arsenal/Helb), or the wife prefer the sun over there (<span style="color: #000000;">Mascherano)</span> or their father or mother or gf or kids wants them back home... The good ones like Alonso, Fabregas and even the not so good ones like Reyes, Arbeloa all end up going back... Does anyone seriously belief Reina is at Liverpool because he love to be there? Had those 2 came for him, he would take the first flight out of England liao to say the least...</p>
              <p>A few years ago I said in here Fabregas will return to Barce if he really became a quality player before he is 25 and a number of Arsenal fans said then it won't happen... But see what happen now?</p>
              <p>I stand to be corrected but I would say De Gea won't be a United keeper before he is 30... or perhaps earlier if he really becomes a very good keeper... Cos Fergie won't be there by then and he won't have any loyalty to the new manager once he has establish himself. And don't bother about the Atletico and Real thing that will prevent him going back... Cos it won't stand in the way by then...</p>

              not...</p>
              <p>I understand we have to give him some time but United didn't
              went out to buy a $7m or $8m keeper, they got the 2nd most
              expensive keeper in the world and that record was standing for like
              more than 10 yrs... So one expects better I guess...</p>
              <p>I honestly hope he does better from here on but I also have
              to call a spade a spade when I see one no two ways about it
              just because he is a United player... From my observation, his
              mistakes got from bad to worse... The first City goal was bad, the
              2nd was worse... The one against West Brom the worst... I am not
              asking for a spectacular performance, just an above average one can
              liao for now...</p>
              <p>One of the question i cannot not think of is... After the
              period of putting up with him over the next few years and the
              cost it takes (Not sure how many trophies United will miss out
              cos of him)... One fine day, 5, 6 yrs down the road when Fergie
              finally retires and he finally becomes a good keeper, he might
              say I am tired of England and wants to return to Spain the moment
              Real or Barcelona comes calling... Afterall, <span style="color: #000000;">Iker Casillas and</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">Victor
              Valdes both are in the 29/30 age now so those 2 will need a new
              keeper in 5 yrs time as not everyone is a VDS who can stay
              quality until 40yrs old...</span></p>
              <p>And 5 yrs from now it's really quite a long time but if
              he really comes good, you can bet your bottom dollar that
              those 2 will come calling for sure... And the signs are, they
              normally prefer to go back after a few years... Whether the reason
              they give is the food, the weather, the traffic
              (Arsenal/Helb), or the wife prefer the sun over
              there (<span style="color: #000000;">Mascherano)</span> or their father or mother
              or gf or kids wants them back home... The good ones like
              Alonso, Fabregas and even the not so good ones like Reyes, Arbeloa
              all end up going back... Does anyone seriously belief Reina is
              at Liverpool because he love to be there? Had those 2 came for
              him, he would take the first flight out of England liao to say the
              least...</p>
              <p>A few years ago I said in here Fabregas will return to Barce if
              he really became a quality player before he is 25 and a number
              of Arsenal fans said then it won't happen... But see what
              happen now?</p>
              <p>I stand to be corrected but I would say De Gea won't be a United
              keeper before he is 30... or perhaps earlier if he really becomes
              a very good keeper... Cos Fergie won't be there by then and he
              won't have any loyalty to the new manager once he has establish
              himself. And don't bother about the Atletico and Real thing that
              will prevent him going back... Cos it won't stand in the way by
              then...</p>

              <p>Cesc's departure was mainly the fact that Arsenal didn't win any trophy for 6 years.. If they had been successful, things will turn out differently.</p>
              <p>As for the points on his loyalty, i guess that's something that would happen to all the players right ? Even Rooney pulled such stuns last season... So it is meaningless to predict loyalty in a team.</p>

              <p><br>Seriously? You really think it's the trophies that he couldn't get that's why he left ?</p>
              <p>Well, I don't think so... Maybe if they had won stuff earlier, he might have left even earlier...</p>
              <p>On the second point... I am saying the chances is far greater for a S American, Portuguese, Spanish player to want to go to Barce and Real than the English ones... Cos they were brought up following that league and they share a more common language as well as a closer culture...</p>
              <p>Do you see home-grown players like Gerrard, Lampard or Rooney going to Spain? It's not that they are not wanted over there but the chances of them wanting to go is far lesser compare to a Spanish player after a few years... Cos it's just natural to want to go back after a few years away if one have a choice... If the chances of Gerrard, Lampard or Rooney going to Spain is 25%, then the chances of Spanish players could probably be 70%.</p>
              <p>If today we compare Phil Jones and De Gea, who do we think have a greater chance of playing in Spain in future?</p>

              <p>Yes I agree they are totally two different things altogether...</p>
              <p>But first of all, he must have real quality for Fergie to break the 11yrs record price for a goalkeeper to sign him...</p>
              <p>The second option sounds more like what a $3.5m keeper like Lindegaard would face rather than a top dollar quality one like him should...</p>
              <p>I can understand mistakes are part and parcel of it but his consecutive mistakes he made were really poor ones especially the WB goal... The ball was struck rather weak that he could still dived over it and watch it slowly roll into the net kind... If you watched the re-run, the 3 defenders (Rio, Vidic, Fabio) put their hands on their heads in disbelief that a weak shot like that could get pass him so easily... It's like a school boy error to make to say the least... This kind of mistake isn't down to the language or the skinniness... I look at it as poor judgement from his part and too slow to getting down to the ground...</p>
              <p>I have to say I don't doubt his quality as a decent keeper in the long run but I feel if he needs like what you said... time to adapt, beef-up, learn the language and fix so many other inadequacy... Perhaps he should train behind the scene first till he is better equip... No?</p>
              <p>And since your latest news said he is excelling in training, let's all pray it's by leaps and bounds... lol...</p>
              <p>Let's hope he don't screw up against Spurs now, cos it would be very difficult to get back at Harry's side...</p>
