              at by an individual outside a restaurant in Hanway Street, W1.</p>
              <p>"Officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10.20pm on Tuesday evening.</p>

              <h3>Rooney 'blameless' over spit claim</h3>
              <p><strong> Wayne Rooney has hit back over allegations that he spat at a photographer.</strong><br> <br>The
              Manchester United and England star was interviewed under caution after
              the alleged incident near London's Oxford Street on Tuesday evening.<br> <br>But a spokesman for the striker said he is 'blameless'.<br> <br>The 22-year-old was reportedly leaving a restaurant with his wife Coleen.<br> <br>He was spoken to by police at a neutral venue after a third party made the complaint shortly afterwards.<br> <br>But the spokesman described what had happened as `a minor incident'.<br> <br>He
              said: "Wayne was interviewed by police in connection with an alleged
              minor offence involving a paparazzi photographer who had been
              persistently invading his and Coleen's privacy throughout the evening.<br> <br>"This included the photographer following the couple into a restaurant from which he had to be evicted.<br> <br>"Wayne was happy to co-operate fully and to give a clear version of the events in which he believes he was blameless."</p>
