              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p><strong>Rio Ferdinand was happy for United
              to come away from White Hart Lane with a point – but insists Spurs'
              goal should not have stood.</strong></p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov slotted
              home Tottenham's opener after 20 minutes, but only after Jermaine Jenas
              appeared to handle the ball in the build-up.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand told <strong><em>MUTV</em></strong>: "I think they were a bit fortunate with their goal.</p>
              <p>"I
              was behind it and I could see Jenas lying on the floor handling it.
              That's why I remonstrated with the linesman – how he didn't see it,
              I'll never know."</p>
              <p>United were below-par for most of the game but
              Carlos Tevez rescued a point with an equaliser from a corner deep into
              stoppage time.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand continued: "I remember going up for the
              corner and the referee said to me '30 seconds left', so I knew it was
              last-chance saloon.</p>
              <p>"Luckily the ball in was good from Nani and Carlos was there to slot it home.</p>
              <p>"We knew we had to come here and work hard. You need spirit if you want to win things and we showed that."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Here are my own thoughts on the match;</p>
              <p>Tottenham played very
              well and did a good job of closing down the Man U players. It prevented
              them from being able to play their game. Tottenham actually were doing
              well against Man U at Old Trafford in the FA Cup and it was a personal
              mistake by Dawson that gave the game to Man U. Hence it wasn't
              surprising to see Tottenham play well against Man U at their home
              ground.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's goal was well and valid in my opinion because
              I don't think it was a handball foul by Jenas. For one thing, he was on
              the ground when his hand touched the ball. Moreover, he could not even
              see the ball so the contact was not deliberate. Plus, the contact was
              minimal and didn't even change the direction or impede the motion of
              the ball. Credit to Aaron Lenon for picking up the ball and good
              finishing by Berbatov.</p>
              <p>Evra was lucky not to concede a penalty
              because he was not watching the ball and the ball clearly hit his hand
              and the ball's motion did change. It wasn't deliberate, but I don't
              think the referee would be wrong to give the penalty.</p>
              <p>Tottenham
              showed lots of determination in this match right from start to finish
              and it was a tremendous team effort. Michael Dawson seemed extra
              determined seemingly with something to prove after getting sent off in
              the FA Cup match. But he did seem a bit too eager at times and might
              have gotten into trouble with the referee if he wasn't careful.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
              as well was lucky not to get sent off for 2nd yellow because there were
              a few rash tackles in the 2nd half that seemed like yellow cards to me.
              Perhaps the Tottenham players were suceeding in winding him up.</p>
              <p>Tottenham
              was so relentless and were chasing for every ball that Giggs and
              Scholes were not able to keep up. With the game going so high tempo
              throughout, Ferguson needed to introduce the fresh legs of Anderson and
              Nani. Hargreaves wasn't tiring, but I'm not sure if he was taken off
              due to injury. Hargreaves was having a first half and it seemed the
              frustration was getting to him. So maybe subbing him off was a good
              idea.</p>
              <p>It would have been more ineteresting in terms of a title
              chase if Man U lost, Arsenal drew and Chelsea won. But oh well....
              whatever happens, happens....</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>To be fair, Spurs did play an excellent game, and we can clearly see the progress under Ramos. He has bought smartly and strengthen where he should.</p>
              <p>Nah, I still prefer it to be a two horse race, introducing a blue ass won't help much.</p>

              <p>did any watch the Mancity game? I did and was quite surprised.</p>
              <p>Given how ManCity got a good home record,I expected them to pin Gunners.</p>
              <p>However, I was surprised at their rubgy style of attack. When the forwards get the ball, instead of moving forward, they play the ball backwards and run. Expecting the player at the back to punch the ball forward for them. The first goal they conceed was a result of that, when playing backwards, Gunner intercept and score. So surprised to see this from Sven.</p>
              <p>Anyway, reality strikes for them cause they are beaten 3-1.</p>
              <p>MUFC going to have a hard game next week.</p>
