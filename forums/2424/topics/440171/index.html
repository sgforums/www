              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>We begin, like so many of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a>'s goals, with David Silva. The ability to play a pass has always been the barometer of a midfielder's gifts. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awKbuc7Lxwc&amp;t=1m45s"><span style="color: #005689;">And, boy, can Silva play a pass</span></a>. It is a rare form of talent: the vision, knowing where the ball should go, at the exact angle and with the precise weight, and making it look so damn easy.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson once said that the greatest quality he sees in a footballer is penetration – "and Eric Cantona brought the can-opener" – and he could be forgiven sometimes if he looks at Silva, a player he watched many times for Valencia, and sees someone who would have been an ideal wearer of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s colours.</p>
              <p>United did speak to Valencia at one stage and, if there are regrets, they will certainly not be eased by the last transfer window when Ferguson identified Samir Nasri to play the same kind of role only for City to ambush the deal. Nasri and Silva are one and two in the table that tells us which midfield players have created the most chances in the Premier League this season. Nasri has provided one every 15 minutes and set up six goals. Silva has five and has undeniably been the star player for Roberto Mancini in the first two months of this season. "I wanted to sign this guy five years ago for Inter," the manager says. "He kept me waiting but, you know, it was worth it. What a player."</p>
              <p>United's inability to bring in this kind of category-A midfielder in the summer was a source of intense disappointment for supporters, which was only partly diluted by the arrival of Ashley Young, to play on the left wing. Trying to recruit someone for the role once occupied by Paul Scholes, the club also missed out on Wesley Sneijder, from Internazionale, and not everyone was entirely convinced when Ferguson talked of being unconcerned because of the emergence of players such as Tom Cleverley and the French teenager Paul Pogba.</p>
              <p>The complaints could conceivably resurface later in the season because, however you shuffle the names, it is difficult to come up with any quartet from United's midfield that consolidate Ferguson's argument earlier this week that they are closing the gap on Barcelona. Yet the players in question, to give them their due, have played well enough to remove a lot of the disappointment. United have emerged unscathed from a difficult opening run of fixtures, playing bursts of illuminating and sometimes riotous football, and Cleverley was at the heart of it until the ankle injury he suffered courtesy of Kevin Davies last month.</p>
              <p>Anderson, too, has been impressive, even if he has not been able to sustain his early-season excellence. Darren Fletcher is back in the groove after a long, unspecified illness while Ryan Giggs always offers flashes of greatness however sparingly he is used, and Michael Carrick is a useful man to have in reserve, regardless of the argument that he withholds too much of his talent too often. Above all, Nani continues to play with distinction and Young, for the most part, has flourished.</p>
              <p>United, like City, usually operate with two reasonably deep-lying midfielders. However, there is far greater emphasis at City for these players to remain in position, closing down the ball, anticipating danger, playing the quick, incisive pass to the players with the more creative edge. Nigel de Jong is now probably the most accomplished exponent of this role in the league and it is here, too, where Owen Hargreaves will play if his knees hold up.</p>
              <p>City are particularly strong in this department because, while Gareth Barry lacks pace and a sprinkling of stardust, he has the discipline and football intelligence to make himself a favourite of Mancini's. James Milner can also fill the role and the same applies to Yaya Touré, even if his ability to drive forward and play the killer pass suits a more advanced position.</p>
              <p>United's central midfielders usually work to the system that one goes forward and the other covers. The team, however, has not had an orthodox holding player, bar Hargreaves's brief spells free of injury, since Roy Keane's departure in 2005. It is a slightly unorthodox view – the majority of Premier League teams operate with at least one defence-minded midfielder and Mancini considers it vital – but Ferguson's trophy count over the past six years suggests he is not being unduly reckless.</p>
              <p>There is less structure to United's midfield and more freedom, plus a greater reliance on width, with 183 crosses this season compared to City's 157. Nani set up 18 goals last season and scored nine, and that form has continued this season. "Nobody at our club thinks he is in Cristiano Ronaldo's shadow," Ferguson says. "He's his own player. And the great thing is, we're going to get the best years out of him."</p>
              <p>City, in contrast, do not operate with orthodox wingers, often starting with a left-footed player such as Silva or Adam Johnson on the right, and the right-footed Nasri or Mario Balotelli on the left. It is a narrow system and the tendency is for the wide players to come inside on to their stronger foot. It is the same for Young in the United team but more pronounced at City because it happens on both wings.</p>
              <p>City also have the more physical midfielders, so much so that Ferguson said this was his reason for not starting the small but wiry Cleverley when the sides met in the Community Shield. As it turned out, the concerns were misplaced and Cleverley's introduction at half-time turned the match in United's favour.</p>
              <p>He is now recovered from injury and it will be interesting to see if Ferguson puts him back into the team. Fletcher seems a safer bet because Touré, De Jong and Barry bring a presence to City's midfield that the home side will need to combat. But it is Silva, almost certainly, who will trouble Ferguson the most. As Mancini says: "He could play for any team in the world."</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>In football, getting a reputation has always been easier than losing one. Roberto Mancini's press conference ahead of Manchester derby was half a dozen questions in before the man from Sky wanted to know whether <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a>'s manager would be going for it at Old Trafford. Or whether we might see more of what happened at times last season and City playing for a draw. A bore draw, presumably.</p>
              <p>Half an hour earlier, across the fields, past the stables and electricity pylons to where United train a couple of hundred yards away, Sir Alex Ferguson was being asked about City's tendency last season to stifle difficult away games. Did he think they would be more positive this time? Ferguson knew where the line of questioning was taking him and neatly avoided saying anything that could be loosely construed as criticism of Mancini. "He's got his job to do, like everyone else," he said.</p>
              <p>The accusation is that Mancini can be too stuffy, too conservative, not prepared often enough to let the handbrake off. Yet like many things in football it does not always stand up to proper analysis. City have accumulated 27 goals from their first eight fixtures and, in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> years, no other side has been more prolific at this stage of the season.</p>
              <p>The 5-1 thrashing of Tottenham Hotspur in August, when Edin Dzeko scored four, was the biggest away win at White Hart Lane for 14 years. Sergio Agüero has nine goals in his first 10 appearances for the club. Dzeko has managed seven in  10. The Bosnian has not scored in his last six games but Mario Balotelli's re-emergence has made it scarcely matter, with a goal in each of his last four appearances. City have scored three or more times in six of their eight matches and when you take into account they have averaged almost 20 shots per game it can feel like a trick of the mind that Mancini was condemned last season for being too defence-minded.</p>
              <p>United have an impressive 25 goals of their own, including a couple of scorelines against Arsenal and Bolton Wanderers that would be better suited to the 1950s, and they have an advantage in terms of squad depth. Ferguson has seven strikers if we are counting Federico Macheda and Mame Biram Diouf and so much competition for places that Michael Owen has not started a league fixture for more than a year.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney's 10 games this season have resulted in 11 goals. Javier Hernández has not been hugely involved, starting five games, but has the ability to score 20-plus goals this season. Daniel Welbeck went to Sunderland on loan last season as a boy and has come back a man. Dimitar Berbatov scored 20 times last season to finish, with Carlos Tevez, as the joint winner of the Golden Boot but he belongs to the edges now, starting only one league game. The competition is brutal.</p>
              <p>Mancini does not have as many choices now that Tevez has been isolated and it could become a problem if, say, two of his three forwards succumbed to injury at the same time. Mancini has talked with his coaching staff about using David Silva or Samir Nasri, even Yaya Touré, as a secondary striker and it would be no surprise if City try to bring in a replacement for Tevez in January.</p>
              <p>The top clubs tend to have at least four high-calibre forwards and, though Dzeko and Balotelli have enjoyed rich bursts of form, there is no guarantee either can keep it up. Dzeko had a poor game against Villarreal on Tuesday and Mancini will hope it was a one-off rather than a return to last season's form. As for Balotelli, the signs are encouraging but who can really say whether he has turned the corner? Mancini seemed amused on Friday when it was put to him that Balotelli was turning into a "model" player. "I hope he has changed his mentality," he said, "but with Mario everything can happen, at every moment."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What can be said with certainty is that both teams are blessed with forwards of devastating qualities. Arsène Wenger said week that Robin van Persie was now the best striker in the league but, in Manchester, they would argue it is either Rooney or Agüero. Rooney is in the best scoring form of his life while Agüero has settled seamlessly into City's team. Ferguson's eyes sparkle when he is asked about Hernández's movement inside the penalty area and the way he can elude opponents. Mancini is on record saying he rates Balotelli ahead of Fernando Torres and that the Italy international can become one of the best three players in the world. Balotelli, with his latest escapade involving fireworks in the early hours of yesterday morning, clearly still lacks maturity but Mancini could be the only man out there to bring out the player's raw qualities.</p>
              <p>At Liverpool last Saturday Ferguson did what Mancini would occasionally do last season and tried to smother the game. But it is rare for Ferguson to be so negative. The United manager will often make a show of strength by putting on three attacking substitutes all at once if his team are losing. As Ron Atkinson once said: "There is nothing more exciting in football than watching <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> chase a game."</p>
              <p>Mancini can still perplex sometimes and it was strange, say, that in the Champions League tie against Bayern Munich, he withdrew Dzeko and brought on Nigel de Jong when the team were losing 2-0. But those moments have become increasingly rare and City this season have marginally edged United as the most attacking side in the land. Like United, their forwards are so good it would be daft to try any other way.</p>
