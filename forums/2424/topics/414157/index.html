              <p class="art-txt-first">Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta says Pep Guardiola is committed to the club and will not be taking over at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Guardiola was offered a six-year deal in the summer by incoming president Sandro Rosell, but preferred to sign up for just two more seasons.</p>
              <p>The Spanish press recently claimed the Barca boss was Sir Alex Ferguson's choice to succeed him at Old Trafford, but Zubizarreta believes Guardiola's ties with the Catalan run too deep for him to think about leaving just three years into his highly successful tenure.</p>
              <p>"If Ferguson is thinking that way, he has excellent taste," the former Barca and Spain goalkeeper told Ona FM yesterday.</p>
              <p>"But everybody knows the ties Guardiola has with Barca, which go far beyond the contract he has."</p>
              <p>And Zubizarreta insists he is working on a long-term project with his former club and international team-mate.</p>
              <p>"There is nothing we are keeping (from people) and nothing holding us back - we are working on a long-term project," he said.</p>

              <p>France coach Laurent Blanc has admitted he "could be interested" in managing Manchester United when Sir Alex Ferguson retires, but stressed that until that day comes he is fully focused on his job with <em>les Bleus</em>.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has been in the Old Trafford hotseat for 24 years and while he has not given any indication that he is set to call it a day soon, speculation persists about who his eventual successor will be.</p>
              <p>The likes of Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho and Everton manager David Moyes are among those who have been tipped as possible replacements for Ferguson, and Blanc himself emerged as a possible candidate after guiding Bordeaux to the Ligue 1 title in 2009.</p>
              <p>And while Blanc, who marshalled United's defence for two years before retiring from playing, says he is currently concentrating on leading France to Euro 2012, he did not rule out putting himself forward to succeed Ferguson when the time comes.</p>
              <p>"Sir Alex is the cornerstone of Manchester United," Blanc told<em> Reuters</em>. "He personifies Manchester's project, he's got this passion.</p>
              <p>"It would be a very interesting, although a very tough challenge but maybe interesting if he is the one starting it [his replacement's process] with me or someone else. But I could be interested."</p>
              <p>"It would please me a lot. But it would be tough to find a successor to Sir Alex. He has done it for 24 years and it will not be easy. For now, I am not in that [United] project. I have another challenge."</p>
