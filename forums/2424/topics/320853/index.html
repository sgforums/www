              <p><strong>Married life has begun for Wayne Rooney and Coleen McLoughlin, as the world waits for photos of the grand event.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              22-year-olds tied the knot in a lavish ceremony on the Italian Riviera
              on Thursday in front of a select group of family and friends.</p>
              <p>The
              footballer and his bride exchanged vows at the Villa Durazzo in the
              resort of Santa Margherita Ligure, around 25 miles east of Genoa.</p>
              <p>Gianni
              Costa, the deputy mayor of Santa Margherita who conducted the ceremony,
              seemed blissfully unaware of the couple's exclusive deal - reportedly
              worth £2.5 million - with OK! magazine.</p>
              <p>He told
              reporters held outside by heavy-duty security: "The bride looked lovely
              in white and the groom wore a brown suit with no tie. No rings were
              exchanged, and the ceremony was very simple, yet very beautiful.</p>
              <p>"Everyone was very emotional and there were a few tears from everyone, especially the bride, but Wayne was very composed."</p>
              <p>Heavy
              rain forced McLoughlin to accessorise her white Marchesa wedding gown -
              believed to have cost £200,000 - with a large black umbrella, but she
              can take comfort in the Italian saying: "A wet bride is a happy bride."</p>
              <p>The
              couple are rumoured to have shelled out £5 million for their nuptials,
              with OK! magazine reported to be meeting half that cost.</p>
              <p>They
              held their wedding reception at La Cervara, an abbey which has hosted
              three popes and imprisoned a French king during its 650-year history.</p>
              <p>Security was tight for the entire event, which culminated in a stunning midnight fireworks display.</p>
              <p>The
              scores of paparazzi scored an early victory with a snatched picture of
              McLoughlin in her wedding dress, shielded by an umbrella as she stepped
              off the yacht where she spent her last night as a single woman.</p>
              <p>However
              one who spent nearly an hour attempting to hack through thick brambles
              surrounding La Cervara left empty handed after having gained no more
              than 50 yards of ground.</p>

              <h1>Coleen wows as she shows off Wayne Rooney's <br>wedding sparkler</h1>
              <p class="byline"> </p>
              <h2>NEWLYWEDS Wayne and Coleen Rooney flashed their matching wedding rings for the first time yesterday— worth a staggering £250k plus.</h2>
              <p>They flew back to Liverpool from their nuptials on the Italian Riviera showing off similar platinum wedding bands. Coleen’s was topped by a magnificent diamond the size of a chicken nugget.</p>
              <p>Last night a top jeweller said her ring alone could be worth £250,000. Eileen Kelly, of Abiba jewellers in London’s Hatton Garden, said: “It’s beautiful and obviously a bespoke piece.</p>
              <h2>Devotion</h2>
              <p>“I would say, because it is so unusual, that she has has chosen the design and had them specially made. “Both rings are channel-set with two rows of diamonds and hers is offset with a massive marquise cut diamond on top. What a lovely way to start married life.”</p>
              <p>Wayne and his bride, both 22, were happy to show off their wedding rings to for wellwishers as they boarded a specially chartered jet from Genoa back to Liverpool at lunchtime yesterday with more than 60 relatives and close friends. One family friend said: “Coleen and Wayne are deliriously happy—head over heels in love.</p>
              <p>The Rooneys’ flight home brought to an end almost five days of festivities surrounding the couple’s £5 million wedding on the Italian Riviera.</p>
              <p>They had tied the knot in a civil ceremony on Thursday at Villa Durazzo in Santa Margherita Ligure, near Genoa. Last night it emerged that police brought an end to Wayne’s pre-wedding party at his five-star hotel, The Bentley, after local residents complained about the noise.</p>
              <p>Rooney’s boisterous group, including father Wayne Snr and brothers Graham and John, partied into the small hours of Thursday morning with music blaring from his £750-a-night suite. The Manchester United and England star apologised immediately to officers who knocked on the door of his room and the music was turned down.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman in Genoa said: “Several calls were received from residents complaining about the level of the music coming from the hotel.</p>
              <p>“I understand Wayne Rooney himself was very polite and courteous, he apologised and the music was turned down."</p>
              <p>Following Thursday’s ceremony the Rooney party then held a marathon two-day party with endless booze and pizza at La Cervara, a converted monastery nearby and back at The Bentley.</p>
              <p>After a honeymoon half-time in Liverpool, Wayne and Coleen are expected to fly to the Caribbean for the second-half.</p>
