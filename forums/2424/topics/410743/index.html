              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson admits that last year's Champions League defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich still haunts him.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has guided the Red Devils to two Champions League successes in his 24 years at the club, but reckons they should have won at least twice that.</p>
              <p>The United boss says some exits were unavoidable, but there were also some they "ballsed up" - and last season's exit is very much classed as that.</p>
              <p>United were knocked out by Bayern as Arjen Robben's late volley at Old Trafford sent the German giants through on away goals.</p>
              <p>"We've only won it three times, which is not enough for this club, and we've been unlucky a lot of times. Other times we've just ballsed it up," Ferguson told <em>The People</em>.</p>
              <p>"The reality is we could have won it another two or three years.</p>
              <p>Last year still plays on my mind, that Bayern Munich game. Christ, I'm still not sleeping after that! I keep thinking about that game and keep getting angry about the way we lost it.</p>
              <p>"We were in complete control until Rafael was sent off and then they came back into it. That result hurt and still does, but against Borussia Dortmund at Old Trafford in 1997 we had about 15 chances and about eight one-on-ones with their keeper.</p>
              <p>"If we'd got past Bayern Munich I think we would have reached the final last year and I'd have fancied us against Inter Milan."</p>
              <p>United begin their assault on this season's Champions League against Rangers on Tuesday and Ferguson is refusing to take the Scottish champions lightly.</p>
              <p>"You've got to respect Rangers and with their history you can't take them for granted," he said.</p>
              <p>"I know Walter Smith well and just how organised and difficult to beat his side will be.</p>
              <p>"Walter will get a good glass of wine after the match but, hopefully, that's all he'll get."</p>
              <p>Ferguson does expect one of his old foes, Jose Mourinho to make Real Madrid a much more potent prospect.</p>
              <p>"Signing Mourinho has upped the ante for Real. They'll have a better chance now - he's got a better squad. He's the first Real coach that's bought players with a plan.''</p>

              <p>man united is cruising until that gary neville decided to use his hand to intervene, result, a deflected fk from ribery ended in bayern goal. in the final minute of injury time, evra dilly dallying resulted in him being dispossed and bayern scored.</p>
              <p>at old trafford, united is cruising to a 3-0 before carrick challenged and fell to the ground haplessly, resulted in bayern scoring a crucial 3-1 at half time and the second half madness by rafael sent off, and carrick rushing out from his position resulted in robben volley that sent united out 4-4 on aggregate.</p>
