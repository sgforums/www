              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson rarely hits the 
              January sales, but this time around, Manchester United’s credit card could be 
              maxed out.</strong><br><br>The manager has sent out mixed 
              messages. On one hand he has bemoaned the lack of value in the market, while 
              also making it clear that money is in the pot for him to spend.<br><br>Supporters are certainly eager to see him 
              flash the cash. A skinflint summer of dealing saw the combined cost of Antonio 
              Valencia, Gabriel Obertan and Michael Owen barely skim the surface of the £80 
              million fee for Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>A 
              minor cosmetic tweak, rather than emergency surgery, is required. United are 
              through to the knockout stages of the Champions League and are in the slipstream 
              of Chelsea in the race for the Premier League title.<br><br>Two deals wrapped up in pre-season are ready to reach fruition. 
              Striker Mame Biriam Diouf should arrive after his loan at Molde FK ends and 
              17-year old Corinthians defensive starlet Dodo is supposedly in the bag for 
              February.<br><br>A transfer window splash to 
              sprinkle stardust on the side could well prove the difference in guaranteeing 
              another champagne soaked summer.<br><br><strong>Goalkeepers</strong><br><br>A 
              plethora of column inches have been devoted to pinpointing the name of the next 
              United number one. <br><br>United are rumoured 
              to be looking east to acquire a new goalkeeper, even though Ferguson has 
              expressed his faith in Ben Foster and Tomasz Kuszczak. The two leading 
              candidates for the spot are CSKA Moscow’s <strong>Igor Akinfeev</strong> and Schalke 04’s <strong>Manuel Neuer</strong>. <br><br>Ferguson has always been a fan of acquiring talent that has 
              shined in opposition, and Akinfeev could not have enjoyed a finer audition. In 
              both of the club’s Champions League meetings, he exhibited every drop of the 
              class that has got Europe purring.<br><br>A 
              sky-high £20 million fee put on his head and CSKA’s progression past the group 
              stage look to have put the kibosh on a winter move, though.<br><br>For Neuer, the signs are more promising. 
              United’s scouts have been regularly posted to the Veltins Arena and he has 
              confirmed interest in the switch.<br><br>Any new 
              player brought in might not be able to count Ben Foster as a team mate. Reports 
              of a loan exit to boost his bid for the England jersey have been discounted by 
              Ferguson, but continue to build momentum.<br><br><strong>Defenders </strong>   <br><br>A defensive injury crisis unheard of in Ferguson’s 23-year 
              tenure could force him in to the marketplace.<br><br>Eight top class first team players are currently in the care of 
              the United medical staff. The Scot spoke at the weekend of the damaging blow 
              this has dealt to the dream of a record breaking fourth consecutive Premier 
              League title.<br><br>Forced to search outside 
              the gates of Old Trafford for the remedy, Palermo’s <strong>Simon 
              Kjaer</strong>, Bolton Wanderers' <strong>Gary Cahill</strong>, CSKA Moscow 
              starlet <strong>Uros Cosic</strong> and even veteran <strong>Sol Campbell</strong> have been linked.<br><br>Despite a denial from his Italian parent club, Kjaer looks the 
              most likely to make the move. He has spoken openly about a desire to move to the 
              Premier League and Palermo have always been open for business if the right offer 
              arrives.<br><br>Cast in the image of injury 
              prone superstar Rio Ferdinand, he could well be the successor for one of the 
              best defenders in the world.<br><br>Elsewhere, a 
              dip in form from Cahill has quelled the fevered transfer chatter of the autumn, 
              while Ferguson was quick to dismiss a shock free transfer move for Campbell.<br><br>Although little known to anyone but the most 
              informed of Russian football fanatics, Cosic is a contender to make the move. 
              Scouts have raved about the 17 year old's potential, and he could make as 
              dramatic an impact as fellow Serb Nemanja Vidic if purchased.<br><br>The flood of injuries to United’s backline 
              make any exits a long shot. Real Madrid are reported to have expressed an 
              interest in Jonny Evans, though with Ferguson a confirmed fan, this seems an 
              impossibility.<br><br><strong>Midfielders</strong><br><br>It seems 
              spurious to talk of an Achilles Heel in a side that is in the running for a 
              fourth Premier League title and third Champions League final appearance in a 
              row. Midfield has long been cited as a weakness in the United squad, however.<br><br>The names sitting at the top of Ferguson’s 
              reported shopping list are Napoli hot shot <strong>Marek Hamsik</strong>, 
              CSKA Moscow’s emerging superstar <strong>Milos Krasic</strong>, Valencia 
              wide man <strong>David Silva</strong> and Olympique Marseille tear-away <strong>Hatem Ben Arfa</strong>.<br><br>Each 
              man would add a significant goal threat and boost the quality in the ranks, 
              although no purchase would be easy to accomplish.<br><br>Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis has refused to countenance 
              the idea of a sale, promising not to be swayed by suitcases of cash from the 
              Premier League. <br><br>For Krasic, his stunning 
              strike against Besiktas was meant to be the crowning glory of his time in 
              Russia, but the club’s European progression has halted the necessity of a move. 
              <br><br>Competition for his signature would be 
              fierce with AC Milan, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Juventus, Real Madrid 
              and Arsenal all supposedly in the hunt. <br><br>Ferguson’s successful gamble on Gabriel Obertan has supposedly 
              influenced him to take a risk on Ben Arfa. Whether Marseille have given up on 
              his potential yet is not known.<br><br>For 
              Silva, Valencia’s crippling debt could play in to United’s hands. However, the 
              Spain international wasn’t too hot on a switch to England more than a year ago 
              and is currently sidelined by injury.<br><br>Amidst the talk of arrivals, Nani and Zoran Tosic are poised for 
              the departure lounge. <br><br>Nani’s explosive 
              revelations on international duty has put him in the clutches of Fiorentina and 
              AC Milan, while Tosic’s lack of action makes a loan exit to suitors FC Twente 
              possible.<br><br><strong>Strikers</strong><br><br>Supporters 
              holding their breath for a big name centre forward should take a gulp of air as 
              no arrival in this area is expected.<br><br>Real 
              Madrid new boy<strong> Karim Benzema</strong>, A.C. Milan flop <strong>Klaas Jan Huntelaar</strong>, deadly Valencia front man <strong>David Villa</strong> and giant <strong>Wolfsburg</strong> number nine <strong>Edin Dzeko</strong> have all been linked, though the 
              acquisition of a new striker is likely to be put on hold until the summer.<br><br>Ferguson’s faith in his current line up has 
              been shown by the continued selection of Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen, as 
              well as his decision to hand contracts to Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck in 
              recent weeks.<br><br>The Scot has also confirmed 
              that a work permit for summer signing Mame Biriam Diouf will be applied for 
              after being wowed in training.<br><br>IN (4): 
              Manuel Neuer (Schalke 04), Simon Kjaer (Palermo), Dodo (Corinthians), Mame

              Lloris</strong></a><strong> too.</strong><br><br>Rumours surrounding a 
              potential January move to Old Trafford for out-of-favour Ben Arfa first began to 
              circulate late on Friday, but the speculation has stepped up in intensity on 
              Sunday, when radio station <em>RTL</em> confirmed that the 
              former Lyon youth’s agent had held talks with representatives of the Premier 
              League titans.<br><br>It is suggested that the 
              22-year-old could join the Red Devils in the coming weeks for around €9 million 
              before being loaned out to either Birmingham City or Everton. Ferguson 
              supposedly wants the Parisian-born talent toughened up a little before regularly 
              turning out at the Theatre of Dreams.<br><em><br>The People</em> suggests that Lloris is also a potential target 
              for the Scottish manager. With Edwin van der Sar in the twilight of his career, 
              the young France international goalkeeper would seem an ideal replacement as he 
              has been in stunning form with les Gones as well as his country.<br><br>Turning 23 years old on Boxing Day, Lloris’ 
              has already demonstrated his consistency at a top level, although he is still 
              considered a youngster by goalkeeping standards. <br><br>No fee has been suggested for his services, but it would be in 
              excess of the €8.5m Lyon paid Nice for him in the summer of 2008.</p>
              <p>Reports in Italy, meanwhile, has pin-pointed Fiorentina's 
              Sebastien Frey as a potential successor to van der Sar.</p>

              from Milan. Furthermore, with a place in the Champions League last 16, the Viola 
              are unlikely to sell one of their prized assets mid-season.<br><br><em>La Gazzetta Dello

              <p>Fergie going for French stars now?</p>
              <p>In Goalkeeping, Kuzczcak is still weak at crosses and his goal kick is questionable too. I've never seen him pumping the ball to the right place, his kicks are always aimed to the left middle of the field and more frequently seen kicking out for opponent throw in. A reserve keeper at best.</p>
              <p>Foster is turning into a piece of crap. I still remember Robinson's freekick that loop over his head into the goal, how he tried to be clever many a time and lose possession of the ball. Think Tevez in the derby match. Sell Foster away as soon as possible Fergie, when he's still worth something.</p>
              <p>Frey is a good keeper but i think he cant thrive in big stage. He was with Inter Milan a couple of years back and cant even retain the No 1 spot. Plus the fact that he's already 29, not appealing at all.</p>
              <p>Hugo Iloris or Steve Mandanda or Igor Akinfeev look like better prospect (They look good in FM too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">).  My pick would be Lloris. First of all, Fergie is seemingly building his core towards French players and It's good to have a keeper that can communicate with his teammates. Furthermore, he is young and he will only improve unlike some Ben Foster who has lost his way due to the pressure of expectations and his big ego for thinking that he's some superstar now.</p>
              <p>In defence, United is seriously lacking a tough central defender apart from Vidic. Evans look like a stickman, Ferdinand is on his way downhill, Brown is a sicknote. I'd recommend Gary Cahill of Bolton or Steven Taylor of Newcastle.</p>
              <p>Retire Neville please. What nonsense defender he is, and he's actually the skipper?! He runs so slowly and always commits professional fouls, a dirty player at best and he's always mouthing off at the wrong time to the wrong people. I was actually happy to see him getting sent off in the FA Cup cos Fergie, please wake up and see that he's of no use. I'd rather play Simpson instead of him.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Hartem Ben Arfa, although his attitude is questionable, will no doubt be the best bet as he is cheap. I would like to see Obertan and Ben Arfa on the wing for United as they both possess the skills, tricks and speed, enough to win the fans over.</p>
              <p>I think Fergie should consider Luca Toni. He might prove to be a better Bosman transfer as compared to Owen. Alternatively, Fergie can try his luck on Agbonlahor. Pacey, Strong and good in air, a perfect foil for Rooney.</p>

              <p>well, for a GK, I still prefer those vocal ones like <span id="main" style="visibility: visible;"><span id="search" style="visibility: visible;"><em>Peter</em> Schmeichel, he really keep those defenders infront of him on their
              toes. And as a defender, u know, if U make a mistake, the keeper behind
              will chew u.. not sure if any targets mentioned fit this.</span></span></p>
              <p>for
              gary neville, U are spot on in that he lost his pace. but i still loved
              it when you see the opposing fans' reaction when they see him, esp those
              pool fans... haha.</p>
              <p>as for arfa, well, if anyone can "tame" him, it is the wily old fox.</p>
              <p>english players are expensive, and given the ??? hanging over how much $$ MU has... it is not easy..</p>
