              <p>lol who the F*ck are you lot?</p>
              <p>How many ManU games have you been to in your life? I find it amusing that you just latch onto the so called rivaly between ManU and Liverpool yet have probably never met a scouser in your life.</p>
              <p>If anything you should be sitting here posting about how much you hate man city! That's the real rivalry for Mancs, though i guess they are not a top4 club so you've probably never heard of them! Any self respecting mancurian wouldn't be found dead in a red jersey.</p>
              <p>Like those muppets burning the Liverpool shirt! They're not English and probably couldn't find Anfield on a map let alone have been to the ground.</p>
              <p>And god knows you wouldn't know Craven Cottage if it came up and bit you on the a*se!</p>
              <p>I've travelled away to Manchester &amp; Liverpool many times as a Fulham fan, manchesters staduim is full of tourists and prawn sandwich munchers, at least anfield has atmosphere, passion and history.</p>
              <p>I never got excited about an away day to Manchester, but I loved the away days up in Liverpool, great city, friendly locals, great night life.</p>
              <p>Manchesters stadium is in salford bloody quays for goodness sake next to a rubbish shopping centre that is as souless as the atmosphere in the stadium on match day!</p>
