            <div class='col-md body'>United have been boosted by the news that Ji-sung Park and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer are both ready to resume full training.<br><br>The pair will rejoin their team-mates this week having overcome ankle and hamstring injuries respectively.<br><br>Park has been out of action since damaging ankle ligaments in the 1-0 win over Tottenham back in September. Solskjaer, meanwhile, pulled his hamstring in the final seconds of United's Champions League defeat in Copenhagen a month ago.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed the duo are now fit to return and he's delighted to see them back.<br><br>"Ji-sung and Ole will begin training this week which is great news for us," the manager told Manchester United Radio. "With the hectic December period coming up it's great we'll have those players available."<br><br>Meanwhile, Sir Alex has revealed that Alan Smith is currently undertaking a special training programme to boost his fitness.<br><br>"Alan is coming along fine," he insisted. "We've changed his fitness programme with the first team; he's now doing special training to aid his speed.<br><br>"He's responding well and is enjoying it. He realises that there is a lot of hard work involved but he's putting everything into it."<br><br><img src="http://picsrv.manutd.com/?fif=/manu/img_10_14533.jpg&amp;obj=iip,1.0&amp;wid=480&amp;hei=179&amp;rgn=0.0437375745526839,0.26485148514851486,0.9542743538767395,0.4430693069306931&amp;cvt=jpeg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think SAF was banking on the fact that we will go further in Carling cup or even FA cup to give the 2nd team a run out.<br>but we prematurely exit the carling cup which ruins his plan.<br><br>now, he needs to find another avenue for 2nd team or youth team to have some serious action.<br><br>but if MUFC were to get a striker in Jan, I think time for either Ole or Smith to go.<br><br>btw, don't you find OwenH's new familiar?
