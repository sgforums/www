              <p><span class="caption"><em>Promise: Ben Collett was highly regarded at Old Trafford until he suffered a serious injury.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ben Collett, who was aged 18 at the time of the injury, fractured his right leg while making his first appearance for United's reserves against Middlesbrough five years ago. Middlesbrough player Gary Smith and his club admitted liability through their insurers before compensation was decided at Manchester's High Court.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, and club captain Gary Neville both gave evidence at an earlier hearing in July. Ferguson had described Collet, who has been compared to Ryan Giggs, as an "A-class" player who had an "outstanding chance" of being awarded a professional contract.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Collett broke his leg in two places. Despite lengthy rehabilitation and attempts to resurrect his career in New Zealand and the Netherlands, Collett was forced to retire. He is now studying and seeking an alternative career.</p>
              <p>The player's lawyer, Jan Levinson, said Collett was one of United's most talented young players, with his full career ahead of him, but the injury ended his prospects at just 18. He said Collett had played in the FA Youth Cup-winning side in 1992, as had David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Phil Neville, also products of the academy.</p>
              <p>Now aged 23, Collett joined United at the age of nine was part of the club's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2003.</p>
              <p>"I thought the boy showed fantastic focus, a great attitude to work hard, and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game," Ferguson told the hearing last month. Earlier, the court heard Collett could have earned more than £13,000-a-week, making a total in excess of £16 million, if he had played until the age of 35.</p>
