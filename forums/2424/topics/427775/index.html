              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAUL has vowed to dump Manchester United out of the Champions League.</h2>
              <p>The Schalke star is gunning for a hat-trick of wins against the Red Devils after twice leading Real Madrid to quarter-final victories against them in 2000 and 2003.</p>
              <p>German outfit Schalke beat reigning champs Inter Milan 7-3 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to set up the last-four clash with Alex Ferguson's side.</p>
              <p>Madrid meet Barcelona in the other semi.</p>
              <p>And Spanish legend Raul said: "My dream is a final against Real Madrid. I see no reason why we shouldn't advance to the final by beating United.</p>
              <p>"The game against Inter was an historic moment. I came to Schalke for experiencing such moments.</p>
              <p>"Everyone said that Schalke is an easy draw - we showed that this is not true."</p>
              <p>Raul, 33, is the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League with 73 strikes - four of them against United. </p>
              <p>And to make matters worse, Raul snubbed a move to Old Trafford last summer when he quit Madrid.</p>
              <p>Schalke centre-half Christoph Metzelder - a former Real team-mate - helped convince Raul to move to Germany.</p>
              <p>Metzelder said: "Manchester United tried to sign him, he talked about it to me. </p>
              <p>"He got to know Germany in the World Cup 2006.</p>
              <p>"I said to him, you have to see it and experience it. He's a big player and his influence is great."</p>
              <p>Raul has bagged 17 goals already this season, five in Europe.</p>
              <p>Metzelder added: "Raul is Mr Champions League. He has played a great season with Schalke, especially the matches in the Champions League."</p>

              <p>yes its true. united never fared well against german teams, but I believe Schalke will be an exception. I always believe past matches have no bearing in matches yet to be played.</p>

              <p>that was the plan in Dortmund in 1997 season, when united lost the first leg 1-0, but second leg also lose 1-0 at OT.</p>
              <p>remember last season when bayern won 2-1 at their den, though united won the return leg 3-2 at OT and went out on aways goals rule.</p>

              <p>Metzelder identifies Rooney threat</p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0424/waynerooneymufcback20110419_275x155.jpg" alt="" width="313" height="198"></p>
              <p>Schalke defender <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/10732/Christoph-Metzelder"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Christoph Metzelder</span></a> has put a target firmly on <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Wayne Rooney</span></a>'s back ahead of Manchester United's Champions League semi-final first leg visit to Germany on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Rooney has rediscovered something like his best form in recent weeks and he was again influential in United's 1-0 Premier League victory over Everton at Old Trafford on Saturday, drifting off the forward line expertly to dictate play.</p>
              <p>Metzelder, 30, said Schalke are well aware of Rooney's ability to find space and would be looking to limit his freedom, even if merely seeking to do so and actually achieving that aim can be two different stories.</p>
              <p>"It's all about stopping Rooney, he's the key player," Metzelder said. "The first match is at home so it will be very important not to concede a goal. Against Chelsea he dropped into the midfield, so it's important to defend against him not only with the defensive line but also with the midfielders.</p>
              <p>Metzelder said he was glad Schalke had avoided favourites Barcelona in their first-ever Champions League semi-final, claiming United more conventional style of play is easier to counter than the tiki-taka of the Spanish pass-masters.</p>
              <p>"Of course we know that Manchester United have so many key players but they don't scare us," he said. "It would be much more difficult for us to play against Barcelona. The style of Manchester United is easier for us, if you can say that. Barcelona take control and they make you run so much it's very difficult to defend against them. It's easier to play against teams like Manchester United - or even Real Madrid."</p>
              <p>But Metzelder is by no means underestimating the challenge ahead for Schalke, though, conceding the German side are the underdogs.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United have had so much experience in the Champions League over the last 20 years. Individually they are so very strong so they're big favourites.</p>
              <p>"Our advantage is certainly that Manchester United will be busy thinking about facing either Real or Barcelona at Wembley in the final. We will definitely be looking to come up with something."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson would do well to heed his friend’s warning: there are 10 other men in blue willing to extend </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;">’s</span> miserable record in Germany.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><br><strong>Manuel Neuer</strong> Goalkeeper, Age: 25<br>Captain and icon, Ferguson will know all about the Germany international: he has sent scouts to watch him several times this season. Neuer has confessed that he will not renew his contract and is expected to shun United’s interest for Bayern Munich this summer.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p><strong>Atsuto Uchida</strong> Right-back, Age: 23<br>Uchida will become the first Japanese player to feature in a Champions League semi-final should he, rather than Chinese international Hao Junmin, feature against United. He moved to Germany last year after coming to prominence with Kashima Antlers.<br><br><strong>Benedikt Höwedes </strong>Centre-back, Age: 23<br>Reared in the same youth system as Neuer and Mesut Özil, the Real Madrid player and a potential opponent in the final, the graceful defender was locally rated the most promising of the three. Widely expected to receive international recognition soon.<br><br><strong>Christoph Metzelder </strong>Centre-back, Age: 30<br>Tasked with leading Schalke’s back line, the veteran Germany international, currently sporting a face mask to protect a cheekbone injury, cuts a daunting figure. Spells at Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid were blighted by injury, but his talent is not in doubt.<br><br><strong>Hans Sarpei</strong> Left-back, Age: 34<br>Likely to be preferred to the more exhilarating, but less defensively sound Sergio Escudero, the versatile full-back will be expected to call on 13 years of Bundesliga experience to stifle the creativity of either Antonio Valencia or Nani.<br><br><strong>Joël Matip </strong>Defensive midfielder, Age: 19<br>The Cameroonian may be drafted into central defence if Höwedes does not recover from a stomach muscle problem in time, but otherwise will be expected to patrol the area in front of Schalke’s occasionally chaotic back four.<br><br><strong>Kyriakos Papadopoulos</strong> Defensive midfielder, Age: 19<br>Signed from Olympiakos for £4.6 million last summer, Papadopoulos is the youngest player yet to feature in the Greek top flight and has continued to develop at a prodigious rate in Germany. A bundle of energy and strong in the tackle, he will provide a formidable obstacle.<br><br><strong>Jefferson Farfán</strong> Right winger, Age: 26<br>The Peru international has been at this stage before, with PSV Eindhoven, but would be forgiven for being surprised to discover himself here again. He was almost sold to Wolfsburg in January before blossoming after Ralf Rangnick replaced Felix Magath as coach.<br><br><strong>José Manuel Jurado</strong> Left winger, Age: 24<br>Schalke’s main creative force, it is little surprise Jurado and Raúl dovetail so well. Both played at one Madrid club before shining at the other – though Jurado left Real for Atlético – and both have suffered for their versatility. Jurado is more at home in a central role, but will be deployed wide on the left.<br><br><strong>Edu</strong> Striker, Age: 29 <br>Roving the front line ahead of Raúl, the Brazilian is probably the unlikeliest player in the semi-finals. After unimpressive spells for some of Germany’s lesser lights – Bochum, Mainz – Edu was plucked by Schalke from obscurity in South Korea 18 months ago.</p>

              <p>Neuer may be a good keeper and he had a good performance last night. But it's one of those days when a keeper suddenly makes a few very good saves type...</p>
              <p>Personally I don't think he is a great keeper, but a good one though. He have let in quite a few soft shots too recently and one was even more crazy like the Ben Foster kind where he came out and the ball bounced over his head and went in.</p>
              <p>Neuer had a good performance right up to 70 mins no doubt... But then again, the 2 goals that when pass him were rather easy too wasn't it? For me, I think the Ajax keeper could be better than him, but that's not to say he is lousy. He is indeed rather good too but could be another Ben Foster, though not that terrible but you know what I mean... On his day he is very good, but not on his day, soft ones can also beat him kind...</p>
              <p>Maybe his performance comes from the inspiration to get Schalke to the finals... Or maybe an interview for Fergie to come and get him ?</p>
