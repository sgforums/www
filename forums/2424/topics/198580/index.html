Of course, I don't mean the players were bad, but their star appeal just wasn't there(which, in a way, proved a blessing in disguise as the team was essentially far more cohesive and united).<br><br>As Keane and Bruce recounted years later, that team could play if the opponents wanted to play and scrap if their opponents wanted to scrap and aboveall, the confidence throughout the side was just immense - and justifiably so - and I'm proud to say that's the only United side I've ever seen which every single member would pull his weight in every match they took part in.<br><br>For me, at least, Hughes' equaliser in the FA Cup Semi Final in 93/94 just sums up what that team is about - United had a greater(with more strength in depth) squad in '99, but in terms of the quality of the first 11 alone, no other United side would come close to touching the '94 one...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by walesa:<br><strong>I wouldn't so much like to speculate what my ideal XI is as for, one reason or another, having star names does not necessarily mean they can play in tandem and churn out better results/performances than the illustrious Man Utd sides of yesteryears. But for me, this is [b]the Greatest</strong> Man Utd side I've ever had the privilege of watching :<br><br>Peter Schmeichel<br>Paul Parker<br>Denis Irwin<br>Steve Bruce(C)<br>Gary Pallister<br>Ryan Giggs<br>Paul Ince<br>Roy Keane<br>Andrei Kanchelskis<br>Eric Cantona<br>Mark Hughes<br><br>The side hails from the 93/94 season and fitness/suspension permitting, was Fergie's automatic first 11(yeah, in those days, squad rotation were unheard of!) - for both quality and entertainment, no other United side has come close prior to that or since(not even the '99 Treble-winning side - regardless of which 11 you want to pick - IMO). Just a pity that side in 93/94 never got to compete as a team in Europe because of the now-defunct 3-foreigner restriction...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>[/b]</blockquote>ya man!!! that was probably the best Man Utd team that i've ever watched too.<br><br>Peter Schmeichel - rated the best keeper in the whole after his Danish side won the Euro championship, who constantly shout at his mates to keep them on their toes.<br><br>Paul Parker<br>Denis Irwin - both no nonsenses player, nothing fancy but still get work done everytime, every game.<br><br>Steve Bruce(C) - alittle overweight defender who would be like Schmeichel, constantly shouting at his mates to buck up, but just abit sad that he wasn't being called up to represent England.<br><br>Gary Pallister - a quiet guy who would received lots of shouting from Bruce, but yet will covers Bruce backside time and again without fail.<br><br>Ryan Giggs - Need to introduction.. one of his most well known adverts for Nike, with him flicking the ball from behind his heel and the header reads "Watch the Devil rise from Hell" and Nike warning him that their endorsmment for his is also subjected that he dun cut his hair.<br><br>Paul Ince - always wear this shirt just right before he enter the field is one of his trademark.<br>Roy Keane - both Keane and Ince will cover every blade of the grass in any football match they played in and may even be willing to die on the field to save Man Utd from losing.<br><br>Andrei Kanchelskis - this guy is super fast, almost all counter attack start from either Giggs or Kanchelskis, Schmeichel with his trademark long throw will usually find him who will then bring the ball to the bye line and cross to the central for either Giggs or Hughes or Cantona to knock home, scorer of some pretty good and important goals for Man Utd too.. but was sold away due to that stupid 3-foreigner rule.<br><br>Mark Hughes - one of the best thinking striker after Ian Rush.. might not be the fastest striker ard but will still get the work done.<br><br>Eric Cantona - he is too god like to be discussed in a forum...so i'll let you guys just think abt what this Man Utd legendary Capt can do.<br><br>sub.<br><br>Lee Sharpe - one of the most expensive youth team player SAF ever brought, was a wonder boy type of player but due to drinking and gamble he can't find back his form and was sold away, a typical wasted talent. (Maybe it was because of him that SAF started taking extra care and protection over his young players protecting them from media..etc.. hence the Giggs, Becks,...was able to mature to what they are today)<br><br>Keith Gixxxxxxx - was a pretty decent right winger who was sold to Newcastle in the part exchange with Andy Cole, but again, maybe was without the fatherly advise from SAF, was wasted in Newcastle and was again sold to Blackburn, had a couple of good games but couldn't keep hold the same performance day in day out.<br><br>Brain Mclair - old but experinced Scotland striker whom SAF brought along with him when he newly came into Man Utd..<br><br>sorry for being a bored, just can't stop talking abt the good old days....<br><br>Cheers everyone in Manchester United and fans of the Red Devilllllllllll..............<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the good old days. LOL.<br><br>but in my opinion the 99 side was the best. the 94 side was dominating the EPL, but they din win the European Champions League, or European Cup as it was known then.</div>
