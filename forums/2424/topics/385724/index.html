              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo concedes he has missed Manchester United since completing his world record £80 million transfer to Real Madrid over the summer.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's lengthy flirtation with the Spanish giants finally ended in June and he has adapted rapidly to life in Spain, scoring 13 goals in ten games for Manuel Pellegrini's side.</p>
              <p>But having developed into one of world football's elite players during his six-year stay at Old Trafford, winning three Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League, Ronaldo still has fond memories of life at United.</p>
              <p>"What people think about me is their opinion but I really miss Manchester a bit," said Ronaldo after being named in the FIFPro World XI on Monday. "I played there for six years and I left a few friends there. So I miss the club a little bit but I'm focused now at Real Madrid and I'm really happy there.</p>
              <p>"I think they [United] are doing very well this season. They have lost two [of their past three] games, but they are still second in the league."</p>

              <p>"Cristiano is one of the best players in the world but I have to be honest and say I haven't noticed much of a difference since he left," the 36-year-old Giggs, who has signed a year's contract extension at United, told The People.</p>
              <p>"We have never been a one-man team and we still have more or less the same group of players. We all knew Cristiano wanted to play for <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Real Madrid" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid"><span style="color: #005689;">Real Madrid</span></a> and when he got the chance he took it. He wasn't a Manc and we knew one day he would leave, and good luck to him."</p>
              <p>One of the biggest changes Giggs has noticed during his 20 years at Old Trafford is the attitude of younger players to the club's established names.</p>
              <p>"In my day, we wouldn't have said boo to the likes of Steve Bruce or Gary Pallister but now the young players are running around making jokes."</p>
