              <h2>Reports in the Spanish press today suggest that Cristiano Ronaldo
              has already signed a pre-contract agreement with Real Madrid, and that
              if he doesn't join this summer, he will have to pay the Spanish club
              €20 million.</h2>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo will have to pay Real Madrid €20 million if he does not join them next summer according to Sport.<br><br>The
              Spanish site reports that the agent for the Portuguese winger, Jorge
              Mendes, signed a pre-contract agreement with former Real Madrid
              president, Ramon Calderon, whilst he was still in office.<br><br>This
              deal is apparently worth €100m, and if Ronaldo does not join, then
              Sport reports that he will have to pay €20m, as he has broken the
              agreement.<br><br>It seemed as though Ronaldo was going to join Madrid
              last summer, and even though he did stay at Manchester United, the
              rumours continue about a potential move for the Portuguese superstar.<br><br>Calderon
              himself was at the centre of the chaos at the time and, if this is
              true, he must be frustrated that he will not be in office next summer
              to see the player finally arrive.<br><br>For Ronaldo, this deal could
              well mean that he will have to try and convince Sir Alex Ferguson to
              sell him, else he will end up losing a substantial sum of money, which
              even such a well-paid played is likely to miss.<br><br>The winger has
              been recognised as the best player in the world, winning the Ballon
              d’Or, however, it is thought that he wants a new challenge after
              winning just about everything possible with United.<br><br>The English
              club would be incredibly reluctant to let go of him, and one saving
              grace for them could be the fact that Calderon has gone.<br><br>If
              Florentino Perez wins the presidential elections, as is predicted at
              the moment, it is highly unlikely that he will want this deal to go
              through, not because he does not want Ronaldo, but because he will want
              to start a fresh.<br><br>Perez will not want to cash in on a deal made
              by Calderon, and for that reason, Manchester United could be saved,
              although for how long is anybody's guess.</p>
