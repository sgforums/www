              Manchester United talisman Cristiano Ronaldo has dropped the biggest hint yet that he will stay at Old Trafford next season.
              
              Once again, Ronaldo has been the centre of attention this week after former Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon claimed the best player in the world would arrive at the Bernabeu this summer. 
              
              Sir Alex Ferguson decided not to respond, beyond the tongue-in-cheek statement that clubs 'find it easy to get players off us don't they?'. 
              
              However, Ronaldo has offered his own assessment of the situation. 
              
              With three Premier League clubs in the Champions League semi-finals for the third successive year, there is no doubt where the power in European football lies at present. 
              
              And it seems Ronaldo may opt to remain at Old Trafford to further his medal collection. 
              
              "It is a great feeling and I love to play here," the Portugal superstar told Setanta Sports. 
              
              "I am very happy here. I want to win more trophies here. At the moment I think I am at the right club. 
              
              "And I want to win trophies next season as well." 
              
              United must tackle Arsenal in the Champions League semi-final, their first two-legged meeting with English opposition. 
              
              "It is not luck that there are three English teams in the semi final of the Champions League," observed Ronaldo. 
              
              "In my opinion it is because the Premier League is the toughest league and the most competitive league with the best players." 
              
              First, United must tackle Everton in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final and then Portsmouth at Old Trafford on Wednesday as they look to consolidate their position at the Premier League summit. 
              
              A pair of victories would keep United on course for an unprecedented quintuple, an aim Ronaldo admits will be tough to complete, but one he does not rule out. 
              
              "We have this opportunity, but it will be difficult to win the five trophies," he added. 
              
              "It is not impossible; we have to play against Everton and that will be a tough game, but everyone knows if we win we are in the final again."

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has played
              a straight bat to former Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon’s latest
              attempt to unsettle Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Calderon, who was forced to step down from the post in January, has
              long been the man at the head of Madrid’s desire to lure Ronaldo away
              from Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Last summer’s interminable saga ended – for now – with the Portugal
              winger opting to stay put, but conjecture continues that the end of
              this season will see the seemingly inevitable come to fruition.</p>
              <p>Calderon this week added fuel to those flames by claiming that a
              deal was already in place to take the World Player of the Year to the
              Spanish capital.</p>
              <p>“That has come from a man who is obsolete now, he’s been buried hasn’t he?” retorted Ferguson.</p>
              <p>“He’s just trying to cause trouble. I think he’s trying to stir
              things up for the new president, along the lines of ‘I’ve set it up,
              now you deliver’.</p>
              <p>“But I’m not worried about it. I’m happy with Ronaldo’s situation
              here. You’re never going to stop that kind of speculation from Madrid
              in this game.</p>
              <p>“It goes on and on but we know that.”</p>
