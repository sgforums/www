              <div><span><strong>Celtic midfielder Barry Robson claims the Hoops players need to be "in the faces" of their Manchester United opponents when the two clubs meet in their </strong><strong>Champions</strong><strong> League rematch at Parkhead on Wednesday night.</strong> </span></div>

              <div></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>The Scottish champions lost 3-0 in the Group E game at Old Trafford last month but warmed up for the return match with a convincing 2-0 win over Hearts at Tynecastle to go back to the top of the Clydesdale Bank Premier League.</p>
              <p>Robson was voted man of the match in a game Celtic won with surprising ease after Shaun Maloney's intelligent strike inside seven minutes, when he quickly returned a punched clearance from Hearts keeper Janos Balogh, gave the visitors the lead.</p>
              <p>Celtic defender Gary Caldwell appeared to use his hand before scoring from close range in the 20th minute.</p>
              <p>Robson turned his attentions to the visit of the Champions League holders, who are hot favourites to complete the double over Gordon Strachan's side.</p>
              <p>The Scotland midfielder knows United will offer a much stiffer test than the one presented to them in Gorgie but offered his own solution to the challenge.</p>
              <p>"We know it's going to be a hard game against Manchester United," Robson said. "They are a good side but we are a good side as well. "We are at home and we want to put on a show for the fans and for ourselves.</p>
              <p>"We have done it before against Manchester United, although they are a better side now than they were a few years ago. "We need to make sure we do get in their faces when we come out the traps and try and use our ability to the best we can to cause an upset."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Michael Carrick believes the prospect of becoming history-makers will ensure Manchester United do not ease up in their quest for Champions League glory this term.</strong></p>
              <p>United head to Celtic on Wednesday night for the second part of their Battle of Britain duel knowing victory at Parkhead will effectively seal a place in the knockout stages with two games to spare.</p>
              <p>Even for the holders it would be an impressive feat, offering Sir Alex Ferguson an opportunity to rest some of his key men for the last-day visit of Aalborg if the final standings in Group E have been decided after the Red Devils' trip to Villarreal on November 25.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>England 'keeper Ben Foster is expected to be handed his Champions League debut by Ferguson, who has decided to rotate United's keepers to give the younger ones some experience while helping first-choice Edwin van der Sar retain some freshness.</p>
              <p>Three men are also fighting for one place at right-back, with Wes Brown expected to get the nod against Gordon Strachan's men providing he overcomes an ankle injury and the presence of Foster and Brown in the United side would bolster the English contingent in visiting ranks.</p>
              <p>Although the atmosphere at Celtic is undoubtedly one of the best in Europe United had succeeded in quietening the home fans on their last visit two years ago until Shunsuke Nakamura curled home the hosts' winner near the end.</p>
              <p>"There will be an extra little bit of something to the game, there always is in matches like this," said Carrick. "It will be a phenomenal atmosphere but as players you can't really get caught up in it. "The noise was incredible last time but we played very well for an hour and it went pretty quiet.</p>
              <p>"If we play like that again, I am sure the same thing will happen, although we have to take a couple of chances this time. "We are in a good position in the group. It would be good if we could tie it up and relax a bit more knowing we were safely through."</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1083126" rel="1083126_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1083126/Bullish-Strachan-My-Bhoys-capable-upsetting-United.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Gordon Strachan has labelled tonight’s crucial Champions League showdown with masterful </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> as mission possible for his gritty </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Celtic</strong></span><strong> stars.</strong></p>
              <p>The SPL champions must win at Parkhead to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages for the third successive season. Strachan’s selection is again severely restricted by injuries to strikers Georgios Samaras and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and defender Glenn Loovens but, despite Sir Alex Ferguson’s team not even bothering to train at Parkhead last night, the Celtic manager struck a bullish note.</p>
              <p>Can we beat Manchester United?’ asked Strachan. ‘It is possible, with the crowd right behind us. ‘We can also get beaten, everybody knows that. But the players here will not be found wanting for spirit or determination, that’s a certainty.</p>
              <p>‘Yes, we know we are not as technically gifted as United. But there are crisis points over the course of a season and, every time over my three years here, the players have answered every question asked of them in terms of character.</p>
              <p>'I don’t think losing at Old Trafford a couple of weeks ago has spooked the players in any way. I feel the Celtic players are looking forward to it and will relish the occasion.</p>
              <p>‘European nights are fantastic at Celtic Park. Whatever happens in our careers as managers and coaches, it will not get any better than European nights here. ‘This is a magical place and throughout the generations we have managed to create<br>memories for the fans. There have been some special, special nights here that I will never forget and I’m sure the players feel the same way.</p>
              <p>‘Each generation of Celtic fans has them to savour and we hope we can add to that proud history.’ Shunsuke Nakamura delivered one of those moments two years ago with the free-kick that defeated United and left Sir Alex red-faced.</p>
              <p>Strachan feels if there is to be a repeat, he needs a hero to step up to the plate tonight. ‘Naka can produce something special and so can Aiden McGeady and Shaun Maloney,’ he said. ‘But being a great player means doing it at this level. Producing magic moments counts in these games and no matter what Nakamura does, he will be remembered in Celtic folklore for that free-kick winner over Manchester United.’</p>
              <p>Realistically, with Villarreal ahead already by six points, Celtic could be locked in a UEFA Cup battle with Aalborg, who entertain the Spanish outfit tonight. Strachan would not reveal if Samaras or Vennegoor of Hesselink will be fit for the trip to Denmark on November 25, not that he was for throwing in any towels yesterday.</p>
              <p>‘We would have to win this to have any chance of the Champions League last 16,’ he said. ‘But we won’t give up. You cannot give up. ‘We will put in the same amount of effort as we did at Old Trafford and try to put some pressure on Manchester United and hope to get the breaks.’</p>

              <h1>Manchester United's Alex Ferguson says he'll flip a coin over keeper role at Celtic</h1>
              <h2>Ben Foster will have to wait until hours before kick-off to find out if he will make his Champions League debut on Wednesday night, after Edwin van der Sar was rested for Manchester United's trip to Celtic.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/09/22/SirFergalot460.jpg" alt="Sir Alex Ferguson" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Although United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted last week that he may pick Foster, he said on Tuesday night that he would leave it late to decide whether to go for Tomasz Kuszczak, the Polish goalkeeper who played last Wednesday against West Ham.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "I haven't made up my mind about who will start. It's a toss-of-the-coin sort of decision. I really don't know. But whoever doesn't play at Celtic will play against Queens Park Rangers [in the Carling Cup next Tuesday]. Edwin will be available for Saturday against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"We have two outstanding young goalkeepers who deserve opportunities like this, to give them a taste of a tremendous European atmosphere."</p>
              <p>Foster, who has been linked with a move to Tottenham, suggested last week that he may have to leave United again to progress his career.</p>
              <p>He was signed for £1 million from Stoke in July 2005, and if he plays at Celtic Park it will be only his second senior appearance for United in three years.</p>
              <p>If Foster is given the nod, the manager is confident the 25-year-old will pass the test with flying colours. Ferguson said: "From what I've seen in training, and from what I saw of him [on loan] at Watford, I would say he's England's next No 1."</p>
              <p>Foster, whose first two seasons were spent on loan at Watford, suffered a cruciate ligament injury that kept him out for most of last season. He has grown frustrated at his lack of opportunities since returning in March, and said last week: "I want to be playing football, that's the main thing for me. As a goalkeeper at my age now, that's when I need to be kicking on. I need to get more games under my belt. I'm not sure what the gaffer is thinking. If he wants to send me out on loan, it's up to him, but I want to kick on here."</p>
              <p>Defender Wes Brown (ankle) is ruled out and Gary Neville rested, leaving Rafael de Silva to come in at right back. United will also be without the injured midfield duo of Paul Scholes and Owen Hargreaves.</p>
              <p>England midfielder Hargreaves is set to visit a specialist this week to see how his knee tendonitis problem is progressing and to decide the next stage of his treatment. The club have not decided whether he will definitely need to undergo surgery.</p>
              <p>Celtic manager Gordon Strachan, whose side beat United two years ago courtesy of a stunning free-kick from Shunsuke Nakamura, does not believe an overly aggressive approach is the way to unsettle the European Cup holders.</p>
              <p>He said: "What does more aggression mean? You can't kick lumps out of each other, and quite rightly so. It's not like 40 years ago when Celtic played Leeds United, when you could kick 10 bells out of each other.</p>
              <p>"You can't get away with that these days. Fortunately, they have brought in some civilised rules since then. We have to be careful with our passing, we have to get close to their players and when we get the ball we have to give them a problem.</p>
              <p>"There has to be special moments from some of our players to score, unless we get a freak goal. It will be a special night. First of all we have to perform, then we have to have a wee bit of luck, maybe have the decisions going for us and the players all playing to their maximum."</p>
              <p>Celtic lost 3-0 at Old Trafford two weeks ago, with two disputed goals, as United are level with Villarreal at the top of Group E on seven points. Celtic and Aalborg have one point.</p>
