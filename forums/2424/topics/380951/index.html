              <p>What if United were to sell the naming rights to Old Trafford? Would any of the United fans here mind the name change? How would you feel?</p>
              <p>Personally, I won't mind one bit... I understand that its a new way to generate more revenue for the club... So its fine with me i guess... Moreover, unlike most clubs... United have another name much better don't they, and that is "The Theatre of Dreams"</p>
              <p>These days, its very hard for fans to accept a stadium name change after being used to it for like years and decades... So the best way is to do it when they have a new stadium like Arsenal... Their fans would have made a lot of fuss had they tried to change the Highbury name then... But a new stadium wouldn't create so much trouble...</p>
              <p>So if Old Trafford suddenly becomes known as "The Nike Stadium", or something else, I guess it wouldn't be so bad right...</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, they only talk about support in spirit but not in the real dollar sense... If they are true fans, they will support the club going forward... But fans are basically fans... They want their club to do well and yet can't accept they have to give up certain things to achieved more for the future...</p>
              <p>Football is moving forward in a rapid speed and the clubs who take the step forward will be the club not left behind... We just look at the Nottingham Forest, a once double winners of the European cup... And once a power house of English football... Their ground is still called the City Ground today, never changed all these years... Their stadium have not gone through any improvement, still 30,000 capacity only... Things just stayed the way it was as no one move it in the forward direction... Therefore in time, they fall behind and new powers emerge... Then there is also Ipswich...</p>
              <p>United were once far behind Liverpool in terms of almost everything... From trophies to transfer fee... Then things started to changed... United took the brave step of going forward and became a PLC while Pool remain where they were because they felt comfortable since they were still winning so never thought of moving forward... In time, United could match Pool in the transfer market given they became richer due to actions taken to move the club forward... and soon it was the trophies as well...</p>
              <p>Clubs who don't continue to improve themselves and keep up with the times... Very soon, they will realise everyone is moving forward while they remain in a standstill position...or worse, fall behind others...</p>
              <p>I believed if we were to ask 100 Pool supporters if their stadium name was to change to K-Mart or something else and do away with Anfield but they will win the league title these last few years... I belief most will grab with both hands...</p>

              <p>true, but if the naming rights generate $$$ that ultimately lower the ticket prices, or more impact to the fans, i think it will be a popular choice.</p>
