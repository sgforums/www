            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reserves: United 6 Stockport 1<br><br><img src="http://img65.imageshack.us/img65/5861/img10215986478jpgobjiiptt9.jpg"><br><br>Club captain Gary Neville completed 60 minutes of the ReservesÂ’ Manchester Senior Cup win over Stockport County, posting his first action since March.</strong><br><br>The 32-year-old defender enjoyed a stern test in a fiercely-fought local derby, which United won 6-1 through goals from Chris Eagles, Sean Evans and braces from Febian Brandy and Dong Fangzhuo.<br><br>Aside from one or two hints of ring-rustiness Â– predictable after seven months on the sidelines Â– Neville looked solid throughout, and did well in the centre of defence alongside Jonny Evans.<br><br>Eagles put United ahead after 18 minutes with a superb free-kick, lining up his strike from 25 yards before curling it high into the corner of the goal.<br><br>Immediately after the restart, Neville was cautioned. He firstly slipped and caught a County attacker and then, as he tried to get to his feet, caught another with a late challenge and entered the book.<br><br>The England international was involved again as County drew level through Dan Ellis 10 minutes, sliding in with Neville and just managing to convert a teasing left-wing cross.<br><br>United immediately pressed to regain their lead, and came extremely close in the latter stages of the half. Eagles clipped in a lovely cross to pick out the onrushing David Gray, but his header was straight at goalkeeper Chris Adamson, while Sean Evans was desperately unlucky to see his 35-yard volley land on the roof of AdamsonÂ’s net moments later.<br><br>The left winger didnÂ’t have to wait long to get on the scoresheet, however. Less than two minutes of the second period had passed when Michael BarnesÂ’ corner fell to Evans around 15 yards out, and he lashed the ball into the far top corner.<br><br>Neville was replaced by Richard Eckersley after 57 minutes, and five minutes later United were 3-1 up. Again it came from a setpiece, with Dong lashing home a slightly deflected 25-yard free kick for his first competitive Reserves goal.<br><br>A fourth goal came just 70 seconds later. DongÂ’s pass for Sean Evans was overhit, but the winger did superbly to rob the defender and square a cross for Febian Brandy, who slotted home with great aplomb.<br><br>The diminutive forward fired home again with a cool finish after more good build-up play from Eagles, before Dong fired home from 15 yards with 16 minutes remaining.<br><br>An emphatic scoreline in the end, which was just reward for a dominant second-half display from United. The undoubted highlight of the evening, however, was the welcome return of United's influential club captain.<br><br>United: Heaton, Gray, J Evans, Neville (R Eckersley, 57), Simpson, Lee, Barnes,<br>Eagles, Dong, Brandy (Welbeck, 74), S Evans.<br>Subs not used: Zieler, Chester, Bryan.</div>
