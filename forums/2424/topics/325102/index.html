              <p><strong>After United's 1-0 win over Orlando Pirates on Tuesday,
              ManUtd.com journalist Nick Coppack asked Sir Alex to assess the
              contributions of the team's younger players. Here's what he had to say:</strong><br><br>"Chris
              Eagles and Lee Martin haven’t played enough football over the last two
              or three years and they’ve come to an important time in their careers.<br><br>"Lee,
              in particular, has been very unfortunate in the loan spells he’s had.
              He’s picked up a couple of long-term injuries. Of course, at that age
              these kids want to play football all the time.<br><br>"Meanwhile, Chris
              Eagles had the opportunity to go on loan last season and didn’t want
              to. Because of that, and the form of the team, he was dependent on
              Reserves football, which, at his age and the progress he’s got to make,
              isn’t enough for him. <br><br>"I have to find out more about those
              players and that’s why I bring them on tour and it’s why I played them
              [against Orlando Pirates]. <br><br>"As for Jonny Evans, he went to
              Sunderland in January and did very well. In fact, I think he was very
              instrumental in them staying up. Jonny's a very good footballer,
              who reads the game well and has good composure. He’s got a career in
              football – there’s no question about that. <br><br>"Darron Gibson went
              to Wolves last season and injuries, as well as a family bereavement,
              derailed his time there. He needs to get football – he’s a big,
              powerful lad with good feet and he has a chance. <br><br>"Then there's
              Fraizer Campbell, who spent time at Hull City last season and had an
              incredible season. He has to improve in certain aspects of his game,
              but he has a chance as well.</p>
              <p>"Concentration is one of the vital components of making the step across
              the line to be a regular first-team player. You saw the composure that
              Rooney and Scholes brought to the team [on Tuesday] and that tells you
              the vast difference between a young player and an experienced player
              like Scholes. His pass in the final minutes of the game to Rooney… I
              would have paid money to see that pass if that was the only thing I saw
              in the game. <br><br>"We often under-rate the value of concentration
              with footballers. They can practise all day long, they can have
              fantastic ability but if they don’t have the concentration to produce
              final passes in important moments then they’re never going to make it."</p>
