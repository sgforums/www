              Michael Carrick says it would mean more for Manchester United to secure the Premier League-Champions League double this season than last term.
              
              After confirming superiority over their domestic rivals for the third season on the trot last weekend, United are preparing for Wednesday's eagerly anticipated showdown with Barcelona in Rome. 
              
              No side has retained the European Cup since AC Milan in 1990 and, until the Red Devils did it this season, no holder of the trophy had even reached the final a year later since Juventus did it in 1997. 
              
              Such rare occurrences leave Carrick in no doubt victory on May 27 would elevate the current United side into the pantheon of great teams. 
              
              "If we did the double again this year, it would be more special," said the England midfielder. 
              
              "It was almost unbelievable to do it last year. To do it two years on the bounce would suggest we are a great team. 
              
              "Teams have won Champions Leagues in the past but if you do it alongside winning your domestic league, twice, it really suggests you have something good going." 
              
              It is that aura of being a super club which so many of Carlos Tevez's team-mates hope will be a persuasive force to keep the Argentina star at Old Trafford on a permanent basis once his two-year loan deal expires in two games' time. 
              
              Winning next week would clearly be a big help as well, reviving the jubilation experienced in Moscow, the drug Carrick cannot get enough of. 
              
              "The feeling of winning drives you," said the former Tottenham player. 
              
              "That feeling when you have been successful and you are going to lift the trophy becomes addictive. 
              
              "Nothing can replace that feeling. The buzz after Moscow last season was incredible. 
              
              "I would say if we do it again this year it would be even better, just because we have done it before and know how tough it is to win it." 
              
              For all his preference to play a strong side at Hull on Sunday so there will be no D-day complaints from the north-east as the relegation battle is concluded, few of Ferguson's likely squad will make the journey to East Yorkshire. 
              
              Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand need a game so could be involved, while Cristiano Ronaldo will want to play to have a chance of securing the golden boot in his personal duel with Nicolas Anelka. 
              
              Nani should also start, although he has been used sparingly since his awful first-half display against Tottenham last month. 
              
              The only other senior figure expected to play is Darren Fletcher, who knows he must watch from the stands at the Stadio Olimpico, a harsh punishment indeed for a perfectly fair tackle on Cesc Fabregas.
