              <p><strong>Jonny Evans has admitted he must improve at </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> this season or face the probability of it being his last.</strong></p>
              <p>The Northern Ireland international has certainly started well enough, retaining his place for the record win over Arsenal after stepping in for the injured Rio Ferdinand in the previous week's win against Tottenham.</p>
              <p>But Evans knows he must maintain his current form in order to avoid a repeat of last season's disappointments. "Of the three seasons since I came back from Sunderland, the last one was my most difficult," he said. "I didn't hit the form I wanted. I went away and thought maybe I have another year, if I had another season like that I am sure the manager wouldn't want me around.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't playing consistently to a good enough standard for Manchester United so I have gone back to basics and worked hard."</p>
              <p>Evans was confident he would get that extra year and Ferguson would not make a judgement based on a single poor season. The departures of Wes Brown and John O'Shea to Sunderland were a further hint in that direction, although Evans realised he could not afford to take anything for granted.</p>
              <p>"The manager never said anything to me and I never went to see him," he said. "I was pretty confident the manager wouldn't get rid of me. I have always thought he has a bit of faith in me. Maybe you do have the odd doubt but I thought it would have been unfair if I had left, considering the two seasons I had before.</p>
              <p>"Last year wasn't a total disaster. There were times when I did feel good and others where I felt I needed that level of consistency every week.</p>
              <p>"I was on holiday when I heard John and Wes were in talks with Sunderland and would be leaving. It did make me think there was room but no matter who the manager gets rid of, or signs, there are so many players who can step into so many different positions it is crazy.</p>
              <p>"If you are not in his plans he will move you on. If you are here you have a great chance of being involved."</p>
