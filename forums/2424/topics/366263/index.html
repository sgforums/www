              <p class="photoDesc"> Manchester United have completed the signing of Wigan winger Antonio Valencia, with the player describing the move as a "dream''.</p>
              <p>The Ecuador international has been tracked by United for the last 12 months and new Wigan boss Roberto Martinez has been unable to persuade him to stay at the DW Stadium.</p>
              <p>United have not disclosed the fee they have paid to the Latics, though it is thought to be around £16m, after signing the player on a four-year contract.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old is the first player signed by Sir Alex Ferguson as they look to replace Cristiano Ronaldo following his £80m move to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"Joining Manchester United is a dream come true for me,'' he told United's official website. "I have enjoyed my time at Wigan, but I am thrilled to have the chance to challenge for the biggest honours in club football here.</p>
              <p>"Playing in front of 76,000 fans alongside players like Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs will be an amazing experience. I can't wait to get started.''</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: "Antonio is a player we have admired for some time now, having spent the last two years in the Premier League with Wigan,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"I am sure his pace and ability will make a significant contribution to the team.''</p>

              <p>Antonio Valencia left Wigan Athletic today to join Manchester United
              for an undisclosed fee and has thanked the club for his time there, and
              hopes that they will at least benefit financially from his departure.<br><br>"I hope the fans at Wigan can understand that I am an ambitious guy and
              a chance like this might never come again for me," he told Athletic's official website.<br><br>"I
              am happy that the club has benefited from the move financially because
              I owe Wigan such a lot. I have had a great time here."<br><br>Valencia
              also expressed a certain measure of regret at the fact that he would
              not get the opportunity to work with new Latics manager Roberto
              Martinez, a man whom he clearly respects as a <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2009/06/30/1356262/antonio-valencia-bids-farewell-to-wigan-athletic-fans#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">coach</span></span></a>.<br><br>"It was Paul
              Jewell who first took a chance on me and gave me the opportunity to
              play in England," the player added.<br><br>"Chris Hutchings and Steve Bruce helped me to progress
              and it is a shame I won't get the chance to work with Roberto because
              he is a great young manager and I'm sure his style of football would
              have suited me."<br><br>And the winger also wished the club all the best in the future, concluding,<br>"I hope and pray that he will help Wigan progress because this is a great club that really gave me my chance."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Valencia cant replace Ronaldo lar, he is his own man and happen to play Ronaldo position. But one thing abt Valencia is that he is pacy and a workhorse like Park, who will track back to defend and chase for the ball, unlike Ronaldo</p>
