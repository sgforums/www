              <h1>Calderón Admits Ronaldo Defeat?</h1>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">The ongoing speculation regarding Cristiano Ronaldo’s future looks
              set to draw to a conclusion, with Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon
              admitting that the Portugal international “will continue to play at
              Manchester United”. </span></h2>
              <p>In what has been an endless and fierce saga since the season’s end in
              May, Ronaldo had been tipped to leave Old Trafford in pursuit of a
              “dream” move to the Bernabeu.  <br><br>Quotes attributed to the 23-year
              old and his family have done little to quell reports of a move, though
              Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United have refuted all talk of
              Ronaldo’s exit. <br><br>The Old Trafford club also reported Real to
              FIFA in the belief that the Spanish side had broken legislation with
              regards to tapping up a player via the media, though no action was
              taken by the game’s governing body. <br><br>Calderon, however, appears
              to have accepted defeat in his pursuit of the majestic forward, who
              netted an incredible 42 times last season for The Red Devils, though he
              left the door open for a move in the future should Ronaldo’s current
              employers decide to cash in. <br><br>"Ronaldo has stated that it would
              be a dream to move here, that he would be excited to come to Real
              Madrid but it is a desire of the player which can not be fulfilled
              without Manchester's assent," Calderon told Marca.<br><br>"Manchester
              must first agree to it. Once they decide to sell him and tell us, we
              talk about a possible transfer. But as of today that is not happening,"
              Calderon said. <br> <br>"Theoretically we still have some time. There
              are still two months left of the transfer until the end of August and
              if Manchester get in touch with Real Madrid and makes an offer, we can
              talk," he added. <br><br>Ronaldo is yet to discuss his plans with
              Manchester United officials, though reports suggest he is set to meet
              with chief executive David Gill in Switzerland next week. <br><br>With
              the club having arranged for Ronaldo to undergo surgery on a
              troublesome ankle injury, the player is set to miss out on the team’s
              pre-season tour of South Africa. <br><br>The Premiership and Champions
              League champions have slammed speculation that the two clubs had agreed
              a fee for former Sporting Lisbon man, describing the stories as "utter
              nonsense and totally laughable” while repeating that the player is “not
              for sale”.</p>

              <p><br>What comment? Only playing for Real will be like a dream come true... But to date he has not said he want to leave United yet... So nvm lah... If he stays, and play well... people won't mind... But to love him like the way Cantona, keane, Beck, Schmeichel or even Rooney... it won't be so easy lah...</p>
