The Bayern Munich and England midfielder has been linked with a move to the Premiership leaders since his strong performances at last summer's World Cup. </strong><br><br>United's initial approaches for Hargreaves were rebuffed by Bayern, but it is thought they might be willing to do business at the end of the season. And the 26-year-old has outlined his excitement at the prospect of moving to the Old Trafford club.<br><br>'United are the only team I want to join,' he told the News of the World. 'They have invested so much time and energy in me. 'It's very rare to see a transfer drag on like this. 'A football team is a puzzle with different pieces and and you need to find the right pieces and the right mix. 'United believe I am the final piece in their puzzle and that is an honour for me.'<br><br>Hargreaves admits the protracted negotiations have put him in a tricky position in Germany, but insists his determination to seal a 'dream' move remains undimmed. He added: 'It has been a difficult political situation. My position is very different and I couldn't compare it to any other player.<br><br>'It is not as though I am chasing money in Greece or Spain. There is a reason for me wanting to join United - I play for England and my family are from the north west. 'I love Bayern Munich. I have grown up in Germany but I'm the only England player never to have played in England and Manchester United want to take me home.<br><br>'That prospect is a dream, especially when you look at the United team and the football they play. 'Once you are with the club you are connected with them for life.'</div>

The England midfielder has his heart set on an Â£18million summer switch from Bayern Munich.</strong><br><br>He said: Â“Wherever I go, I keep bumping into people telling me not to go to United. "I was at a training camp in Dubai and had people saying Â‘Go to Liverpool, not UnitedÂ’ or whichever team they like itÂ’s up in the air.<br><br>"At Bayern, IÂ’ve had people say Â‘You play here, you stay hereÂ’. Â“Those who run the club have had a few words with me about joining United. Â“I havenÂ’t discussed it with Ottmar Hitzfeld because weÂ’ve been involved in a lot of games and he has only recently come back to take charge of the club.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sure there will be some conversations, though. IÂ’m expecting it. Â“But people have to realise most of my family come from the north west, around the Bolton area. Â“IÂ’m also the only England player who has never played in the Premiership. ItÂ’s what I want to do.Â”<br><br></div>

Since they both can play as central/attacking midfielder as long as Hargreaves do his work as holding midfielder.<br><br>Besides, Scholes only got a few years left before he retire and it will be pretty interesting to see how Hargreaves and Carrick partner together.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think there would be any problem having Hargreaves in the team. Fergie, being a seasoned campaigner knows that most players may need some time to adapt not just to the EPL but also to the team style of play.<br><br>Paul Scholes is not getting any younger and could start to lose his form anytime from now or within the next 2 yrs. Anyway, even if he doesn't, it alway good to have able replacements like Carrick or Hargreaves as cover. These 2 and maybe even Scholes are more timid and obedient players who i guess wouldn't create a fuss if they are place on the bench by Fergie. But with the number of games they are playing each season, they will definitely get opportunities.<br><br>Anyway, like i said... Scholes may not last very long anymore and he could also come on as a useful sub, should those 2 take over. He is one who has good experience and skill but may not last the full 90 mins game in time to come...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think he will overwrite Carrick if he moves over to Old Trafford.

Afterall, Bayern Munich is one of the best teams around. As for Carrick, I guess he is still young and inexperienced on a bigger stage compared to Spurs.<br><br>Assuming Hargreaves comes over and overwrites Carrick..<br>By the time Scholes retire..

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>STEVE McCLAREN recently described Owen Hargreaves as Â‘the glueÂ’ which holds England together Â— and likened him to Roy Keane. With such high praise ringing in his ears, Hargreaves knows now is not the time to come unstuck. England must win in Israel on Saturday Â— and the Keano approach is exactly what is required.</strong><br><br>Alex Ferguson clearly agrees with McClarenÂ’s assessment of Hargreaves. That is why Fergie is trying to take the Bayern Munich star to Manchester United to fill the gap left by legendary midfielder Keane, now Sunderland boss.<br><br>Hargreaves knows what he is doing. He won the Champions League as a 19-year-old and has done the double with Bayern in three of the last four seasons. Big games and big challenges are right up his street.<br><br>Hargreaves, 26, said: Â“Keane was one of the most influential players of the last 10 years and such a crucial player for Manchester United. Â“He was one of the reasons why they enjoyed so much success and to be compared to someone of that stature is fantastic.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s important to win the ball in the middle of the park and try and get it forward in any game you play. I think IÂ’ve shown I can do that. Â“But although I play the same position as Roy Keane did, we are very different. He had his qualities and I have mine. Â“When you go on the pitch, the most important thing is the performance. But some people are more vocal than others. Â“At times, IÂ’m relatively easy going and relaxed even though I get frustrated and want to win as much as anyone.Â”</div>

Give me O Shea anytime of the day over Richardson. Whenever Richardson replaced anyone, I will keep my fingers crossed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  He can't make it yet....</div>
