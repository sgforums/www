              <p>well, I differ a bit la..</p>
              <p>tevez, after coming back from bolivia, a 6-1 dubbing, but he still fought on. He could have done much better, but he is never the one to lead the line so too much expectations on him. But credit to his work ethics..</p>
              <p>fletcher was the mom no doubt...</p>
              <p>Ronaldo, tracking back is never his strongest ability...</p>
              <p>as a whole, MU played below their normal standards. Midfield was rather weak, defence was a mixup with Joshea and GaryN changing position constantly.</p>
              <p>Hopefully against Porto, we stepped it up, a simliar scoreline will be sucide.</p>

              <p>This match was probably the best EPL match I have watch this whole season man...</p>
              <p>Its not because it was Man Utd playing but it was like a roller-coaster ride from the start to the finish... The emotions within the match was like swinging all over the place...</p>
              <p>The pressure at the start of the match means United needed to win and after starting nervously, they took the lead with a brilliant free-kick from Ronaldo... This brought joy but when Villa equalized... it quickly became disappointment... then when Villa took the lead, I guess an upset was inevitable cos Villa had played very well on this day and the United line-up was weak especially the defence... But when Ronaldo equalized out of no where... I guess you can say although they had drop another 2 points, but a draw was still a satisfactory result considering the line-up they had.</p>
              <p>But then came the moment of the match...  In injury time a kid whom even most United fans have not heard of let alone seen him play... came out of nowhere and pop in the winner in such fashion... What a game! What a game! and what a strike too!</p>
              <p>All I can say after the match has ended almost 10 hrs ago now is... what a debut for a 17-year-old rookie striker... An injury time goal on his debut... The way is was achieved... What more can you ask for...</p>
              <p>Last night I was so full of emotions that I couldn't even get to sleep... lol... And I can recalled clearly the only other ending that can top this to my memories was the 1999 CL final... Seriously, thats how high I rated this... Not even winning the CL final last season brought such an excitement to me...</p>
              <p>For United, it was very important that they won last night... Or their confidence could get worse... And with Vidic, Rooney, Rio and possibly Rafael all back by next week... It does help a lot.</p>
              <p>The name is Federico Macheda... What a moment for this young man, what a strike...</p>

              <p>This match was probably the best EPL match I have watch this
              whole season man...</p>
              <p>Its not because it was Man Utd playing but it was like a
              roller-coaster ride from the start to the finish... The emotions
              within the match was like swinging all over the place...</p>
              <p>The pressure at the start of the match means United needed to
              win and after starting nervously, they took the lead with a
              brilliant free-kick from Ronaldo... This brought joy but when Villa
              equalized... it quickly became disappointment... then when Villa
              took the lead, I guess an upset was inevitable cos Villa had played
              very well on this day and the United line-up was weak especially
              the defence... But when Ronaldo equalized out of no where... I
              guess you can say although they had drop another 2 points, but a
              draw was still a satisfactory result considering the line-up they
              had.</p>
              <p>But then came the moment of the match...  In injury time a
              kid whom even most United fans have not heard of let alone seen him
              play... came out of nowhere and pop in the winner in such
              fashion... What a game! What a game! and what a strike too!</p>
              <p>All I can say after the match has ended almost 10 hrs ago
              now is... what a debut for a 17-year-old rookie striker... An
              injury time goal on his debut... The way is was achieved... What
              more can you ask for...</p>
              <p>Last night I was so full of emotions that I couldn't even get to
              sleep... lol... And I can recalled clearly the only other ending
              that can top this to my memories was the 1999 CL final...
              Seriously, thats how high I rated this... Not even winning the CL
              final last season brought such an excitement to me...</p>
              <p>For United, it was very important that they won last night... Or
              their confidence could get worse... And with Vidic, Rooney, Rio and
              possibly Rafael all back by next week... It does help a lot.</p>
              <p>The name is Federico Macheda... What a moment for this young
              man, what a strike...</p>

              <p>i couldnt watch the match but i just saw a clip of macheda's goal.. goosebumps all over just like that 1999 CL Finals.. INSANE! LOLs. Brilliant goal..</p>

              <p>Kudos to Fergie once again , for daring to try out newbies for the vital match . Gerguson seemed to know newbies' hunger ..... I saw a not so desire United team against Fulham and Liverpool , Fergie brought in somebody who is hungry , very hungry .</p>

              <p><br>When you see the line-up at the start, I felt this was going to be very difficult... The defence were totally gone apart from only Evra... who was also a short player. The 2 goals that Villa scored were from free headers that would normally get cleared away if Rio and Vidic were playing... The good news here is United played with more than a number of 2nd team squad players and they still manage to win a very much improved Villa side...</p>
              <p>Coming back from a goal down with 10 mins to play is of course a great result. Most would probably expected a draw as the best they could hope for given the time limit if not a lost. Of course the better news is Rio, Vidic, Rooney, Berbatov, Rafael could all be back very soon maybe even by the next match... The stability to the defence could return by then too...</p>
              <p>Pool has not been under lots of pressure before, all along they have only been chasing and hoping... But now that they have got to the top and lost it, I belief they will really start to feel the pressure from now on in every match... their players have not been through this phase before... If you thought they were great against Villa in their previous game, then I guess they were not so great against Fulham...</p>
              <p>The thing here I feel is, this win against Villa isn't just about 3 points... A lost could have started the collapse of their season as confidence could suffer a great deal and the pressure would get too great but instead now confidence could have been boosted with this result or at least they still stand a decent chance at the title. Pools players confidence could be effected too with this result. Maybe had United not won, they would be more confident going into their next match... Now the pressure will build on them.</p>
              <p>I think its hard for you to understand cos you are not a United fan as this coming after 2 straight defeats and staring a 3rd with just 10 mins to go... Then from nowhere an unknown 17 yrs old kid comes up with a wonder strike in injury time... From despair to delight... thats why the ecstasy among United fans... Simply overwhelming...</p>

              <p>yeh seriously, the macheda goal brought back the wonderful years of beckham, sheringham, solkjaer, of course, giggs, scholes still...and also butt, andy cole, jaap stam etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Non united fans would find it hard to comprehend this sort of joy cos the last british team to have done the 1999 CL final win was united. and 9 years on after that triumph, united still has been the last british team to do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Doesnt mean if liverpool thrash villa 5-0, means man u must thrash them 10-0. What's more.....so many second stringers. This sort of fightback spirit is the stuff of champions. But then again, liverpool are also playing like champions now but i guess they may have to settle for 2nd place this year. Well, still a great achievement cos this is their best ever finish in 20 years.</p>
