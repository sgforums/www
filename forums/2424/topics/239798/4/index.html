The Manchester United manager believes the last-gasp win over Liverpool at Anfield was a "massive result" in the Barclays Premiership title race.</strong><br><br>"Liverpool will feel very unlucky and they deserve to. It was a fantastic result. We had a lot of narrow escapes and Liverpool upset our rhythm. The Scot is still not ready to celebrate the title however. "There is a 12-point difference but I don't think anything is impossible in modern-day football.<br><br>United midfielder Scholes was sent off with four minutes left after swinging an arm at Xabi Alonso and will miss three games. Ferguson told MUTV: " I've seen it, he's lifted his hand and you can't do that. I think the referee [Martin Atkinson] got one right in terms of intent."<br><br>Striker Wayne Rooney hobbled off clutching his thigh after a high tackle by Jamie Carragher. "We have to get him scanned but it's a bad tackle around the knee. We will have to judge it with the game [Lillle in the Champions League] coming up in midweek," said the United boss.<br><br>Liverpool trudged away knowing they should have won but did not have the firepower to turn dominance into goals. Gone is Liverpool's 30-match unbeaten home league record, stretching back to October 2005.<br><br>United fans were still contemplating missing Scholes for three matches when O'Shea appeared in the box to fire home a rebound from the arms of Jose Reina, following a curling Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick.<br><br>Liverpool slowly took command of the first half, and in the second, dominated for long spells. But they lacked the final touch and United were always a danger on the break. That they had the resilience to defend for so long, with Rio Ferdinand outstanding, says much for their character and desire.<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez looked stunned by the defeat. He said: "I would have trouble explaining how we lost that in Spanish; in English I find it almost impossible. "We dominated the game, were in control and had plenty of attacks. Sometimes football is all about luck. When you have so much of the play and make chances without scoring, you must be careful against a team as good as United.<br><br>"United have a great defence and a fine goalkeeper. He stopped one from Peter Crouch at the end everyone felt was going in. But although we had so much of the game, we did not make too many chances. "The decision to disallow Craig Bellamy's effort in the first half for offside was right. It just was not our day."<br><br>He added: "United are really close to the title now. Chelsea are a good team, but they cannot make mistakes now because United will continue to win. "As for us, we are down now, but we will train hard and be ready for Barcelona on Tuesday."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>have a good sleep and let's wake up and be realistically.<br><br>now, we got 3 big "?" questions mark hanging over MUFC.<br><br>1) how bad is Rooney's injury?<br><br>2) Larsson played his last EPL game, are we now short of attacking options?<br><br>3) Scholes, he was tigerish in Pool's game. Now, he is gone for 3 games.<br>Any impact??<br><br>but one big merit, EdwinVS is singlehandedly keeping MUFC in the chase. Seems he found his best form.</div>
