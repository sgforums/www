That was a disappointing time and we definitely want a better result at Anfield this time," he told the Liverpool Echo.<br><br>"It would be a great result for us if we could do it.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gerrard risks supporters' wrath with praise for United</strong><br><br>Steven Gerrard yesterday revealed a grudging admiration for Manchester United's commitment to playing stylish, attacking football before admitting that Sir Alex Ferguson's side could effectively secure the title at Anfield on Saturday.<br><br>"They'll be coming looking for maximum points because that would virtually win them the league," said Liverpool's captain, well aware that United will kick off their lunchtime game on Merseyside boasting a nine-point lead over Chelsea at the top of Premiership.<br><br>The so-called "M62 rivalry" between Manchester United and Liverpool ranks as one of the most intense in football and Gerrard risked accusations of heresy from his club's more fanatical supporters when he admitted: "It hurts to say this but United have been playing some really good attacking football this season. They're also really hard to beat because they have some great defenders."<br><br>If that was conceivably a coded message to the sometimes tactically cautious Rafael BenÃ­tez, perhaps hinting that emulating a few of Ferguson's swashbuckling game plans might be welcome, there is no doubt the Merseyside-born Gerrard would relish undoing United. "The rivalry for this fixture has got bigger and bigger over the years," he explained. "These are the games you want to play in."<br><br>Gerrard's team-mate, Dirk Kuyt, is equally aware of the challenge facing the club as they seek their first Premiership victory over United at Anfield since a 3-1 win in November 2001. "Facing Manchester United is one of the most important games you can play in a season, so no one can be thinking about Barcelona until after this match," said the 26-year-old Dutchman. "I want to score and beat Manchester United."<br><br></div>

With closest pursuers Chelsea not in action until Saturday evening, United have the chance to briefly forge a dozen points in front. But the league leaders will come up against a Liverpool side determined to make up for a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford in October. Producing arguably their most insipid display of the campaign, Liverpool were beaten by goals from Paul Scholes and Rio Ferdinand, and are eager to exact revenge.<br><br>Since taking over as manager at Anfield, Rafa Benitez has seen his side score just once in five Premiership games against United. He will be desperate to improve that record and could recall both Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy to the starting line-up for the lunchtime kick-off.<br><br>Peter Crouch broke his nose in last week's 4-0 thrashing of Sheffield United, while Robbie Fowler's penalty brace is only likely to see him make the bench at best. Xabi Alonso started on the bench against The Blades, but could come back into the team, possibly at the expense of Jermaine Pennant or Mark Gonzalez.<br><br>Such a move would likely see captain Steven Gerrard shift out wide, with Javier Mascherano starting his second match for Liverpool. Steve Finnan will make his 400th career league appearance if selected at right-back, while Daniel Agger hopes to replace Sami Hyypia.<br><br>Fresh from a nervy 3-2 win over Reading in a midweek FA Cup replay, United could make up to nine changes for the trip to Merseyside. Only Edwin van der Sar and Rio Ferdinand seem guaranteed to keep their places, with Sir Alex Ferguson having no major injury concerns.<br><br>Nemanja Vidic should be okay to return at centre-half after coming off in last week's 2-1 win at Fulham with a knock. Captain Gary Neville should also return at right-back, having sat out the last two games, while Patrice Evra is on the opposite flank.<br><br>Welsh wizard Giggs will come back into the team to make his 700th appearance for United and will hope to mark the occasion by emulating his brace from the 2-1 win at Anfield in November 2003.<br><br>Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo should also come back into midfield, with Wayne Rooney also recalled. Louis Saha has overcome a calf injury sustained against Reading, but could make way for Henrik Larsson as the striking spearhead.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: red;">Man Utd win will seal title</span></strong></span><strong><br><br>Liverpool's fans used to taunt their Manchester United counterparts with a little tune that went: "You lost the league on Merseyside." It harked back to a crucial United defeat in the penultimate game of the 1991/92 season when goals from Ian Rush and Mark Walters handed the title to Leeds United.</strong><br><br>United supporters may be stretching it to claim they won the league on Merseyside if they beat Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. But victory will clear a massive hurdle on the road to returning the title to Old Trafford. I believe if United avoid defeat in the lunchtime encounter, the title is as good as theirs - and if they win the title WILL be theirs.<br><br>It would put United 12 points clear before Chelsea's tea-time visit to Portsmouth, a massive psychological advantage apart from the points gap with games running out. But before we get ahead of ourselves, Liverpool will see this as a chance to halt United in full flow, leaving the door ajar for a Chelsea charge.<br><br>It's a toss-up which club Liverpool fans hold in greater contempt out of the two Premiership pace-setters, but the old enemy United probably still get the nod. And that is why the usual level of hostility will be cranked up an extra notch at Anfield.<br><br>There have, however, been whispers that Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez may take the heat out of the situation by fielding a weakened team. Liverpool have no chance of the title, and their priority now is the Champions League second leg game against Barcelona at Anfield on Tuesday. But a weakened Liverpool team against Manchester United? Never.<br><br>Benitez would be insulting Liverpool's supporters and players by making such a move - and his previous forays on to this hazardous territory have proved disastrous. Imagine Steven Gerrard's reaction if Benitez told him he was sitting out a meeting with United?<br><br>If Benitez is pondering this, and I cannot believe he will, he must dismiss the notion now. Liverpool's full-strength side, with a midfield trio of Gerrard, Xabi Alonso and Momo Sissoko, is well capable of beating United. And look at their last 30 league games at Anfield - 25 wins and five draws.<br><br>Liverpool have not won a league match against United at Anfield since November 2001, so throw that in for some added inspiration. Liverpool can also test a United rearguard that looked vulnerable at Fulham. But United will look to a blend of youth and experience to fashion a result that will push them towards the finishing line.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo's running and ability will push a Liverpool defence not blessed with pace, while boyhood Evertonian Wayne Rooney needs no motivation against Liverpool. And if Paul Scholes can exert his influence, United may be able to repeat the domination they exerted over Liverpool at Old Trafford earlier this season.<br><br>Neither side will lack the desire to win, albeit for vastly different reasons. Liverpool will not want United crowing on their turf - and United will have ringed this fixture as one of their few tricky assignments on a relatively comfortable run-in.<br><br>Defeat will hardly tilt the title balance back in Chelsea's favour, but victory will surely give United unstoppable momentum. Liverpool know that. And that is what makes the game a special prospect.<br></div>
