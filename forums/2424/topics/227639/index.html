Picking the right players is one thing, but being able to afford for them is another altogether... True liverpool may not have some good manages over the yrs but Gerard Houllier was a rather ok one i thought... I guess they didn't know how to market themselves during the last 20 yrs unlike united, who made lots of money outside of football itself and used it to their teams benefit.<br><br>If the top management team is busy doing their job, the club may grow bigger like united. If the owner, like pool's sit back and ralax and only interested in watching football, then the club can only go so far... There won't be any extra funds coming in besides the usual gate collections and etc...<br><br>If you put mour in wenger's position, one have to wonder if he can do as well cos arsenal really lack funds yet wenger still manager to do rather well with what he has got... He look ahead a few yrs by getting potential young players in early and hope they do well in a few yrs time (no guarantees). This way, they save having to make expensive purchase but they lose too if the players doesn't make it. Mour even with the unlimited millions, he is still struggling at present...<br><br>So a lot goes down to the combination of a few things i guess.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even if SAF retires, he will still be offered a lifetime Board Membership in Mancherster United, and even though if hes retired, i dun think he will ever want to disassociate himself with football totally. Maybe he'll put his time in some youth football academy? Hes the sort of rare breed, the kind that comes once in a life time and thank god that he came in my lifetime.<br><br>As to who might be able to fill in his shoes when hes gone is something i do not want to speculate on, but im sure SAF already has someone on his mind who might be able to carry on the legacy that he left behind, besides, hes already rebuilding the team for the future manager to take over.</div>
