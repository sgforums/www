              even when he hasn't made his debut, I remembered reading an article that he is going to be bigger and better than micheal owen in 2000.
              
              After Euro 2004, he became touted as the white Pele, scoring 4 goals for England at euro 2004 and scoring 10 goals for England already at age 18. After the Euro, Man Utd spent 27m pounds to buy him from Everton.
              
              Since then, it has not been going the way of Rooney. He has not fulfilled his potential, unlike Ronaldo, who has won the european player and world player of the year award.
              
              Is it due to his temperament that he has not fulfilled his potential, or he is not that good after all, as people made him out to be in the first place?

              He is good, but maybe not as good as Ronaldo lar. I considered Rooney to be world class, but not the same as kaka or ronaldo of course.
              
              The only english talented players in the past were glenn hoodle and john barnes.

              <p>I don't think we can compare it this way... Putting Rooney along with Ronaldo is not right as different individual develop differently...</p>
              <p>Rooney has been great for United all along... And I belief he has develop very well over these last 4 yrs... If we take him away from the squad then we can see how much difference he makes to it... Ronaldo on the other hand has developed into a very good or we should say into the best player in the world winning the Fifa and European awards together in the same year... Nobody expected him to turn into what he is today 5 years ago... but he has and full credit to him.</p>
              <p>If we want to compare, We should look at how much Ronaldo has improve as a player on his own rather than just compare Rooney to him... If we think carefully, when Ronaldo first arrived, Robben was far more establish and a better player than him too... But today he has surpass him...</p>
              <p>Arsenal's Rvp was mentioned to be their most potential player 4, 5 yrs ago, He is probably one year older than Ronaldo and 2 on Rooney... He was said to be more potential or at least level with Ronaldo and Rooney during those days... Today, he has, well... done ok I guess. But not everyone reach the very top... Some don't even make it like Rafa once said Mark Gonzalez would be the new Ryan Giggs or something then what happen to him?</p>
              <p>There are so many potential players that may not make it to the very top, some don't even make it very far... What has happened to Jose Antonio Reyes, another during those days along with Ron, Roon and Rvp? Has Mohamed Sissoko turn out to be another Patrick Vieira like what Rafa said he could be? Will Bojan Krkic turns out to be another Messi? Or Samir Nasri into Zizu? Or Nicklas Bendtner into another Dennis Bergkamp?</p>
              <p>So we have to take into account all these... Players who have reach Rvp or Rooney's level we should consider them having fulfil their potential... Whether they can take it one step further its not easy... Just like Gerrard who was a young potential at Pool, today we can say he has fulfiled his potential but has he take it into the next level? I guess the answer is no as he have yet to be crown World and Europe's best, but has he fulfilled his potential, I would say definitely.</p>

              ya you are right. but being humans, we always like to compare or benchmark with other people.
              
              which englsh players in the past you reckoned are world class?
              
              Besides Glenn Hoddle, John Barnes, Paul Gascoigne, Chris Waddle, can't think of any liao. Maybe Kevin Keegan, as he won the european footballer of the year twice.
