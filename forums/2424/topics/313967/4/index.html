              <p><br>The replay clearly showed Kuszczak got the ball before he touch the man... Moreover they both were running into each other only Kuszczak reached the ball first... Rooney was given a yellow card for that lunged... so it settles that.</p>
              <p>But the hand ball by the Blackburn player in the box should have been a penalty. If United was leading by 2 goals margin he probably would have gave but I notice this Rob Styles always make things difficult for United when the score is still level...</p>

              <h1>Rob Styles suffers demotion to League Two</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="small"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">A week after officiating at Blackburn's Premier League game against leaders Manchester United, referee</span> Rob Styles will be in charge of Saturday's League Two match between Shrewsbury Town and Chester City.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Styles turned down two United penalty appeals and cautioned Wayne Rooney when he complained about a challenge by Steven Reid.</p>
              <p class="story">The Premier League would say only that referees' supremo Keith Hackett had 19 referees to choose from for 10 Premier League games each weekend, but it does appear a huge drop in status for a man regarded as one of England's senior referees.</p>
              <p class="story">Last month Styles was criticised over a penalty he awarded to Birmingham and in August he was sanctioned following his performance in Liverpool's game at home to Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><em>Good, Good... Hope he won't referee another united match until next season...</em></p>

              <p>i duno, i watched the highlights from here, and it shows that kuschack only got the man not the ball. Sure Rooney got a yellow card from styles, but thats favourable to the man utd man, it was high, dangerous, cynical and from behind, most refs i believe would've given a red. but since he gave a yellow, fine i'll leave it at that since he's a poor decision maker anyway.</p>

              <p><br>You should have watched the channel 27 highlights with the replay from different angles and the pundits comments... You will get a better picture of it... it clearly showed Kuszczak got the ball before he touch the man... Anyway you can also see it from your clip... Tho it didn't show Kuszczak getting the ball first from that angle, it does show the ball was moving in forward direction then suddenly it moved backwards when it reach him... Obviously the ball hit "something" or its direction won't changed right...</p>
              <p>So you are still unhappy with what Grant has done? Despite taking Chelsea to such heights you still think he don't deserve the credit?</p>

              <p>I gave him credit, but not all because a manager is judged by his players, and his players the Chelsea players don't seem to be playing their hearts for him. Motivation factor?</p>

              <p><br>How can that be? If that is the case then they wouldn't be where they are now right? I see many players doing very well even sub keeper Hilario... I see there are many outstanding individuals over the past 3 months... Players like Ballack, Carvalho, Cech, Terry, J Cole even Essien... On Drogba i am not too sure if he don't want to play well for him or is he losing he touch at 30 like most strikers do... cos he only show flashes of good form in some matches... But i belief its more to do with age catching up on him... and not he don't want to play...</p>
              <p>Reading reports about players wanting out and the actual players leaving is totally a different thing altogether... Those players that are not getting games will obviously want to leave... But the main team i don't think there are many... I just saw a report today that Ballack vows to stay and he wants to end his career at Chelsea... Same with Terry, J Cole and even Lampard who is ready to commit but the club may have other ideas like Villa's Barry...</p>
              <p>Even if he don't manage to beat Pool on wed, it doesn't mean he is worse... Cos we have to give the man credit... For he took a team of unhappy players one month into the season and on a string of bad results and made them what they are now, challenging for the 2 most important titles... He has already manage where his predecessor fail last season. And that is keeping up with the challenge when the pressure is on. We all saw how they crack up last season when the pressure starts... But this season, they have been going about their business despite the pressure... That alone is something i respect cos this is management area, not any individual player can do... and he has done it without all the circus acts like his predecessor used to do. </p>
              <p>Sometimes i think some of you guys miss the point... Their dislike for Grant (B'cos they luv Jose) is so great that they rather see the club they support do badly than well so as to continue hating him... I don't know how you can say that players don't want to do well for him and yet they are on top... Cos I see a lot of players want to do well for Wenger and yet they are below... It just puzzle me...</p>

              <p>We'll see what the board thinks of him cum end of the season as well as the players who are going or staying. You cannot say Terry,Carvaloh,Cech and Essien played outstandingly well for Grant, because under Jose they were top top players as well for most of the time.</p>
              <p>He has succeeded where people expected him too, but failed also when it matters and when people expected success more then ever such as the league cup and fa cup. I am not willing to sit around and wait 1 full season to see whether he has got what it takes, i would more rather Chelsea hire a top class coach with credentials such as Ancelotti, Lippi, Hiddink.</p>
              <p>Don't think the reason why i dislike him is because i'm a Jose fanboy sure he was good and the Chelsea fans loved him but about a decade ago, i was equally sad when they sacked Gullit after he led us to second and an fa cup. Then he was replace with Vialli, who brought us the cup winners cup. Both of whom also endeared themselves to the Stamford Bridge faithful, i was only happy when Rianieri was replaced, because i found him tactically clueless too.</p>

              <p>What the board thinks of him doesn't change the fact that he has indeed done very well when called upon in mid season to coach a unhapppy squad does it... Real Madrid sack Capallo doesn't mean he is a lousy coach... if anything, he just went on to sign a bigger contract...</p>
              <p>Why can't we say Carvalho, Cech, Terry, Essien have played well? Yes they did perform well for Jose too but i don't see them doing any lesser presently... But I can see Ballack and J Cole has indeed been playing better than during Jose's time tho... agree? I think he has succeeded where people expected him to fail. The problem is he has done so well at the start that now more is expected of him...</p>
              <p>The grass somehow always look greener on the other side doesn't it... But be careful what you wish for cos sometimes it could be worse than what you already got...</p>
