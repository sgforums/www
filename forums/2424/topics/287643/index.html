Just a few months with United and he is now showing form of a very good player he is and will be... He is tough, can tackle well, has speed, aggressive and most important, has a vision for great passes...<br><br>Actually of the 4 that came in this season, I was thinking that Anderson would be the most likely to fail especially when the other 3 did good enough at the start of the season while he was still struggling to find his way... But looks like all 4 are proving to be good buys<br><br>I think he has already surpass Carrick in the passing area and in time can match Hargreaves in the defensive side of his game too... I think Paul Scholes days as a first team player will not last beyond this season with the emergence of Anderson Luis de Abreu Oliveira...</div>

If he perform like he did in his last 2, 3 matches... Then he is definitely better than them... if not now, very soon when he has settle in.<br><br>Strange that the things that you mentioned are all qualities of each very good individual player... But in Anderson, he seem to have a unify strength of their talent... In Scholes, he can pass but don't seem to be able to tackle well... In Hargreaves, its like the opposite... Then with Carrick I call him the slow-mo man, not aggressive enough... Anderson has shown more aggression in his last 2 games than Carrick has for the whole of this season i think...<br><br>This in itself is a great quality to have in one player alone. And lets not forget, this is a 19 yrs old in his first season we are talking about, the other 3 guys are all seasoned and experienced players who have been to the WC, some even more than once...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
