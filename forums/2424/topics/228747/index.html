            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Alex rues missed chances</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson admitted after United drew 2-2 with Newcastle at St JamesÂ’ Park that his side should have come away with three points after "creating enough chances to win five matches".<br><br>At 2-1 early in the second half the only additions to the scoreline looked like coming from the Reds. But the Magpies hit back with a deflected strike from teenage defender David Edgar.<br><br>However, despite the dropped points, Sir Alex isnÂ’t too concerned about the implications the result could have on the title race.<br><br>Â“There will be points dropped by both teams,Â” he told Sky Sports. Â“There is a real challenge for the championship now. Chelsea are not getting it all their way as they have done in the last two years. We are serious contenders.Â”<br><br>Analysing the match, he added: Â“We had three cleared off the line, thatÂ’s a bit unlucky, and Ryan Giggs, Louis Saha and Ji-sung Park all had good chances. When you are creating chances you would hope you do enough to win, and we should have won the match with the opportunities that we had.Â”<br><br>The United boss was full of praise for Glenn RoederÂ’s players, who never gave up the cause. Â“I donÂ’t think we played as well as we have done in recent weeks simply because Newcastle didnÂ’t allow us to play," he added.<br><br>"They wanted to be first to every ball, showed determination and character. IÂ’ve got nothing but praise for them. We missed a stack of chances but I have got to admire the spirit and determination of the Newcastle team. They deserved their point without question. When they put in that kind of effort they prove that itÂ’s not an easy place to come to now.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was so angry at the first half performance.. What kind of sh!t football are they playing? Keep giving the opponents the balls with stupid inaccurate long balls.. Kudos to Newcastle in fact they should have won punish Man U for their lack of hunger.. Whats with Rooney? Whats happening to his form? The only players I thought were on form yesterday were Ronaldo, Ferdinand and Vidic.. So disappointing..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Calm down guys... if you look at it realistically it wasn't that bad... Newcastle was a strong team at their home ground winning their last 5 so naturally it wasn't going to be easy.<br><br>To be fair, we should be quite happy with the results after all, 4 matches in 10 days and united got 10 out of a possible 12 points should be consider good cos it could be worst.<br><br>Had scholes not been able to play yesterday, it could have been worst. So relax, It was the Christmas &amp; New Year period and i don't think any team manager to win all their matches...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder:</strong><br>"It was terrific and we will enjoy the result. When you play Manchester United you have to keep trying to take the game to them. "The lads came in and did a great job and it just shows how much courage and team spirit there is in the squad. "David Edgar is not renowned for his 25 yarders and he must have been saving it for a special occasion."<br><br><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong><br>"We missed a stack of chances but we have to admire Newcastle's character, they deserved their point. "We should have won the match but we did not play as well as we have been because they did not allow us to play. I have nothing but praise for them. "It is a real challenge now for the championship but we are a serious contender and points will be dropped by both teams."<br><br></div>
