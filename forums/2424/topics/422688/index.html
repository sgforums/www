              <p><strong>Young, who scored in England’s 2-1 victory against Denmark in Copenhagen last week, is understood to be Ferguson’s leading outfield target at the end of the season after being monitored by United since the start of the season. </strong></p>

              <p>The 25-year-old is out of contract at Villa Park in June 2012 and has so far rejected Villa’s attempts to extend his deal at the club.</p>

              <p>United’s efforts to sign Young in January were rebuffed by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/"><span style="color: #000000;">Aston Villa</span></a> manager Gerard Houllier but, while refusing to disclose the name of his transfer window target, Ferguson admitted in his programme notes ahead of Saturday’s 2-1 win against Manchester City that renewed efforts will be made to sign the player this summer.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Ferguson said: “We had an interest in one player and I thought we had a chance of bringing him in, but the other parties involved weren’t ready, so we have put it away until the summer.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Houllier admitted this week that clubs are ‘sniffing around’ Young, but the Frenchman is hopeful that the former Watford player can still be persuaded to stay at Villa Park.</p>

              <p>park/giggs are on their last leg. Valencia is a big "?", no disrespect. Young can also be push forward to partner rooney. Berba is also not young anymore.</p>
              <p>With him in the side, the front line is more mobile.</p>

              <p>One thing that separate him from Nani, Valance and Park is... He is a natural left-footer which United are in need of as Giggs can't make those speedy runs on the left-wing anymore... Nani and Park may be able to play on the left, but they are not left-footed afterall so will be less effective.</p>
              <p>Seen Young play lots of times already and the guy is good... And I belief he can improve his game playing alongside better players too... The guy is definitely worth as much if not equal to Andy Carroll though... But if his contract is near its end and he refuse to sign a new deal at Villa, Villa will have no choice but to sell of risk losing him for nothing...</p>

              <p>central midfield and goalie is more of a priority, winger not so priority.</p>
              <p>Fergie should go buy a world class goalie to replace VDS and a creative midfielder to replace scholes long term, as carrick, anderson and fletcher are more of a destroyer than creative midfielder. I hope fergie target Sneider and Buffon.</p>

              <p>truthfully, I have not been following his progress, I don't even have Mio.</p>
              <p>my Logic is that Ronaldo, who was new to EPL, an uncut diamond, and Fergie (old fox) shape and cut, and created a superb gem. Young is a cut diamond, but dulled. And what Fergie (oldfox) can do, is to add some elbow grease, and restore the diamond to its glory days. Fergie thinks he can do it, else, he won't have bid if really, Young's good days are behind him already, ya?</p>
              <p>And also, given the level of players/experiences/hunger, maybe, that could spark Young to a new level or maybe not.</p>

              <p>since when young become left footed?? since when did you not see him cut in on his right and then push back out wide, always doing this one trick he knows which causes him to lose the ball more often than not and it's all on his right....</p>

              <p><br>Well, since the time I seen him play, he is usually playing on the left for Villa sometimes on the right... And does very well too... Of course he can operate on both wings and also the 'hole' behind the main striker which he does for Villa lately and for England too recently to good effect... Here is a player who can play in many different positions, and that must be a plus for any manager to have.</p>
              <p>Of course you may disagree... But I think it could be due to Villa fans being upset that Young seems like he isn't keen to commit his future to the club right now... or even in the future.</p>
              <p>But whatever happens, I think Young has outgrown the club... Villa may be able to match his salary, but I don't think they can match his ambition... I don't think he wants to be in a club fighting relegation but challenging for titles if he can...</p>
              <p>And with the number of clubs after him... He must be doing something right otherwise they wouldn't be chasing after his signature right...</p>
              <p>When we see players like Andy Carroll going for $35m, tell me Young isn't worth even $25m if not same as the Carroll fee? Don't forget, he will help with the quota as well... But right now, cos of his contract near its end, his value being mentioned about $15m only, tell me it isn't a steal?</p>
              <p>To be very honest, even going to Pool for him would be seen as a step up from his present position...</p>

              <p>we've been selling our england internationals cheaper than what other clubs are doing...just 5 mil for cahill, 12 m for barry and yet still find a lot of criticisms against villa for overvaluing players...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Not Milner though... I don't think it's fair to include Cahill cos when he left, he wasn't exactly the 'big name' player he is now...   And I don't think many have criticize them over, over-valuing players... Maybe some felt they paid too much for Bent only... But not from their selling point though... Don't recall anyone saying they are selling their players too high... Even if they value Young a $25m sum, it could still be value for money...</p></div>
