            <div class='col-md body'><p><em>There have been big changes at Old Trafford this summer, from which <strong>Ben Hibbs</strong> feels Anderson must come of age and kick on next term...<br><br></em><strong>Whenever a talismanic and iconic player departs for pastures new, the inevitable clamour to find his replacement begins, people often seeking a like-for-like alternative. The truth is, there arguably isn’t a player in the world that poses the same threat Cristiano Ronaldo does, so I think we need to look elsewhere for a hero-in-waiting.<br><br></strong>Identical replacements for players are hard to find, although I’m sure Antonio Valencia will be a hit at Old Trafford next season. The players that define a team come in different forms, and positions. There are several candidates in the current Reds squad to take over Ronaldo’s crown. Wayne Rooney is a prime contender, displaying all the qualities to characterise the way this Reds team plays, and he will be United’s most important player next season, no doubt. Elsewhere, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic epitomise the team’s classy and aggressive brand of defensive solidarity.<br><br>Owen Hargreaves is another potentially influential component of the side - and getting him fit again remains one of the most important targets of the summer for Sir Alex Ferguson. Hargreaves, more than anyone in the squad – perhaps with the exception of the outstanding and still underrated Darren Fletcher – performs that crucial role of disrupting opposition attacks, before restarting the United assaults.<br><br>But there’s one other player I believe has the charisma, personality and ability to define this team for years to come: Anderson. He rapidly earned respect among United supporters in a hugely impressive first season at OT but, after a disrupted summer and one or two niggling injuries throughout the campaign, we only saw glimpses of his talent last term.<br><br>There isn’t always time or patience for transition at United, and with Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez departed, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs edging towards the end of their careers, there’s a vacancy that Anderson seems primed to fill.<br><br>Sir Alex once told me that when he had Anderson watched at FC Porto he had to temper the excitable reports he received back from his scouts, who were queuing up to lavish grand praise on the young Brazilian’s shoulders. Best young midfielder in the world, some said. Now could be the time to prove it.<br><br>Yes, he hasn’t scored yet (apart from in penalty shoot-outs, of course), but that will come. For a player of his skill and passing accuracy, it’s only a matter of acquiring the composure that comes with age to overcome his stuttering record in front of goal. When one goes in, plenty more could follow – and can you imagine his goal celebrations? He promised (or threatened) to tear his shirt off and run round the pitch when he finally breaks his duck.<br><br>His goal tally is only a minor issue, it’s his energy, skill and vision that are his greatest assets to United. It’s time for Anderson to step forward; next season he has to, and I’m sure he will.</p></div>

              <p>pls dun tear off or take out your shirt to celebrate if you do scored a goal if you are on a yellow lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope he can score 2-3 goals a season and subsequently averaged 5 goals per season. 2-3 goals can be a tad difficult if what he does is shoot at the stands lol</p>
