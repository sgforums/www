              Mark Hughes believes Sir Alex Ferguson deserves all the credit for Manchester United's continued dominance of the English game.
              
              Hughes' former club are expected to pick up a record-equalling 18th league title on Saturday by collecting the point required against Arsenal at Old Trafford. 
              
              Not only will it see United equal the mark Liverpool set in 1990, it would also seal an 11th triumph for Ferguson, the first two of which Hughes starred in himself. 
              
              And, for all the plaudits being heaped on the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Hughes' one-time team-mate Ryan Giggs, the Welshman feels Ferguson deserves them more. 
              
              "Eighteen championships is an outstanding achievement, which Sir Alex has been involved in many of," said Hughes. 
              
              "That is where the credit lies. He is the key. He is an outstanding manager who sets the bar for everyone else in the Premier League. 
              
              "It is credit to him he has the ability to create sides, recognise when they have to be changed and builds again. 
              
              "He has done that on three or four occasions now and they still win championships." 
              
              United's latest triumph is not yet secure. Yet even the most one-eyed Manchester City fan would struggle to believe that both Arsenal and Hull can beat the Red Devils, with Liverpool beating West Brom and Tottenham to snatch it on the final day. 
              
              In all probability, the last chance of the trophy being taken away from Old Trafford disappeared when City failed to pick up anything other than a 2-0 defeat last weekend. 
              
              "They have had an outstanding season and it looks like they are going to be crowned champions again," said Hughes. "That is a credit to them. They are such a good team as they have proved over many years."
