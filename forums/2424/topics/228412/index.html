            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GARY NEVILLE is facing a New Year operation which may rule him out of action for six weeks.</strong><br><br>And boss Alex Ferguson is planning to replace him with unknown reserve Danny Simpson. Fergie has called the youngster, 20 next week, back from a loan spell at Royal Antwerp and told him to get ready for his first-team debut.<br><br>Manchester United captain Neville has failed to recover fully from calf and knee problems which have plagued him all season. He has missed the last two games with a knee problem Â— an injury which has been troubling him since the World Cup last summer. He looked to have recovered but suffered a setback in the recent 1-0 defeat at West Ham and has also had problems with each calf.<br><br>Ferguson confirmed in November that unless the problems were cleared up by the New Year he would undergo an op. Neville has been training alone with the club physios this week and wants to play at home to Reading today and at Newcastle on Monday. Then United will take advantage of a break in the Premiership campaign for the player to have an operation.<br><br>UnitedÂ’s next league game after the trip to St JamesÂ’ comes two weeks later away to Aston Villa, who they also play in the FA Cup in between. Neville would be expected to miss five league games in all but Ferguson wants the problem sorted out so he can have his captain fresh for the title run-in.<br><br>The knee may just require keyhole surgery to gather the extent of the problem and then rest to build up its strength. It is hoped there is nothing more wrong but each calf also looks like needing surgery. The elevation of Simpson straight into the first team is the big surprise. The move will be bad news for Wes Brown who fears he is going to be sold by United. His contract is up in the summer and he is still to be offered a new deal.<br></div>

These reports have supposedly come from some great authority. What kind of authority is it when the lad is going to play on Monday?"<br><br>Ferguson confirmed Rio Ferdinand was receiving treatment for a kick on the shin but said Nemanja Vidic and Paul Scholes would definitely be available for the St James' Park encounter after missing Saturday's win through suspension.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Lucky he is ok...
