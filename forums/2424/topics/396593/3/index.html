              <p>The Neviller is always so determine that is why i still like him so much as a United fan... Even though at 35 going on to 36, where most players have already retired and gone into commentary, this guy is still giving his all to United's course. His body may no longer be able to take it fully, but his heart is always so true to United.</p>
              <p>Here is one guy who will probably retire rather than play for some other clubs and get first team football weekly... And let's not mistake him with the likes of Lampard, Terry or J Cole... These guys are playing for real hard money and not for the love of their club. They threatened to leave if they are not paid exorbitant amounts. Even though their previous salaries were already very high in the case of Terry and Lampard.</p>
              <p>Players like Neville, Scholes, Giggs are not even in the $100k per week bracket... They never held the club to ransom over salary demands... Contract talks are usually easy and no hassle... These guys are probably in the $60 to $80k per week range. But they accept it cos they truly feel for the club and never intend to leave.</p>

              <p>Wigan? I would not depend on them to avoid defeat to Chelsea. That 3-1 loss was really more of a fluke thanks to Chelsea playing uncharacteristically poorly in that game. Petr Cech was sent off in that game, and Hilario was..... hilarious. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And remember that they will be playing at Stamford Bridge. If Wigan can come away with a draw, that is already a fantastic result on their part.</p>
              <p>As for Liverpool.... let's just face it: with the way that they're currently playing, there's only a 50-50 chance that they will be playing their hearts out. Just shut down Gerrard and Torres, and Chelsea can make short work of them.</p>

              <p><br>Scare that Liverpool won't play their hearts out if they don't want Man U to overtake their winning record of 18 by letting Chelsea win.</p>
              <p>But Benitez wants his team to fight for top 4 now. (Needs miracles to do so) Else they can also secure the top 6 (probably last Europa League spot) as Aston Villa still trail them currently with one match on hand.</p>
              <p>Against big match for Liverpool, they had won against Man U (even without the presence of Torres and Gerrald last season that 2-1 win) and Spurs, but narrowly lost to Arsenal. So, if Liverpool plays their heart out, they can win the match since Chelsea's away day is not good (even though they had won Man U earlier on)</p>

              <p>As a result of yesterday's outcomes, Man U and Chelsea had different fates.</p>
              <p>Odds for Singapore Pools now:</p>
              <p>Man U: 7.00 (Yesterday) to 2.20 (Today)<br>Chelsea: 1.05 (Yesterday) to 1.60 (Today)<br>Arsenal: 25 (Yesterday) to 17 (Today)</p>
              <p>I think Arsenal's odd will drop even further if they win Wigan tonight.</p>
              <p>Should be 2 horse race as now, I will tip Man U to claim 1st ever 4th con. BPL under Fergie in charge. So, hard to say which team wins BPL as it goes down to the wire now.</p>
