              Ahead of Manchester United's clash with Everton, Sir Alex Ferguson says he is not a fan of using Wembley as an FA Cup semi-final venue.
              
              The United manager has never lost at this stage of the competition and is hoping to maintain his 100% record on Sunday when his team tackle David Moyes' Toffees. 
              
              But his memories of 1994, when the Red Devils drew with Oldham at Wembley thanks to Mark Hughes' memorable last-gasp equaliser, are not particularly fond. 
              
              "The FA have obviously got to pay off Wembley, which is the reason the game is down there," said Ferguson. 
              
              "Getting to the final should be the reward and the incentive for every footballer in the game. 
              
              "At one stage, you could only play at Wembley by reaching the FA Cup final. 
              
              "We didn't have play-offs or anything. It lost that real feeling of getting to the top of the tree by reaching Wembley. 
              
              "With so many games there already, you can understand why they utilise it for semi-finals as well. But it is hard when the final is there as well." 
              
              Unquestionably, Villa Park stands out as Ferguson's favourite semi-final venue. 
              
              It is where United have won five of their eight semi-finals under Ferguson's command, including the epic 1999 replay against Arsenal, settled by Ryan Giggs' wonder goal. 
              
              In addition, two replay wins against Oldham came at Manchester City's old ground Maine Road, with Newcastle beaten in an embarrassingly one-sided effort at the Millennium Stadium in 2005. 
              
              "I have always thought semi-final day at Villa Park was a fantastic occasion. The atmosphere is brilliant," said Ferguson. 
              
              "This will be the second time we have been to Wembley and I do remember that Oldham match was not a particularly good game. 
              
              "They don't have Manchester United's support and could not bring the numbers. 
              
              "But the match against them at Maine Road (in 1990), plus the two replays, were excellent. The ground was full and the atmosphere was brilliant."

              <p>I dun agree.</p>
              <p>A game is still a game, no matter where it is played.</p>
              <p>I believe the wembly stadium also need to recover its cost for their renovation.</p>
              <p>Good for the players as they will get a feel of what the ground is about esp for teams that have never played in wembly before.</p>
