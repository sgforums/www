              <h3>Winger wants to be like Best and Becks</h3>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Cristiano Ronaldo insists that he will not leave Manchester United until he has become an Old Trafford legend.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese superstar is already well on his way to becoming
                  part of Red Devils folklore, but is keen to secure the status enjoyed
                  by former heroes David Beckham and George Best.</p>
              <p>Having already adopted the famous No.7 jersey worn with such
                  distinction by those he is trying to emulate, it would appear to be
                  only a matter of time before Ronaldo can rightly claim to be equally
                  revered.</p>
              <p>He helped the club secure a domestic and European double in the 2007/08 season, scoring a remarkable 42 goals along the way.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Rumours linking with him a summer switch
                  to Real Madrid refuse to go away, but the 23-year-old revealed that he
                  will not be following in the footsteps of another United great just
                  yet.</p>
              <p>"Beckham is one of the club's greatest-ever players and it was a huge honour to be handed the shirt," Ronaldo told <em>Maxim</em> magazine.</p>
              <p>"I just hope to carry on doing it justice for the manager and the fans.</p>
              <p>"To be talked about like Becks and George Best would be amazing. But then why not if I carry on what I am doing?"</p>
              <p>The transfer saga which continues to surround Ronaldo has seen
                  relations between United and Real disintegrate in recent weeks, with
                  the Red Devils accusing their Spanish counterparts of illegal
                  approaches for their wing wizard.</p>

              ronaldo got a UCL medal and a few BPL medals in just a few years,
              he can leave for madrid now and be elevated as the same OLD

              <p>an interesting comment -&gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1 class="art-headline">Law is an ass over Ronaldo</h1>
              <h2 class="art-byline">Brian Reade  <a title="View other stories for 7 June 2008" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/columnists/reade/2008/06/07/"> 7/06/2008</a></h2>
              <p class="art-p">I'm
              slightly bemused by Bryan Robson joining Denis Law to tell Cristiano
              Ronaldo that if he leaves Old Trafford the only way is downhill to
              obscurity.</p>
              <p class="art-p">How come no one told Jaap
              Stam that? After leaving United he won the Italian Cup at Lazio,
              reached the Champions League Final with AC Milan, and won the Dutch Cup
              with Ajax.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Ruud van Nistelrooy clearly
              wasn't listening either when he went on to win La Liga twice with Real
              Madrid and a nomination for FIFA World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Diego Forlan? How his goalscoring touch deserted him and his profile plummeted at Villarreal.</p>
              <p class="art-p">As
              for that David Beckham, he really slipped under the radar. He won La
              Liga with Real Madrid, developed his global fame to such an extent
              Arena named him the most influential British male under 40, and five
              years on, he still plays for England.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Maybe
              I'm being a bit harsh on the United legends. Maybe they're talking
              about players who left in the days before foreigners dominated the
              dressing room.</p>
              <p class="art-p">No, hang on, what's that shiny thing on Gordon Strachan's mantelpiece? Oh yes, a league title winners' medal.</p>
              <p class="art-p">So, Bryan and Denis, early dementia it is then?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I always think if a player is loyal to his club, he has all my respect. Yes, thanks to ronaldo's goals, perhaps we have clinched the double. But if he wants to move on then go ahead, and lose the very bit of respect that everyone is ready to give him. Not say the club is going for the money and sell him for insane profits, it wasn't their intention to sell him. He has already voiced out his wants and intentions, then carry on but don't expect to be honoured for it.</p></div>

              <p>pool is a big mystery to me..</p>
              <p>they got the best striker, the best midfield combo, one of the best defences, and one sound keeper.. tell me, where is the error? for me, would be Rafa..</p>

              <p>T<br> use your brains to think can? ronaldo already won the champions
                  league and EPL with man u. the challenge is to see if he can
                  win the champions league with another clubs. seedorf won
                  it with three different clubs. how many players can boast that
                  record in the champions league? what incentive is there for ronaldo
                  to stay when he has already won what he wanted in England? its just
                  like ronaldinho won the la liga title, champions league in same
                  season, won individual awards but stayed on at barcelona and lost
                  motivation cos he needed a new challenge. do you know what you are
                  talking? what the fuck.</p>

              <p>Well, I think Ronaldo wanted to play with Real Madrid all his life, it is his dream.But when he started in Sporting, he wasn't going to do that. Only when he came to United, got polished, won the league and European Champions, now, RealM put the red carpet out for him.</p>
              <p>The key here is before a transfer can be done for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contracted</span> player, the clubs needs to talk and then personal terms, like for Beckham, Heinze, RuudVN. But in this case, RM did it in their way again. They go out and enticed the player and then ask them to strike at their club. Now, I think that's a bit unprofessional don't you think?  Did they do it with Zidane? Figo?</p>
              <p>No.. but why now? Cause United doesn't want to sell...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Real went to papers and announced they got an offer of 75M, 300000 pounds after tax per week, and it is not going to be on the table next year. And they tell the world, they did NOTHING to lure Ronaldo.  Are we all 3 yrs old kids?</p>
              <p>End of day, given how Ronaldo has voiced out, I think it is good to sell him. Cause his heart is gone. No point repairing a broken mirror. Let him go try and win whatever he dreams of winning in La Liga if he can or his team can.</p>
              <p>MU just has to get back all they have put in him like the polishing/nuturing, the sheltering after the WC.</p>
              <p>And the sum is not 75m, not 100m, cause if RealM values him @ 0.5B, then MU should sell him for 0.5B so no loss. Right? We should all profit from the deal, a win-win right? So deal or no deal?</p>
