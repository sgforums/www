            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson admits Manchester United now have a wonderful chance to win the league after securing victory at Everton.</strong><br><br>Champions Chelsea could only draw against Bolton at Stamford Bridge as United came from two goals down to seal a 4-2 success at Goodison Park.<br><br>"I can't explain the game as I didn't think we did that bad, but two goals from two great strikes - in football that can happen," Ferguson told Sky Sports 1.<br><br>"The first had a bit of fortune about it, it got a bit of a deflection past Edwin, but the second was an incredible hit and at that point we were toying with the idea of bringing on Ronaldo - because he is carrying an injury.<br><br>"We decided if we get a goal we bring him on and we got the break when the young keeper dropped the ball and John O'Shea has taken it and at that chance I thought we had a chance.<br><br>"With Ronaldo coming across, their focus would be on Ronaldo - with Giggs, Scholes, Carrick and Rooney and I think it was waiting to happen."<br><br>Ferguson admits he was keeping up-to-date with the Chelsea game at various points.<br><br>"I kept asking you, and up to 3-2 and we did hear Bolton were 1-0 up, but you are just thinking how we resurrect our situation and I was not really thinking about the Chelsea game I was thinking about my own game," he continued.<br><br>"Hopefully that result will pick everyone up, all the players have pains and aches - these players are carrying the banner for us - they are having to do it all themselves and it is great credit they are doing it, and that result today will give them a new benefit for Wednesday.<br><br>"The result is significant, we are away to Manchester City next week - in the morning after playing in Milan - and we know what that can do to players, it can be difficult and then we have Chelsea at Stamford Bridge - but I do think the marvellous attitude of the players and the spirit in the camp is going to help us."<br><br>He admitted United now had the 'momentum' to secure the title, adding: "With Chelsea drawing today, it [the momentum] is obviously back with us.<br><br>"A five point lead and a better goal difference it gives us a wonderful chance with three games left, but I think the most important thing is that we are having a go.<br><br>Ferguson also found time to praise Wayne Rooney who scored the crucial third to put United ahead for the first time with just ten minutes remaining.<br><br>"He could have scored two or three today, but perseverance is a wonderful attribute - particularly when you not doing well because some people can give it and some don't like the challenge," he said.<br><br>"Wayne Rooney is a natural fighter and from missing two or three, he had the opportunity and I was certain he would score."<br><br>And Ferguson admitted his friend Sam Allardyce would be getting some extra thanks after holding Chelsea.<br><br>"He will be getting a hug and a kiss, maybe two kisses," he quipped.</div>

When Bailey was keeper. And it was not fun watching liverpool, everton winning everything.<br><br>As for Phil, it is easy to link him to MUFC after his own goal, but being captain of Everton FC, it was not a good feeling.
