              <p><strong>United’s players can’t wait to kick-off Tour 2010 against Celtic in Toronto tonight, signalling the start of preparations for the new campaign.</strong><br><br>The Reds travelled to Canada from the team’s first US base camp in Chicago yesterday. Since returning to pre-season training on 5 July, the players have been building their fitness, but all the lads are keen to get the football underway.<br><br>"Everyone is really looking forward to the game,” United midfielder Darron Gibson told <strong>ManUtd.com</strong>. “There's a big Irish contingent over here so it should make for a good atmosphere and hopefully we can kick off with a win.”<br><br>Team-mate Jonny Evans added: "It should be a good game. They were actually the last team I scored against [in a friendly in 2006] and I'm certainly due another goal so it would be nice to get on the score-sheet again.”<br><br>However, players, staff and fans are all keen to kick off the tour with a victory, gaining fitness for the new season is the number one aim.<br><br>"The tour is going well,” added Dimitar Berbatov. “It's good to spend time with your team-mates and get to know the new guys as well. It’s about training hard and preparing for the new season and hopefully we'll come back in good shape."</p>

              <p> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIMITAR BERBATOV hit the ground running as Manchester United cruised to victory.</h2>
              <p>Striker Berba, the subject of a summer move after a poor return last season, opened the scoring just after the half-hour in Toronto.</p>
              <p>Berbatov showed some wonderful touches and set up late goals for substitutes Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley as United marked their first appearance in this part for the world for six years with victory in the first of their five games.</p>
              <p>Manager Sir Alex Ferguson opted for a strong line-up, with Edwin van der Sar, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Darren Fletcher and Berbatov all lining up on a rather suspect looking grass surface that was only laid a day earlier following the Toronto Argonauts opening CFL home game on astroturf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/17/article-0-0A78ED45000005DC-438_468x326.jpg" alt="Man Utd v Celtic" width="468" height="326"> </p>
              <p><em>Landmark: The two teams line up beneath the CN Tower at Toronto's Rogers Centre stadium</em></p>
              <p><br><br></p>
              <p><strong>Still it was an impressive setting in the shadow of Toronto's famous CN Tower which stretched high into the blue skies above the 50,000-seater stadium. United boss Alex Ferguson fielded a strong side in front of 39,000 fans at the Rogers Centre tickets cost as much as $150 and there was no chance of seeing United's World Cup contingent or the injured Michael Owen, Gary Neville and Canada native Oswen Hargreaves.</strong></p>
              <p>But there could be no complaints over Ferguson's selection, with Smalling making his debut alongside Jonny Evans and the Da Silva twins in a defence with an average age of 20.</p>
              <p>Celtic also put out a strong line-up with Ledley making his first start. <br><br>£10million defender Chris Smalling had a debut to forget, though, after giving away a penalty.</p>
              <p>Samaras stepped up to beat Van der Sar with a right-foot shot, and it looked like earning Celtic a draw until Berbatov helped to tip the balance back in United's favour.</p>
              <p>He showed awareness and intelligence to square the ball across the box when it fell to him after 78 minutes, rather than go for goal, and presented the lunging Welbeck with a easy opportunity to slide it into an empty net.</p>
              <p>And it was the Bulgarian's backheel four minutes from time that gave Cleverley a clear sight of goal, and the youngster's effort deflected off the unfortunate - and aptly named - Odea for United's third.</p>
              <p>Ferguson and his team now return to America where they play Philadelphia, Kansas City and an MLS All-Star team before rounding it off against Chivas in Mexico.</p>

              <div class="newsStory">
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has reiterated his belief that Dimitar Berbatov is the 'right player' for Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>Since becoming United's club record signing in 2008, the Bulgarian striker's performances have been heavily scrutinised. However, Berbatov shone in the Reds' opening pre-season victory over Celtic, and Sir Alex insists everyone in the United camp is behind him.</p>
              <p>"He got man of the match, and I think he deserved that, no question," Sir Alex told <strong>MUTV</strong> after Saturday's win over the Bhoys. "His performance was excellent. In the second half he produced some fantastic moments.</p>
              <p>"It underlines the one great factor - that class he has. You cannot take that away from him, no matter the crticism. It doesn't come from our camp. When we see that we know we have the right player."</p>
              <p>As United continue to be linked with a string of new strikers, Sir Alex gave backing to his current roster of front men and conceded that he has an abundance of attacking options for the new season.</p>
              <p>"We are happy with the strikers we have got," he said. "You have to decide what is the best combination. Diouf has got different talents to Macheda and Welbeck. He penetrates, he is quick and aggressive. We have really good talent in the striking department with Hernandez also joining us, so that is a good area and a good future for us."</p>
