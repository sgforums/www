            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/100197.jpg"><br><br><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has ruled out making any attempt to keep Henrik Larsson beyond the end of his loan deal on March 12. The veteran Swede has been an astute addition to the Manchester United squad since his arrival on New Year's Day.</strong><br><br>Larsson's contribution to the Red Devils cause goes far beyond his two goals and although the 35-year-old indicated this week he would be heading back to Helsingborg as planned next month, many believed Ferguson would attempt to keep the striker until the current campaign reaches its conclusion.<br><br>However, Ferguson has ruled out such a move and insisted he will stick to the agreement originally thrashed out to get Larsson to Old Trafford in the first place. "I have said all along we have Henrik here until March 12 and that doesn't change," revealed the United chief.<br><br>"I am not even attempting to go near it because I respect what Helsingborg have done for us in letting him come here and I am not changing from that. "Henrik has a lot of responsibility to Helsingborg too, so we are both shooting from the same gun. We are just thankful for having him here."<br><br>Given the partnership Larsson has struck up with Wayne Rooney it seems almost inconceivable Ferguson could just let the legendary former Celtic striker leave with two months of the season remaining. But Ferguson, who twice tried to land Larsson in his prime, believes the forward will leave behind a legacy which will stand United in good stead for the next eight games and beyond.<br><br>"Young players who want to progress in the game should look at Henrik's movement, timing and enthusiasm," said Ferguson. "Against Lille last week, he was the one player dropping back into midfield when we were caught out of position. "It just showed his tactical awareness and also his responsibility in terms of being a senior player to make sure we got through a vital part of the game near the end.<br><br>"The players have been absolutely amazed at him because he is such an intelligent footballer. "It is as if he has been here for years rather than a few weeks. He has been an absolute credit in the manner he has gone about this period."<br><br>However, while Larsson's departure will not be greeted with universal approval among the United contingent, it is good news for Alan Smith. The former Leeds striker has been put on a personal fitness programme after struggling to make an impact on his initial comeback from last season's horror leg break.<br><br>But Ferguson is ready to throw Smith back into the fray in next week's FA Cup replay at Reading, and he insists his Â£6million front-man still has a future at Old Trafford. "Alan is unfortunate in that the team's form has been great but he still has a long-term future with us," said the United chief.<br><br>"The one thing about Alan is he has fantastic courage. He has a great enthusiasm to play football which always gives him a chance. "If he gets a bit of the game on Tuesday, it will only help him in the later stages of the season when I may need him."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, do you all feel that his presence is worth it?<br><br>I do agree his professional ethics, passion, skills, finishing can influence younger players.<br><br>but I seems to be disappointed at his recent displays. Maybe I expect more.<br><br>With him now going back, Saha and Rooney losing that mental link, or understanding. Our forwards aren't doing that great at the moment.<br><br>And against Fulham, it showed that Scholes and Carrick just could not compete.<br>Can they do well against Gerrard and Co?</div>
