              <h1>Rooney, Vidic and Evra boost for Man Utd</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/04/30/ufnrooney.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="small"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is confident Wayne Rooney, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra will all feature in Saturday's crunch Premier League clash at home to West Ham on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Rooney and Vidic both missed last night's 1-0 Champions League semi-final victory over Barcelona after suffering injuries in last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Chelsea. England striker Rooney has a sore hip while Serbian defender Vidic was concussed following a collision with Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge. Left-back Evra played against Barcelona but was stretchered off late in the game after receiving a blow to the head.</p>
              <p class="story">"Patrice got a real bang on the head but I’m sure he’ll be all right for Saturday," Ferguson told the club's official website. "Vidic may be okay too, but that’s in the doctor's hands.</p>
              <p class="story">"After getting the knock against Chelsea on Saturday, Wayne was in real pain on Monday. I made the decision not to risk him (against Barcelona) because if I had to then substitute him early in the match it could really have affected us. So I went with a front two of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. Wayne has got a big chance (of being fit to face West Ham). He'll be all right for Saturday."</p>
              <p class="story">United, in sight of a Premier League and European double, are aiming to keep up the pressure on Chelsea on Saturday as their rivals for the title do not face Newcastle until Monday. Meanwhile, Ronaldo has hailed the Old Trafford crowd for their vocal support against Barcelona as United reached their first Champions League final since 1999. "The fans were absolutely fantastic," Ronaldo said. "They did a great job and sang for the whole game. It gave the players motivation and helped us get a massive result."</p>
              <p class="story">Ronaldo said United would not be distracted by thoughts of the Champions League final, insisting the whole squad were fully focussed on retaining their Premier League title first. "The feeling is great," he said. "It will be my first Champions League final and I feel very good. It's great for me and my colleagues. The final is in three weeks and we have time to work and keep our concentration. But the most important thing now is the league."</p>

              <p>Alan Curbishley has confirmed what all Chelsea fans were dreading,
              West Ham will take a scratch squad to Manchester United in a week’s
              time.</p>
              <p>The Hammers have been struck down by
              injuries all season, with Freddie Ljungberg the latest in a long line
              of casualties after Steven Taylor inadvertently cracked his rib.</p>
              <p>Chelsea need United to drop a point in one
              of their final two league games if they are to win the title, but
              Curbishley revealed he will be giving one or two youngsters a chance at
              Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Matthew Upson, Anton Ferdinand, Jonathan
              Spector, Danny Gabbidon, James Collins and Calum Davenport are all out,
              meaning the likes of James Tomkins will be thrown in at the deep end.</p>
              <p>"Perhaps some players have only seen Old
              Trafford on the TV might get a chance. It will be another learning
              curve for one or two of them and I have been happy with young Tomkins.</p>
              <p>"Our problems have actually made us stronger because our squad player have been getting games and are more experienced.</p>
              <p>"Obviously we won't be going with the
              pressure we had on us last year but we want to finish the season as
              strongly as we can. We will go there and give it our best shot."</p>

              <p>just run and run.. and he won't do a nani and shoot cause he will almost always pass to a better positioned team-mate.</p>

              <h1>Angry Chelsea fear West Ham won’t be up for Old Trafford clash against title rivals Manchester United</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_01/managers0105_468x391.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea are furious with West Ham manager Alan Curbishley for claiming that it would be 'a great injustice' if Manchester United failed to win the league. Curbishley's side travel to Old Trafford tomorrow for a match that could have a decisive influence on the outcome of this season's championship race.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Avram Grant will today take Curbishley to task for promising to 'raise a glass' to his old friend Sir Alex Ferguson if he sees off the Blues to claim a 10th Barclays Premier League title. He will draw attention to a newspaper column in which Curbishley said: 'It has not been a fluke that his side have been so attractive to watch and produced some thrilling football to match their results. 'It is the reason they stand on the brink of winning the Championship for the 17th time, and the general feeling among most managers is that they would like to see them crowned again.'</p>
              <p>In the column published nine days ago, Curbishley added: 'It would be a great injustice if Manchester United were to lose the Premier League title. I would raise a glass if United win the title. It would be, of course, a toast to Alex Ferguson, the best there is and may ever be.' Grant will refer to those remarks at his press conference before attending the funeral of Frank Lampard's mother, Pat.</p>
              <p>By implicitly questioning Curbishley's desire to beat his old friend, he doubtless hopes to spur West Ham to another great performance against a side they have beaten in their last three encounters and help deny United that 17th league title. Curbishley, who believes Fergie will continue in charge until he beats Liverpool's record of 18 top-flight triumphs, insists Sir Alex can accept no favours, saying yesterday: 'The world will be watching and we've got to put in a performance and show what we can do.'</p>
              <p>But to further fuel Chelsea fears of football conspiring to aid United, Wigan Warriors rugby league club have moved their Challenge Cup match against Whitehaven from tomorrow week to the following Monday to avoid damaging the JJB Stadium pitch the day before the Old Trafford club's visit on the final day of the Premier League season.</p>
              <p>Fergie's No 2 Carlos Queiroz, 55, insists he has no intention of leaving the club to take charge at Benfica and takes great pride in rebuilding the club around youngsters such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Anderson. 'I have a contract and I intend to fulfil it,' said Queiroz.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo, 12 months into a new fouryear deal, has revealed that he will discuss his future after the Champions League Final. United insist they have no plans to hold talks over improved terms. But asked in the aftermath of Tuesday's win over Barcelona if he might be tempted by a move to Spain, Ronaldo said: 'As far as my future is concerned I don't know, nor do I want to speak about it until after the Champions League Final.'</p>
              <p>United's Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic are struggling to make the game with West Ham. But Carlos Tevez, who became an Upton Park cult hero before his switch to Old Trafford, is available for selection.</p>
