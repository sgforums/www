There is no question there is an unfairness about it all.'<br><br>It was the second time Bennett had sent Ronaldo off, having dismissed him against Manchester City in January 2006.<br><br>Bennett has also been criticised this season by Wigan manager Chris Hutchings for his handling of a match at Newcastle and last week he fell foul of Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez for ruling out a goal in the Carling Cup tie against Bolton.<br><br>Hutchings later welcomed the decision to withdraw Bennett from yesterday's Premier League match against Liverpool after admitting he was wrong to send off Kevin Kilbane for two yellow cards at Newcastle.<br><br>The club were unable to overturn the dismissal as there are no grounds to appeal when two yellow cards have been issued.<br><br>Wigan, infuriated by Bennett's decision, were cited for failure to control their players.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>an age-old question, do these referees have their own favorites??<br><br>I do know they are normally from a neutral ground or etc, but then surely, they must have followed a club from young rite? They did not just become referees all of a sudden.<br><br></div>
