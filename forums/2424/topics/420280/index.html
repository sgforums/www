              <p>On paper, I think this could be United's touchest match... Spurs are really on a high and would love nothing more than to end United's unbeaten run...</p>
              <p>Spurs are usually very hard to beat at home... Even Chelsea and Arsenal suffer defeats there I think... So United could actually lose this one too... And without Park, who Fergie usually turns to in this kind of fixtures... United will be short of players willing to run and run for the whole match...</p>
              <p>Just a pity Park is not available for this... cos the guy normally comes up with winners or important goals during this type of games...</p>
              <p>Honestly, I would be very pleased if United gets a draw at White Heart Lane... Cos one point is better than nothing right... lol.</p>

              <p class="full-line tweet tweet_button">It is a long time since this fixture had an aura of rivalry about it. Tottenham last beat <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> in May 2001 and have lost 15 of 19 subsequent meetings with Sir Alex Ferguson's side. Harry Redknapp's men have taken great strides to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, but this squad could do better on the domestic front. Although the visitors are unbeaten in the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Premier League</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> their away form has still been rather drab and Tottenham should have a real prospect of distressing United for a change. <strong>Kevin McCarra</strong></p>

              <p>I think there could be a reason for that sometimes... Cos he can't hold on to the ball for like more than 6 seconds and when the team is defending, and Spurs attacking... He had little option as few players are up-front and quite a number of Spurs players are in United's half very close to their defenders... so dangerous for him to short throw to one of them i think...</p>

              <p><span><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson's long-running feud with referee Mike Dean erupted again on Sunday following Rafael Da Silva's dismissal during Manchester United's goalless draw at White Hart Lane. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>United returned to the top of the Barclays Premier League but had to play the last 16 minutes against Tottenham with 10 men after full back Rafael was given a second yellow card for tangling legs with Benoit Assou-Ekotto. </span></p>
              <p><span>'It's not worth discussing because everyone can see that,' said Ferguson. 'It's out of my bounds now. Thank God.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson's history with Dean includes being handed a two-match touchline ban and a £10,000 fine after confronting the referee at the end of the victory against Hull in 2008. </span></p>
              <p><span>He was also infuriated by Dean last season after Chelsea's victory at Old Trafford included a disputed goal by Didier Drogba, admitting afterwards 'when I saw Mike Dean I did worry'. </span></p>
              <p><span>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp described yesterday's sending off as harsh, adding: 'It was like Mary Decker and Zola Budd.</span></p>

              <p><span>Rafael could now be in trouble with the Football Association if Dean reports the Brazilian's language as he left the pitch, or his kick at a television microphone before heading down the tunnel. </span></p>
              <p><span>Spurs were unable to take advantage of Rafael's departure to inflict a first defeat of the season on United, but Redknapp believes it would be a 'miracle' for them to go through the season unbeaten.</span></p>
              <p><span>He added: 'I personally can't see it. I think it would be a miracle if Alex got them through the season unbeaten.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I am not knocking them. They are top of the league and above where we are and want to be. But you can't be as good a team as you were a year or two ago when you haven't got (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Carlos) Tevez.' </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Redknapp also insisted his own team are still in the title race despite being eight points behind United, who have two games in hand on second-placed Manchester City. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson agreed with Redknapp, adding: 'I think there are five teams all contesting it. All have chances and it makes it interesting for neutrals. We have to win the two games in hand. We have to go to Chelsea and that will be a massive game and we have to go to Blackpool who are in great form at the moment.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson paid tribute to his defenders: 'They were particularly good,' he said. 'It's about keeping your nerve and, defensively, we kept our nerve.' </span></p>

              <p>Rafael did alright and like I've mentioned before, he just needs to concentrate on decision-making, which he was really bad at. The first yellow was a result of over-zealous attempt at winning back the ball AT THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD. Now why is he doing there in the first place?</p>
              <p>The second yellow is a joke. Mike Dean really has some issues with Fergie/United. Some decisions were really stupid.</p>
              <p>Modric did a super dive when Carrick wasn't anywhere near taking him down and Modric went flying over as if he was shot and yet he escaped with no card.</p>
              <p>However, I must comment on Rafael's dribbling ability. He waltz his way through Spurs' defence so many times and I think Spurs must be glad that he was off the field before any damage was done.</p>

              <p>You all noticed that fletcher lost the ball at least four times in midfield last night? Man, like I've said before...this guy is above average....not the outstanding kind of player someone in his midfield shoes should be.</p>
              <p>Nani looked short on confidence last night too. He didn't do his magic. And when that happened, the only creative force was giggs.</p>
              <p>Rooney seriously looks a shadow of himself........</p>

              <p>United miss Park in this match... Cos he is the type of player that does well in this kind of all running, all action game... Too bad he is across the other side of the world helping his country...</p>
              <p>Anyway, on the bright side... United have got Spurs out of the way in the league for this season... City and Chelsea still have to host them sometime later and gunners still need to go to White Hart Lane...</p>
