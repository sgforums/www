              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As Sir Alex Ferguson prepares for his 700th Premier League match, Sportsmail's writers recall the moments of football genius and volcanic temper that put Fergie in a league of his own.</span></p>

              <h2 style="background-color: #004db3;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Jamie Redknapp</span></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I was playing for Spurs against Manchester United and remember looking at Cristiano Ronaldo in the tunnel and admiring his shape and physique. He looked like a footballer. At the time, plenty were dismissing him as a show pony. There was a lot of focus on his theatrical falls and tricks, without too much end product. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After the game, I saw Sir Alex and said: 'Your No 7 isn't too bad.' He looked at me and said: 'I'm telling you, he's going to be one of the best players in the world.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His development of Ronaldo is an indication of his passion for the game, his knowledge and ability to spot a United player, because it's harder to play for the bigger clubs, such are the demands and expectations, the pressure to perform consistently when everyone is trying to bring you down. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Look at what Ferguson did with players such as David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs. He is a brilliant spotter of talent and he knows how to take that talent and make them into a United talent. It was the same with Eric Cantona. It sums him up as a manager. I wonder if Ronaldo will ever enjoy his football as much as he did when he played for Sir Alex. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It was the day after Boxing Day 2004 and I sat with a group of other daily newspaper reporters in a small ante-room at United's Carrington training ground. The day before, Wayne Rooney had been criticised by Bolton manager Sam Allardyce for a swipe at defender Tal Ben Haim with his arm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sir Alex seemed in reasonable humour as he sat down behind his desk, gently chiding us for 'ruining my Christmas by making me come here'. As can sometimes be the case, though, the United manager's temper was on a hair-trigger that day and my questioning about the Rooney incident promptly saw a storm blow up, the like of which I had never seen before and indeed have never seen since.</span></p>

              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sir Alex was into his stride quicker than Usain Bolt as he vented his spleen at Ben Haim for his alleged play-acting and at us, the written press, for not highlighting it - even though, as I tried to point out, we actually had. When he is in this mood - when the red mist has well and truly come down - Sir Alex is impossible to reason with. It's as close as a journalist can ever come to feeling what it must be like when the dressing room hairdryer is turned on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">One of his strengths has always been the depth of his own convictions and the blind loyalty he feels towards his own players and indeed the club he has built in his own image. At times, it spills over. Deep down I can't believe that he doesn't sometimes regret it when it does.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This was certainly one of those occasions. I won't repeat the exact dialogue here - although I have kept a copy - but as I tried to reason with him, tried to direct the exchange back on to a course fit to publish in a newspaper, Sir Alex merely swept me away, shouting over me, the air blue with profanities and accusations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">By the end he was standing on his feet and his final act was to swipe his right hand across the table, sending eight tape recorders flying into the wall. With that he walked towards the door but, before he left the room, he turned back to us. 'Now you've got me to lose my f*****g temper,' he grimaced. Wonderful. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After my run-in with Ruud van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford in 2003, the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United had never been greater. But I was still surprised by the way Ferguson behaved when I next saw him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We were in the marble hall at Highbury before the game and he was greeting people he knew. But he did his level best to ignore me, which he hadn't done before. He usually shook my hand so I was a bit put out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But a few years later, after I had left Arsenal, I saw him at Jim Smith's testimonial dinner in Blenheim Palace in Oxford. It was in the middle of the season and he must have been very busy but he took the time out to go along. I made a decision to go and shake hands with him. He was very warm and gracious - the perfect gentleman. I guess I wasn't a rival any more at that point but it made me realise how different he was away from work and how competitive he is with it.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">THE first thing Sir Alex Ferguson said to me takes some beating as an opening line. 'Are you related to that tramp?' he enquired, which not only took me by surprise but also suggested, back in 1995, that someone had given him some duff information. Well obviously.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But this was classic Ferguson. A then typical response to the arrival of another young journalist on the scene. He didn't trust you. He didn't want you using him to make a name for yourself. He didn't want you getting comfortable. Instead, he wanted to put a marker down. During the seven years I worked specifically as a Manchester-based football reporter, there were other such run-ins.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Soon after he had announced his intention to retire in 2001 I'd run a story about how the new board members at Aberdeen would offer him an opportunity to return to Pittodrie as club chairman at the end of the season. That morning I got a call from Paddy Harverson, then the director of communications at Manchester United, who informed me Ferguson was spitting mad, not least because his phone hadn't stopped ringing. Harverson wanted to try to diffuse the situation before I arrived at Carrington for his press conference later that day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sadly, he failed and Ferguson launched into a verbal tirade that turned briefly physical when I argued that the story was true. Harverson had to dive between us, suggested I leave and then - rather courageously it has to be said - told Ferguson that he not only believed the story had some substance, but that he also probably shouldn't have tried to throw me out. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In fairness to Ferguson, he did then grant me permission to re-enter the building for an interview I had arranged with Ryan Giggs. 'You still here?' he asked as he walked past. There was a moment in a televised Champions League press conference. 'It would take an entire interview to answer that question and it's an interview you're never going to get,' he said, much to the amusement of my colleagues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But there is another side to Ferguson. A hugely generous side that many of the same journalists he has jousted with over the years have experienced. When colleagues he's known have been taken ill he's turned up at the hospital; even made a visit to their homes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I'm not sure he'd do that for me but it's been a great ride all the same. One of the highlights of reporting, for the last 15 years, on this amazing game.</span></p>

              <div class="floatThirdRHS"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/09/article-0-0B1C5FF0000005DC-201_196x250.jpg" alt="GRAHAM POLL" width="196" height="250"></span></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">My first 'hairdryer' came in 1996 after a 2-2 draw against Everton. He was furious that I had not added enough time - I had only added nine minutes! Our next meeting was on November 16, 1996, again at Old Trafford and his 10th anniversary at United. I told him that I had considered buying him a watch to mark the occasion. He replied that after my last visit he had considered buying me one - a Mickey Mouse one! </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After one game at Old Trafford he waited for me in the tunnel and blasted at me that 'someone would have to take an axe out and fell one of his forwards before I awarded them a penalty.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On my next visit, as the assistants walked down the line-ups doing their equipment check, I shouted: 'Make sure you check for axes, it'll help me with penalty appeals!' He smiled at me. Sir Alex did try to intimidate officials but respected good ones. He encouraged me to continue refereeing after my World Cup cock-up and offered support. He does care about the game and not just Manchester United. The referees should listen to his ideas - they would benefit.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">There are many happy memories of sitting in Fergie's office at their old Cliff training ground. His banter, particularly with Brian Kidd, was the stuff of stand-up comics, especially when the jokes were about who had been the better player. Yet nothing gave him greater pleasure than watching Eric Cantona go through his strict, post-training practice. Of all the players Sir Alex has managed, the Frenchman's skills and presence have given him the greatest pleasure and galvanised the side that won four Premier League titles with him in the team. He loved, too, Cantona's mystery; his use of language and when he said things like: 'The ball is like a woman, she loves to be caressed.' Fergie would drool with admiration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He describes the day, on April 24, 1997, when Cantona told him he intended to quit as a hook to the head and his imagination is still fired by memories of his upturned collar and guardsman's gait. Cantona is on record as saying: 'I want to die from an overdose of love.' Well, Eric, there are few who admired you more than Fergie.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In Ferguson's old office at The Cliff at the end of 1999, his annus mirabilis, he was in a content and reflective mood talking to the Irish Times. He was generous with his time and, as others will confirm, charismatic, friendly, teeming with stories.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The controversial World Club Championship in Brazil was looming - 'we didn't want to go, that's the nuts and bolts of it' - and there was debate about Martin Edwards' intentions, possible Irish ownership, Roy Keane's new contract and Brian Kidd's departure - 'the saddest part of my life here, no question'. Attack and intent have been key Ferguson words but he admitted he had been too hard at times.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'But it suited the environment I was in, at St Mirren and Aberdeen. Coming to Man United I carried on a bit of Aberdeen for a spell. But then I needed to start thinking - this was different, this was expectation, this was big league, this is the biggest.' A line from his recently published autobiography about his time at Aberdeen had referred to the team's 'creative aggression'. It was put to Ferguson that the phrase suited him. He agreed: 'Yeah, that sums me up.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Old Trafford draw against Juventus in the first leg of the 1999 Champions League semi-final looked ominous. For the public record, Fergie acknowledged it would be tough in Turin. But, as we left the press conference, he beckoned me into a small room. 'Have a Scotch,' he said. As we clinked glasses he looked hard at me and said: 'We'll beat 'em over there and we'll go on and win this thing.' 'Maybe,' I said. He grinned: 'Remember Gothenburg.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On that damp May night 16 years earlier, after Alex's upstart Aberdeen beat Real Madrid in the Cup-Winners' Cup Final, Fergie was holding court in the bar and he slapped me on the shoulder: 'Nae bad having an Englishman say cheers for what our wee club has achieved here.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">For more than a quarter of a century, we have drunk to his successes, drowned the odd sorrow, agreed mostly but occasionally argued vigorously. Contrary to the fearsome reputation, he respects opinions, as long as they are expressed honestly. Sure enough, United won 3-2 in Turin and then performed European football's greatest escape against Bayern Munich in the final.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">So, now it's on to the 700th Premier League game. Cheers, Alex - and may there be many more to come.</span></p>

              <h2 style="background-color: #004db3;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">DES KELLY </span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Running Manchester United must feel like a neverending swordfight. To keep on top of it requires a manager who is fiercely committed, driven and bloody minded if needs be.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I had written a story about Eric Cantona's contract, claiming he had asked for assurances about new signings before agreeing to a deal. I was confident the source was very close to the player, and was standing in the car park, chatting to a curious Denis Irwin and Steve Bruce at The Cliff.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Then I heard footsteps thundering down the stairs. The door flew open and an angry Sir Alex Ferguson appeared. Knowing what was coming, Bruce and Irwin were already moving away. Sir Alex then politely explained that he had some reservations about my article.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">No, of course he didn't! He gave me the full treatment. He said he ran the club, nobody else. I said the story was right. He told me I was banned. I explained this was not going to affect me greatly. He banned me some more. Then the gateman put his arm across me and said I had better leave. I said, no problem, but pointed out it wasn't me he should be holding back. At this point, I think we went from hairdryer setting to full Krakatoa.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I understood the fuss. Ferguson was protecting his club, his players and his position. I respected his right to blow his top. Ever since, I've always got on very well with Sir Alex. He is charming, charismatic company. If there were a charity or a cause to support, he'd be among the first I'd ask for help. There isn't another club who wouldn't want a character like him in charge. He is truly the last of his kind.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Hand rebelliously clenched, head tilted to the side, legs wide apart and firmly set as if ready to take on the world, this is Sir Alex Ferguson (back left) holding his first football trophy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Not a piece of glittering silverware, nor even one of those plastic simulations destined to gather dust in a bedroom, but a wooden pencil case which at least had the merit of being useful.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The smiling 11-year-old could not have looked happier had he won the European Cup which, of course, he did by the time it had evolved into the Champions League. And why would he not be grinning? Young Fergie with the cheekychappy face, exhibiting confidence and a hint of arrogance, had scored the goal which won his team the Govan &amp; District Junior Brigade Five-a-Side Tournament. 'I had to give Alex a ticking off at half-time because he missed a few chances,' Johnny Borland told Sportsmail. 'But he responded very well and scored the winner.'</span></p>

              <div class="floatRHS"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/09/article-1310603-0987C1FA000005DC-909_306x400.jpg" alt="John Borland, who was Alex Ferguson's first ever football coach" width="306" height="400"></span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mr Borland (right), then the leader of the 129 Glasgow Company and in charge of the Life Boys team, took the picture which also shows Ferguson's younger brother, Martin. The event took place at Langbank, a village about 10 miles from Paisley.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Alex was a much better player than his brother,' said Mr Borland. 'He was the star. I built our team around him. Once he didn't turn up. I found out that his father had taken him to Ibrox to see Rangers play Fiorentina, if I remember correctly. I told him that if there was a repeat he'd never play for us again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Alex was all go, such a determined boy. He came from a very humble background but he displayed leadership qualities at a young age. I asked him if he'd like to be an officer in the Boy's Brigade. He turned it down, saying the pull of football was too strong.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Borland, one of the heroes left behind at Dunkirk, is 90 years young and still eager and fit enough for chaplaincy work at a Glasgow hospital. Two years ago, he and his family were guests of honour at a dinner hosted by Ferguson on a VIP visit to United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'John Borland was one of the biggest influences on my earlier life,' said Ferguson. 'He was an absolute fanatic for the game. When we went to camp we were given a list of everything we had to bring with us and at the bottom, in big capital letters, he'd put "AND FOOTBALL BOOTS''. As soon as we arrived it would be, "Right, everybody, get your boots on''.' They were a size or two bigger when the 129th won the Glasgow and District Cup, one of Ferguson's strongest childhood memories.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Our manager, JB, bought us all ice creams with double nougat wafers and eating them walking down the Polmadie Road, with our boots tied at the laces and dangling round our necks, was the most exhilarating experience of my young life,' Ferguson wrote in his autobiography.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The rest, as they say, is football history. </span></p>

              <p><strong>United remain unbeaten this term, but it's a statistic which veils a nagging feeling that things could be better - and Reds boss Sir Alex Ferguson wants his men to get the league victories his team's play has warranted.</strong><br><br>The 0-0 Champions League Group C opening draw with Rangers can be assessed in isolation. Ten personnel changes were made to ensure fresh legs for Liverpool's visit on Sunday, while the Gers' ten-men-behind-the-ball approach was always going to a tight game.<br><br>But the lesson of seeing games out in the Premier League - one not heeded against Everton after dropped points at Fulham - is one that Sir Alex says must be addressed. "Sunday is a big game," he says. "The disappointment of last Saturday [at Everton] has to resonate with the players. They can’t make mistakes like that again."<br><br>The boss used a 4-5-1 formation at Goodison Park, while opting for a more traditional 4-4-2 against Rangers. "We have to analyse what we think is the best formation to play on Sunday," he adds. "We have some players in very good form at the moment and that makes it easy for me."<br><br>United's squad was, of course, bolstered by the return on Wednesday night of Wayne Rooney, who was left out against Everton, and Rio Ferdinand, who has been missing for four months with a knee injury. Ryan Giggs says their comebacks are a huge boost and will help the players carry out their manager's request. "It was good to see Rooney and Rio back," he added. "Rio has been out for a while - it's great for him to get some minutes under his belt even though he didn't have a great deal to do."<br><br>Giggs is determined to ensure lessons are learnt after last week's seemingly unlikely draw. That the need to do that is against Liverpool only adds spice to the fixture.</p>
              <p>"It's always a big game but it's even more so after what happened at Everton," says the Welshman. "The fans will be up for it and so will the players, these are the games you want to play in. It's always tough, but hopefully it'll be a good game."<br><br>Darren Fletcher agrees: "It’s a massive occasion – one of the biggest games – and the fans look forward to it. We’ve had some great battles over the years and both teams are tied on 18 league titles. There’s great history between the two clubs. It’s definitely one of those games everybody wants to play in - a real derby match."<br><br>And although this is a fixture for experienced heads, Chris Smalling - who made his Champions League bow against Rangers - is excited to see what it takes to play in another big fixture. He might have to settle for a place on the bench on Sunday, but he's intrigued to see at close quarters how this battle unfolds. "It's going to be a massive game and I'm sure another great atmosphere. We need the victory after what happened at Goodison, and hopefully we can get the job done."</p>
