            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson is convinced that he has built a squad strong enough to withstand the rigours of challenging on all fronts in the second half of the season.<br><br>Although United regained the Premier League title last term, the Reds' lengthy injury list saw them narrowly miss out on further silverware in the Champions League and FA Cup.<br><br>"We felt the draft a bit towards the end of last season," said Sir Alex. "What we tried to do in the summer was make sure we had a squad that was capable of withstanding everything. I think our squad's strong, I like it.<br><br>"You could say we don't have a natural left-back, but John O'Shea proved again (against Sunderland) that he's a fantastic stand-in if we have to play him there. He's got the experience of playing there before, he's got the composure and balance that it's not a problem to play him at left-back."<br><br>Owen Hargreaves, Anderson, Nani and Carlos Tevez were all recruited over a busy summer, and Sir Alex has been delighted with the way they have adapted to life at Old Trafford.<br><br>"They've settled in quicker than we thought, especially with four coming in - with one you're worried enough anyway," he said. "It's much easier for them nowadays, especially at our club because of the level of success we've had.<br><br>"Going back 15 years before we'd won the league it was always difficult for players coming here because they were always looked on as the final piece of the jigsaw. That doesn't apply itself now, so they don't need to worry about that."<br></div>
