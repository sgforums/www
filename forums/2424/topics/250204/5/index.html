Some of the intention behind your posts is very clear.<br><br>Don't think people are stupid and they can't tell, also don't think too cleverly of yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">i've this intention of resting the case but well, just for the sake of answering your questions, after which you might want to lock the thread.<br><br>and hope you won't mind me making it into point form so that your questions gets the proper answers from my point of view<br><br>look, whether its Keii against SS&amp;L or Keii against Gimpheng doesn't going to make any different, the fact is still two wrongs ain't going to make one right. if Gimpheng/SS&amp;L insulting threads around the forum is deem to be the first wrong, wouldn't Keii targetted him (whoever you mean) after he was attacked becomes the second?<br><br>i'm pretty sure SS&amp;L is a clone of someone cause to me at the very least he must be the clone of version-1 SS&amp;L but i can't be sure about Gimpheng or Keii or even myself, cause i was said in another thread that i could very likely be a clone of gimpheng, so should i attacked the guy that calls me a clone? wouldn't it leads to two wrong ain't going make one right thingy again? so who does your "them" referred to?<br><br>political issue? you got to be kidding, if i have intention of making politics i wouldn't have even bothered to post in here, maybe you guys lives too much in the forum to even think that forums are worth so much to have politics in them.<br><br>Permier members having the same treatment as ordinary members? who are you trying to kid? did he even got a public caution for his action?<br><br>i'm not bothered with others having the impression that i'm trying to get keii ban cause why should i? and like i said, my only concern is why did a guy whom posted a name calling and insulting of fellow forumer's parent thread got away freely and yet comes back to challenge the system around here by crying out Ban me! Ban me!?<br><br>while i'm just simply giving a passing remarks you gets takes it as if its a call for his head kind of thread. let it rest i will, as for staying cool? nah... guess i've taken enough chill pills to have any effect on such matters.<br><br>chill out.<br><br></div></blockquote>I am glad that you have every intention of resting this...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   And yeah i don't mind you making it into point form...<br><br>2 wrong doesn't make a right. Well you said it, so does 1 wrong make a right? Obviously not right... You seem to be a bit confuse by what some here are saying... Weather its SSL or Keii or Ghimpheng there is no difference?<br><br>Well, i think there is a lot of difference. Keii and Ghimpheng are not known to be clones at least not to the extent of SSL. Wouldn't you agree? Moreover whatever happen between Keii and GP is between themselves. You seem to forget that this is an open forum where different views are exchanged on a daily basis... If you are going to ban Keii, you might as well ban Gp and a few others along the line as well... Then where do you stop?<br><br>SSL is a different case, he is a well known clone, like i have said earlier he goes around to afew different forum folders to create trouble by spamming indiscriminately besides insulting others on his titles and it not just to one person but a few others. Can't you see the huge difference?<br><br>Keii is a p-member, so? Does it make him any different? And i am not kidding... Your point to highlight this a few times over seems like you are very much bothered by it... Now you are even seem to be coming across to suggest that the admin are favouring him in some way...<br><br>So Keii posted Ban me! Ban me!... So what? I guess he was probably piss that someone actually created a thread to ask or suggest that he be ban when he hardly deserve it... But were the words inflaming to anyone? I guess it could be but seriously doubt so to most people... but maybe to the one who created the thread it may come across like a smack in the face. But I personally found it funny actually in a light hearted way by his cavalier approach to it. You shouldn't be too upset by his reply too, just take it as a playful reply will do.<br><br>Like i have said in my earlier post... This is over, let it rest... people have moved on... Keii don't even bother to reply anymore so why do you still persist... I guess the people here already knows your opinion on this matter and we will respect it... So time to move on wouldn't you agree my friend...<br><br>Be cool...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
