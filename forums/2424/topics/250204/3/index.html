First of all, the flaming isn't happening here, it happened at a what was suppose to be a normal match discussion thread between Man Utd v Middlesbro' and another in the Chelsea forum.<br><br>This thread was created by a united fan with regards to another united fan... It has nothing to do with GP for that matter, if there was anything it could be just a passing reference to his behaviour at most from those other threads in another forum folder. I only came to know about this thread when it was well into its second page. It was late, people in here were having some light fun joking about something else (Do read back if you had missed it, i notice you have this tendency), there was nothing whatsoever with reference to GP. So please don't come here and act as though it had something to do with GP...<br><br>I am glad you brought out that thread, that has been my intention all along and it still is. You don't see me going around flaming him do you? I don't even bother to reply to his taunting when united loses. (Note: He actually comes in here for that purpose knowing that most united fans will be here) So you have to realise that one has to also be responsible for one's act. The way he has conducted himself, Its not just the Man u fans that are unhappy with him, Pool fans, Gunners fans and even the Chelsea fans and Mods have a problem with his ways... I don't deny that sometime i would like to have a go at him too but i control myself and refrain from doing so but not everyone can do so if he constantly comes knocking at you right?<br><br>Lets not try to be hypocritical about this... Your history in this forum with regards to flaming isn't something that can give you a pedestal to speak on this matter. I do really hope there would come a time when should Man u loses and we are disappointed, we can still discuss it among ourselves with other non-united fans in here genuinely discussing the merits of the game rather than for the sole purpose to taunt the people in here.<br><br>My time in Sgforum is obviously not as long as in your case, perhaps you care to give us your take on this matter too? Do you find his behaviour acceptable to your standard? He going around creating troubles with others like Poolman, DMI, Stell, eemtij, most of the head mods of different folder? And i am not asking you about who start first alright cos there won't be any end to that, just the way he replies to them and others here will do... Calling others here stupid, dog, pervert and many more names... these are all fine by you? Cos All i see is you always coming out to defend his behaviour, So you condone it? And if not why haven't you said a word to him?<br><br>I must say the situation has improved very much over the months, we don't see silly post in Sports nowadays and this is probable due to the Sports mod doing a great job discouraging such stuff to degrade its forum... When chelsea wasn't doing so well in Dec and Jan, do you see people going around flaming him? Well no, not to such extremes. But the thing is... these things is like a vicious circle, if he starts coming around with the sole purpose of taunting others when they are not doing well, then do you seriously expect others to give him a break when his time comes?<br><br>Many here have tried to reason with him from the start but strangely, it is always returned with some kind of personal attacks to the individual making it worse. I just can't wait to see the way he will behave should Chelsea win (which is very possible in my mind considering the injuries and away matches united have)... It will tell us if he learn anything from this whole episode. There is nothing wrong with being happy among your own but to taunt others...<br><br>And for your info, as a mod, it is not my responsibility to tell others what to do and what not to, I can only try to discourage things like the thread you have highlighted but at the end of the day, they have their rights too. I am a believer in free speech, and if they are happy to discuss it among themselves, then they should be given the right to.<br><br>As to your take on ratings... Let me tell you once more, it isn't very important to me at all, If there is great, if there isn't... its no big deal to me... Ratings and numbers isn't going to change a thing to what we do in this forum... I am more interested with having people sharing a discussion of common interest. It make more sense... Only a shallow mind would take the ratings too serious.<br><br>Ultimately we are all here for the fun of it, so having ratings with no fun i would say is a silly thing to be in a forum for... Lastly, do not be mistaken, i am not asking for anyone to get ban or leave this forum least of all GP, i am just stating how i perceive things currently to be thats all. And i find it odd that you would pick on me when there are others here... and as i have said, i only came into this when it was well into its 2nd page.<br><br>Mods do keep this thread open, as there is nothing offensive on this threads to warrant a close. Moreover, i like to hear his reply to this too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
