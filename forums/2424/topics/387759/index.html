              <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak says confidence is high that they can retain their Premier League crown.</p>
              <p>The Polish international is currently enjoying a run in the first team with Edwin van der Sar away on compassionate leave and Ben Foster kicking his heels on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>Kuszczak remains confident, despite the fact they dropped further points in a 1-1 draw at Birmingham at the weekend.</p>
              <p>"The league is really tough this year. There's not much to choose between quite a few of the big sides," said Kuszczak.</p>
              <p>"We have to just make sure we pick up as many points as we can so we have a big say on the destination of the Premier League title.</p>
              <p>"There is obviously still a feeling we can finish the season as champions. The league is very close and everyone will drop points.</p>
              <p>"It's not as simple as it was a few years ago. There are a lot of games to play. But I still think we are the ones the others have to beat."</p>

              <p><strong>He may have been relegated to the bench for the first time in 12 games, but Tomasz Kuszczak still drew resounding support in the aftermath of United’s win over Burnley.<br><br></strong>Edwin van der Sar, while delighted to be back in action after two months, took time out to sing the praises of the man who kept goal with such distinction in his absence.<br><br>“I have to say, Tomasz Kuszczak did excellently in difficult circumstances,” the Dutchman told <em>MUTV</em>. “There were a lot of players missing – sometimes eight or nine defenders – and he had to play behind a back four or three consisting entirely of midfielders. I have to give him a big compliment for that. It wasn’t easy and I think he did very well.”<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson echoed van der Sar’s sentiments, before explaining exactly how important it was to have the Dutchman back for the remainder of the season.<br><br>“Tomasz has done fantastically for us, and it's no slight at all on Tomasz when you say that Edwin made a difference,” the United manager said. “He's 39 years of age, he's got 130 caps to prove that experience and two European Cup winner’s medals from four finals.<br><br>"You could go on and on about his record – it's a fantastic career he's had. It showed again today. What a performance – steady, his decision-making, his use of the ball… magnificent, unbelievable.”</p>
