              <p>I do see ur points, but it seems, that for this time, SAF is "tricking" the referee to unconsciously add in the time for one final MU push than to "take" time out.</p>

              <p><br>Substitutions are allocated 30 seconds almost every one knows this i guess... Most substitutions are done before the 90 therefore the "extra time" added at the end together with any injury time. You are also correct that sometimes a sub is made during added time to waste time, but how they waste time could be slowly walking off and slowly getting into position but the referee could still stop his watch or add time onto it I guess... There is nothing wrong to it... If a player gets injured during added time and stays down for 2 mins, I belief 2 mins will be added onto the added time as well... And if you are allocated time before the 90, then I don't see any reason why you don't get after the 90...</p>
              <p>Ferguson was not pleased that Martin Atkinson was appointed for Sunday’s derby, a man he still believed eliminated United from the FA Cup against Portsmouth two seasons ago. A penalty should have been given but he didn't gave...</p>
              <p>Laws of the game are specific in saying that “the allowance for time lost is at the discretion of the referee” and so Atkinson cannot be faulted technially for finding an extra 2 minutes in addition to the four minutes he allowed at the end of the second half... City's celebrations and Carrick's substitutions and United's own celebrations are good reason for the added time I guess... At the end, only the losers will try to make it an excuse... But they can only blame themselves for not keeping their defence well until the final whistle...</p>

              <p>Like replacing a tired player... or adding someone who has other qualities to the replaced player? Like better crossing, penalty takers or free-kick takers or a long range shooter or even just to disrupt the opponent's momentum and formation...</p>
              <p>Bottomline is, there is no reason you are not allow to use up your 3 subs... Maybe even just put in a more experienced player for a young one like in this case... Or it could even be just adding Carrick's game count to the season? lol</p>

              Sunday’s derby, a man he still believed eliminated United from
              the FA Cup against Portsmouth two seasons ago. A penalty
              should have been given but he didn't gave...</p>
              <p>Laws of the game are specific in saying that “the allowance for
              time lost is at the discretion of the referee” and so Atkinson
              cannot be faulted technially for finding an extra 2 minutes in
              addition to the four minutes he allowed at the end of the second
              half... City's celebrations and Carrick's substitutions and
              United's own celebrations are good reason for the added time I
              guess... At the end, only the losers will try to make it an
              excuse... But they can only blame themselves for not keeping their
              defence well until the final whistle...</p>

              <p>Well said.</p>
              <p>While it's true that the ref seemed to add too much time, that's still hardly an excuse for Man City to let in the final goal. It was their own weak defence that let in the goal. They could have parked a bus in front of their own goal and just soak up every Man U attack to get away with one point.</p>
              <p>Want to blame the referee also, it can still be argued that he did it within reasonable limits, and it is up to him as to how much should be added. I remember a World Cup match many years ago where the referee added almost <em>nine</em> minutes.</p>
              <p>If Man City had scored in the 96th minute, would Mark Hughes be complaining over the extra time? No.....</p>

              <p>Man City has the fire power, but defence-wise, probably needs 1 or 2 top class defenders to balance the team.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>this match confirmed one thing. foster is not ready and suited to the stage at man utd. he is a good goalie with potential, but not a great one. utd need a great goalie like VDS or Peter Schmeical type. Foster reminds me of the potential of Carroll and Howard many years ago, but they didnt make it at Utd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foster would do well at watford or even Blackburn or Sunderland, but not at the top 4 clubs. how many times have you seen foster fumbled, coming out to punch the ball to an opponent, or his kicking problems reminded me of Bosnich, not to mention his slow decision making and his lack of confidence in his right leg. If he indeed succeed VDS as utd no 1, I think he will costs utd progression to CL or worse, the league title.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remmeber Carroll fumbling at 2005 CL at OT against AC Milan, scored by the on loan crespo. what about howard fumbled a shot against Porto in the last minute of the CL in 2004.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope fergie dun make his previous goalie mistake again and better bid for buffon or cech to succeed VDS long term, however much they costs. if a lesser goalie than Peter Schmeical was in goal at the CL 99 finals against bayern, bayern would have won the match. It was schmeical who kept utd in the match before 2 injury time goal won it for utd. goalie is especially important, as his saves and heroics will account for either winning or losing the match or titles. if not, why fergie go buy VDS in 2005 and not kept faith in howard then? because he knew that howard doesnt have what it takes to do well at a top club. remember Taibi lol</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal is a case in point. Almunia is good, but not a great goalie. He has made quite a few fumbles in goalkeeping. i rate Lehman better than Almunia although Lehman is also dodgy at times. If Arsenal want to win trophies, better find a great goalie. Great goalie also made mistakes sometimes, but their presence inspire confidence and their saves can win you matches.</p>

              <p>the problem is foster is already quite limited in his skills, does he really think he is as skilled as barthez, who often tried to fool and dribble past strikers charging in? Does he really think he is really a top class goalie? I think not. Look how many times he hesitated, slow decision making and his right feet simply cannot make it. Barthez is so much better in his right foot kicking than foster. I hope this once and for all, prove that he simply isnt suitable to be utd no 1 goalie after VDS retire. If not, we are going to relive the days of carroll, howard, bosnich and taibi all over again.</p>

              <p>there is also a lack of communication betwen ferdinand and foster, as they are quite near each other when the ball came in. if foster wants to claim the ball he should have sprinted out and he sort of like hesitated and then chut pattern when he realised tevez is so damn near him to challenge for the ball.</p>

              <p>championship and BPL or EPL, the gulf is so wide you know lol. he did well while on loan at watford just goes to show that he is only suited for clubs like watford or burnley and not utd. the stage is too big for him to fill at utd. besides he is not as talented as others said he is. I see a top goalie when I see one, cos class is permanent, form is temporary. foster sadly neither has form nor class. does fergie want to kid himself when he said foster can be england no 1 at next year world cup lol. its true that confidence plays a part, cos he has little confidence in his own ability, as he know he is not in the same class as Reina or Cech or VDS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Time for Thomas Kucszak to claim the goalie jersey before VDS returned from his injury. Its fair that Thommo is given the chance to show what he can do, since foster time and again fumble.</p>
