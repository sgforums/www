              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Michael Owen stole the show in a derby for the ages as Manchester United defeated Manchester City 4-3 and demonstrated why the team from Old Trafford remain the city's dominant force.</strong></p>
              <p>We came wondering about Carlos Tevez, we prepared to sing the praises of Darren Fletcher, then a City draw and United's shocking defensive errors. In the end, we were talking about Owen.</p>
              <p>In the fifth minute of stoppage-time, when England's fourth highest scorer had been shunted so far down the list of talking points he was not even worth a mention, the substitute strode onto Ryan Giggs' precise pass, looked up and calmly found the bottom right corner.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson danced, Mark Hughes looked punch drunk. One of the most eagerly awaited Manchester derbies had become one of the most dramatic.</p>
              <p>Hughes was sick, angrily asking how referee Martin Atkinson had managed to come up with so much additional time. He, more than anyone, knows what United can do with it.</p>
              <p>It left the rest rather superfluous. For the record, United led three times but on each occasion were pegged back thanks to their own idiotic mistakes. Carlos Tevez left the field laughing. But only because Anderson was winding him up.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has put forward a rather disparaging assessment of Tevez's time at Old Trafford, highlighting why he did not feel the Argentina star was worth the £25million United eventually offered to pay.</p>
              <p>Yet the Scot's assessment centred around Tevez's goals output. No-one could ever quibble at his work-rate. It was one of the reasons that made him such a hero among the Old Trafford faithful and why the City fans were so quick to acknowledge talent beyond the obvious humour of signing a player Ferguson was urged time and again last season to sign up.</p>
              <p>That knowledge left Ben Foster with no excuse for the truly abysmal error of judgement that gifted City their equaliser.</p>
              <p>Even Joleon Lescott turned away in disappointment as his long pass bounced into no man's land. Foster clearly felt it would eventually run into the area, which was a debatable point in itself.</p>
              <p>Eventually, Foster realised more urgent action was required as Tevez stormed in, just as he should have expected. Any chance of redemption disappeared as Tevez nicked the ball away from Foster's grasp as he tried to reach the safety of his area, and slipped a pass to Gareth Barry which the England midfielder gleefully swept home.</p>
              <p>The mistake was made worse by the knowledge Foster had already received one warning, when he got his wires crossed with Nemanja Vidic and allowed Tevez to half-block a long punt downfield.</p>
              <p>Foster might have genuine hopes of becoming United's number one goalkeeper and going to the World Cup. In one moment of madness, he might have blown them.</p>
              <p>An errant Wayne Rooney backheel might not have been of the same magnitude but its consequences were almost equally dire for United.</p>
              <p>Kolo Toure strode onto the loose ball and fed Tevez for the opportunity to score a goal that would have left Ferguson distraught and humiliated in equal measure.</p>
              <p>Tevez thought his shot was going in. To his frustration - and Ferguson's relief, it bounced to safety off the post.</p>
              <p>It had all looked so different 43 minutes earlier.</p>
              <p>United made a bright start, with Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov looking particularly threatening, when Shaun Wright-Phillips let Patrice Evra run free at a quickly-taken Ryan Giggs throw-in.</p>
              <p>Evra fed Rooney, who had the strength to wriggle past Toure and Nigel de Jong before prodding home from close range.</p>
              <p>At that point, the noise was deafening. If anything, the volume had gone even further up the scale at the end of a awesome first seven minutes of the second half as United got their noses in front, only to be pegged back once more.</p>
              <p>Fletcher did the damage for Ferguson's team, rising above Barry to power home a Giggs' curling cross.</p>
              <p>Yet, just as the hosts looked set to take control, with Park Ji-sung and Giggs going close, Craig Bellamy thundered home an equaliser.</p>
              <p>Bellamy had been buzzing around in his inimitable manner, but there was no doubting the stamp of class on his 20-yard strike as he collected Tevez's short pass, cut inside John O'Shea and drilled into the top right corner. This time Foster was blameless.</p>
              <p>But there was so much drama still to come. Fletcher thought he had won it as he powered home a second header, again from a Giggs cross, 10 minutes from time.</p>
              <p>Yet the suicidal tendencies in United ranks had not gone away. Rio Ferdinand attempted an idle chip a minute from time, but found Barry instead. Barry released Bellamy, who ran 60 yards before tucking past Foster. It seemed City had come through their biggest test yet. Not on your life.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Owen stole the show in a derby for the ages as Manchester United defeated Manchester City 4-3 and demonstrated why the team from Old Trafford remain the city's dominant force.</strong></p>
              <p>Michael Owen believes he proved his dedication to Manchester United with his dramatic last-gasp winner against Manchester City at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Owen spent eight years playing for United's bitter rivals Liverpool but Sir Alex Ferguson signed him this summer - and the 29-year-old scored his second goal for the club to seal a 4-3 win deep in stoppage-time against City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When asked if that would confirm hero status with United fans, Owen told Sky Sports: "Yes, if there was any doubt before then maybe. It was always going to create noise when I joined but even if the fans didn't take to me you're never going to pass up an opportunity to play for team like this."</p>

              <p><strong>City equalised three times before Owen struck. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring before Gareth Barry took advantage of Ben Foster's error. Darren Fletcher scored two headers, with Craig Bellamy levelling twice for the visitors.</strong></p>
              <p>"We dominated and the lads played well for a lot of the game," Owen added. "There were individual mistakes but over the years before I was here the defence has been fantastic."</p>
              <p>Fletcher added: "It was an unbelievable match, we showed great character to come back. The goals were mistakes but we look at the positives - we showed character to the end."</p>

              <p>seriously, I think too much time were added, it should have stand as a 3-3. but it was nothing MU did but all up to the referees. So any ABUs, please direct ur arrows @ the right places.</p>

              <p>well, for a start, I can see Ferdinand not 100% fit, and playing him was a big gamble. U can see he wasn't totally comfortable with kicking and running.</p>
              <p>I do agree, with Palmer that while at watford, Foster was one of the better players, but at MU, a different stage, every mistake is magnified and could be potential lose the match, and hence with that pressure, Foster is either going to prove he can or he can't.at this moment, he can't.</p>
              <p>Every striker is going to "challenge" when the ball is played to Foster's right, like Tevez. And he is yet to prove he can.</p>
              <p>Secondly, for bellamy's goal, I noticed this foster seems to favor two handed dives than ones. if it was EDS, I bet he would have used his left to stretch and deflect the ball.</p>

              <p>I tink we have to look at it this way, the extra 2 plus mins was first for City's goal celebrations... That one took like 1 min, then there was Carrick's sub during added time, that one got 30 seconds... So when Owen scored on 5:24 mins, probably an added min was given for the United's goal celebrations as well... So its really no big deal, only the unhappy ones will try to make an issue of it... But if they think carefully, its quite silly to even make it... lol</p>

              <p><br>that's true.....if nothing had happened at all for the entire 4 mins of added time, then the whistle would have gone on 4 min plus plus. But I'd have to say that the referee had been generous too. He could have blown on the 5th min but allowed united to keep attacking. He gave united the advantage.</p>
