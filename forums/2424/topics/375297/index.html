              <p>Tevez &amp; Robinho may not be playing due to injury. Adebayor may be banned for 3 matches. guess they will be short on quality strikers for this match.</p>
              <p>if utd plays like how they did against tottenham, we shd get the 3 points.</p>

              <p class="article">The FA is today set to charge the Manchester City star for the Van Persie 
              incident and goal celebration in front of Arsenal fans.</p>
              <p class="article">United's management are urging the FA to act so Adebayor misses Sunday's derby 
              at Old Trafford. He could be banned for a total of six games if charged and 
              found guilty.</p>
              <p class="article">United boss Alex Ferguson will be without Paul Scholes against City after he 
              was sent off for two bookings at Tottenham.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie felt Scholes had been sent off because of his reputation. He said: "I 
              am not getting into whether or not a player should have been sent off.</p>
              <p class="article">"Inconsistency and decision-making is part of the game, what makes it 
              interesting."</p>
              <p class="article">And SunSport has learned City were warned about Adebayor's behaviour BEFORE 
              Saturday's powder-keg clash at Eastlands.</p>
              <p class="article">Ref Mark Clattenberg spoke to City captain Kolo Toure and coach Mark Bowen 
              about the striker before kick-off and that could count against Adebayor.</p>
              <p class="article">Police also want FA bosses to throw the book at Adebayor.</p>
              <p class="article">Former Met Police commander John O'Connor said: "I am sure the police will 
              want Adebayor to be made an example of.</p>
              <p class="article">"From a police perspective, Adebayor could have been arrested and then charged 
              with actual body harm for the incident with Van Persie. He would then have 
              faced the prospect of standing trial in court."</p>
              <p class="article">City boss Mark Hughes rapped: "The referee had a great view of the challenge 
              and deemed it not worthy of a card."</p>
              <p class="article">Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore admitted: "These instances 
              don't do the image of the league or football in general any good."</p>

              <h2>EVRA HOPING FOR TEVEZ REUNION</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/09/240/Carlos-Tevez-Manchester-City-Premier-League_2356943.jpg" border="0" alt="Carlos Tevez - major doubt."></div>
              <p><br><br>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Patrice Evra is ready to join in the booing of Carlos Tevez if his good friend turns out in Sunday's Manchester derby. Tevez is a major doubt for the eagerly-anticipated showdown between United and City at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>With both clubs currently in the Premier League's top four and City riding the crest of a wave created by their £120million summer spending spree, there would have been more interest on both sides of the city, even without Tevez's controversial move from red to blue.</p>
              <p>Despite the South American's change of allegiance, the friendship Evra struck up with Tevez remains. But, acknowledging the reception Tevez is likely to get if he does recover from a knee injury picked up on World Cup duty earlier this month, Evra is only going to make it worse.</p>
              <p>"I have been joking with him about the reception he will get," said Evra. "I don't know if the fans will boo him or clap him. He did a great job at Manchester United. He respected the shirt and the fans understand that. "But if they boo him I will join in."</p>
              <p>As usual, Evra's comments are delivered with a beaming smile. There has been plenty of laughter between the pair, who formed a somewhat unlikely alliance with Park Ji-sung during their time together at United, as they contemplated Sunday's game, the first time in almost 40 years the two clubs have met on almost equal footing.</p>
              <p>It is clear, despite reaching two Champions League finals and winning a couple of league titles during his 'loan' spell with United, Tevez is now firmly in the blue camp. "I have had a message from him saying they are going to win. I am not so sure," said Evra. "I just hope he plays. It will be special to play against him because he is such a good friend. "But he is a City player now and we cannot let him beat Manchester United."</p>
              <p>Evra may not be a Mancunian but he has been around the city long enough to understand the passion each set of supporters has for their club. And he could hardly not be aware of the jaw-dropping impact the Abu Dhabi United Group have had at Eastlands since they bought the club just over a year ago.</p>
              <p>It is why Evra is not alone in believing that match will have more spice than has been the case for a number of years. "The game is more special this season," he said. "When we have played them before they have never been in the top four. "This year it is a big mission of City's to play in the Champions League. "They have not lost yet, so they will come to Old Trafford with a lot of confidence. It will be an amazing game and it is a big challenge. I hope we are ready."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson certainly has plenty of options. Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand, Darren Fletcher and John O'Shea were among those not required to change out of their suits last night, while Wayne Rooney might not have been too happy to sit out the final half hour of United's 1-0 win over Besiktas but Ferguson knows he will be fresh for battle.</p>
              <p>And, one thing that should not be much of a surprise given United's experience on the banks of the Bosphorus is the atmosphere. Sir Alex Ferguson described the noise made by the Besiktas fans as the loudest he has experienced in his long career.</p>
              <p>Evra is not about to disagree. "It was an amazing atmosphere," he said. "At the end I clapped the supporters because the noise was just incredible. "If you are not excited to play a game like that you never will be. "This wall of noise was there from the moment we began our warm-up right until the final whistle."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson does not care whether Carlos Tevez recovers from his knee injury or not - because </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong>'s best player will miss the derby-day showdown with </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>United </strong></span><strong>at Old Trafford on Sunday.</strong> </p>
              <p>While Tevez has created all the cross-club headlines this summer with the acrimonious manner in which he moved from United to City, Ferguson has identified Emmanuel Adebayor as the main danger.   </p>

              <p><strong>The £25million striker has scored in all four games as the Blues opened their Premier League campaign with a 100 per cent record. Now though he is consigned to watch from the sidelines after picking up a three-match ban for his awful tackle on Robin van Persie last weekend.</strong>  </p>
              <p>'I am not bothered whether Tevez plays or not - Manchester City's best player won't be playing,' said Ferguson. 'Adebayor is their star player, there is no question about that. He has scored in every game so far.'  </p>
              <p>Ferguson repeated his assertion that City behaved in an 'arrogant and cocky' manner when they displayed their infamous Tevez "Welcome to Manchester" poster in the city's main shopping area this summer. </p>
              <p>'That stupid poster upset us,' he said. 'It showed an arrogance. It was naughty.</p>
              <p>'It showed a cockiness that wasn't required at the time because they hadn't done anything. The season hadn't even started.'</p>

              <h1>£9,000 EACH TO BEAT UNITED</h1>
              <h2>Manchester moneybags have already forked out £459,000</h2>
              <div class="image-holder"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00057/barry_blue_516x350_57946a.jpg" alt="Barry: Derby day bonus" width="516" height="350"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>MONEYBAGS Manchester City have paid their players a staggering £459,000 in bonuses already this season. </h3>
              <p>In addition to their sky-high salaries, City's stars - like Gareth Barry (right) - are on a jaw-dropping £9,000 a man to beat Manchester United today. </p>
              <p>The club's owner Sheikh Mansour will fork out £99,000 to the starting line-up if they beat United - plus another £27,000 if all three substitutes are used. City's bonus system is by far the biggest in the Premier League - outstripping the £5,000 paid at Chelsea and £4,000 at United. </p>
              <p>The bonus structure - which was registered with the Premier League at the start of the season - guarantees the players £3,000 a point. </p>
              <p>Just one month into the season, ever-presents such as Shay Given, Kolo Toure (bottom) and Craig Bellamy (below) have already bagged an extra £36,000 each. </p>
              <p>The club's annual wage bill smashed through the £100million a year barrier in the summer. </p>
              <p>If they finish in the top four of the Premier League, City will be committed to paying around £4m in bonuses to their players. </p>
              <p>City's scheme blows their rivals out of the water and is another indication of the club's financial clout under Sheikh Mansour and their intention to shake up the Big Four at the top of the Premier League. </p>
              <p>Even non-playing substitutes get in on the act and are paid around £300 for each point secured in the Premier League. </p>
              <p>City's players are also on £200,000 a man to win the title, with further incentives for FA Cup or Carling Cup glory. </p>
              <p>Manchester City's forgotten man Roque Santa Cruz is being lined up for a return to training this week. </p>
              <p>The Paraguayan striker has yet to play for City since his £18m capture from Blackburn in the summer. </p>
              <p>He needed surgery on a knee problem that had bothered him most of last season and is only now coming back to fitness. </p>
              <p>Santa Cruz is expected to play in a reserve clash in two weeks' time before stepping in Mark Hughes' first team plans.</p>

              <p>Man Utd is the overwhelming favourites to win this tie after Ade is banned. even if he is not banned, man utd is also favourite to win at home. Tevez is not 100% match fit, he may start or be on the bench, but when he come on, he will be relying on emotions to last the match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have confidence in Vidic and Ferdinand shackling Tevez if he play. Rooney is on fire, hope he score his hat trick tonight.</p>
