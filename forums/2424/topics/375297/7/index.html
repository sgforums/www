              <p>if above average players can improve, can keep them as squad players, like o shea, utd utility player. but foster he will not be given time to proof himself as utd played in high tempo matches every week. foster kicking,, decision making and coming out to punch balls are things he need to improve fast.</p>

              <p>Fletcher is probably the most improved player I have seen over the last 2, 3 year at United... And to think Roy Keane said he wasn't good enough... Now he is even better than a lot of DM liao... Today he even scored 2 goals... and I expect him to start scoring even more as the season goes on...</p>

              <p>Fergie and Arsene share one thing in common: vision. Adebayor was nothing when he was at monaco. Same for fabregas from barca. Viera at ac milan too. OMG the list goes on.</p>
