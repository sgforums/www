            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>FOSTER PREPARED TO WAIT</strong></span><br><br>Ben Foster is prepared to accept spending a season as Edwin van der Sar's understudy in order to improve his chances of becoming Manchester United's number one in the future.<br><br>Foster's stock has risen during his two years out on loan at Watford and he is being tipped to take over from Van der Sar at United.<br><br><strong>That is unlikely to happen next season, as the Dutchman is not ready to step aside, but Foster is prepared to bide his time.</strong><br><br>"It will be massively disappointing," he told Sky Sports News. "I have had two good seasons out on loan and love playing week in and week out, being first-choice goalkeeper.<br><br>"I love everything that goes with it, you get so much confidence knowing you are going to play every Saturday.<br><br>"You can go out so confident knowing you are a great goalkeeper, whereas if you only get the odd game you know you have got to impress and it comes with a bit of added pressure.<br><br><strong>"But in the long run I have got to look at my long-term future at United and hopefully it is going to lie there and if it means spending a season on the bench and biding my time, then so be it."</strong><br><br>Foster is aware that his international hopes are likely to nosedive if he is left to kick his heels on the bench.<br><br>"If you are not playing, you can't expect to be picked for your national team and that is part and parcel of playing for England," admitted Foster.<br><br>"You have to be playing and playing well and if you are not playing, then you can't expect to be picked."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Edwin should retire gloriously after the next season and it's time for Foster to step up and take his place as United's number 1 shot-stopper. But Foster has to learn to cut down his mistakes - like the one against Man City, clearing the ball straight at Vasell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would be a bit worried if Foster takes over the No.1 next season... Clearly he is not ready yet... He still makes quite a number of mistakes at Watford... The one difference is at Watford when he make a mistake... not many would take notice But if at United, it would be played over and over on the tv, mentioned frequently on the papers... the pressure will be much more than where he is now at Watford...<br><br>And of course, with such pressure it could effect his performance in his following matches... We have seen many good keepers doing well at a smaller club but when they move to bigger clubs... The seem to lose their skill... Maybe someone like David James.</div>

I bet he stayed with EVS cause he has no other choice. But not to allow foster to be further on loan has signifies his desire to change and give EVS some challenge.<br><br>To me, EVS,or another keeper could have saved some of those Milan's goals.<br>Imagine Crech there.. I bet he would have done better.<br><br>I was disappointed at how EVS performed in the last few matches.. Yes, he did come up with a few world-class saves, let's not denied that.<br>But for those which end up in the net, he could have made a difference but the fact is he didn't.<br><br>Well, he still have one more game to prove me wrong, FA CUP Finals, where is is up against Crech. Let's see then..<br><br></div>
