              <p>The 20-year-old will join United subject to passing a medical later in the week.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils have already agreed a deal with Bebe's current employers Vitoria Guimaraes.</p>
              <p>Personal terms have also been ironed out, paving the way for the move to be completed.</p>
              <p>The youngster will move to England for an undisclosed fee, bolstering United's attacking unit in the process.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">

              <p>Bebe had been recommended to the United boss by the club's former assistant manager <a class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Carlos+Queiroz/?section=football">Carlos Queiroz,</a><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon  lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> who is now in charge of the Portugal national side.</p>
              <p>He
               has shown his potential during pre-season with a number of well-taken 
              goals and will bring power and pace to the Red Devils' frontline.</p>
              <p>His
               arrival does come as something of a surprise, though, as United already
               have eight senior strikers on their books and Ferguson has often stated
               that he was not looking to add to his squad.</p>

              <p>I guess this was a case of, he didn't intend to buy but this boy was brought to his knowledge by Queiroz and after watching him, decided to take him now before others start to hover around him...</p>
              <p>I don't see any harm having another young striker, cos if he is good enough, he can still make it to the top. And if he does, he can save them a lot of money...</p>

              <p><strong>The 20 year-old arrives at Old Trafford from Portuguese club Vitória de Guimarães, with </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>United</strong></span></a><strong> having agreed to pay the buyout clause to release Bébé from his five-year contract.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The player – a relative unknown outside his native country – only arrived at Guimarães in July, and it is a mark of Sir Alex Ferguson’s enthusiasm that he was prepared to spend that sort of sum on a player who has spent most of his career playing in the Portuguese third division.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Bébé was recommended to Ferguson by his former assistant, the Portugal manager Carlos Queiroz.</p>
              <p>Bebe, 20, who spent part of his childhood on the streets before being raised in an orphanage. The 6ft 2in hitman. </p>
              <p>Bebe - real name Tiago Manuel Dias Correia - will rubberstamp his switch to Old Trafford after a medical.</p>
              <p>His arrival takes United’s spending since the end of last season to £25 million. Ferguson has already added former Fulham defender Chris Smalling and Javier Hernández to his squad.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is reported to have met the player for the first time only on Tuesday, when he was in Portugal to be a witness for Queiroz in a disciplinary case with the Portuguese Football Federation.</p>
              <p>United remain interested in Mesut Özil, the Germany international, although they face competition from Barcelona for his signature.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span>’s latest signing, Bébé, has taken an amazing journey from a youth shelter on the outskirts of Lisbon and playing for a team of "homeless" to the peak of world football.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The 20 year-old is living proof of the transformative effect for good that football can have even in an age when reports are dominated by ownership bids, leveraging deals and six-figure weekly salaries for some players.</p>
              <p>“I am very happy. I had the dream of playing, one day, for a major club. That dream has come true,” he said. “Football can change lives, very much.”</p>
              <p>It was while living in Casa Do Gaiato, a respected shelter for young people on the outskirts of the Portuguese capital that he was invited with three other boys to play football with CAIS, a partner organisation of the Homeless World Cup, though he never actually played in the competition proper.</p>
              <p>He was later spotted by third division Portuguese club Estrela Amadora after impressing for amateur side Loures.</p>
              <p>Moving through the youth ranks to the senior side there, the Cacem-born striker attracted the interest of a number of top level clubs in Portugal, as well as a host of European heavyweights including Real Madrid and United, before signing on a free transfer last month with Vitoria Guimaraes, whom <span style="color: #000000;">United paid an undisclosed fee, believed to be £7.4m</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson was alerted to the forward’s talent by former assistant manager and now coach of the Portugal national team Carlos Queiroz.</p>
              <p>“Bébé is responsible, with one big heart and an all round awesome boy,” says Gonçalo Sequeira dos Santos, a CAIS member and manager of Portugal’s Homeless World Cup Team.</p>
              <p>“We are truly happy for this opportunity he has to make his dream come true and improving his life.”</p>
              <p>The fairy-tale rise from the streets to the Theatre of Dreams is as surprising as it is heart-warming and owes much to the efforts of grassroots workers in the game, specifically CAIS.</p>
              <p>The Homeless World Cup is an annual world class international football tournament working with 64 national grass roots football projects to reach 30,000 homeless players.</p>
              <p>The next edition of the event takes place from Sept 19-26 2010 on Copacabana Beach in Rio.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United chief executive David Gill admits the club's prospective new signing Bebe has "come from nowhere".</strong></p>
              <p>Bebe's imminent arrival - subject to passing a medical - comes just a matter of weeks after he signed for Vitoria Guimaraes on a free transfer and Gill is frank about the whirlwind nature of a deal that is reportedly worth in the region of £7million.</p>
              <p>"He's a player we've been following, but he really came on the scene in the last week or so," Gill told MUTV. "We looked at him, spoke to a number of people about him and then went out and secured the deal.</p>
              <p>"It's exciting. He's a potential player, and a lot of Manchester United's focus is about getting players who have the potential and then getting them under the great coaching of Alex (Ferguson), Mick (Phelan), Rene (Meulensteen) and other people. He can fulfil that potential with Manchester United and I think it's going to be exciting. Let's hope it works out."</p>
              <p>Gill added that it was unlikely that Bebe would be immediately sent out on loan and would instead be given the chance to bed down at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"He'll join up and be part of the first-team squad this season," said Gill.</p>
              <p>"I think he'll probably stay this year. (He is) a boy who has to learn English and integrate into Manchester United, and he's really come from nowhere in a lot of respects."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has described Bebe's £7million move to Manchester United as a fairytale for the 20-year-old.</strong></p>
              <p>In Portugal as a character witness for under-fire national team boss Carlos Queiroz, Ferguson took the opportunity to tie up a deal for Bebe, who had spent just five weeks with Vitoria Guimaraes.</p>
              <p>Bebe played football in a homeless team during a brief spell on the streets before his potential was spotted by a Portuguese third division team, where he first came to prominence.</p>
              <p>Now he will get the chance to feature for one of the world's most famous clubs, which Ferguson admitted is a meteoric rise by anyone's assessment.</p>
              <p>"It is a fairytale when you read about his background," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"But it is one of those things that happens when you identify someone with potential.</p>
              <p>"Normally you would assess someone over a longer period of time but other clubs were starting to have a look so we made a quick decision.</p>
              <p>"He doesn't speak any English, so that needs to be addressed, and we need to allow him to settle in but sometimes you have to work on an impulse."</p>

              <p>There's Manucho too, who promises so much with the National team but failed when it matters.</p>
              <p>I don't know why he was bought when United already has Macheda, Hernandez, Welbeck and Diouf on board. And with the new homegrown rule in place, I wonder why Fergie would waste it on this guy after claiming that he will not let Bebe out on loan this season.

              <p><strong>When United announced that a Portuguese player called Bebe would be joining the Reds, it left many fans asking, 'Who?'.<br><br></strong>He didn't even have a wikipedia page, and the usual stampede to Youtube yielded little. But we've obtained video footage of our new winger in action so you can make your own mind up about him.<br><br>Sir Alex believes he is a player of raw potential. "He’s two-footed, he’s very quick, there’s material there," Sir Alex said recently. "He’s raw material but I’m sure we can work with that. He’s young and we’re good at [developing] young players.<br><br>"When we identify someone with potential, we would normally assess over a longer period. But we have a good scout in Portugal and he’s very bright. He’s got a tremendous instinct about the boy and we’ve worked on that impulse. Other clubs were starting to hover on the boy so we made a quick decision and said, ‘Why don’t we go for it?’"</p>
