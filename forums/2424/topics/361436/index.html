              Fergie can become the greatest
              
              Will Manchester United versus Barcelona be a great final? Yes. These are two great teams, of course, and obviously there are big expectations, but you must remember that finals are not for playing beautiful football. [If Sir Alex] wins on Wednesday it would make him the greatest club manager. He has made a super team. Three Premier League titles in a row and two Champions League finals â€“ that's really top. They have quality and experience, with Ferdinand, Vidic, Ronaldo and Rooney. They have absolutely everything as a team: strength, mentality, speed, magic, solutions. You need no more words to explain how strong they are.
              Jose Mourinho, Daily Telegraph
              
              Yes, you read that right. Jose's clearly missing the English press... his final preview in the Telegraph makes for a great read.
              
              Gary Neville has earned his first England call-up since Fabio Capello took over - he last played against Spain over two years ago. Neville is joined by Ferdinand, Rooney and Carrick in the squad for June's 2010 World Cup qualifiers against Kazahkstan on 6 June and Andorra four days later.
              
              Cristiano Ronaldo insists we won't be in for a 'will he?/won't he?' summer of speculation. He promises. "My heart is here. This is where I want to play. Manchester United is now my house." Brilliantly put, Ronny!
              
              The Independent's Sam Wallace challenges the notion that versatility in a footballer means they suffer by never being able to pin down one position. He says that quality is what has made John O'Shea's United career as the Irishman prepares to start in the Reds' defence in Rome.
              
              The Telegraph praise the young Reds who saw off Hull on Sunday. "United's shadow XI could be classed as unfamiliar, but weak? Hardly," writes Mark Ogden.
