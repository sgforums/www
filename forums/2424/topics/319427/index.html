              <h1>Glazers tell Sir Alex Ferguson: Real Madrid can go 'to hell' over Cristiano Ronaldo transfer</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/06/01/sfnfro201get.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Making his point: United manager Ferguson has the full support of the Glazers in the Ronaldo saga</em></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Any doubt that Cristiano Ronaldo is to stay at Manchester United has been swept away by Sir Alex Ferguson, who said the club's American owners, the Glazer family, would ''sit a player in the stand" rather than yield to pressure from Real Madrid to sell the two-time Footballer Of The Year.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Ferguson has accused Real of courting Ronaldo through the press, even though his contract has several years to run. ''What they are doing is awful," the United manager said, and <a lang="en.uk" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/05/28/sfnfro128.xml"><span style="color: #000000;">a complaint to Fifa is expected</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> But Ferguson promised Real's tactics would not work. ''I've had a couple of meetings with the Glazers," he said. ''And their attitude was 'To hell with them'. They would sit a player in the stand - I'm telling you - just to prove a point. They're not going to give in. They've got balls and I've been delighted with them in that respect."</p>
              <p class="story">What seems to be going on, as Ronaldo prepares for Portugal's opening European Championship match against Turkey next Saturday, is a game involving the player's agent, Jorge Mendes. Recently the United board took the unusual step of denying reports that they were ready to negotiate improved terms with Ronaldo. But Ferguson would probably support any measure to keep the 42-goal star of the Premier and Champions League double and he remains utterly confident that this time, whatever may have happened in the cases of David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy, the Spaniards will not get their man.</p>
              <p class="story">Real Madrid sporting director Predrag Mijatovic, meanwhile, has insisted that they have no agreement already in place with Ronaldo. "He is an objective, but we cannot do anything if his club do not want to part with him. Until this time we do not have anything with the player," he told Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias.</p>
