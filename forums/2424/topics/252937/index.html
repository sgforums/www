Two years ago, Sir Alex Ferguson famously ordered his players to applaud Chelsea onto the Old Trafford pitch following the Blues first title triumph under Mourinho. And now, after Chelsea's lingering hopes of a championship hat-trick died with a draw against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, Mourinho confirmed the gesture will be reciprocated when Ferguson takes his team to Stamford Bridge this week. "They did it for us and we shall do the same for them," said Mourinho.</strong><br><br>"This is not a time for excuses. The title race is over and Manchester United are the new champions. "I wish to congratulate everyone, from the manager, to the players, the board - and everyone else who gave them a help to be champions. "We still have the FA Cup to play for and I promise we will be ready for next season."<br><br>After his well voiced complaints about the failure of referees to award penalties against United recently, Mourinho rejected any suggestion his comment regarding the 'help' United received had a wider meaning. However, he admitted he was awaiting with interest the outcome of discussions between United, Everton and the Premier League over the failure of Tim Howard to turn out for the Toffeemen in their home defeat to the Red Devils a week ago.<br><br>It has been claimed Howard was left out by David Moyes as the result of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Ferguson which was struck when the American turned his loan move at Goodison Park into a permanent deal, although the Premier League today said they were satisfied neither club broke any rules. "I am not the authorities," observed Mourinho. "I can't do anything about it. I just have to sit down and wait and see whether I agree with the decision. "Everybody knows what the story is. Now I have to see whether I can find friends in other clubs who will agree with me on a couple of things."<br><br></div>
