              <h4 class="newsHeadline sIFR-replaced"><br><span class="sIFR-alternate"><br><br>Your defence for Wolfsburg?</span></h4>
              <p><strong>Rarely has United's team selection been more difficult to work out.<br></strong><br>After
              confirming a very unfamiliar 19-man squad for the Wolfsburg trip,
              ManUtd.com's Ben Hibbs - our man in Germany - asked you to post your
              thoughts on who will play at the back.<br><br>Your responses on <a href="http://community.manutd.com/forums/t/84624.aspx?PageIndex=1">Talking Reds</a> feature plenty of support for Oliver Gill to make his debut, while
              there are also several calls for Ji-sung Park to play as a full back,
              such is the dearth of recognised defenders at Sir Alex's disposal. We
              plucked these sample posts from our message board, feel free to join
              in...<br><br><strong>Himann:</strong> Matty James can slot in at the
              back I reckon. Gill will probably partner Carrick at centre-back.
              Fletcher, Carrick, Gill and Evra could be the back four.<br><br><strong>Giggsy the true midfield magician:</strong> Looks like it will be Carrick and Evra playing in the centre against
              such a tall striker in Dzeko. I’m really not looking forward to that,
              but I still have faith in the side.<br><br><strong>Pagimp:</strong> Greetings from a Salford Red now living in Sydney and working the night
              shift. As always I have complete faith in Sir Fergie. I reckon the team
              will be: Kuszczak, Fletcher, Carrick, Gill, Evra, Valencia, Scholes,
              Gibson, Park, Welbeck, Owen.<br><br><strong>Red Devil4Life:</strong> As
              said by Sir Alex, we are "down to the bare bones". I am certain he will
              field five in midfield. I'm not sure of putting Oliver Gill in
              centre-back on a big away European night against the reigning German
              champions but I can't see any other option. With the depleted back
              four, the role of goalkeeper becomes paramount and hence the inclusion
              of Kusczcak over Foster, as he is in pretty good form. Matty James is a
              defensive midfielder and can fill in if needed.<br><br><strong>Shilesh4United:</strong> The back four may be Carrick and
              Fletcher in the centre, Evra at left back and Gill at right back. Since
              Carrick and Fletcher are tall and they both have good pace, Sir Alex
              will rely on them in the centre to handle Wolfsburg’s strikers.<br><br><strong>Ees A Fact No!:</strong> It’s got to be young Gill at right back, Carrick and Fletcher in the
              centre and Evra at left back. Let's be honest it’s not ideal but needs
              must. I seem to remember they were very physical up top at Old Trafford
              so a bit of experience in the centre is a must. At least if Gill plays
              at right back any mistake he makes through lack of experience is less
              likely to be punished than it would be if he was at centre back. I also
              think the boss might go for a 4-5-1 formation to help cover the
              makeshift defence.<br><br><strong>Noni:</strong> I think the defence
              will comprise Fletcher, Carrick, Gill and Evra. Gibson is set to start
              again, and I think he'll play alongside Anderson in the centre of the
              park. This is the time for Nani to step up, so I expect him to start.
              At the other flank I'd go for Welbeck, and up front Owen should
              definitely start.<br><br><strong>Chikodi:</strong> For us to succeed at
              Wolfsburg we have to choke the midfield. Remember that our opponents
              are also reading our blogs and will know that we have a depleted
              backyard (defence). I think a 4-5-1 formation will be ideal.<br></p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Alex Ferguson is already looking ahead of Manchester United's final Champions League group game against Wolfsburg on Tuesday night</strong>. </p>
              <p>Ferguson will have no less than 15 players unavailable for the trip, which has little consequence to United other than determining whether they will qualify in first or second place. </p>
              <p>And even this does not appear to concern Ferguson, who will pick his team with the busy upcoming domestic schedule in mind. </p>
              <p>He said: "I'm not sure whether coming first or second in the group really matters. You're going to face strong teams either way, Real Madrid or Barcelona, Inter or AC Milan, they're all quality, all much of a muchness. </p>
              <p>"And I have to look at the bigger picture, the Premier League games we have coming up." </p>
              <p>United travelled to Germany with only two specialist defenders in their squad - Patrice Evra and youngster Oliver Gill, who is unlikely to start the game. </p>
              <p>Ferguson joked that it "would be worth trying with one defender," on the basis that he would be "easy to organise", but faces a difficult decision about who to play alongside Evra. </p>
              <p>He has already stated that Michael Carrick will start at centre-half, but it's not clear who will play alongside him. Darren Fletcher is an option, while Darron Gibson could also play in the middle, having occasionally operated there before. </p>
              <p>Evra is another option to partner Carrick, with Park Ji-sung possibly playing at left-back. </p>
              <p>"I need a back four that can unite," said Ferguson. "And good passing ability is going to be important, considering we don't have natural centre-backs." </p>
              <p>Ferguson went on to admit that his knowledge of United's opponents was somewhat sketchy. </p>
              <p>"I'd never heard of Wolfsburg before they won the Bundesliga last year," he said. "But we have a lot of thinking to do because this is a big game for them. And they will be delighted we have so many injuries."</p>

              <p>Hahaha... I don't belief it, Man United played with one defender and they actually beat the German champion... lol.</p>
              <p>Michael Owen is a real classic striker... He had 3 different types of goals. The first was a header... lol... Small Owen against the German defence and he manage to get his head in first... The second, a lot of the credit must be given to that new French boy but Owen show the fox in the box instinct... The 3rd was classic Owen, in counter attacking, he collected the ball at the edge of the pitch near the centre circle line from Scholes I think, then he race half the pitch with all the Germans defenders chasing after him... But he coolly chipped is over the on rushing german keeper when he reached the box... A lot of strikers would just try to blasted it as hard as they could (like Rooney type) but Owen took it like an experienced striker... Little strength used but more effective as the keeper couldn't even get his hands to it...</p>
              <p>What I didn't like of the match was Welbeck. This fellow is selfish and a poor decision maker... A few times he could have played Owen in more but hold on to the ball for himself or for too long then lose it...</p>
              <p>Overall, the match was good, United's makeshift defense was good but the high balls into the box from the 2 sides (left and right) wasn't cleared properly... The Germans had 3 clear chances to head the ball in but lucky they only too one of the 3 chances... The other 2 went over the bar. And that PIG, is good... Another good showing from him...</p>

              </div>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1234257" rel="1234257|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1234257/Wolfsburg-1-Manchester-Utd-3-Brilliant-Michael-Owen-fires-hat-trick-ensure-United-Champions-League-group.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>With three midfield players operating in the defence and the chief executive’s son sitting next to him in his boots in the dugout, this was a European night like no other for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p>When he looks back in the future, though, only one thing will matter. His team qualified from the group stages in first position again, thanks to a Michael Owen hat-trick.</p>
              <p>At this level, results are all that matter and the victory that United somehow managed to dig out in Saxony will send Ferguson and his depleted squad into the draw for the knock-out stages next week in extremely good heart.</p>
              <p>As was to be expected, United spent much of this game on the back foot. When Wolfsburg contemplate their exit from the competition, the German team will ask themselves just how they managed to miss so many chances.</p>
              <p>But in the Champions League, class and experience more often than not will tell. And as United’s teenage defender Owen Gill - son of chief executive David - looked on as a substitute, one of Europe’s most senior and respected centre forwards walked away with his first hat-trick in four years.</p>
              <p>Owen’s early weeks and months at United have been rather underwhelming. His promising form of pre-season evaporated once the real business started and as England secured qualification for the World Cup without him, the 29-year-old has spent much of the autumn and early winter in the shadows.</p>

              <p><strong>But last night proved to be something of a throwback, though. Three goals, each clinically taken. No fuss.</strong></p>
              <p>Whether it proves to be a catalyst for something more significant and long lasting, only time will tell. But it was too much for Wolfsburg.</p>
              <p>Missing bundles of senior players and with Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher playing in the centre of defence, this was always going to be a long night for United, an evening when discipline, courage and the ability to follow instructions would prove as valuable as anything more glamorous.</p>
              <p>As the match wore on, these qualities came to the fore. After an uncertain start, Carrick and Fletcher grew in confidence while keeper Tomasz Kuszczak contributed perhaps his most assured display of his time at United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/09/article-1234257-0786262E000005DC-515_468x297.jpg" alt="Michael Owen of Manchester United scores his team's second goal against Wolfsburg" width="468" height="297">

              </div>
              <p><strong>Nevertheless, it was largely down to the German team’s poor finishing that United were not dead and buried within half an hour.</strong></p>
              <p>Playing on a heavy, muddy pitch and backed by a rowdy full house, Wolfsburg were purposeful and should have been ahead early on.</p>
              <p>They could have had a penalty when Carrick challenged Makoto Hasebe while the Brazilian Grafite whipped a shot wide from the edge of the penalty area and Andrea Barzagli and Zvjezdan Misimovic headed over when unmarked within the first 20 minutes.</p>
              <p>United struggled in the air throughout which made it all the more ironic that they took the lead with a header just before half-time.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/09/article-1234257-07862C13000005DC-93_468x307.jpg" alt="Michael Owen of Manchester" width="468" height="307">

              </div>
              <p><strong>Ferguson’s team had gradually come in to the game as the half wore on and Danny Welbeck had a goal ruled out for offside. And when Nani delivered a cross to the far post, Owen who had thus far been quiet, nipped in ahead of Marcel Schafer to score simply at the far post.</strong></p>
              <p>Behind at the interval, Wolfsburg must have wondered quite how. But they responded well in the early stages of the second period and, after Edin Dzeko stole in behind Carrick to thunder a cross from Schafer in to the corner from 10 yards, it appeared as though the home team were ready to make good their place in the next stage.</p>
              <p>Grafite brought a good save from Kuszczak with a powerful shot in the 70th minute before Dzeko was foiled as he delivered a somewhat weaker effort at the near post.</p>

              <p><strong>As time drew on, it appeared as though a draw was perhaps the limit of United’s ambitions. A good result that would have been, too.</strong></p>
              <p>But after Ferguson sent on Gabriel Obertan and Antonio Valencia with 17 minutes left his team went on to steal the game.</p>
              <p>Obertan, who has improved steadily since recovering from injury six weeks ago, found a way past three men to cross low from the left in the 83rd minute for the unmarked Owen to score from six yards. And the decisive passage of play then followed as full-time approached.</p>
              <p>Wolfsburg looked odds-on to equalise when a low cross flew in front of the United goal as white shirts closed in. But Darron Gibson managed to clear the danger and within 10 seconds the ball was in the net at the other end.</p>

              <p>It was a little harsh on Wolfsburg but they had lost to a masterclass from Owen. There is no shame in that.</p>

              <p>With such a long injury list, and with only one specialised defender and an untested formation, getting a 3-1 result away at Wolfsburg is certainly excellent.</p>
              <p>Now this is what I call true depth in the squad. Man Utd may be weaker without Tevez and Ronaldo, but they've compensated with plain old hard teamwork.</p>
