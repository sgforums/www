            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Edwin van der Sar would love the chance to have a crack at Chelsea three times in the space of a fortnight.<br><br>Manchester United's defeat at Portsmouth last weekend already means the May 9 Barclays Premiership encounter between the pair at Stamford Bridge is likely to prove pivotal in the battle for the title.<br><br>Both sides have now advanced to the Champions League semi-finals, on the back of sensational successes over Roma and Valencia on Tuesday, keeping alive the possibility of a European Cup final battle between England's top two in Athens on May 23.<br><br>And, this weekend, both could book spots in what would be a mouth-watering first FA Cup Final at the new Wembley.<br><br>Even a seasoned veteran like Van der Sar can't help but raise an eyebrow at the prospect of that particular treble.<br><br>"It would be great," he told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"Most important, it would mean we had re ached the two finals, which is what we want.<br><br>"We will do our best to achieve the goals we have set ourselves here at United. We will find out who we face later."<br><br>Van der Sar is by no means a certain starter in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with Watford at Villa Park given understudy Tomasz Kuszczak has appeared in all but one match on United's run to the last four.<br><br>Ryan Giggs is another experienced member of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad who may step down as the United boss plots a way through a packed fixture list, one which sees his side tackle Sheffield United in a crucial Premiership encounter at Old Trafford on Tuesday.<br><br>"We are into the last six weeks of the campaign and this is the time when things start to get a bit interesting," admitted Van der Sar.<br><br>"We are ready to go for it and hopefully, everything will work out.<br><br>"The players are very confident in themselves and their team-mates but you have to deal with everything that is thrown at you."<br><br>Paul Scholes definitely returns after suspension on Saturday and Ferguson will also hope to have Louis Saha available after a recent hamstring problem although, given Alan Smith's outstanding contribution to the midweek rout of Roma, the Frenchman's presence may not be quite as crucial this weekend as it might previously have been.<br><br>Gary Neville is still a few days away from full fitness, so John O'Shea will continue in the right-back role despite Patrice Evra's unlikely appearance in the position as a second-half substitute this week.<br><br>Evra was as thrilled as the rest of his colleagues by the magnificent win over Roma, United's biggest success in Europe since 1968.<br><br>However, he is urging them to ensure the scale of that success does not distract his team-mates from their immediate focus.<br><br>"The most dangerous moment for us is now," he said.<br><br>"After beating Roma, a lot of people are saying Manchester United will win everything now.<br><br>"But we have not finished yet. This is the most important part of the season and we must keep winning.<br><br>"I know we have played well for a long time but if we end this season winning nothing, it will have been a very bad one."</span><br><br>I agree with the last four paragraph.
