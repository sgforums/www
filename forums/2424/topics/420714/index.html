              <p>Lousy performance by United, let down by so many players notably Evra and Gibson, especially Gibson, what an absolute disaster to play him. I hope Sir Alex do something in the 2nd Half to at least salvage a draw.</p>

              <p>I personally doubt the draw. And I think Blackpool will pile on the damage.</p>
              <p>I'd rather take the loss, so United will wake up, and actually start winning the next few games without fucking up so much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Side note, the only person that could probably revive midfield at the moment is Park.</p>

              <p>A tale of 2 halves and 2 magnificent players for either team: Adams for Blackpool in the first half and Giggs for United in the second half.</p>
              <p>Summary of match:</p>
              <p>1. Playing 5 in midfield in away matches as predicted earlier backfired. Berbatov is not getting any support and hardly had any sniff at goal before the formation reverted back to 4-4-2 midway through the first half.</p>
              <p>2. Gibson is garbage. A 37 years old Giggs outplayed someone who's 13 years his junior. It's like Lucas for Liverpool last season, we have Gibson for United.</p>
              <p>3. Giggs must have drank some magic potion alongside Scholes, the performance they put in really puts the young ones (Fletcher, Gibson) to shame.</p>
              <p>4. Berbatov is a lethal weapon upfront this season, almost everything he touches resulted in a goal. Goal number 19 in the premier league for him, I'm rooting him to score past 25.</p>
              <p>5. That wonder boy Chicharito always, yes, always impress when he comes on. It's hard not to compare him with the great Ole, a miracle supersub. He could have easily grabbed a hat-trick had the keeper not been alert both in the one-on-one and the cross from Giggs.</p>
              <p>6. Concussion to Rafael - A sight to forget. He was doing well until the head collision, let's hope he's alright.</p>
              <p>7. United fighting spirit wins the match. I thought a draw will be good enough and United went further by taking the 3rd away win of the season. Kudos to Fergie and his half-time hairdryer team talk.</p>

              <p>I too, like many, was disappointed to have woken up at an ungodly hour, only to see them go down 2-0 at half time. I just thought to myself....let this be utd's destiny if they were meant to lose. Likewise, if they can comeback, then this be the mettle of true champions....and they did!! I say this with some tears waiting to burst out!! ha!</p>
              <p>Yeh gibson was quite crappy. The only reason why utd had creativity when they played was due to scholes and nani. For a midfielder who plays so much forward, to have such lack of creativity is an absolute sin.</p>
              <p>I thought anderson at one point was free with the ball but he lacked the confidence. Nevertheless, the touch of visionary passes is still there.</p>
              <p>Funny....the first half, united had difficulty maintaining posession. Odd balls pumped here and there. Perhaps the away factor at play.</p>
              <p>I also think rooney shouldn't be running all around the field. Yeh he had a crucial defensive header if you all remember but someone else would have covered him had he not been there. Should work on his distribution and assists from the other half.</p>

              <p>Eh, I think at that precise moment, Evra was off the pitch having treatment after being caught by Adams' elbow and United were still playing the stupid 4-5-1 formation with Rooney out on the left so his duty has been changed to provide cover for Evra before he returns on to the field, which is why he was back defending and what a great defensive header it was before Blackpool can launch a counter.</p>
              <p>Oh yeah, just to add on, the pitch was a unplayable, so many players slipped and mispassed the ball throughout the match and especially the area where the keepers play. I hardly spot any sign of grass there. I think Blackpool should invest on underheat system and regular pitch maintenance.</p>

              <p>Btw, if anyone thinks charlie adams can fit seamlessly into liverpool's first XI, then i must beg to differ.</p>
              <p>Yes he shows flashes of brilliance but he is largely inconsistent to me.  Yes he has vision but he's not paul scholes. To me, the only reason why he's rated highly is due to the fact that he's at blackpool and he being the incandescent bulb among the lesser lights.</p>

              <p>I think his stamina lets him down la. He's definitely a good passer of the ball, great built but just lacks that little bit of luck when it matters.</p>
              <p>He has nerves of steel though, he always seems to score penalty, just like Alexander did for Burnley last season. But his style of play is similar to Gerrard, not sure how he's gonna fit into Pool's team when he eventually makes his way there which I think he would after Babbel's sale free up some funds.</p>
              <p>p.s He doesn't look like 25 does he? I thought he was older than Vidic in terms of his looks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
