              <p><strong>Gary Neville has retired from football after 20 years playing at Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>Gary
               signed for United in July 1991 and was part of the famous Class of ’92 
              that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992. He then became a first-team regular 
              alongside his teammates from that side, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky 
              Butt, his brother Philip and David Beckham.</p>
              <p>In his time at Old 
              Trafford, Gary played 602 games and scored seven goals. He has won the 
              Champions League, eight Premier League trophies, three FA Cups, two 
              League Cups, the Intercontinental Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.  He 
              became United club captain in 2005.</p>
              <p>Gary won 85 caps for England 
              between 1995 and 2007, playing in two World Cups (1998 and 2006) and 
              three European Championships (1996, 2000 and 2004).</p>
              <p><strong>Neville</strong>, who turns 36 this month, made the decision after much consideration. He said:</p>
              <p>"I
               have been a Manchester United fan all my life and fulfilled every dream
               I've ever had. Obviously I am disappointed that my playing days are at 
              an end, however it comes to us all, and it's knowing when that time is 
              and for me that time is now. I have played in the most incredible 
              football teams, playing with some of the best players in the world as 
              well as against them and I have been lucky to have been part of the 
              team's achievements and the club's great success.</p>
              <p>"There are so 
              many people I want to thank and, of course, top of that list is Sir 
              Alex. He has given me so many opportunities and countless support over 
              the last 20 years - he is truly one of the greatest managers - and I 
              have to thank him for that.</p>
              <p>"There have also been so many great players that I have had the 
              privilege to train and play alongside. The experiences we've shared will
               be with me for the rest of my life. Also, I'd like to thank all the 
              coaches I have played under from youth level right through to now, who 
              have guided me through my playing days. And finally, the fans, who have 
              always shown me unbelievable support. They know how special they are to 
              me and this club.</p>
              <p>"I am looking forward to new experiences and the
               club will always be a part of my life going forward. However, the most 
              important thing now is for the club to continue with the success that is
               synonymous with Manchester United and I will be supporting them all the
               way, as a fan."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson </strong>said:</p>
              <p>“Gary
               was the best English right back of his generation.  He is an example to
               any young professional; hard-working, loyal and intelligent. As a 
              United fan born and bred, his fantastic career at Old Trafford has 
              cemented his place in the affection of the club’s supporters everywhere.</p>
              <p>“His
               impact on the club in general has been huge; his presence in the 
              dressing room and leadership qualities have been an asset to me as a 
              manager. All the young players who have sought his advice on many 
              matters, particularly on contract issues owe him a great debt.</p>
              <p>“As
               a young boy he had the will and determination to succeed as a 
              footballer and that character remained with him throughout his career. 
              That's the legacy he leaves every young player at Manchester United.”</p>
              <p>Reds chief executive <strong>David Gill </strong>said: “Gary has been a great servant to the club and we thank him for his 
              loyalty and his contribution to the tremendous success we have enjoyed 
              in his playing time here. I know from my many dealings with him over the
               years that he's always had the club’s best interests at heart. So, 
              while this illustrious chapter in his career has finished, his 
              experience, commitment and energy will ensure he will continue to play a
               part in the life of the club, whether on the coaching or the commercial
               side."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Goodbye Gary Neville, u will always be remember for ur service in Manchester United =) and the treble year 1999...</p>

              <p>Manchester United defender <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8862/Gary-Neville">Gary Neville</a> has become the first of the 'Fergie Fledglings' to end his career after
               announcing his immediate retirement from professional football at the 
              age of 35.</p>

              <p>Neville,
               who has made only three Premier League starts this season due to 
              fitness problems and a lack of form, made 602 appearances for United and
               represented England on 85 occasions.</p>
              <p>Hailed as "the best English right back of his generation" by <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, Neville was a member of the famous side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992, and along with fellow academy graduates <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8853/Ryan-Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8860/Paul-Scholes">Paul Scholes</a> dedicated his entire career to his manager at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>But
               while Scholes and Giggs continue to shine in the Premier League, 
              Neville has decided that the time is right to hang up his boots, 
              bringing to a close a trophy-filled career that saw him secure eight 
              league titles, the Champions League, three FA Cups and two League Cups.</p>
              <p>"I
               have been a Manchester United fan all my life and fulfilled every dream
               I've ever had," Neville told the club's official website. "Obviously I 
              am disappointed that my playing days are at an end, however it comes to 
              us all, and it's knowing when that time is and for me that time is now.</p>

               top of that list is Sir Alex. He has given me so many opportunities and

               club to continue with the success that is synonymous with Manchester 
              United and I will be supporting them all the way, as a fan."</p>
              <p>Striking
               up a successful partnership with his good friend David Beckham on the 
              right side of the United team, Neville came to epitomise United's spirit
               under the leadership of Ferguson and his dedication and professionalism
               saw him awarded the captain's armband in 2005.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 
              "Gary was the best English right back of his generation.  He is an 
              example to any young professional; hard-working, loyal and intelligent.

              That's the legacy he leaves every young player at Manchester United."</p>
              <p>Neville also attracted tributes from his colleagues, with Rio Ferdinand writing on his <em>Twitter</em> page: "Gary Neville has retired from football ... the best right back 
              in premier league history #fact. Gonna be a loss to our dressing room 
              #banter."</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/11/02/402x210/Gary-Neville-Jan-2011_2558434.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="210"></p>
              <p class="art-txt-first">Gary Neville has confirmed his intention to remain within the Manchester United fold for the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>The 35-year-old announced his retirement with immediate effect last night, bringing an end to a stellar career that brought him eight Premier League titles, a Champions League triumph and 85 England caps.</p>
              <p>In an extensive interview with MUTV, Neville confirmed it had been a decision he had been thinking about for some time and his performance against West Brom on New Year's Day turned out to signal the end.</p>
              <p>However, although there has been speculation about a media career with Sky, or a place in Sir Alex Ferguson's backroom team, Neville does not have any concrete plans, although he will stay with the Red Devils in the short-term to help out behind the scenes.</p>
              <p>"I am going to stay at the club until the end of the season and do some coaching because I have got my coaching badge to complete," he said.</p>
              <p>"But at this moment in time my mindset isn't to go into coaching or management full-time.</p>
              <p>"I have been working for a football club every day for 20 years. I definitely want to try and continue my relationship with this club, even if it is just as a fan.</p>
              <p>"But I want to have 12 months to gather my thoughts. I don't want to rush into another relationship quickly.</p>
              <p>"I want to ease off a little bit and just relax. I need to chill out."</p>
              <p>It is anticipated Neville will be granted a testimonial at the end of the season in recognition of his contribution to the United cause.</p>
              <p>The widespread belief is that Neville was a fairly average player, who reached his status in the game through tenacity and hard work.</p>
              <p>Yet such a description does scant justice to his talents.</p>
              <p>His overlapping runs for David Beckham for instance often went unnoticed, yet they provided his great friend with the space to execute his impressive crossing abilities.</p>
              <p>Yet even Neville admits he had to reach the highest level every week to cut it alongside fellow 'Class of 92' members Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.</p>
              <p>"I relied upon qualities that weren't technical or skilful to get to where I did," he said.</p>
              <p>"I like to think there is a level of intelligence and physically, I felt like I could run all day. But mentally I had to do whatever it took to win a game for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"I was determined to win and felt to succeed was the most important thing.</p>
              <p>"That was probably my greatest asset.</p>
              <p>"Some players can play at 100% and drop by 3% and be okay. With me it was 100% or nothing. There was no in between."</p>
              <p>And on that day at The Hawthorns, when Neville should have been sent off for a tackle on Graham Dorrans, he knew it was time to go.</p>
              <p>"After that game on New Year's Day I felt I had reached the end," he said.</p>
              <p>"It fact, it wasn't after that game, it was during.</p>
              <p>"I had been thinking about it for a month or so before that.</p>
              <p>"You don't just give up after one bad game. I had enough of them over the last 20 years to know that can happen.</p>
              <p>"But the way I felt at the start of the season, when I started picking up injuries, there is only so many times you can come back.</p>
              <p>"Your mentality is such at this club that you are always willing to go again.</p>
              <p>"But sometimes you get a feeling in your mind that you just can't go again and that time had come for me.</p>
              <p>"In the previous two seasons I had played 25-30 games and there was always a period where I felt I was contributing.</p>
              <p>"Once you have lost that and you know it was not quite right, you don't want to be a passenger."</p>

              <p class="art-txt-first">Gary Neville says the number of trophies he won at Manchester United is more important to him than the amount of games he played.</p>
              <p>The 35-year-old called time on his playing career earlier this week after making over 600 appearances for the club and winning countless medals, including eight Premier League titles.</p>
              <p>Speaking to Sky Sports News in an in-depth interview, the former England full-back revealed that his priority was always to try and help his boyhood club to be successful.</p>
              <p>"Winning trophies, that is the most important bit," Neville told Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>"A lot of people might not play 600 games at United, but a lot of people have amassed caps and amassed a lot of games, and there might be people who've played 850 games, they might be on 720 in different clubs over their careers.</p>
              <p>"The difference, I feel, in my career is that I've played in teams that have mattered and won things, and that's all I've ever wanted to do which is to contribute in some way, however big or small, to teams that have won major trophies.</p>
              <p>"That is the only thing that is really important.</p>
              <p>"I could have played 450 games, but as long as the tally of trophies and medals at the end is the same, that is what matters.</p>
              <p>"To play 500 or 600 games, obviously that would bring you potentially more money and a longer football career, but what really matters is winning trophies and playing for a club that I love and wanted to win trophies for."</p>
              <p>Neville also acknowledged there was a sense of relief upon his decision to retire after making just four appearances for United this season.</p>
              <p>"I do feel relief," said Neville, who has struggled with injuries in recent years. "I feel it's the right thing.</p>
              <p>"As much as you might think when you see a picture of yourself in a kit or see footage of you from five, six seasons ago, and think 'should I go again?', reality then kicks in and says 'no, it's right'.</p>
              <p>"Your body doesn't do what you want it to do. The injuries had an effect on me mentally and my performance level.</p>
              <p>"There comes a point where you no longer feel you are contributing and are good enough to play in this team, and that's how I felt."</p>
