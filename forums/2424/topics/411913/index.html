              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED have left Wayne Rooney out for tomorrow night's game in 
              Valencia.</h2>
              <p>The troubled England striker will stay at home as the rest of Alex Ferguson's 
              squad fly out to Spain today.</p>
              <p>United revealed on Sunday that Rooney has an ankle injury but were confident 
              he would be fit to play at the Mestalla.</p>
              <p>However, Sun Online broke the news yesterday that out-of-sorts Roo would not 
              feature in the Champions League clash in Spain.</p>
              <p>And a United source said: "Rooney is not going to Spain this week. The manager 
              feels he has sufficient depth in his squad to leave Wayne behind."</p>
              <p>Rooney is battling to save his marriage after allegations about his private 
              life and Fergie admitted the media glare was 'exhausting' him.</p>
              <p>Striker Roo has scored just one goal for United since late March - and was 
              subbed after 61 minutes at Bolton on Sunday.</p>

              <p><strong>No Wayne in Spain</strong></p>
              <p><strong>United will travel to Valencia on Tuesday morning without striker Wayne Rooney.<br><br></strong>The Reds frontman picked up an ankle injury in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Bolton and was substituted in the 61st minute. While the injury is not thought to be serious, Sir Alex Ferguson told ManUtd.com on Monday afternoon that the 24-year-old would not be fit enough to be included in United's side to face top-of-La-Liga Valencia on Wednesday evening (kick-off: 1945 BST).<br><br>One man who will be taking off with the United squad on Tuesday morning is ManUtd.com reporter Nick Coppack. He'll provide details of the full travelling squad, when confirmed, from Manchester airport at approximately 09:00 BST. You'll then be able to follow his rolling blog, <a href="http://origin-www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7B83A644F4-1A7E-48B9-AF95-4605613A9A18%7D&amp;newsid=6652562"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Today In Valencia</span></span></a>, throughout the Reds' stay in Spain.</p>

              <h3 class="sub-heading padding-top-3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="black-link">Vidic warns United defence</span></span></h3>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">NEMANJA VIDIC fears Manchester United could get tonked in Valencia if they do 
              not shore up their defence.</h2>
              <p>Alex Ferguson's side have conceded nine goals in their opening six league 
              matches - their worst record at this stage since 2001-02.</p>
              <p>And their backline has been particularly leaky on the road with seven goals 
              against them in just three games, including two at Bolton on Sunday.</p>
              <p>That could spell trouble for United in Valencia in their crucial Champions 
              League clash ahead of Saturday's trip to Sunderland.</p>
              <p>And skipper Vidic warns they will have to improve at the Mestalla as Unai 
              Emery's men are in fine form.</p>
              <p>Despite selling David Villa and David Silva, Valencia currently top La Liga 
              and also thumped Turkish outfit Bursaspor 4-0 in their opening match in 
              Europe.</p>
              <p>Vidic said: "We have to be much better in Spain than we were at Bolton.</p>
              <p>"Valencia are in decent form and won their first match 4-0.</p>
              <p>"They are also top of La Liga and that shows how well they are playing - 
              whereas the last few games we have played away have been very disappointing.</p>
              <p>"It is a big concern conceding so many away goals. We know over the last few 
              years we haven't given many away.</p>
              <p>"We have always looked strong and haven't given teams so many chances.</p>
              <p>"But in the last three away games we haven't kept a clean sheet. We have lost 
              too many goals and have to stop that.</p>
              <p>"This is not the true Manchester United. It does have to be sorted quickly.</p>
              <p>"In the last three games we have conceded the type of goals from set-pieces 
              that we haven't conceded in the last four years."</p>
              <p>Vidic is set to resume his partnership with Rio Ferdinand in Spain. The 
              England skipper was left out at Bolton because Fergie does not feel he is 
              ready for more than a game a week following his knee injury.</p>
              <p>But Vidic hopes United can get back to the sort of solid defensive 
              performances which were their trademark.</p>
              <p>He said: "Our defending has always been our platform. We need to work on the 
              small details."</p>

              <p>The midfielder had not started for United since the Community Shield win over 
              Chelsea due to a niggling Achilles problem.</p>
              <p>But United boss Alex Ferguson has confirmed Carrick, 29, is in the running to 
              feature in the Champions League clash in Spain.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, however, will be without Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney 
              for the Group C fixture.</p>

              <p><strong>Valencia defender Hedwiges Maduro believes Manchester United will find his team even tougher to beat despite the loss of superstars David Silva and David Villa.</strong></p>
              <p>Super-striker Villa has joined Barcelona while Silva moved to Manchester City in the summer.</p>
              <p>Valencia, however, remain top of La Liga after five games - ahead of Villareal, Barca and Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Maduro said: “I think as a team we are much more balanced. Everyone works for each other. Villa and Silva had extraordinary qualities but now we are more one group.</p>
              <p>“Everyone has similar qualities. We all work for each other. We attack together, we defend together and I think that is very good progress for our group.”</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>Seven-time French Champions Lyon insist they will stand by under-pressure coach Claude Puel despite a disastrous start to the season.</p>
              <p>Chairman Jean-Michel Aulas was forced to face 2,000 angry fans after Saturday’s 1-0 derby defeat to St Etienne.</p>
              <p>And Lyon travel to Hapoel Tel-Aviv tonight, with the Israelis undefeated in their last nine European games, winning five.</p>
              <p>Aulas, has vowed to stand by his man regardless. He said: “The easiest solution would be to change things.</p>
              <p>“But to change you have to find something better than what you already have, and I am not convinced we can do that. Stability is the only solution to improve the club.”</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex says the Reds would be "foolish" to think Wednesday night’s Champions League Group C clash against Valencia will be easy.<br><br></strong><em>Los Che </em>currently top the Spanish Primera Liga and are unbeaten in their last 11 home games in Europe. Furthermore, United have only ever won away from home once on Spanish soil in 18 previous attempts.<br><br>“Valencia’s home record over the years has been very good,” Sir Alex told the journalists assembled at his pre-match press conference in Spain. “It would be foolish not to respect that. Spain has produced cup-winning teams for years and you have to recognise that. The standard of Spanish football has always been good, so yes, it’s a difficult place to come and win.”<br><br>The United manager saw Wednesday’s opponents first-hand last week when he flew to Valencia to watch the team play Atletico Madrid. <br><br>“I saw a very good team when I came here last week,” he said. “We expect a very difficult game – they’re top of the league and playing very well.”<br><br>The Reds enter the game with only a point after the first round of matches in Group C but Sir Alex remains confident United will qualify for the knockout stages.<br><br>“The 0-0 draw against Rangers was a disappointing result but we have five games left to try and qualify. We have a tough game tomorrow, but that’s the great thing about the European Cup – you face the best teams in countries like Spain, Italy and Germany. That’s what makes it a fantastic tournament.”</p>

              <p>What a great result for United to win in Spain against the La Liga leader. .</p>
              <p>Before the match, I was like only expecting a draw would be a good result to take away but to get all 3 points in Spain, is just fantastic.</p>
              <p>I was thinking the possibility of a loss was very real last night cos Valencia are an on form side, even Real and Barce are behind them currently. And had United lost and Rangers won which they did last night, the chances of United making it to the next round is seriously threaten.</p>
              <p>So the significance of this result is very important... Otherwise, the United match against Rangers in Scotland could get tricky, they might have to win that at all cost... Now with this result, United's fate are in their own hands while the Rangers v Valencia matches will decide their own fate...</p>

              <p>Boring Boring Man United. Seriously. Last night Fergie chose defensive football over the usual play.</p>
              <p>Pro:</p>
              <p>The first away clean sheet in the new season. And wow, does it come to anyone surprise that the Evans and O'Shea didnt play? In fact, O'Shea only made a last minute appearance to kill time. Evans wasn't even on the bench.</p>
              <p>Con:</p>
              <p>1. Vertically-Challenged Wing Backs. Valencia pumped high ball to the wings and Evra + Rafael had tough time dealing with them.</p>
              <p>2. The lack of match fitness of Rio + Evra's lack of concentration is imminent. Especially Evra, who seem to have his mind firmly fixed on the summer fiasco. Maybe Fabio can help out to let Evra have a good rest?</p>
              <p>3. The player who chased after every ball, showed the most intention to open scoring is *gasp Berbatov! Nani gets the credit too but the rest of United team seem to lack motivation. Anderson seemed to be lacking in confidence, chose to play safe passes rather than through balls to Berbatov.</p>
              <p>4. Carrick is the archilles heel of United's attack. Whenever there's a counter, he will always be the idiot who takes his time to pick up a pass. Sell him already!</p>
              <p>5. Fergie's defensive tactic almost caused his own downfall had Valencia taken their chances. Soldaldo and Pablo came so close to scoring but lady luck was with United.</p>
              <p>6. Speaking of tactics, shouldn't Fergie play 2 strikers from the start instead of 1? United had trouble stringing a series of passes and obviously Berbatov got angry and went back to help out in midfield. Anderson was just clueless about his role. Park is at his usual best - running like a headless cockroach with no real intention.</p>
              <p>7. Chicharito's first European goal for United. His first touch is world class and the finishing too. Hope to see more from this young star.</p>
              <p>I thought it will end in a draw after watching them play but lady luck was really with United.</p>
