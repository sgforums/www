            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, i do notice that United defence shakes whenever Heinze and Silvestre plays. Silvestre has made 2 awful mistakes in 2 matches and both near to the end of the match. Maybe it's time for him to go.<br><br>Pique is doing reasonably well at the moment and we do have Northern Ireland young International defender Evans rite? He's going on loan to Sunderland along with Bardsley.<br><br>As for Heinze, I dunno wad's with him but almost everytime he plays, United lose. Southend, Copenhagen, Arsenal(As Sub). Coincidence? Maybe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>6 points lead and their skipper is out in the cold.
