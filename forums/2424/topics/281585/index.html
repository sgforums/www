We don't want that kind of confusion coming into Manchester United.<br><br>"Mourinho is clearly a very successful coach, he has done well here in a relatively short period of time.<br><br>"But we don't need that kind of interference in our club."<br><br>Gill was somewhat less forthright when quizzed over the possibility of Mourinho becoming United manager one day, pointedly refusing to answer the question.<br><br>However, his tactic is one borne out of the experience of knowing so many candidates have been linked with the job at various stages of Ferguson's tenure, including Martin O'Neill, Steve McClaren, Bryan Robson and, currently, Mark Hughes and Roy Keane, but then fade from view as Ferguson continues.<br><br>Ferguson himself has always resisted telling the media who he thinks should replace him, although in a public speech recently the Scot did offer the name of his present number two Carlos Queiroz as a plausible candidate.<br><br>"We have a very good man in Carlos there, but we would look at everyone available at that time to take over what is undoubtedly one of the best jobs in football," he said.<br><br>"There are lots of other people who have the credentials and at that time Manchester United will undoubtedly still be one of the most attractive jobs in football."<br><br>One thing appears certain, no matter who replaces Ferguson, the next United manager will enjoy the same level of non-interference in football matters as the current incumbent.<br><br>Gill confirmed there can be disagreements between the pair over some football decisions.<br><br>But ultimately, Ferguson is left to get on with his job with a freedom Abramovich has not afforded to Mourinho if rumours of Chelsea's strategy for buying players is to be believed.<br><br>Yet, after succeeding Peter Kenyon as chief executive at United, Gill cannot quite believe the stories of transfers being foisted on Mourinho are true.<br><br>"I have never suggested signing players and I don't think any of the big clubs would ever do that.<br><br>"It would never work, and it would be a recipe for disaster.<br><br>"And knowing Peter Kenyon as I do, I'm sure that didn't happen at Chelsea either."</div>
