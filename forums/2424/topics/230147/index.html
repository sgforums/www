            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br>just my opinion, yes, Heinze gives an toughness edge that "Don't mess with me" to all opposing wingers coming down the right lane, but one thing seems to affect him after his injury. His pace. Seems he is a beat slow.<br><br>That's why, when we compared with the other two, he seems to be weaker in this aspect.<br><br>However, to me, his anticapation and his "never say die" are key to him winning the place in left back.<br><br>Evra,showed last night that he is not one to give up. He got pace, and his tackling is good. On top of that, he got that extra edge in his attack.<br>He seems to link well with either Park, Giggs or Ronaldo.<br><br>I think his assets are pace and he is relatively young.<br>However, his weakness is his aerial where opposing players tend to exploit coming in from the blind side when they cross from the left.<br><br>MS is to me, a tank. He got pace, strength, and aerial.<br>But his weakness is his concentation, and the fact he is soley left-footed.<br>Being in the league for so long, most opposing players know that if they attack on the right, MS will struggle.<br>Given his build, he is not as agile as the former two and can't react as fast when situation and thus, he is often caught out.<br><br>That's why, I believe MUFC is getting the Saint's left back, and will def sell out either one or even two of these mentioned.<br><br>SAF should not stall and should sell while they still have value.<br><br>But saying all that, MS has been a faithful servant and has done well.<br>Let's be reminded more of his good than bad.<br><br></div>
