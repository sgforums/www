              <p><strong>Roberto Martinez is relishing the challenge of pitting his managerial wits against Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br></strong>The Spaniard's first meeting with his United counterpart ended with a 5-0 defeat at the DW Stadium back in August. Although his Wigan Athletic side will arrive at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening as huge underdogs, Martinez is in upbeat mood ahead of the game.<br><br>"It's a tough challenge but it's always great to go head-to-head with probably one of the best managers ever in world football," he said.</p>
              <p>"We know it's a monumental task but we'll enjoy it. We're going to go there and try to nick it. Their home record is outstanding and they've got such a big squad but we're all excited to be going there."<br><br>Victory for United would reduce Chelsea's lead at the head of the Premier League to two points going into 2010.</p>

              <p>Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc has rubbished speculation linking him to either the France job or Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Reports suggest the French Football Federation have earmarked Blanc to replace the unpopular Raymond Domenech when his contract runs out after the 2010 World Cup finals.</p>
              <p>There are also suggestions that the 44-year-old is being lined up as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor at United - where Blanc spent the final two years of his playing career.</p>
              <p>However, the highly-rated coach insists no-one has made him any offers.</p>
              <p>"I signed a contract with Bordeaux for two more years so there is no urgency regarding my future," Blanc told Europe 1.</p>
              <p>"I have not received any approaches either from the federation or from abroad.</p>
              <p>"Just because I have strong links with Ferguson he's not going to come up to me and say 'Hey, here you go Laurent, I've saved the place for you'."</p>
              <p>This is only Blanc's third season in management.</p>
              <p>In his first campaign he steered Bordeaux to second spot in Ligue 1 before finally ending Lyon's stranglehold on the French title last year.</p>
              <p>Blanc claims that, while he would be delighted to be offered the France job, he could very well turn it down.</p>
              <p>"It would please me, that's obvious," he added. "But I could also refuse it.</p>
              <p>"Contractually I'm not free. Don't forget I have an employer. But if they offer it to me, I would think about it of course.</p>
              <p>"But the problem they will have is with dates.</p>
              <p>"The World Cup final is on July 11, unless they take a coach who's free, everyone else will be right in the middle of preparing for the new season and I don't see a coach giving all that up.</p>
              <p>"For me anyway it would be difficult."</p>
