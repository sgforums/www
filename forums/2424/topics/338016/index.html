              <h1>Tevez Will Join Madrid - Marca</h1>
              <p>"Tevez said 'yes' to Madrid...for next season," trumpeted Spanish sports daily <em>Marca.</em><br><br>According
                  to the newspaper - known for publishing stories that advance whatever
                  agenda Real Madrid are interested in pursuing at any given time - a
                  deal between Los Merengues and the Argentine international has already
                  been signed.<br><br>It is certainly true that Real Madrid are desperate
                  to bring in reinforcements for their depleted attack, with Dutch
                  striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy - another ex-Manchester United star - ruled
                  out for at least six months with a right knee injury suffered in the
                  Champions League defeat by Juventus in October.<br><br>It has also been
                  speculated - though denied by United boss Sir Alex Ferguson - that the
                  Red Devils would be willing to offload Tevez rather than bite the
                  bullet of buying his expensive contract from the MSI agency that 'owns'
                  him, especially as Ferguson seems to have settled on Wayne Rooney and
                  Dimitar Berbatov, when both are fit, as his regular starting strike
                  force. <br><br>However, that does not necessarily mean that <em>Marca </em>have put the two situations together and come up with the right answer.<br><br>Madrid are currently fourth in La Liga, five points behind leaders Barcelona.</p>

              <h1>Ferguson: Tevez To Real Madrid? No Comment</h1>
              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has finally been lured into
              commenting on the latest Red Devil-to-Madrid saga, which now involves
              Carlos Tevez.<br><br>Los Merengues are seeking a replacement for former
              United star Ruud van Nistelrooy, as the Dutchman is crocked and out for
              the rest of the season.<br><br>Thus, pseudo-unsettled Argentine Tevez
              has been linked with a January switch to the Bernabéu, having allegedly
              fallen out with Fergie recently after a period of prolonged appearances
              from the substitutes' bench despite his impressive form.<br><br>However,
              the fiery Scot has refused to even dignify such a suggestion of a
              transfer with a straight answer, preferring instead to take another dig
              at Madrid, who infamously chased Cristiano Ronaldo all summer long to
              no avail.<br><br>Tevez of course is still not officially a Manchester
              United player, with rumours that he will command a sky-high transfer
              fee from his owners to make the deal permanent - and though United have
              remained assured they will land their man, there have been suggestions
              to the contrary.<br><br>"I've not even spoken to Carlos about Real
              Madrid's interest," the Old Trafford boss said ahead of the Champions
              League clash with Spanish side Villarreal, "We get used to them talking
              to our players.<br><br>"I could have the opportunity to respond to Real Madrid every day of the season, because it never stops.<br><br>"There
              will be plenty of time to talk about Real Madrid throughout the rest of
              the season, but just now I'm focused on Villarreal."<br><br>El Madrigal is the venue as Fergie's troops attempt to escape from Group E on Tuesday evening.</p>
