              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson will try to exploit growing turmoil at Inter Milan by making a concerted attempt to sign Wesley Sneijder at the end of the season. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Though a huge admirer of Tottenham’s Luka Modric, the Manchester United manager has set his sights on Sneijder as his principal summer target and is prepared to meet a £25million asking price to prise him away from the San Siro. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Recruiting a midfielder with drive and energy is Ferguson’s priority, and the feedback on Sneijder’s likely availability has encouraged the Old Trafford boss to seek clearance to proceed with a bid.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Sportsmail</span> understands an offer will be lodged with Inter, and their president Massimo Moratti is willing to sanction the Holland World Cup midfielder’s departure, despite him signing a long-term deal this  season. </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Sneijder, 26, accepted improved terms until 2015 but has since seen Inter unravel under coach Leonardo, with the one-time Brazil midfielder coming under heavy fire for his tactical approach to their Champions League tie against Schalke and Serie A clash against city rivals AC Milan.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After axing Maicon and Thiago Motta for not trying hard enough in training, and even relegating Sneijder to the bench, Leonardo was at the mercy of a critical Italian media after Inter crashed out 7-3 on aggregate against Schalke and effectively surrendered their league title to Milan with a 3-0 derby defeat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Sneijder, who spent two seasons at Real Madrid before joining Inter in summer 2009, is ready for a fresh start and evidently relishes the challenge of replacing Paul Scholes as United’s new midfield general.</strong> <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">United have also been alerted to a hint that Porto are surprisingly ready to cash in on their main assets to ease financial worries. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Despite being crowned Portuguese champions with five games to go, Porto need to raise funds and are resigned to losing centre back Rolando, who was watched by an Old Trafford scout against Sporting Lisbon last weekend, and forward Hulk, who is also being monitored by United. </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>However, with doubts remaining over Carlos Tevez’s future, Manchester City have repeatedly run the rule over powerful Brazil front-runner Hulk and are prepared to match Porto’s £34m valuation. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">United were offered Rolando last summer and, although they dithered then, they are now ready to make a move for the 25-year-old, who has been capped 10 times by Portugal and is available at around £12m. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Though United have agreed a £17.8m fee with Atletico Madrid for goalkeeper David de Gea, there remain concerns within Old Trafford about the 20-year-old’s readiness to leave his homeland. </span></p>

              <p>Now then try to actively pursue him.I take it as kind of a miscue.He was not wanted at real madrid before Inter snatched him up.At that time ,with the foresight,should have known that we need somebody to take over scholes and he way ready to move but Manutd didn't move for him.The most impt thing was,he was CHEAPER than now.His stock has risen a lot at inter with all the honours and his adventure with the dutch team in the recent world cup.</p>
              <p>Should have snatched him from real.Now spending this kind of $ on him.Not really worth it.Besides him,there's van der vaart,another unwanted dutch player at real,we missed him yet again...look at what he did at spurs.Plus,..Ozil.Moved to real for 10+ m pounds only..oh god..If we had snatched up any of these 3...our centre midfield area would not be so horrendous now.<br>Keep seeing carrick playing like a whimp,anderson trying to play through passes that will nv go through.hai</p>

              <p>united also can pay him 120k a week wages, but if he wants more than 200k a week wages, then he should join city. 120k a week is already a lot of money, plus you join a club that will challenge for domestic and CL title aspirations every season.</p>
              <p>city have riches, but they do not have a winner manager.</p>

              <p>Yeah I agree it's very hard to say... At his age, money would be his biggest motivation having won many stuff already. And at 26, this could be his last big money deal. So City would be attractive cos City is not exactly an average side either. Moreover, United when they sign a new players even on big money, they don't normally pay very very high salaries as this would give them room to increased in their next deal (renew)... Berbatov is on like $80k, $90k only despite paying $30m for him...</p>
              <p>Tevez was on like $60k to $70k when he was at United... See how he left and didn't want to sign a new deal? But who can blame him when City was offering $160k to $200k per week.</p>
              <p>Barry who fought so hard to go to Liverpool suddenly changed his mind and rather go to City...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Then there is Yaya Toure... Chelsea and United was interested in him. But look where he chose, how do you blame him, he is said to be the highest earner in the EPL currently... He career is coming to an end and he will take whatever can pay him the most before be retires and never earn this kind of salary again... Or how about Silva too?</span></p>
              <p>Sometimes we have to look at it from both sides lor...</p>

              <p>City is good, not as good as United. United have a better chance with the league and obviously will contend CL next season.</p>
              <p>Just mentioning that money has been a very very very big factor in recent years, in most cases, the turning point of a player's decision. Players say one thing, want to go this club, come-get-me-plea, etc, then suddenly, joins another team, mainly because they've offered a lot more in contracts.</p>
              <p>I would really like Sneijder to come, but he hasn't really have the best track record in terms of club signings. But I can only be skeptical until the deal is done, for United of course.</p>
