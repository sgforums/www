            <div class='col-md body'>Roy Keane accepts he overstepped the mark towards the end of his Manchester United career.<br><br>The Irishman's trophy-laden 12 years with The Red Devils were brought to an abrupt halt last autumn after he was critical of his former team-mates.<br><br>He was let go by United and finished his playing career with a spell at boyhood heroes Celtic, but returned to football on Tuesday by being unveiled as Sunderland's new manager.<br><br>Reflecting on his departure from Old Trafford, the 35-year-old concedes his forthright views cost him his United career.<br><br>"No doubt over the years I have crossed that white line and it has probable cost me lots," Keane told a press conference on Sky Sports News.<br><br>"The World Cup in 2002, my United career.<br><br>"But it has also been a big plus to me. I do care about the game, who I am playing for and playing with.<br><br>"Over the forthcoming days, weeks, months and, hopefully, years at Sunderland I will look to get the balance right.<br><br>"Sometimes it comes with experience as you get older and more wise.<br><br>"I've made mistakes, but I'm just glad I've got this opportunity and hopefully I'll make the most of it.<br><br>"I wouldn't be sitting here if I thought I couldn't do it."<br><br>Keane has already been in touch with his former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and admits he could be on the phone for new players.<br><br>He added: "I spoke to him briefly over the last few days, but you've got to be your own man.<br><br>"I always enjoyed the way he looked after players, in terms of backing them and defending them.<br><br>"Again, maybe I did cross that line towards the end and I was rightly punished for it you could say. Again you move on.<br><br>"I was very, very fortunate to play under him and I'm sure I can pick up the phone any time and he'll lend me a few players if I need any!"<br><br>Keane has also had his differences with Niall Quinn in the past, but the ex-United captain feels any problems have now been laid to rest.<br><br>He continued: "I think it will be fine. A lot of people have been making a big issue of what happened in the past.<br><br>"When I met up with Niall three or four months ago, we sorted it out there and then, despite what was going to happen if I took the job or not, which was important for me.<br><br>"People have this impression of me out there, but I think it's important to move on.<br><br>"I have had differences with thousands of people, but I'm humble enough to apologise if I've done something wrong.<br><br>"Working with Niall I really don't see a problem."<br><br><a href="http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=412917&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=1&amp;lid=&amp;title=Keane:+I+crossed+the+line" rel="nofollow">http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=412917&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=1&amp;lid=&amp;title=Keane:+I+crossed+the+line</a></div>
