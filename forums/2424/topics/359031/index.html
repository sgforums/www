              Gerard Pique is relishing a reunion with United after his Barcelona side booked a berth in this season's Champions League final.
              
              The 22-year-old defender joined United from Barca in 2004, only to return to the Nou Camp at the end of last season.
              
              Pique's departure came shortly after he had missed out on a place in the Reds' playing squad in for the Champions League final in Moscow but, with Eric Abidal and Daniel Alves both suspended for this year's showpiece, and Rafael Marquez likely to miss the final through injury, it seems certain Pique will play a part in Rome.
              
              "It is against Manchester United and it will be special for me because I had four years which were really good for me there," Pique told Sky Sports.
              
              "Maybe I didn't play a lot but it was really good to get experience because I was very young. It will be very special. It means a lot, but more because we are in the final."
              
              The Catalans, beaten by United in last year's semi-final, booked a re-match with the Reds by virtue of Andres Iniesta's injury-time leveller at Chelsea on Wednesday evening. While Pep Guardiola's side left it late to find the net for the first time over two legs against the Blues, Pique feels his side boast too much firepower to be kept quiet.
              
              "A team like this that is trying to attack all the time cannot go 180 minutes without scoring a goal," he said. "It was the last minute, but it was enough to qualify for the final and I have no words to describe how happy the team is."
