              <p><span class="italic"><em>Welbeck and Cleverley could be set for loan moves</em></span></p>
              <p><span class="italic">
              </span></p><p>Promising Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck accepts he is likely to go out on loan to a Barclays Premier League club in the coming season.</p>
              <p>Manager Sir Alex Ferguson says both Welbeck and midfielder Tom Cleverley have good futures but need regular football at another top-flight team.</p>
              <p>Sunderland have already expressed an interest in Welbeck, who had a spell on loan at Preston last season before suffering a knee injury, which needed an operation.</p>
              <p>He has made a bright start to United's five-match summer tour which takes in Canada, the United States and Mexico.</p>
              <p>The 19-year-old Manchester-born forward scored in the victory against Celtic in Toronto last week and followed that display by setting up Gabriel Obertan for the winner in midweek when Philadelphia Union were beaten.</p>
              <p>Welbeck insists he is content to go along with any short-term career plans Ferguson may have for him.</p>
              <p>Welbeck said: "My main aim is to be part of the first team set-up but I am happy to go on loan if the manager wants me to. I just want to keep playing games and improving.</p>
              <p>"I feel I have improved a lot over the last couple of years in particular. I have learned so much during that time particularly the importance of mental strength on and off the pitch. I just want to keep improving and striving to show everyone what I can do.</p>
              <p>"I am really pleased with how the tour has gone for me so far and I am happy with my performances. I have got to keep going and continue to get my fitness up."</p>
              <p>Welbeck says it is a "privilege" to be around senior outfield players like Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Dimitar Berbatov on tour.</p>
              <p>The squad are due to leave Philadelphia for Kansas on Saturday to prepare for the match against the Wizards on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Welbeck added: "It is always good to be away with a few of the older lads because you pick up so much from them every day.</p>
              <p>"You see how they prepare for games, how they rest and how they train. They are unbelievable - they have this huge determination to win every single training match, let alone actual games. Just to be around them is a real privilege."</p>
              <p>Even though the Wizards have struggled for consistency in the MLS Eastern Conference they are expecting a bumper crowd at the Arrowhead Stadium with ticket sales still climbing after hitting the 40,000 mark last month.</p>
              <p>President Robb Heineman said: "This is one of a series of events here which are staking claim that Kansas City truly is a soccer town.</p>
              <p>"The things we are trying to do here are not small minded in nature. I am hopeful we are going to have the largest crowd on the tour. This match speaks volumes for the momentum we have in Kansas City."</p>
              <p>United then face an MLS All-Stars XI in Houston before ending the tour in Guadalajara against Chivas after signing striker Javier Hernandez.</p>
