I've never seen Anderson play but I've heard that he is a very exciting player. BBC Radio 5 have just announced that we have also reached agreement on a fee for Nani. If true we have picked up 2 wide players and I am hoping that this means we may see Ronaldo play some time up front as a partner for Rooney."<br>Barry Lee, USA<br>30/05/2007 at 21:05<br><br>"Wow! This feels like doing 0-60 in 2 seconds! There we all were wondering how long it'd be before the next signing, if any, and like buses, along come two at the same time (three, with OH next week). Looks like Utd are going with youth then (okay, not counting OH). I wonder whether there will still be further signings, or does Fergie see Anderson as capable of filling in as a striker, or in the hole, covering for Scholes? Hopefully this will also further bed Ronny into Utd..."<br>Jrogger, Canterbury<br>30/05/2007 at 21:16<br><br>"Anderson seems to be a left winger and Nani a right winger. It would therefore mean Ronaldo and Rooney playing up front for the forthcoming season. Or will we still be in the market for a proven goalscorer?"<br>Xs, Mauritius<br>30/05/2007 at 21:22<br><br>"Anderson could well be the new Scholes (yes he's that good). He'll need time to adapt to the EPL and I hope the fans give him that time. Very excited by United signing him and can't wait to see him in the team. Wonder who'll be the incoming striker? Nice that Mr Gill has stuck to his word this summer (well that's if all 3 deals don't end up getting hi jacked by other teams). Nani a superb prospect, but may struggle in EPL, can be a bit lightweight, but very fast and has good feet."<br>Bradley<br>30/05/2007 at 21:25<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as seen from earlier posts..<br><br>1) does it means the closing of chequebook for with these two, now MUFC can afford to play Ronaldo, or even Giggs with Rooney, negating the need for a natural goalscorer? the endless possibilities if these two were to settle fast.<br><br>2) importance of carlos quiroz? with Gunners going french, Pool going spanish, seems MUFC going portugese, stealing from jose's backyard????<br><br>3)  finally we got replacement for aging players in scholes and giggs..<br><br>4) with these added flair and quality, time for TREBLE??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
