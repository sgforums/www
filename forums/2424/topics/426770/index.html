              <p>Injury-plagued <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7825/Rio-Ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a> has given Manchester United a timely boost by returning to training just two weeks after manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> had effectively ruled him out for the rest of the season.</p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">
              <div style="margin-left: 10px; width: 275px;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/1208/rioferdinand20101208_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Rio Ferdinand" width="275" height="155">
              <div style="width: 275px;"><cite>GettyImages</cite>Rio Ferdinand: Has played 15 Premier League games for Man United this season</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/900849/wayne-rooney:-old-trafford-%27fear%27-stifles-opponents"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Ferdinand,
               32, has been out of action since picking up a calf strain in the 
              warm-up prior to United's shock defeat at Wolves at the start of 
              February.</p>
              <p>After making slow progress in his recovery, Ferguson 
              admitted the club were "not looking at this as a short-term situation" 
              but the former England skipper returned to training on Wednesday and, 
              although he is likely to miss the first leg of the Champions League 
              quarter-final against Chelsea, he has a chance of featuring when United 
              welcome Fulham to Old Trafford on April 9.</p>
              <p>"He's started training,
               he trained this morning but I think you know the Friday morning session
               is not excessive, it's just a light session for the players," said 
              Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"I could bring him back tomorrow and give him a few days
               off afterwards but I think he's more likely to be fit for the Fulham 
              game."</p>
              <p>Ferguson may ultimately conclude it is worth taking a 
              gamble given none of his other injured defenders will be back to face 
              Chelsea, whilst a few may be available for Fulham.</p>
              <p>Rafael, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7624/John-O%27Shea">John O'Shea</a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8866/Wes-Brown">Wes Brown</a> could all tackle <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=20">Mark Hughes</a>'
               men. But none of that trio will make the trip to Stamford Bridge, when 
              Jonny Evans will be available as he serves a three-match domestic ban.</p>
              <p>None of this helps his team selection for Saturday, when Ferguson accepts filling
              the right-back slot is going to be a major issue.</p>
              <p>"We have to solve that and find the right solution,'' he said.</p>
              <p>It seems almost certain Brazilian Fabio will fill the void, with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/123605/Chris-Smalling">Chris Smalling</a> partnering skipper <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/24529/Nemanja-Vidic">Nemanja Vidic</a> in central defence.</p>
              <p>At least Ferguson finally has options in midfield. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21544/Park-Ji-Sung">Park Ji-Sung</a> could make his first start since he left for Asian Cup duty in Qatar, 
              whilst Anderson is likely to be on the bench at Upton Park after 
              recovering from a knee injury it was initially suggested would rule him 
              out for the season.</p>
              <p>However, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8871/Darren-Fletcher">Darren Fletcher</a> is still troubled by a virus, whilst <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/12654/Owen-Hargreaves">Owen Hargreaves</a>'
              United career now looks to be at an end following the shoulder problem he picked
              up in training.</p>
              <p>"It is another huge setback for the lad,'' said Ferguson.</p>
