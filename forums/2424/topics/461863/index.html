              <p class="imageCaption">Hit man: Ruud van Nistelrooy scored 150 goals for Manchester United</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Ruud van Nistelrooy believes his own brutal departure from Manchester United underlines why Sir Alex Ferguson has spent so long at the top.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Van Nistelrooy scored an incredible 150 goals in five seasons with the Old Trafford outfit from 2001.</span></p>
              <p><span>It is a record that rightly places him amongst the greatest strikers in United's history. Even Cristiano Ronaldo was unable to match the 44 goals Van Nistelrooy scored in United's 2002-03 Premier League title-winning season.</span> </p>
              <p><span>Yet that staggering return counted for nothing when Ferguson decided Van Nistelrooy had outlived his usefulness.</span> </p>
              <p><span>As the summer of 2006 approached, Ferguson decided to pick Giuseppe Rossi ahead of Van Nistelrooy for the final game of the season against Charlton.</span> </p>
              <p><span>The Dutchman drove away from Old Trafford in disgust and - until Friday's unveiling of a Ferguson statue - had not been back since.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'When he is building new teams he is willing to do things like that,' said Van Nistelrooy.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'That is all credit to him. In his mind, the club is the most important thing.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'That is what he always said. It is his most-repeated sentence.'</span> </p>
              <p><span>At the time, Van Nistelrooy was incredulous, as were many fans.</span> </p>
              <p><span>Yet United came back to win three successive Premier League titles and a Champions League triumph in 2008, in a period when they never did worse than a semi-final.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'What he did was fair enough,' said Van Nistelrooy.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'I didn't find it hard to deal with. I accepted it.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'I moved on to Madrid and had four great years there. He moved the club further onwards.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'My overall feeling about United is that I had a great five years there and I wanted to come back today to pay respect to the manager because I am very grateful for the chance he gave me.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'Of course, we had our things with the way it ended but he is man who gets the best out of people. He did that with me as well.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Possibly the true nature of Ferguson's achievements are not fully appreciated without going through the number of stellar careers he has nurtured.</span> </p>
              <p><span>Van Nistelrooy, Eric Cantona, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes were all present today. Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham sent messages by video.</span> </p>
              <p><span>Roy Keane was amongst the most notable absentees but even if the Irishman's relationship with his one-time manager has been fractured beyond repair by his outspoken criticisms of United's Champions League elimination 12 months ago - and Ferguson's reaction to them - even he would surely admit the Scot had a positive influence on his career.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'It is incredible how many careers he has touched,' said Van Nistelrooy.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'Twenty-six seasons is difficult to get your head round.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'Ten years is an awful long time for a manager to be at a club in football but Sir Alex is going on and on.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'He has a very strong desire to give his best every single day.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'That is what he does. He puts everything he has in and here we are.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'In three or four years we will be talking 30 years. It is out of this world.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'But he is doing it. As he said, he has outlived death. He is outliving everyone.'</span></p>
