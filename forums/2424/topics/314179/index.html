              <p class="art-p"><strong>Paul Ince and Darren Ferguson are poised to become the latest of Fergie's managerial fledglings to taste success today. Ince will clinch promotion with MK Dons - a week after winning the Johnstone's Paints Trophy at Wembley - if they beat Wycombe at home this afternoon. The feat has already made him one of the most highly-rated young managers currently plying their trade outside the Premier League. And he could be joined by Sir Alex Ferguson's son Darren who will lead Peterborough back up to League One after a three-year absence should they beat Stockport at London Road.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">Ince and Ferguson jnr follow in the footsteps of a clutch of former Manchester United players who learned their trade under Sir Alex. The most successful so far in England is Mark Hughes whose Blackburn side are pushing for a UEFA Cup place. Wigan boss Steve Bruce has been the most travelled with six clubs under his belt, including two spells with the Latics.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Roy Keane lifted the Championship title with Sunderland and looks set to keep the Black Cats in the Premier League. Bryan Robson - now in an ambassadorial role at United - had success with Middlesbrough while Mark Robins, whose FA Cup winner against Nottingham Forest saved Sir Alex's job back in 1990, is now boss of Rotherham.</p>

              <p>Wa!!! BPL getting dominated by manutd managers. So many managers formerly from manutd and they are always so fired up to help manutd win the title while opposing rivals like arsenal, liverpool and chelsea.</p>

              <p>Mark hughes (blackburn), roy keane (sunderland), steve bruce(wigan)...wa all of them anti chelsea, arsenal, liverpool but always lose to manutd (so far this season) sia! An empire is emerging!</p>

              <p><strong>Steve Bruce has revealed that Sir Alex Ferguson called him twice ahead of Wigan's clash with Chelsea to offer encouragement and advice.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Latics boss has revealed that Ferguson has only called him four times since he took over at Wigan - twice before the Arsenal game and twice before this week's Chelsea clash.</p>
              <p>Bruce has certainly been an ally of Ferguson's this season as his Wigan side drew first with Arsenal 0-0 and then rescued a point with a late Emile HEskey goal at Stamford Bridge on Monday night.</p>
              <p>"Sir Alex has phoned me twice before this game and twice before Arsenal.He hasn't phoned me any other time during the season. Four times!" said Bruce.</p>
              <p>"I have had a few calls from friends in Manchester but I am more pleased for us getting a point. The United players will be pleased but they know it's not over yet."</p>
              <p>It's almost over because Chelsea are now five points behind United but Avram Grant insists: "Of course the players still believe. Anyway we need to win against Everton, against United and we need them to have a bad result. So nothing much changes."</p>

              <p><strong>Phil Neville has issued a rallying call in the direction of his team-mates as Everton's season threatens to peter out. For much of the campaign the Toffees looked capable of qualifying for the Champions League but in recent weeks poor form has put paid to best-laid plans.</strong></p>
              <p>Everton's new challenge is to fend off those clubs closing in on fifth. Aston Villa and Portsmouth have hit their stride at just the right time of the season and Neville has warned his Toffees team-mates that they must see the campaign out professionally, starting against Chelsea on Thursday.</p>
              <p>"We're at the stage of the season where we seem to have hit a brick wall," Neville told <em>evertonTV</em>. "But we have got to recover and find something from within to kick on and get that fourth place. That's still what we are aiming for and the position that we want. "We can't worry about results at Anfield or Villa Park or Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>"We have to make sure we win our own games and there's no better way to bounce back from the disappointment of the weekend by beating a quality team like Chelsea. "There's no motivation needed for Thursday, fourth place is still up for grabs and we have to make sure that we get the just rewards for our season.</p>
