              <p><strong>Manchester United winger Nani
              says he has no intention of quitting the club, despite failing to
              secure regular football at Old Trafford. </strong></p>
              <p>The Portugal international, signed from Sporting in a big-money deal
              two years ago, has so far failed to live up to expectations and has
              slipped behind established stars in the United pecking order.</p>
              <p>He could be deemed surplus to requirements in the summer if, as
              expected, Sir Alex Ferguson looks to strengthen his attacking options,
              but the player says he has no intention of walking away.</p>
              <p>“It is very difficult at a club like Manchester United because there are so many good players here,” he said.</p>
              <p>“It is hard when you are not playing but I am happy here and I have confidence that I can be part of everything.</p>
              <p>“The manager has not said anything to me, but I want to stay. I don’t want to leave and nothing has been said about leaving.”</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Nani dismisses fears over United future</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/man-utd/nani-ball.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>After seeing his Manchester United future called into question
              following a fit of pique at the weekend, Nani has attempted to smooth
              over any problems by declaring he has no intention of leaving the club.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nani reportedly left Old Trafford early following his half-time
              substitution against Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend, leading to
              suggestions that his time under Sir Alex Ferguson could be coming to an
              abrupt end.</span></p>
              <p>After  joining United for a fee in the region of £18 million in
              2007, Nani has started only 22 league games and has left Old Trafford
              regulars largely underwhelmed with his contribution, aside from some
              sporadic spectacular strikes.</p>
              <p>But the 22-year-old is adamant that he does not want to leave Old Trafford and has denied a rift with Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"I was not satisfied with my work against Tottenham but I accept the
              orders of the coach with the half-time substitution," said Nani.</p>
              <p>"In the second half the team changed in every respect but I alone am
              not responsible for the bad performance in the first 45 minutes. I
              finished the game unhappy with my work but I still believe I can
              demonstrate my level at United.</p>
              <p>"My head is in Manchester United and the rumours about other clubs are not true.</p>
              <p>“I am at the best club in the world and it is my desire to stay here. My dream is to secure a place in the first team.</p>
              <p>“I have not shown my best this season because of injuries but I am a professional and I will fight for this club.</p>
              <p>“I do not have any problems with the coach. I will always be
              grateful to the manager for this opportunity and I am still learning. I
              will never reject the challenge to be a star for this team."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson
              has confirmed that Nani will be a Manchester United player next season
              and declared that he would be a success. </strong></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old has struggled to make an impact this
              term with just six Premier League starts to his name and failing to
              complete a full 90 minutes in any of them.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese
              winger's season was perhaps best summed up on Saturday when he was
              substituted at half-time with United trailing 2-0 only for the
              champions to come back and triumph 5-2.</p>
              <p>Many suspected Nani, who
              United signed from Sporting Lisbon for £14million only two years ago,
              to be heading for the Old Trafford exit door in the summer but the Red
              Devils boss insists he is going nowhere.</p>
              <p>"He has been unlucky this season," the Scot said.</p>
              <p>"The form of Park Ji-sung has been absolutely outstanding and most of the time has kept Nani out of the team.</p>
              <p>"Getting a consistent run has really been the problem for him and then he got a little injury.</p>
              <p>"But he will be here next season and he will do very well next season for us."</p>

              <p><strong>Anderson is convinced that Nani should not be fearing for his Manchester United future.</strong></p>
              <p>The Portugal international, signed at the same time as the
              Brazilian, has not pushed on this season while Anderson has managed to
              earn more favour with Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>After being forced to insist he had permission to leave Old Trafford
              early after being substituted against Tottenham, Nani was left out of
              the squad altogether for the Champions League win over Arsenal.</p>
              <p>There is obvious speculation about the exciting winger's future but
              Anderson has explained that squad rotation goes with the territory at
              the European champions.</p>
              <p>"Nani is in good shape," he told RTP. "He has played some good games but the coach picks the team.</p>
              <p>"Everyone knows that he can only play 11 players. The majority of players do not always play. It is normal that this happens."</p>
