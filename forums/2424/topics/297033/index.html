            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson admits his young side will take huge positives from their thoroughly deserved draw against a strong Roma side in the Stadio Olimpico.<br><br>Although the Italians posed questions of their visitors after the break and snatched a point through ManciniÂ’s 70th-minute equaliser, United could easily have registered a sixth win in Group F.<br><br>Only profligate finishing and good goalkeeping prevented the Reds from building on Gerard PiqueÂ’s first-half opener, but Sir Alex was nevertheless satisfied by what he saw.<br><br>Â“I was pleased with a lot of it,Â” he told Sky Sports. Â“I think in the second half we gave the ball away too much, which is perhaps understandable with our inexperience at times. But we put up a good performance and I think we can be pleased with that.<br><br>Â“We lacked a bit of experience at times, but it was compensated for by their ability on the ball, we played some good football against the strongest Roma side. WeÂ’re really pleased with that.Â”<br><br>UnitedÂ’s youngsters suffered a humiliating defeat to Coventry City in the Carling Cup back in September but, with seven of those who started against the Sky Blues lining up in Rome, a huge degree of pride was restored by WednesdayÂ’s result.<br><br>Â“In the context of today there wasnÂ’t a great deal in the game for either side, but I think both sides played with quite a deal of freedom in their game,Â” said Sir Alex. Â“It was end to end and I think in the end it was a very good European game.<br><br>Â“I think we were unlucky in the second half, we had a good bit of football between Wayne Rooney and Louis Saha, and unluckily we werenÂ’t able to put it in, but it was good football.<br><br>Â“It [the experience] helps them. The sudden bursts of play from Roma can catch you off guard at times. The explosion of noise from their fans is exactly the same thing, and thatÂ’s the European game for you. It will do them the world of good.Â”<br></div>
