              <p>For 17 years Sir Alex Ferguson has been steadily placing explosives at the foot of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a>'s infamous perch and this weekend he will invite them to the detonation. Whether to partake in a possible farewell to the honour of England's most decorated champions, a mantle now shared with <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>, is the dilemma tearing at Anfield's conscience.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been here before, of course. For Chelsea 2010 read Blackburn Rovers 1995, and a Sunday at Anfield when natural elation at a home victory will be severely tempered by the side-effect of assisting a Manchester United title challenge. Providing, of course, that Ferguson's team can capitalise on the offer, unlike 15 years ago when a United draw at West Ham gave Kenny Dalglish's Blackburn the title regardless of their 2-1 defeat at Anfield.</p>
              <p>That day still represents one of the most surreal match-going experiences for many Liverpool supporters, who were divided over which goals to embrace – Alan Shearer's opener, John Barnes's equaliser or Jamie Redknapp's exquisite last-minute winner – but ultimately shared their former hero Dalglish's joy as the losing team began to celebrate before the final whistle. Yet 15 years ago a United title victory would have been an unpalatable irritation. Their failure to score a second past Ludo Miklosko in the West Ham goal ensured Liverpool's superiority over their Old Trafford rivals remained at 18-9 in championships.</p>
              <p>There seemed no threat to the perch back then, but it is indicative of Ferguson's command and Liverpool's malaise that 18-19 beckons should Chelsea drop points at Anfield and United win their remaining two games. Anfield's dilemma has deepened as a consequence. Indeed, a text doing the rounds beseeches Rafael Benítez to field Cilla Black, Ken Dodd, Holly Johnson, Sinbad the window cleaner – and Lucas Leiva – against Carlo Ancelotti's contenders this weekend.</p>
              <p>Not all have veered from the doctrine that a supporter always supports. John Mackin, co-author of "REDMEN: A Season on the Drink", explained: "People have been talking about wanting us to lose for a few weeks now but personally I want to win it. I always want my team to win. The only thing I hope for is that it plays out like the Blackburn game in 1995. I remember United fans on the telly in the week leading up to that game saying: 'Win it for us, scousers', but thankfully the gods smiled upon the football world that day and it played out perfectly.</p>
              <p>"My gut reaction when Redknapp scored that day was to punch the air and celebrate, but a few people around us were saying: 'What have we done?' We still have a chance of fourth place this season and I'd be delighted to beat Chelsea even if it puts United in the driving seat. We can't hope to stay the most successful team in the land because of another team's failure. We have to get our own house in order and try to stay the most successful team by virtue of our own success." Blackburn 1995 demonstrated perfectly the distinction between supporters' emotions and a player's professional duty. Liverpool silenced all the sceptics that day, to the extent it gives United hope for the penultimate weekend and the game that, on paper, provides the best chance of another turn in the title race.</p>
              <p>As Liverpool's captain, Steven Gerrard, said: "We are underdogs for fourth position but our fans know that we have also got Everton breathing down our necks and we certainly don't want them finishing above us. We have got a couple of games left now and the idea is to take maximum points to see if we can get into fourth through the back door. If we take maximum points, who knows? The teams above us might slip up."</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney summed it up as a United player and Evertonian would. "Liverpool are a proud club with a lot of history and I'm sure they'll want to win that game as they're fighting for the Europa League," the newly crowned PFA player of the year said.</p>
              <p>Unlike 1995, the timing of Liverpool's belated influence on the title encourages the controversial prospect of Benítez fielding a weakened team against Chelsea. No Liverpool manager wants United overtaking the club's league title record on his watch. It may not be devilment that influences Benítez's thinking on Sunday, however, but what has unfortunately become standard managerial practice at this stage of a season.</p>
              <p>Should Liverpool qualify for the Europa League final by beating Atlético Madrid on Thursday and see fourth place almost disappear with a Spurs victory over Bolton on Saturday, Benítez may be tempted to tinker, with a trophy in mind. Roy Hodgson did precisely that with the Fulham side he fielded at Goodison on Sunday. Likewise Sir Alex Ferguson in last season's FA Cup semi-final against Everton, when he prioritised chasing the European Cup and <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> in an admittedly more demanding schedule than faces Liverpool. Finally, the thought of Benítez's rotation policy being brought out of storage is sufficient to send a chill through Old Trafford.</p>

              <h2><strong>No-win situation: Fans caught in a dilemma</strong></h2>
              <p><strong>Dave Usher</strong><br><strong>Editor of the Liverpool Way fanzine</strong></p>
              <p>'There will be no satisfactory outcome on Sunday. If we win, we are basically handing the title to the Mancs and allowing them to overhaul us as the most successful side in the land. But if we lose, we are giving up any faint hope of finishing in the top four. I want us to win but if we don't you won't find me crying about it. There is a part of me that would find it hilarious if Rafa 'rested' most of our side and we lost, as it would cause Fergie's head to explode'</p>
              <p><strong>Les Lawson</strong><br><strong>Secretary of the Merseyside branch of the Liverpool Supporters' Club</strong></p>
              <p>'This match is not one I'm looking forward to. I never want Man United to win the title and particularly so this year as it will be title No19. The problem on Sunday, too, is that Liverpool kick off before United do [against Sunderland] and so we can't even go into our game hoping that they've slipped up and thus we can then go all out for a win. It's a very difficult situation'</p>
              <p><strong>Anil Patel</strong><br><strong>Kop season-ticket holder for 21 years</strong></p>
              <p>'For me there is no dilemma – I want Liverpool to win every game they play in, whether it be the first team, the reserves or the youth side. Too many of our fans are obsessed with United but they shouldn't worry about them. There is still a chance of us finishing fourth and we should aim for that until it's mathematically impossible.</p>

              <p>You know, the very fact that a 'dilemma' even exists among some Liverpool fans shows how messed-up things have become....</p>
              <p>For all their hatred of Man U, every game should be treated like a game that has to be won. Full stop. I don't particularly support any side, but I like to see sides that play professionally. A team that intentionally throws a match out of hatred for another team is a team that deserves to be spat at and reviled from one end of England to the other.</p>
              <p>I don't give a sh*t about who Rafa chooses to play in the Chelsea match, so long as they put in a 100% effort and not throw the match. He can play the reserves for all I care - so long as they put in their very best.</p>
              <p>When I watch the match, I expect to see an all-out slugfest between the Blues and the Reds, and not a one-sided bore brought about by poor attitude of Liverpool players.</p>
              <p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: to throw the match is tantamount to robbing the grave of Bill Shankly himself. And Liverpool fans know what sacrilege that is.</p>

              <p>United = Liverpool's Arch Enemy since dunno when because of

              quite near each other, something like derby clubs).</p>
              <p>If they win Chelsea, United might pip Chelsea for the title and
              thus, overtaking Liverpool's record 18 league titles. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>You know, the very fact that a 'dilemma' even exists among some Liverpool fans shows how messed-up things have become....</p>
              <p>For all their hatred of Man U, every game should be treated like a game that has to be won. Full stop. I don't particularly support any side, but I like to see sides that play professionally. A team that intentionally throws a match out of hatred for another team is a team that deserves to be spat at and reviled from one end of England to the other.</p>
              <p>I don't give a sh*t about who Rafa chooses to play in the Chelsea match, so long as they put in a 100% effort and not throw the match. He can play the reserves for all I care - so long as they put in their very best.</p>
              <p>When I watch the match, I expect to see an all-out slugfest between the Blues and the Reds, and not a one-sided bore brought about by poor attitude of Liverpool players.</p>
              <p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: to throw the match is tantamount to robbing the grave of Bill Shankly himself. And Liverpool fans know what sacrilege that is.</p>

              <p>I don't care whether Liverpool wins or loses this match.</p>
              <p>I don't care whether Rafa puts out his best team or his reserves.</p>
              <p>All I care is whether or not the Liverpool players give their 100% in this match. To intentionally throw the match is pure sacrilege. To all those Liverpool fans who say that '<em>I hate Man U, let's just throw this match'</em>, I flash one big middle finger at them.</p>
              <p>If Liverpool were to really intentionally lose this match, then I hope <strong>all</strong> of the following events will take place:</p>
              <p>1. Chelsea loses their final match and Man U wins their 19th Premiership anyway,</p>
              <p>2. Atletico Madrid beats Liverpool and destroys their last chance for a trophy.</p>
              <p>3. Spurs (or Man City) gets 4th place instead of Liverpool</p>
              <p>4. Everton (their other most-hated rivals) leapfrogs Liverpool and throws them out of the Europa League.</p>
              <p>That would be awesome poetic justice.</p>
