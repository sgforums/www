              <p>I don't care whether Liverpool wins or loses this match.</p>
              <p>I don't care whether Rafa puts out his best team or his
              reserves.</p>
              <p>All I care is whether or not the Liverpool players give their
              100% in this match. To intentionally throw the match is pure
              sacrilege. To all those Liverpool fans who say that '<em>I hate Man
              U, let's just throw this match'</em>, I flash one big middle finger
              at them.</p>
              <p>If Liverpool were to really intentionally lose this match, then
              I hope <strong>all</strong> of the following events will take
              place:</p>
              <p>1. Chelsea loses their final match and Man U wins their 19th
              Premiership anyway,</p>
              <p>2. Atletico Madrid beats Liverpool and destroys their last
              chance for a trophy.</p>
              <p>3. Spurs (or Man City) gets 4th place instead of Liverpool</p>
              <p>4. Everton (their other most-hated rivals) leapfrogs Liverpool
              and throws them out of the Europa League.</p>
              <p>That would be awesome poetic justice.</p>

              <p>well, no need to lay down such harsh condition.</p>
              <p>It is understandable that Pool's priority is to win the Europa League or at least be there for European games next season 4th Place is perhaps out of their grasp.</p>
              <p>I think Pool will always play all out, but with Chelsea's form, sadly, it is egg vs rock.</p>

              <p>well, I understand where you coming from.My pt, in this game, it is brutual at their level. Quality is key. Effort alone may not be enough.I just wish Pool to keep the score respectable for their own sake. As a MU fan, I don't believe Pool players will have the 19th title thingy hanging over their head and put in anything less than 100%, they are professional.</p>
              <p>For a big club like Pool, its ability to affect the title race boils down to this, is quite pitiful. Hopefully, it can bounce back to its glory days soon. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Exactly. I just want Liverpool to play their hearts out. Full stop. They can throw in their clerks and physios and kitmen for all I care as long as they do their best.</p>
              <p>Which is why I'm cursing all those morons who want Liverpool to throw the match. Football rivalry is one thing, but football professionalism is all-important.</p>
              <p>And if Liverpool really does throw the match intentionally, then I would hope for them to face all the four brutal scenarios that I spelled out.</p>

              <p>it is title-deciding... these last 2 games are..</p>
              <p>if LFC throws the match which they could have fought out for a draw or even a win, MUFC loses the championship...</p>
              <p>Wolves doing it when they faced MUFC was punished with a suspended £25,000 fine.. the cynics may say there's not much since it's a suspended fine, but the good name of Wolves is tarred forever for this one incident...</p>
              <p>but then, i guess the meaning of sportsmanship is gone... killed by the almighty dollar...</p>
              <p>and if LFC chooses to throw the match just because they don't want MUFC to get the 19th, then LFC should be thrown out of the whole business of sports.. because they don't deserve any less...</p>
              <p>btw... LFC fans can go blame Rafa for this.. and this is one hell of a test for the club.. as well as its fans... and many have already been found wanting...</p>
