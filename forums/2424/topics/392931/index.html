              <h1>Michael Knighton fears Red Knights' Manchester United bid doomed</h1>
              <h2>Michael Knighton ought to be an honorary Red Knight. After all, the former 
              property magnate came within touching distance of riding a wave of popular 
              support to dislodge a resented owner at Manchester United before 'fan-power' had 
              even entered the football vocabulary.</h2>

              <p><strong>It is August 1989 and Knighton, having unveiled a radical blueprint aimed at 
              realising United's global potential, strides on to the Old Trafford pitch, in 
              full </strong><strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/">Manchester United</a></strong><strong> training kit, and 
              juggles the ball before striking it into the net at the Stretford End prior to 
              the 4-1 victory against Arsenal. </strong></p>
              <p>Knighton had the United supporters in the palm of his hand. Martin Edwards, 
              the hugely unpopular owner, had signalled his readiness to accept Knighton's £20 
              million takeover bid and succumb to the 'Edwards Out' chants that had echoed 
              around Old Trafford for months.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>It was a dream scenario for the United supporters. Here was a man with a 
              plan, a charismatic tycoon ready to modernise Old Trafford and allow the United 
              brand to generate the huge income streams it provides today.</p>
              <p>Yet the dream quickly died. Knighton's partners, Robert Thornton, the former 
              Debenham's chief executive, and Stanley Cohen of Parker Pens, withdrew their 
              financial backing when the bid began to attract adverse publicity and, within 
              months, Edwards abandoned plans to sell. Knighton was instead offered 30,000 
              shares and a seat on the club's board.</p>
              <p>As the Red Knights, the supporter-backed group of wealthy individuals, 
              attempt to go one better than Knighton by ousting United's current owners, the 
              Glazer family, history is beginning to repeat itself at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>And Knighton, now a semi-retired resident of the Channel Islands, warns that 
              the "astonishingly naive" Red Knights will ultimately suffer the same fate as 
              himself if they continue to stalk the Glazers.</p>
              <p>Knighton said: "Even when you are talking in terms of £1 billion or £2 
              billion, Manchester United is massively under-valued, and the Glazers are no 
              fools. They know that you do not sell an asset like Manchester United unless 
              needs must.</p>
              <p>"United are the Disney of the sporting world because of the sheer power and 
              value of their brand. They are Coca-Cola, Microsoft, IBM. When you have such a 
              prized asset, you simply do not sell it.</p>
              <p>"The takeover of Cadbury by Kraft earlier this year was done at a figure of 
              around £11 billion and, although you would not compare Cadbury and United like 
              for like, the reality is that United's brand name is equally powerful and the 
              Glazers have no reason to sell.</p>
              <p>"The Red Knights appear to be astonishingly naive in this regard. The whole 
              approach smells typically of stirred-up egos over good sense."</p>
              <p>Knighton, who subsequently resigned as a United director in 1992 in order to 
              buy Carlisle United, admits that the Glazers have saddled United with excessive 
              debt, an issue he believes must be addressed. But he has warned the club's 
              supporters to be wary of pinning their hopes on the Red Knights.</p>
              <p>Knighton said: "I 'did debt' at Carlisle and it is sometimes a necessary evil 
              in football, even at the ruinous interest rates that come with it.</p>
              <p>"There is no question that the Glazers have run up too much debt at United. 
              The club is very highly geared and they must deal with that. One route could be 
              to offload a percentage of their stake to a wealthy investor, but at the same 
              time retaining their majority shareholding.</p>
              <p>"But under their ownership, United have enjoyed tremendous success on the 
              pitch. Off it, their commercial revenues have rocketed.</p>
              <p>"They have left Sir Alex Ferguson to get on with the job and the club is run 
              as a very successful business.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, many football fans do not live in the real world. Football is 
              a business and the romantic scenario of supporter-owned clubs is simply not 
              workable.</p>
              <p>"The fact that the United fans are prepared to even consider a group of City 
              bankers running their club, no matter how unpopular the current owners might be, 
              highlights how muddled fans can become."</p>
              <p>Calls for United fans to boycott games and not renew season tickets have been 
              made by figures close to the Red Knights' campaign, but Knighton fears such 
              tactics are doomed. He said: "What kind of subversive talk is that? And from 
              supposedly respected figures, too.</p>
              <p>"If somebody attempting to buy any other business called for a boycott of the 
              product, then their reputation would be shot to pieces.</p>
              <p>"Those tactics might work at clubs in the lower divisions, but they will 
              never succeed at clubs like United that have such a huge, global following. Such 
              ideas only confirm my view that the Red Knights do not have a snowball in Hell's 
              chance of success.</p>
              <p>"If they need to recruit 40-60 backers to raise the funds required to mount a 
              bid, it suggests they are relying on small-scale figures.</p>
              <p>"The reality is that, if and when the Glazers do come to sell – and at a huge 
              profit – they will find a buyer in the Middle East or Far East who can do it all 
              on his own." </p>

              <p>Manchester United chief executive David Gill insists the Old Trafford outfit are benefiting from the Glazer family's business expertise.</p>
              <p>Whilst the highly visible green and gold campaign, which David Beckham offered support to by wearing one of their scarves as he made his way off the pitch on Wednesday night, will again be in evidence as United entertain Fulham on Sunday, Gill believes the Glazers' positive contribution to the club is being ignored.</p>
              <p>United announced a seven-figure sponsorship deal with Telekom Malaysia on Thursday, providing further proof the Red Devils remain an attractive proposition.</p>
              <p>The five-year deal is part of a new commercial strategy implemented by the Glazer family.</p>
              <p>Instead of taking a global approach, United adopt a territorial stance, doing exclusive deals in specific areas to maximise income and make the most of an estimated 333million supporters worldwide.</p>
              <p>It was one of the facts the Glazers took into account when they launched their own takeover.</p>
              <p>"The owners thought we were doing very well on the commercial front but that there were other opportunities out there," Gill said.</p>
              <p>"This is the insight they have brought in.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't get much media coverage but the very fact they have come in and are able to do these deals benefits us.</p>
              <p>"We can reinvest that money back into the team."</p>
              <p>Gill's comments reinforce the view inside Old Trafford that the only reason the vast majority of the £80million received from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo remains unspent is due to Sir Alex Ferguson's reluctance to enter what he feels is an inflated transfer market.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United Supporters Trust argue differently, of course, as they stand solidly behind the Red Knights, whose attempt to wrest control of the club on behalf of the fans is now being assisted by leading global investment bank Nomura.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the Glazer family have continued to insist the club is not for sale, and they have no intention of off-loading despite debts in excess of £700million.</p>
              <p>It was a message reinforced by Gill as he was announcing Telekom Malaysia is to become the 'Integrated Telecommunications Partner' of the Old Trafford outfit.</p>
              <p>"There are protests," said Gill.</p>
              <p>"Everyone has the right to protest and there was certainly a lot of green and gold there on Wednesday, you cannot deny that.</p>
              <p>"But this partnership demonstrates the strength of the club. It is a long-term partnership for five years.</p>
              <p>"We will be around for the length of this five-year deal and many more in addition to that.</p>
              <p>"We have a sound business model and Telekom Malaysia is partnering one of the best teams in world football. That will always be the case."</p>

The club had been considering whether to increase prices to help with the club's enormous interest payments on their debt.</p>
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on The Glazer family" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/the-glazer-family"><span style="color: #005689;">The Glazer family</span></a> have been attacked for the size of price rises since their controversial takeover in 2005 and it was claimed further increases would be implemented despite the ongoing worldwide economic problems.</p>
              <p>However, the club have announced prices will be pegged next term, which will come as a welcome relief to supporters.</p>
              <p>Season tickets have gone up by an average of 48% since the Glazer family took over in 2005 and by as much as 69% in some areas of Old Trafford, much to the anger of sections of the club's support.</p>
              <p>United were the only club in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> not to reduce or freeze season-ticket prices for the current season. Instead, the Premier League champions asked their 55,000 season-ticket holders to pay an extra £1 for each match.</p>
