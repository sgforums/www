              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">David Beckham has warned
              against trying to calm down Wayne Rooney, insisting the forward would
              be a "different animal" without his aggression.</span></strong></p>
              <p>England stalwart Beckham
              famously got himself sent off in the 1998 World Cup and Rooney's
              discipline has been in the spotlight after his dismissal against Fulham
              at the weekend, when he punched a corner flag on his way to the
              dressing room.</p>
              <p>Manchester United star Rooney also received a red card in the
              quarter-finals of England's last appearance at a major tournament, in
              2006 against Portugal, and ahead of the matches against Slovakia and
              Ukraine boss Fabio Capello made a light-hearted reference during
              training to the Craven Cottage dismissal.</p>
              <p>Beckham, however, feels Rooney's temperament is an important part of his game and insists he has no concerns.</p>
              <p>"With Wayne Rooney you don't get the exceptional talent and
              player you have without that side of his game," said the 33-year-old.</p>
              <p>"If you take that side out of his game, he becomes a different
              player, a different animal. You don't want to take that out of him.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes it flows over. He's done it a few times with myself.
              It happens. He knows it's not right, I know it's not right, but it
              happens. You don't want to take that out of him."</p>
              <p>Despite fears that Rooney's temperament could undermine
              England's chances at a tournament, Beckham added: "I've got no concerns
              whatsoever.</p>
              <p>"Taking that away from a player is dangerous and I don't think anyone will try to take that away from Wayne."</p>
              <p>Beckham is willing to offer Rooney advice if the United
              youngster wants it, but he added: "I don't think it is an issue. I
              don't need to speak to him but if he wanted to talk to me I would.</p>
              <p>"Of course it is very hard, there are a lot of people looking up to you.</p>
              <p>"I've reacted on the pitch and it wasn't a great reaction. It
              might be wrong but it is me showing I'm frustrated that we're losing.</p>
              <p>"He's got enough people around him, there isn't a stronger
              manager than Sir Alex Ferguson to look after him and also Fabio
              Capello. He has two managers who can get the best out of him and they
              do that."</p>
              <p>Since his recall to the squad, Beckham has noticed Capello putting a high value on discipline.</p>
              <p>"He has done in the past and said we have the right manner on and off the field," Beckham said.</p>
              <p>Beckham will break the caps record for an England outfield player if he features against Slovakia in Saturday's friendly.</p>
