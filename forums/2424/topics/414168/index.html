              <h2>Gary 'Red Nev' Neville is one of the United greats</h2>
              <p><img src="http://m.gmgrd.co.uk/res/230.%24plit/C_71_article_1349516_image_list_image_list_item_0_image.jpg?28%2F10%2F2010%2009%3A49%3A13%3A531" alt="" width="620" height="370"></p>
              <p><strong>Gary Neville’s style might not be as easy on the eye as some 
              of his fellow Class of ’92  performers. But his steel has been just as 
              important to United’s success as the silk of his more glamorous 
              colleagues.</strong><br> <br>That’s the opinion of ex-Reds full-back Arthur Albiston.<br> <br>Neville’s landmark 600th United appearance – at Stoke last 
              Sunday – was an inauspicious occasion and passed without much 
              celebration.<br> <br>In fact, as he became the fifth member of Old Trafford’s elite
               band of 600-plus appearance- makers, the event was bathed in 
              controversy.<br> <br>In lining up at the Britannia Stadium he joined Ryan Giggs, 
              Sir Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes and Paul Scholes  in that exclusive 
              group of Reds.<br> <br>He bagged a yellow card, escape what most saw as a deserved 
              red and was hauled off at half time by Sir Alex Ferguson after referee 
              Andre Marriner said he’d be dismissed if he committed another foul.<br> <br>That marking of the milestone didn’t do justice to the career 
              of United’s former captain, who made his senior debut against Torpedo 
              Moscow in December 1992.<br> <br>But while his fellow former FA Youth Cup-winning pals like 
              Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and David Beckham might be the headline 
              stealers, Albiston says Neville has been a vital component of the Reds 
              success.<br> <br>“Gary Neville has made the right-back position look simple and
               believe me is not an easy job at,” said Albiston, who tied up Old 
              Trafford’s left-back role for 485 matches in the 70s and 80s.<br> <br>“He has never tried anything he is not capable of and that is why he makes it look so effortless and straight-forward.<br> <br>“United, of course, have always been associated with flair 
              players. The crowd absolutely love them. Reds fans adore their wingers, 
              strikers and creative midfielders.<br> <br>“From Gary’s era you have Giggs, Scholes and Beckham who are 
              all very easy on the eye and watchable. But you cannot have a team 
              without a Gary Neville character in it. He’s been the heartbeat of 
              United. I have always felt a lot more comfortable watching United when 
              Gary is in the side. That’s because you know he is going to be on at his
               fellow defenders and also the referee. Nobody gets an easy ride.<br> <br> <strong>Organisation</strong> <br> <br>“You don’t want a quiet defence and sometimes I think without 
              Gary United are a shade too quiet. His organisational skills are vital.<br> <br>“If you are not naturally vocal then it is difficult, but you 
              have to have a person like Gary with his non-stop chatter on the pitch 
              keeping people alert and focused.<br> <br>“I think he has said it himself in the past that his ability 
              was natural in the same players like Giggs, Scholes and Beckham’s 
              talents were.<br> <br>“He had to show determination and fight to make it at     Manchester United. But those assets are as important as anything else.<br> <br>“Eric Harrison was his youth team boss at United and if you 
              talk to him, he’d tell you that if he ever wanted to hold up any player 
              as an example to up-and- coming hopefuls, then it would be Gary Neville.<br> <br>“His hunger and determination to succeed makes him the number one in that respect.<br> <br>“I think over the last two or three years, ever since he’s 
              picked up injuries following the ankle ligament damage he suffered 
              playing against Bolton in March 2007, people have appreciated him more.<br> <br>“You can sometimes value players like Gary more and what they bring to a side after you watch the team without them in it.<br> <br>“England have not yet replaced him properly and it is not 
              going to be easy for United to replace him long-term when he finally 
              calls it a day.<br> <br>“Players with his drive and enthusiasm and ability to hold 
              down a place at Old Trafford for over 600 games over a period of 18 
              years don’t come along every five minutes.”</p>
