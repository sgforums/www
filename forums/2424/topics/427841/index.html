              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Rio Ferdinand" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rio-ferdinand"><span style="color: #005689;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a> has offered an insight into the reasons for <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a>'s success by speaking of the togetherness he believes would prevent one of Sir Alex Ferguson's current players from emulating James Milner's reaction after being substituted in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a>'s defeat at Liverpool on Monday.</p>
              <p>"You don't see anyone come off the pitch shaking their head, being disgruntled, or sitting on the bench in a sulk at this club," Ferdinand said. "It won't happen here because everyone is delighted to play for this club and they want to be here. The moment you show a bit of dissent like that, the manager pulls rank, and rightly so."</p>
              <p>The defender stopped short of naming Milner but the inference was clear at a time when Ferguson's players seem to be in a considerably stronger frame of mind than Roberto Mancini's going into Saturday's <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on FA Cup" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa-cup"><span style="color: #005689;">FA Cup</span></a> semi-final at Wembley.</p>
              <p>Joe Hart summed up the atmosphere at Eastlands in the wake of their 3-0 defeat at Anfield – "We're all fed up," the City goalkeeper said – and Milner's fit of pique when he was withdrawn did not feel completely incongruous given some of the dressing room problems that Mancini has encountered this season.</p>
              <p>Milner is aggrieved that he has not been used in the attacking central midfield role in which he previously operated for Aston Villa, with Mancini generally preferring Yaya Touré. The England international made little secret of his displeasure, angrily shaking his head and throwing his armband to the floor, and behind the scenes at Old Trafford a comparison has been made with Michael Owen's very different reaction to being on the edges of the United team.</p>
              <p>Owen has legitimate reasons to be frustrated himself, restricted to only one Premier League start in the season that his contract expires and not even on the bench for either leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea. Nonetheless, it was noted that the former England striker made a point of congratulating his team-mates on his Twitter page after the match.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo tested Ferdinand's theory during his years as United's star player, making a public show of his annoyance about being substituted in one match, but Ferdinand believes that was a one-off. "It just comes from a respect for the manager, the club itself and the people who were here before you," the defender said. "It's an unwritten rule at this club. You see it in the changing room before games. There are no cliques. People are wishing each other well before games, even if someone else is playing in your position. That's just the way we are."</p>
              <p>Ferdinand was limping badly throughout long spells of the Chelsea game but has declared himself fit for the weekend. Ferguson, however, may still feel it is a suitable moment to bring in Chris Smalling to face a City side that will almost certainly be deprived of their leading scorer, Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>Edin Dzeko is on standby because of the Argentinian's hamstring injury, but Ferdinand was careful not to say it worked to United's advantage. "You don't spent £27m on a player who is average. Dzeko is a good player, he's played Champions League football for a few years and he's won the league in Germany, so he's a good player. We won't be underestimating him."</p>
              <p>The better news for City is that Micah Richards has returned to full training, having initially been ruled out of the semi-final because of his own hamstring tear. Tevez's absence is also balanced in part by Wayne Rooney's suspension, the striker consigned to the role of spectator because of his expletive-filled outburst into a pitch-side camera during the recent 4-2 win at West Ham United.</p>
              <p>Rooney's anger about that ban now appears to have made way for a form of begrudging acceptance. "I didn't realise what I had done. It was just emotion – a release, if you like, from scoring the three goals that got us in the lead. But, of course, it was wrong of me and I accept my punishment. You just have to move on. Hopefully the boys can pull through for me on Saturday and get to that FA Cup final."</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sir Alex Ferguson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> believes <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a>'s desperation for a first major trophy in 35 years could prove decisive at Wembley if <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> capitalise on their greater experience of the big occasion.</p>
              <p>United enter the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on FA Cup" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa-cup"><span style="color: #005689;">FA Cup</span></a> semi-final without the suspended Wayne Rooney but pursuing a repeat of their Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble of 1999, while City face another contest with Tottenham Hotspur to qualify for the Champions League for the first time. Ferguson was careful to avoid inflaming local hostilities ahead of a crucial derby in the capital, claiming City's wealthy owners "were correct" to invest in "big plans" and highlighting the individual experience in Roberto Mancini's squad.</p>
              <p>However, the United manager does believe the Wembley factor, and City's lack of trophies, could be a factor in the semi-final. "It's possible," Ferguson said. "But I don't know the mental side of their players because I've not worked with any of them apart from Tevez of course. I know my own players and, obviously, they have been used to big-game situations many times. We don't have to conquer that.</p>
              <p>"It can be very difficult to block out the occasion, simply because sometimes the occasion overrides everything else. And Wembley is an occasion stadium. When you go there it's for an important reason and that can affect some players. I don't think there's any doubt about that. It's a fact. All we can do is prepare our players properly, make sure the information you give them is fine, and trust that their own temperament, and their own beliefs, come into it."</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov is expected to return to the United starting line-up in the absence of Rooney and Ferguson said the outstanding form of Javier Hernández has given him no option but to leave the Premier League's leading goalscorer on the bench recently.</p>
              <p>"It's unfortunate for Dimitar because he's a fantastic player, but the reasons are obvious," the United manager said. "The emergence of Hernández in the last couple of months has been startling. He's improving all the time, he's getting stronger and it's very difficult to leave a player out when he hits that kind of form.</p>
              <p>"He's fantastic, with a natural instinct to move about the box. There have been a few top strikers who've had that quality. Ole [Gunnar Solksjaer] was one, always being in space in the box, and having a natural instinct to do that. [Gary] Lineker probably never scored a good goal in his life. It would always come off his chest, his shin or he would get a rebound off the goalkeeper. But he was always in really good areas, and the boy Hernández is the same."</p>
              <p>Ferguson also had another slight dig at Rooney's agent, Paul Stretford, when asked if United's hopes of a treble were a convincing retort to claims the squad was on the wane, aired at the time of the striker's contract dispute last year. He said: "I shouldn't really need to sell that. I don't think he actually really meant that. I think he was prompted on that one. Probably thought he could make me angry."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has challenged his players to start another winning streak after the 1-0 FA Cup semi-final defeat to City. </strong></p>
              <p>The Reds were beaten by Yaya Toure's goal and any hopes of a comeback receded when Paul Scholes was dismissed with 18 minutes remaining. Sir Alex felt his team paid the price for a 'sloppy' start to the second half but appreciates the need to focus on getting three points from a tough trip to Tyneside in a few days' time.</p>
              <p>"It's a major game on Tuesday up at Newcastle," he told <strong><a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/MUTV.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUTV</span></span></a></strong>. "It doesn't matter when you play, you know you've got to recover and get on a winning streak again.</p>
              <p>"The first 15 minutes after half-time cost us the game," admitted the boss. "Slack moments. Edwin [van der Sar] had a bad kick out and Michael Carrick couldn't hold it and it was a goal.</p>
              <p>"From then on, they were defending apart from a couple of counter-attacks. It's disappointing as we should've been ahead in the first half as we were the better team.</p>
              <p>"The chance that Dimitar [Berbatov] missed - there was a great save by the keeper but the second chance, from under the bar, if he'd have scored there, I had a feeling whoever scored first would win the match.</p>
              <p>"We were a wee bit sloppy and it got them on the counter-attack against us. I think the pitch was slow.</p>
              <p>"It's a good pitch but very slow, we like quick pitches and it maybe suited City a bit more than us."</p>
              <p>The Reds' job was made all the more difficult by Scholes' sending-off after a high challenge on Pablo Zabaleta</p>
              <p>"Paul has had unbelievable moments and is a great player, one of the greatest ever at this club, but he has these red mist moments and this was another one," added Sir Alex, who actually thought his team played better after going down to ten men.</p>
              <p>"He's a bit unfortunate maybe as he went for for the ball and it bounced up and he's gone through and caught the boy on the thigh."</p>

              <p><strong>Nemanja Vidic says United must not dwell on the FA Cup semi-final defeat to Manchester City and concentrate instead on winning a record 19th league title.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds' skipper has challenged his United team-mates to bounce back from losing to City at Wembley by picking up three points against Newcastle in the Premier League on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Speaking after Saturday’s semi-final defeat, Vidic told <strong><a href="http://origin-www.manutd.com/en/MUTV.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MUTV</span></span></a></strong>: “We have played many games in the last few weeks and the next one is against Newcastle away, which is always a hard game to play.</p>
              <p>“We must forget the City game now and concentrate on winning the title. It will not be easy but we have to perform, play good football and try to win the league.”</p>
              <p>In the end, Yaya Toure’s goal was the deciding factor in an extremely tense and nervy affair in which both United and City enjoyed spells of dominance. Although Vidic cites the Reds’ second half performance as the root cause for defeat.</p>
              <p>“We had two or three chances in the first half but didn’t score the goal," he added. "All they had were shots from distance but their goal has cost us the final.</p>
              <p>“We didn’t play as we should have in the second half. It was more open, they played a bit higher up the pitch and scored a goal.<br> <br>“We had a few good situations from the right side which I think we should have done something with but we didn’t. We talked a lot about concentration, but today we didn’t concentrate enough.”</p>
