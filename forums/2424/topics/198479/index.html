            <div class='col-md body'>RONALDO - ME AND ROONEY ARE FINE<br><br>Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed there is no ill feeling between him and his Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney after the England striker was sent off in Saturday's World Cup game between the two countries.<br><br>Ronaldo, speaking on the website of the Gestifute agency which represents him, says the pair have been in regular contact since the end of the match and have cleared the air.<br><br>Media reports in England have suggested the two players are at loggerheads following the incident, which saw Rooney push Ronaldo before being sent off in the quarter-final clash in Gelsenkirchen.<br><br>Some reports also suggested that Ronaldo will be hounded out of United for his behaviour.<br><br>"The things that have been said regarding me and my team-mate and friend Rooney are incredible," said Ronaldo in an exclusive interview to www.gestifute.com.<br><br>"Between me and Rooney, there is absolutely no problem.<br><br>"I reiterate, no problem.<br><br>"At the end of the game, we sent each other some text messages and also today. Between the two of us everything has been cleared.<br><br>"He wished me the best of luck in the World Cup. He told me we had a great team and that if we continued to play like this, we would go far.<br><br>"He wasn't angry with me and moreover, he told me to completely ignore what the English press has said, that all they wanted was to create confusion but we are already used to that."<br><br>Ronaldo said he had warm exchanges with his United team-mates before kick-off.<br><br>"Before the game, I spoke in the tunnel to my club team-mates Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Rooney," he said.<br><br>"We had a nice chat and we wished each other good luck."<br><br>Rooney, who had seemingly stamped on Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho before pushing Ronaldo, was shown a straight red card.<br><br>Ronaldo insisted he was not to blame for the dismissal.<br><br>"I am not a referee and I don't have the power to send off a player," said Ronaldo.<br><br>"I had nothing to do with the fact that the referee showed the red card."<br><br>Ronaldo has brushed aside suggestions he will leave Old Trafford this summer, despite reports that he is keen to join Real Madrid.<br><br>"There have been comments published in which I reportedly said that I didn't want to go back to Manchester United," he said.<br><br>"That is completely false, of course I want to go back.<br><br>"It's just typical of the English press but I don't lose any sleep."<br><br>After the game had finished goalless after extra time, Ronaldo scored the winning penalty which sent Portugal through to a semi-final meeting with France.<br><br>"When the decision was going to be taken on who will take the penalties, I asked Scolari if I could take the last one," Ronaldo said.<br><br>"I like to take penalties and to score them.<br><br>"Why did I ask to be last? Because I like to take responsibility and because I had a strong feeling that I was going to be the one to resolve the game."<br><br><a href="http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/07/03/WORLDCUP_Rooney_Ronaldo.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/07/03/WORLDCUP_Rooney_Ronaldo.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer</a><br><br>There are just too many stories about it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rooney Thanks Team-Mates</strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney has thanked his England team-mates for their support after his red card in the World Cup quarter-final.<br><br>Rooney broke his silence to plead his innocence and insist he did not deliberately stamp on Portugal's Ricardo Carvalho.<br><br>He paid tribute to the efforts of the England team, who went out on penalties after playing almost an hour with 10 men.<br><br>Rooney, 20, said: "I thought the England lads were awesome after I went off and the effort they put in was amazing.<br><br>"Truly if there was any justice England would now be preparing for a World Cup semi-final.<br><br>"Sadly, however, that is not to be in 2006.<br><br>"I want again to thank my team-mates for the unbelievable effort they put into the game and for all the support and encouragement they gave me after it."<br><br>England flew home from Germany on Sunday as their victors Portugal moved onto Munich, where they face France in the semi-final tomorrow.<br><br>Rooney said he had been "disappointed" with his Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo - who put pressure on the referee to pull out a red card - but promised not to hold a grudge.<br><br>He said: "I bear no ill feeling to Cristiano but am disappointed that he chose to get involved.<br><br>"I suppose I do though have to remember that on that particular occasion we were not team-mates."<br><br>Rooney has until Thursday to submit his version of events to FIFA.<br><br>Disciplinary bosses will then decide on the length of his ban - although they would be more lenient if they received a written apology from Rooney.<br><br>They may not get one because the striker maintains he has done nothing wrong.<br><br>Rooney said: "I want to say absolutely categorically that I did not intentionally put my foot down on Ricardo Carvalho.<br><br>"He slid in from behind me and unfortunately ended up in a position where my foot was inevitably going to end up as I kept my balance. That's all there was to it.<br><br>"If you ask any player - and indeed almost any fan - they will tell you that I am straight and honest in the way I play.<br><br>"From what I've seen in the World Cup, most players would have gone to ground at the slightest contact but my only thought then was to keep possession for England.<br><br>"When the referee produced the red card I was amazed - gob-smacked."<br><br>Rooney had the ball in midfield and was fighting hard to keep it from several Portuguese players.<br><br>Carvalho had fallen to the floor and the England striker stepped back onto him, sinking a boot into the defender's groin.<br><br>England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson spoke to referee Horacio Elizondo about it after the game and chose not to dispute the decision.<br><br>Rooney said: "Obviously I'm bitterly disappointed to have been sent off in a World Cup finals match for England.<br><br>"I remember the incident clearly and have seen it several times since on TV.<br><br>"I am of the same opinion now as I was at the time - that what happened didn't warrant a red card.<br><br>"If anything, I feel we should have had a free-kick for the fouls committed on me during the same incident."<br><br>Rooney had looked set to miss the World Cup finals when he broke a bone in his foot in April.<br><br>He battled hard to be fit in time to make an appearance as a sub in England's second game of the competition against Trinidad and Tobago but the adventure ended in heartbreak.<br><br>Rooney said: "I will also always be indebted to everyone who, after my injury, helped make it possible for me to begin to fulfil a boyhood dream by representing my country in the finals of a World Cup."<br><br>The United star also offered his thanks to departing boss Eriksson and David Beckham, who resigned as England captain after the World Cup exit.<br><br>Rooney said: "I want to say how sorry I am to see Sven go and to see David step down as captain.<br><br>"I will always be grateful to Sven for his guidance and the faith he showed in me and to David for being a great captain and great friend."<br><br>More news from SportingLife.com</div>
