              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/11/02/330/Wayne-Rooney-celebrates-Manchester-United_2567856.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p>Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney admits this season is his worst ever.</p>
              <p>Rooney helped United go four points clear at the top of the Premier League table on Saturday as they romped to a 4-0 success at Wigan.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old scored at the DW Stadium, but it was only his seventh goal of the season, which he admits has been a struggle.</p>
              <p>The England forward, who was also accused of elbowing Wigan's James McCarthy during the game on Saturday, came into this season following a desperately disappointing World Cup campaign.</p>
              <p>Then in October he handed in a transfer request at Old Trafford before retracting that and signing a new long-term deal.</p>
              <p>And he admits he has never had such a tough time since making his breakthrough as a 16-year-old with Everton.</p>
              <p>"I have to say it's been a difficult season for me - probably the worst I've ever had," he told the <em>News of the World</em>.</p>
              <p>"That week when I asked for a transfer was something I wouldn't want to go through ever again, but I feel I made the right decision to stay because this club is always going to be challenging for trophies.</p>
              <p>"I picked up a few niggles as well and missed a few games, so I didn't really feel like I was playing a part.</p>
              <p>"The good thing is that I feel fresh at a time when most players are picking up injuries or feeling jaded.</p>
              <p>"I really want to kick on from here and have a big impact on the most important matches of the season."</p>
              <p>Rooney in the last few weeks has showed glimpses of getting back to his best, including a brilliant over-head kick which won the Manchester derby against City earlier in the month.</p>
              <p>"The goal against City gave me a big lift because it was in such an important game. I've seen it again quite a few times and I'll never get sick of it," he added.</p>
              <p>"We're happy with the position we have put ourselves in - and we know it could have been even better</p>
              <p>"This is usually the time of year when we really go for it. We want the title back. It was hard losing it to Chelsea as we did."</p>
              <p>Rooney travel with United to Stamford Bridge on Tuesday - a match being shown live on <em>Sky Sports</em> - as they face Chelsea in a crucial Premier League clash, and he admits the West London ground is not his favourite hunting ground.</p>
              <p>"We've got a really terrible record at Stamford Bridge - in fact, I don't think I have ever won there in my entire career," he said.</p>
              <p>"I've got some pretty bad memories about the place, like the time when I fell down and broke my metatarsal just before the 2006 World Cup.</p>
              <p>"But you get these things in football and there's no way to explain them.</p>
              <p>"It won't play on our minds. If anything, it will make us even more determined to go there and win.</p>
              <p>"It's a really massive game and Chelsea need to win it more than we do. Hopefully the pressure will tell on them.</p>
              <p>"I am a bit surprised to see them so far behind us in the league but I would never write them off completely.</p>
              <p>"They have shown down the years they are a team capable of going on a long run of winning games.</p>
              <p>"We can make it really hard for them by beating them but they will be thinking the same thing about us because it will have a big say on where the title goes."</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The win at Wigan put United four-points clear and Rooney admits they are in good shape.</p>
              <p>He said: "It has been a season where we have had to stick together as a team and grind out results, even when we haven't been playing well.</p>
              <p>"To be honest, sometimes you get just as much satisfaction winning that way as you do when you play entertaining football.</p>
              <p>"I think it shows how strong we are as a team. It all stems from the manager but the pressure is always there to win trophies.</p>
              <p>"We don't care how we do it as long as it's us lifting them at the end of the season."</p>
