While Mascherano escaped to Liverpool in January 2007, Tevez stayed and almost single-handedly steered the London club to safety.<br><br>The East End outfit were fined â‚¤5.5million by the Premier League for not disclosing certain details of Tevez’s contract, such as the fact the player could be transferred without the club’s permission – as eventually happened. <br><br>After a drawn-out negotiation process, and extensive legal screening on United’s part, the 24-year-old moved to Old Trafford on a two-year loan last summer. He has impressed immensely, scoring 19 goals during his first season and forming an excellent understanding with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>While the deal runs out next summer, the Red Devils had the option of tying him up in the winter – just as Liverpool did with Mascherano. However, despite Tevez’s public pleas for a permanent deal, United opted to wait.<br><br>But now, after talks only recently reopened between the North West giants and MSI, a figure has been agreed that will make the <em>Albicelestes</em> star the most expensive player in the history of English football, edging out Andriy Shevchenko’s â‚¤30.6million move to Chelsea.<br><br>It is unknown whether United must pay the fee this summer or whether they may wait until the loan expires next year.<br><br><br><br>our first signing this summer? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"></p></div>

              <p>The £32m fee will not be paid up front by United. In reality, a sum of about £15m will be paid, with the rest following on in relation to Tevez's appearances and achievements.</p>

              expects the Argentina forward to sign a permanent deal with Manchester
              United, but says reports of an impending agreement are premature.</strong></p>
              <p>Tevez is currently with the Red Devils on a two-year loan deal which is due to expire next summer.</p>
              <p>Reports
              in Saturday's press claimed United are nearing a £32million deal with
              the striker's owners to secure his long-term services.</p>
              <p>However,
              the 24-year-old's representative, Kia Joorabchian, has explained that
              while both parties are keen to strike a deal rumours of a nearing
              agreement are a little hasty.</p>
              <h4>Best club</h4>
              <p>"Carlos has another year's contract left at Manchester United," Joorabchian told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"He
              has an option which United could exercise to make him a permanent
              player. United are very interested in making him a permanent player.</p>
              <p>"They are waiting for the current transfer window to finish before making that decision.</p>
              <p>"I believe at the moment the news is that Tevez is extremely happy there, it is one of the best clubs he has played for.</p>
              <p>"So he is definitely keen to stay. At some point we will get there, but not today."</p>
              <h5>Misquoted</h5>
              <p>Joorabchian
              also explained that Tevez was misquoted in the press after it was
              claimed he said that United should allow Cristiano Ronaldo to join Real
              Madrid if he so desires.</p>
              <p>"He was misquoted. He doesn't like to speak about the futures of other players," Joorabchian added.</p>
