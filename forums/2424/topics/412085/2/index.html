              <p>He should sell the 3 headless ones. But anyway, i dont think Anderson is that bad. Fletcher is much worse. At least Anderson can shield the ball effectively, can train to become the next defensive midfielder.</p>
              <p>Owen was poor, in fact, very poor. He cannot hold the line on his own and maybe Fergie can consider Houllier offer to buy.</p>
              <p>Macheda is too raw, inexperienced at top level and Lazio seemed to have him on loan in January with an option for permanent deal. Looks like a goodbye to him.</p>
              <p>Chicharito and Berba should have started right from the beginning and United looks unbalanced at the wings. Anderson at Left Midfield?! Fergie needs a hairdryer from the upper level too. Obertan! I wanna see him play! Is he injured or what?</p>
              <p>Bebe looks like a nonsense buy. Dunno what position he plays but definitely not striker since he loves the wing.</p>
              <p>Nani is too selfish at times. I think he's still trying to emulate Ronaldo. He cant. He doesn't have the built to do so and he is short. He should concentrate on wing play instead of complaning at every single tackles, loose balls and wayward passes.</p>
              <p>4 away matches, 4 draws. The players lacked motivation and i am losing mine too. I rushed home to watch a bunch of restless souls on the pitch. I should stay away from United's away matches.</p>

              <p>Another draw.doesn't come as a surprise for a manutd team in the yr 2010..haiz.Its always tough coming back from a europe away.Just take note that this is the team's 3rd consective away game,Bolton 2-2,Valencia 0-1,Now 0-0 again.I believe there must be glory hunters out there calling for fergie's head.But the man does make some bizzare decisions at times.For me,its defintely O'shea.You don't need to be a hard-core united fan to spot that he's the team weakest link for so damn long.Slow,doesn;t use his build to gd use,always give away balls cheaply...seriously,So evra was dropped,this guy hasn't seem to recover from the French turmoil or fasico in the WC so he needs a break,Evra played in almost every game for united last season and this season has seen a couple of high profile errors from him so i can understand Fergie's decision to so called either drop/rest him.But WES BROWN should play!..he's the best RB we have in the team but he's down in the packing order for some reason.He's fit somemore.If not,Rafael/Fabio could slot in at DL position.</p>
              <p>Scholes's age catching him up,we can't really depend on him to deliver every match seriously,he has contributed a great lot for the 1st 4games.Fletcher,the way i see is,he's also tired,he's been featuring in every game thus far.Anderson has to really work on his passing,the energy he brings into the midfield is good,but whenever he wants to pick up a SC or what,the final touch fails him.It has always been his problem at manutd for as long as i watch him play.This could be his last season to prove that he's worthy in this team after so long.</p>
              <p>Hernandez should partner Bebatov from the start.Macheda's inclusion was quite a gamble for a tough away opposition like sunderland.He's still young,remains to be seen if he's still gd enough for the red jersey despite his heroics against Villa 2 seasons ago.</p>
              <p>The midfield has to be the weakest thru out the team.Fletcher n anderson are not seen as the real midfield dictator with creativity in their overall play,and i can't see any other better options we have in the team,all these lies to the fact that fergie didn't buy well during the transfer window.Notable misses were Ozil which cost Real 10+ million only? van der vaart?! free transfer?!seriously..look at what he has done at spurs.Sneidjer?!..when he was unwanted by Real madrid..we should have signed him !knowing that Ronaldo was on the fringes of leaving for Madrid..So many misses for a replacement for our dear Paul Scholes-the only real creative midfielder we have now.Only nani can be said as the other spark we have in the midfield,but his crosses and decision making still found wanting at times,but this guy has made a great leap this season.</p>

              <p>agree with you on some good pts u mentioned.</p>
              <p> it is no longer a plug &amp; play and expect 3pts anymore. MU used to be able to over-run teams whenever they mix N match and give some a rest, but teams are now better prepared/motivated to play, and it is never easy.Plus sunderland is not an easy team, given how they performed over the season.</p>
              <p>also, O'Shea, Anderson recovered from long injuries and they are certainly still lacking, but hopefully, improving.</p>
              <p>this season, Berba has stepped up to the plate, but we still need Rooney to upz his game too. Rio is back and hopefully, he can shore up the defence, which should give more stability for the team to move forward.</p>
              <p>Moving ahead, I do hope Rooney can sort out his form/head and do his stuffs. With him firing, he will pull the rest along and hopefully, with the seemingly easier games coming up,  MU can pull the distance between them and the rich kids ahead of them in the table.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON was content with a point after seeing Manchester United survive 
              a first-half battering at Sunderland.</h2>
              <p>United battled their way to a 0-0 draw at the Stadium of Light with Edwin van 
              der Sar making a vital save to deny Steed Malbranque.</p>
              <p>Bolo Zenden also struck a post as Steve Bruce's men went for the kill before 
              the break.</p>

              </span>
              <p>The United boss said: "Sunderland had the most chances in the game and I have 
              to say we were fantastic defensively.</p>
              <p>"That's the area in which we have been leaking goals and throwing games away 
              this season, so I am pleased with that.</p>
              <p>"It was a very determined Sunderland team. Their home record this season has 
              been very, very good, so I am not pleased but I am satisfied."</p>
              <p>Sunderland largely controlled the first half and would have been ahead with 16 
              minutes gone had Van der Sar not pulled off a fine save to deny Malbranque.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who had left Wayne Rooney at home, replaced Michael Owen with 
              Dimitar Berbatov at half-time.</p>
              <p>And the change quickly helped United look more threatening.</p>
              <p>Fergie added: "We had no attacking purpose in the first 25 minutes of the 
              match.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't until towards the end of the first half that we got any semblance 
              of keeping possession of the ball.</p>
              <p>"In the second half we did a lot better, there was more threat by us, but they 
              had chances from set-pieces."</p>
