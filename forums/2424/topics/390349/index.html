              <h3>THE GLAZER family will attempt to boost flagging morale at Manchester United by treating their entire workforce to a day out at the Carling Cup final.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United set aside 800 tickets for their disaffected staff after the dramatic semi-final win over bitter crosstown rivals City last month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The club's 594 full-time employees will be told this week that they are all being treated to a free day out at Wembley for the final against Aston Villa on Sunday February 28.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of the staff are so fed-up with United's dire financial situation that they are looking around for new jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The club recently made a round of redundancies at Old Trafford and staff fear more lay-offs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cost-cutting measures brought in at United's Carrington training HQ have now been implemented at the stadium.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Staff at the stadium have always been entitled to free fruit, crisps and chocolate, but those perks have now been taken away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead they have to purchase snacks from vending machines strategically placed in staff rooms as the club try to cut back on spiraling costs.</p>
              <p>Although tea and coffee remains free, one department head recently put a sign up in the kitchen warning that if the "area is not kept clean and tidy, tea and coffee will have to be paid for".</p>
              <p>Chief executive David Gill addressed staff at the quarterly meeting last week in an attempt to quell any unrest.</p>

              <p>Michael Carrick admits he was 'shocked' to be sent off at the end of Manchester United's 3-2 win over AC Milan.</p>
              <p>The midfielder was shown a second yellow card in stoppage-time after flicking the ball away following Patrice Evra's foul on Alexandre Pato.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson had few complaints with the decision and stated that Portuguese referee Olegario Benquerenca had little option but to dismiss Carrick.</p>
              <p>However, following a first red card of his professional career, Carrick feels he was harshly treated by the decision, which rules the England international out of the second leg of the UEFA Champions League last-16 tie in three weeks' time.</p>
              <p>"It was very soft to be honest," Carrick told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"It rolled at me and I flicked it into Pat's path as he's ran past me.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't as if there was a player from their team trying to get it and it didn't slow the game down in any way.</p>
              <p>"I was just shocked really, to be honest."</p>
              <p>Asked if he spoke to the referee about the incident, Carrick replied: "What can you say really?</p>
              <p>"He said it was for kicking the ball away, but I don't believe I kicked the ball away to be honest.</p>
              <p>"I didn't slow the game down in any way, I was just surprised more than anything."</p>
