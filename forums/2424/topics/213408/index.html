            <div class='col-md body'>Glenn Roeder is adamant he has received no complaints from Sir Alex Ferguson about Giuseppe RossiÂ’s lack of starts at Newcastle this season, and says the teenage striker will get plenty of chances in the first team.<br><br>Sir Alex, who initially planned to keep Rossi at Old Trafford this season, allowed the Italian Under-21 international to go on loan until 1 January after the striker said that he wanted first team football to aid his progression towards being a regular in the United side.<br><br>Rossi was in the stands for the game at Old Trafford as he could not play due to Premier League rules. He has made three substitute appearances for the Magpies and Roeder says there will be more opportunities.<br><br>"Giuseppe Rossi has made a big impression at the club,Â” he said in an interview you can watch in MUTV Online's Latest News. "He's been here for a month and he's been on a few times. He couldn't play in the European games, which I accept, and he couldn't be involved against United. That leaves four games he could have been involved in and he has played in three.<br><br>"I'm sure that between now and when he returns to Manchester United on January 1 he will have had plenty of starts."<br><br>Roeder also rejected the notion that Rossi and Obafemi Martins are incompatible as a partnership because of the lack of aerial prowess.<br><br>"I think we could pair the two of them together,Â” he added. Â“At home, where we are expected to make more of the running, it could work.<br><br>Â“Giuseppe is so good at dropping off to get hold of the ball and he knows what's going on around him, and Oba Martins could use his speed to make some clever runs where Guiseppe would be able to slide him in. Physically, they wouldn't be a big partnership but there is definitely the potential for the two of them to play together."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=368048" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=368048</a><br></div>
