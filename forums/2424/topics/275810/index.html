            <div class='col-md body'>From <a href="http://www.manchesterunited.vitalfootball.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.manchesterunited.vitalfootball.co.uk/</a> :<br><br><img src="http://www.manchesterunited.vitalfootball.co.uk/resource/teams/manutd/105_b.jpg"><br><br>Amid reports of possible bids for strikers, I wonder if the only one we need is already on our books.<br><br>Wayne Rooney out, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer out, Carlos Tevez needs time to settle so the goals have dried up. United, therefore, have been linked to a number of players, most recently Dimitar Berbatov of Spurs, Obafemi Martins of Newcastle and Adriano of Inter.<br><br>You may notice that I have omitted one of our strikers from the list above and I've done that with a purpose. For I think that if the rumours of Saha's imminent return are true then we need to purchase no one at all.<br><br>First and foremost, Fergie insisted there would be no panic buys as reaction to Rooney's injury. The aforementioned players hardly fall into that category but what would we do when having all our attackers fit? Imagine having Tevez, Rooney, Saha, Solskjaer and Berbatov available at the same time - it would be unhealthy.<br><br>Louis Saha has all we need in him: quick, has very good technique, essentially two-footed, can lead the line and hold up the ball and scores goals. He's been training for the past 10 days now and reports say Fergie will use him against Spurs on Sunday.<br><br>Even with his injury record, that piece of news tell me we no need to buy strikers. We scored only one goal so far, courtesy of a midfielder, Paul Scholes but with Saha and Tevez up front - that would be a different story. If Louis could stay fit for a bit more than a month (and that's not a big thing to ask, even from him) then we'll have Rooney back.<br><br>I for one will be glad to see Saha among the starters if reports prove to be true. Our attack will be much less predictable and that's very important in the absence of Rooney and Ronaldo, our main attacking powers. A comeback of the 2005/06 style would be most welcome from King Louis.<br><br>If only we still had Rossi...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saha doesn't quite cut it for me. He is way too fragile. Berbatov is slightly siimilar in terms of injuries, but he does play through the pain barrier, so it is slightly better in that respect.<br><br>Solsjkaer is not a viable option for me. He's constantly injured and he's already too old to be effective against most teams in the fast pace of the prem. Typically, older strikers will drop deeper to collect the ball and play it on, something that Tevez and Rooney do better than Ole.<br><br>At the end of the day, while I won't say that signing Tevez was a mistake, I believe that priority should have gone to first signing a tall frontman then signing Tevez.</div>
