            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United ace Louis Saha has revealed Sir Alex Ferguson saved him from quitting the game. The Frenchman, who is United's top scorer this season, claims he considered quitting because of his injury problems.<br><br>Saha has enjoyed his best season to date with United and he has helped them go six points clear at the top of the Premiership. The former Fulham man has endured a frustrating time with injuries over the last few years and Saha insists he was close to calling it quits.<br><br>"The injuries I have had recently have been the hardest times of my life," Saha told the News of the World. "Somewhere in my mind, while it was happening, I thought that it was all over, that Sir Alex Ferguson has had enough of my problems.<br><br>"It just wouldn't stop, as soon as I was ready to play again I would get injured. I couldn't take it anymore. "At the beginning of last season I was at my lowest - it was hell. "I thought about throwing in the towel as I couldn't handle it any more. What disappointed me was the fact I couldn't pay back the faith the club and the manager had placed in me after they stood by me through previous injuries."<br><br>Saha has special gratitude for the patience Ferguson has shown with him through all the injury problems. "I'll always remember what Sir Alex has done for me. I went to see him when I was at the end of my patience," continued Saha.<br><br>"I must have been injured for the 15th time and had the impression he had already been too nice to me. "I didn't want to abuse the situation so I said to him, 'I can't take it any more, relegate me to the reserve team'. He replied, 'Louis, you'll be back. We're counting on you'. "That's a phrase I'll never forget. He never gave up on me. Not once."<br><br>Meanwhile, Ferguson has admitted the surprise signing of Henrik Larsson will allow him to give a rest to Saha and Wayne Rooney in the second half of the season.<br><br>United announced a three-month loan deal for Larsson on Friday and the former Celtic hero will add options to Ferguson's attack.<br><br>Ferguson is keen to give Saha and Rooney a break at some point and he believes Larsson is the perfect replacement for either player.<br><br>"The major attraction for me is that he gives me a trusted option while I give Wayne and Louis a break," said Ferguson. "That's one of the reasons we've signed him. "Wayne and Louis want to play every week, but you can't allow that to happen."<br><br><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Premiership/ManUtd/saha_look.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i doubt beckham will ever get a chance to be back, hes gone, so be it. without doubt, SAF is the most loyal among the loyal, this club would not have being where it was if not for him, i think the club and fans all owe him too much, and we have still yet to find a suitable replacement if he ever decides to retire.. *gulp* .. no i wouldn't dare to dream that carlos would replace him...because i hope not.. Guus Hiddink would seem like an ideal candidate though..hes already comitted to russian football team.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>anyway, its good taht saha is paying back the faith by pumping in the goals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
