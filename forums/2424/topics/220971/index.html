However, the Hoops boss is in no mood to accept the result is a foregone conclusion.<br><br>He said: "I won't be put out if anybody says United have got better players than Celtic. "I accept that and I'm the Celtic manager. All of the managers in the Premiership would probably have to accept that fact.<br><br>"What I won't accept is that we can't beat them at Celtic Park on Tuesday. "There has to be a feeling that we can win the game. "You might scare yourself if you looked at too many videos of United in action.<br><br>"There has to be respect for what they've got at their disposal. But we have got to stand up to them." Celtic defender Gary Caldwell will not dwell on his recent Lisbon nightmare as he contemplates facing up to the Old Trafford side on Tuesday night.<br><br>The Scotland defender was at fault for two goals in the Hoops' 3-0 defeat by Benfica at the Stadium of Light which has left the qualification hopes of the Parkhead men in doubt.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>Celtic v Man Utd </strong><br><br>John Hartson believes his former Celtic team-mates are entering the last chance saloon as they prepare to take on Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday night.<br><br>Home wins against FC Copenhagen and Benfica appeared to pave the way for what would be an notable success for Gordon Strachan's side in Group F, but a resounding defeat at the hands of Benfica in the last batch of fixtures leaves them looking for points from their final games against United and the Danes.<br><br>'If they are going to get through, I fancy them to cause and upset and get something out of the Manchester United game,' he begins. 'It didn't surprise me to see them lose against Benfica and I wouldn't be shocked to see them beaten in the last game against FC Copenhagen as well because our away form has been dreadful for many years now.<br><br>'So, to my mind, it all comes down to this United game and I wouldn't rule out the prospect of Celtic getting the result they need. European nights are very, very special at Parkhead and United won't enjoy going there, even if they have players who are used to massive ties like that.<br><br>'It will be an amazing occasion. Alex Ferguson going to Celtic with all his Rangers connections, a full-house and a United side that will respond to the challenge.<br><br>'As far as I remember, only a top-class Barcelona outfit beat us at Parkhead and there was no shame in that, so United are in for a tough evening. I still fancy my old team to go through and I wouldn't be surprised if they get the result they need in this final home game.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson admits he will have one eye on Manchester United's summit meeting with Chelsea when he picks his side to face Celtic in the UEFA Champions League.<br><br>United face an important week in their embryonic season, and Ferguson, though mindful of the threat to his team at Parkhead on Tuesday, admits he could gamble with his team selection.<br><br>The Scot concedes his chopping and changing of the team backfired in defeat to FC Copenhagen earlier in United's European campaign.<br><br>But that will not prevent Ferguson from shuffling his pack once more as he prepares his squad for the top of the table clash with Chelsea the following Sunday.<br><br>"I have obviously got to think about the Chelsea game when I pick my team to face Celtic and there will be one or two changes to the side," said Ferguson.<br><br>"Players like Gabriel Heinze will come into contention, but we want to come back from Glasgow with qualification guaranteed.<br><br>"We took a bit of a risk in Copenhagen and it went wrong for us.<br><br>"We want to get a result to make sure we qualify, but the Chelsea game will have a bearing on the team I pick.<br><br>"I think it is good that we have a hugely important game at Celtic ahead of playing Chelsea. It will be good preparation for the Chelsea game because there will be a real intensity about the occasion in Glasgow.<br><br>"Celtic have fantastic support and we have got to cope with that because it gives them a definite lift.<br><br>"But we've got players who have seen these types of occasions and I am sure they will cope with it this time as well."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Celtic wary of Scholes</strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo are often highlighted by opposition managers as United's main threat, but Celtic boss Gordon Strachan fears no player more than Paul Scholes.<br><br>The 32-year-old Reds midfielder has been in outstanding form this term after overcoming a serious eye problem that cast doubt on his career last season.<br><br>Fully fit and in fine form, he travels with the Reds to Parkhead where he scored two goals in a pre-season friendly on 26 July. Strachan is well aware of his ability to dismantle any defence in the Champions League.<br><br>"He can score goals, hit crossfield passes, play one-twos, beat people and win headers in the opponents' box," the Celtic boss explained.<br><br>The Celtic boss, who has said his side are still capable of causing an upset in Glasgow, believes Scholes has been one of the best all-round performers in the Champions League for more than a decade.<br><br>"If you take that whole package I don't think I've seen anybody as consistent - and he's been doing that for 10 or 11 years."<br><br>United need just a point to qualify for the knockout stages, but a victory would see the Reds guarantee top spot in Group F.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Celtic_FC.png"><br><br>Celtic FC manager Gordon Strachan is looking forward to the most exciting game of his managerial career as he prepares to go head to head with former club Manchester United FC and manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the penultimate fixture in UEFA Champions League Group F.<br><br><strong>Five-goal thriller</strong><br>Strachan would happily settle for a repeat of the thrilling Matchday 1 encounter at Old Trafford as long as the Scottish champions record a victory that betters the 3-2 defeat inflicted on them by United. That would take Celtic into the last 16 provided FC KÃ¸benhavn do not beat SL Benfica in Tuesday's other game. "It was a cracking game of football and hopefully we will get the same again, but obviously with a different result," said Strachan.<br><br><strong>Miller time</strong><br>On a more positive note, Kenny Miller has shaken off the ankle knock that kept him out at the weekend and looks set to renew his strike partnership with Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. While his manager insists Celtic can still qualify even if they lose to United, Miller sounds a different tone, claiming an impressive home record of one defeat in eleven UEFA Champions League matches can inspire them to victory.<br><br><strong>'Not immortal'</strong><br>"We need to get something from the game, there's no doubt about that," said the 26-year-old Scottish international, who has three goals in the competition so far. "They're not immortal and we know we've got enough in the squad to win the game. A point would be a great result but obviously we'll be going for all three."<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/150px-Manchester_United_FC.png"><br><br><strong>Summit meeting</strong><br>United have a full squad to choose from following Saturday's 2-1 win at Sheffield United FC, although Sir Alex conceded he will make two changes with an eye on Sunday, when the Premiership leaders face the team directly below them, champions Chelsea FC. United need a point to ensure progress while three would clinch first place and, having slipped up in Copenhagen on Matchday 4, their boss is in no mood to hand out favours to one of his former pupils.<br><br><strong>'Fantastic atmosphere'</strong><br>"You want former players to do well but you can't afford to do that because you have to win the game for your own club," said the United manager, who spent two years of his playing career on the other side of Glasgow with Rangers FC. "We want to be top of our group but we know we're in for a tough game. The atmosphere will be fantastic and I'm really looking forward to it."<br><br></div>

He was one of the best attacking midfield players in the world two or three years ago and he is still one of the best in the game.<br><br>"He can pass, score goals and he can even play in that deeper role.<br><br>"He's just a quality player and is one of the many players we have to keep a close eye on.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad lose for Man Utd. Nice win for Celtic.<br><br>Nakumura scored a free kick, thats somehow nice. Saha missed a chance to equalise, he stopped for a while  as he thought he was off-side. Few mins later he missed the penalty. Man Utd need to win Benfica to confirm a place in the next round.<br><br>Full Time:<br>Celtic 1 : 0 Man Utd<br>"81 - Nakumura.<br><br>Next Man Utd match : EPL, Chelsea.</div>
