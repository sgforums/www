              <p>United got 1 away goal, which is crucial.</p>
              <p>Surprised that United played its  full team, thought fergie will play the likes of Gibson, De Laet, Wellbeck, Obertan for experiences.</p>
              <p>United need to score and win the match and not concede any goals in order to go thru.</p>

              <p>I think United got lucky and cocky - City deserved to win with Tevez, whom i feel Fergie has made a wrong bet in settling for Berba and letting Tevez go.</p>
              <p>Wenger once said "Never change a winning team" and ovbiously Fergie didnt agree. After winning the league and Champions League 2 years back, Fergie signed Berba to so-call bolster the front line and left Tevez out. I believe if the money spent on Berba is used to secure Tevez on the permanent, United wouldn't be playing so out of form at the moment.</p>
              <p>Just my opinionj though, but lucky for the away goal, there's still a chance at Old Trafford.</p>

              <p>A bit of misfortunne for him.. He commited the first tugging outside 18 yard, but referee gave advantage.. Then he attempt to tug Belly again inside box hence giving away penalty..</p>
              <p>Think he needs to mature his play like Evra did.. Can assist in attack &amp; come back for defence.. Everytime he went up to assist attack, our RB got one big lobang for CB to cover.. Then when opponent has quick play like Belly, Tevez &amp; SWP like to exploits this type of gap..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>They were all there at the end, the great and the good of </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>. Rooney, Giggs, Scholes, Fletcher, Carrick, Van der Sar, Evra. No line-up of kids, this.</strong></p>
              <p>Not for the first time this season, they came up short. Not for the first time this season there is no room for excuses.</p>
              <p>In a competition he has little regard for, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson threw everything he had at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a> last night. Local pride, it seems, can cause previously declared intentions to end up in the waste bin.</p>
              <p>What a super evening this was. For City and for Manchester football as a whole. The rivalry — so one-sided since the likes of Summerbee, Bell and Lee last called it on in the late 1960s — is worthy of the name once more.</p>
              <p>As much as it will irritate City fans to read it, United were the better side for much of last night’s game. The football they played was more controlled. They created more chances. In some ways, they may still be favourites to progress to the final. But none of that really matters.</p>
              <p>After the bad feeling caused by Carlos Tevez’s summer move across town and the dramatic nature of United’s victory in the league back in September, City are well and truly under Ferguson’s skin now. The Scot’s features were dark as he strode off down the tunnel at full time.</p>
              <p>He has lost at Eastlands too many times for his liking already. But when he reflects on this game more rationally than he would have been able to last night, it will be the manner of the defeat that will irritate him most.</p>
              <p>In his calmer moments, Ferguson is adept at taking the emotion out of football. And when he does he will ask himself how his players have lost a game they were — for a time —fully in control of.</p>
              <p>A goal to the good and with Eastlands relatively becalmed, United conceded a needless, if slightly debatable, penalty and then shipped a quite a dreadful second goal with 20 minutes left.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar’s punch was not convincing and then Anderson got stuck under the ball as it was headed rather innocuously back into the penalty area. Ultimately, Tevez was unmarked as he headed home from a yard.</p>
              <p>It is not a one-off, either. United have conceded goals like this all season and that is the great danger that stalks them again ahead of next week’s return game. They are more than capable of scoring freely against this under-strength City team. They could have scored two or three last night.</p>
              <p>But at the other end of the field they are vulnerable, whoever plays. United pretended that they didn’t care much about this competition. Now we know they do. What is yet to be proven is if they are good enough to stay in it.</p>

              <p>ya you are right man. carling cup have no away goals rule. united need to win by 2 clear goals for 90 mins, then they qualify for finals. if 1-0 only by the 90 mins mark, then extra time and pk beckons if tie is still draw.</p>

              <p>Why United Play 4-5-1 ?????</p>
              <p>i) Rooney isn't a targetman - he doesn't have the height nor is he clinical. He needs support upfront to give him more chances or to help him win more 50-50 balls.</p>
              <p>ii) Is Fergie saying that our midfield is so weak that it is unable to take on City's attack??? Please play carrick/scholes and flecther in the 2nd leg.</p>
              <p>iii) To play 4-5-1, you need 2 pacy wingers to stretch the width and a midfielder to run into the box to provide support but United only has one pacy winger and lacks the other 2 components so how?</p>

              <p>Think he needs to mature his play like Evra did.. Can assist in
              attack &amp; come back for defence.. Everytime he went up to assist
              attack, our RB got one big lobang for CB to cover.. Then when
              opponent has quick play like Belly, Tevez &amp; SWP like to
              exploits this type of gap..</p>
              <p>Tevez penalty is a beauty..</p>

              <p>well, didn't Leeds successfully exploit this "hole"? they know their striker can outpace Brown, so whenever they see GaryN up, they pump the ball..</p>
              <p>similarly, Evra has always left "holes" at the back, but luckily, he seems to recover or carrick seems to arrive in time. Against Burnley, it was quite evident.</p>
              <p>we do need Rio/Vidic fit and ready.. sigh..</p>
