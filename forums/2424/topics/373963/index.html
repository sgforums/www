              <p>ARSENAL manager Arsene Wenger has accused Manchester United of adopting
              "anti-football" tactics after a fiery meeting between the Barclays
              Premier League title hopefuls.<br> <br>United were 2-1 winners over the Gunners on Saturday, coming from behind after Andrei Arshavin had given the visitors the lead.<br> <br>Arsenal
              were arguably the better team but were responsible for their own
              downfall when Manuel Almunia tripped Wayne Rooney to concede a penalty
              before Abou Diaby inexplicably headed into his own net.<br> <br>Wenger was then sent to the stands for kicking a water bottle after Robin van Persie's late strike was disallowed for offside.<br> <br>That
              capped a week of perceived injustice for Wenger after Eduardo was
              charged by UEFA over his alleged dive to win a penalty in the Champions
              League win over Celtic.<br> <br>The Frenchman, though, compared Eduardo's behaviour favourably with the tough-tackling of United at Old Trafford.<br> <br>"I
              have seen a player who plays on the pitch only to make fouls," he said.
              "For me, this is a point that is more urgent than diving.<br> <br>"The
              players who are never punished, who get out of the game without a
              yellow card. I think it is more anti-football than a player who did
              what Eduardo did.<br> <br>"Look at how many deliberate fouls some
              players get away with. That's a bigger problem because it cuts the flow
              of the game. And people pay to see football, not free-kicks."<br> <br>Wenger,
              meanwhile, is set to receive an apology today from the Premier Game
              Match Officials Board for his sending-off, which League Managers'
              Association chief executive Richard Bevan described as "completely out
              of context".</p>

              <p>Complain people pay to see football, not free kick. If Eduardo don't get away with a yellow card, a free kick will be awarded what. Smlj?</p>
              <p>To be anti-something, you would have to oppose it and probably break it's rules. Diving is against the rules isn't it? And an obvious one at that.</p>

              <p>Let's face it, Wenger don't have a player to break up play at this moment... And the way Arsenal lost, I feel Wenger is only trying to deflect attention on how his team collapsed despite taking the lead... The way they fell apart has to be look into more seriously... Despite their great start to the season, and taking the lead in the first half at OT, his players seems to fall apart when put under some pressure... They still don't have an able defensive midfielder to keep it together, and the fitness of some of their players especially Arshavin who was so obvious he was empty and couldn't run anymore has to be worrying...</p>
              <p>Wenger is well known to deflect attention away from his own team but if I was an Arsenal fan, I would be a little worried with the lack of depth in the squad. Cos despite they played well in the first half, Arshavin was the only one that was threatening... And taking the lead was probably not a good thing for them either as they became more nervous trying to protect it...</p>

              <p>well, as per heard on football focus, it is wenger's mistake.</p>
              <p>He has been in EPL for 13 years, and during that time, Gunners also have their fair share of red cards notably by Vieira. They did have their "enforcers" too in Flamini and Vieira. So to claim MU is anti-football is a joke.</p>
              <p>Plus the fact, he is an idealist, and he wants football to be played a certain way, and when MU steps on their necks, their players 'fed' with his idealist ideas are 'caught in the headlights'.Hence the rumours of getting Vieira back.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it is quite cunning for him to try to deflect attention from his team on the dive charges with these BS.</p>
              <p>Unfortunaely, UEFA chose to act now, and the spotlight is his team, so bobian lor.</p>
