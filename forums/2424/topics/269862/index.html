            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Owen sympathises with Tevez<br><br>Owen Hargreaves admits he can fully relate to the frustrations Carlos Tevez will be feeling at the moment over his proposed switch to United.</strong><br><br>Tevez must wait for the outcome of a FIFA investigation before he discovers whether or not his move to Old Trafford will go through before the transfer window shuts next month.<br><br>Hargreaves found himself in a similar position this time last year when, having expressed a desire to join the Reds, his club at the time, Bayern Munich, blocked his departure.<br><br>United failed in their attempts to sign the England midfielder in January, before finally completing the deal earlier this summer. Hargreaves sympathises with the Argentine and is hopeful that he'll receive clearance to join the Reds in the near future.<br><br>"Sometimes these things are difficult," Hargreaves told PA Sport. "We are all aware Carlos Tevez is a fantastic player who is obviously wanted by the club. It is tough to say what the situation is at the moment but once it is sorted out, I am sure he will be eager to come here.<br><br>"When a team like Manchester United express their interest it is hard to say no, especially for someone like myself - I dreamt of having an opportunity like this my whole life.<br><br>"Every player would love the opportunity to come and play here and I am sure he is exactly the same."<br><br>Hargreaves was already familiar with many of his United team-mates before he joined having spent time with them on international duty for England. He says he is loving life at Old Trafford and is excited about the season ahead.<br><br>"Settling-in has been easy. The transition has been very smooth for me because I know a lot of the players already," he explained. "I have been on the training ground with them at Carrington, I am used to playing at Old Trafford with England. All these little things mean the transition has been smooth.<br><br>United is used to signing new players and having new faces come in. The atmosphere in the dressing room is fantastic and everyone seems to get on. It is a very loose, fun atmosphere.<br><br>"We can be very pleased with the squad we have," he added. "We have great options. Each player is very different and very unique. We are all pieces of a puzzle and you can put that puzzle together in many different ways. The important thing is that Manchester United is successful.<br><br>"Michael Carrick said not every player is going to play in every game. That is a fact. If, at the end of the season, we have a couple of titles in our hands, everyone will be very happy."</div>
