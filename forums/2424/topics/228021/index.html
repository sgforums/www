            <div class='col-md body'>Giuseppe Rossi has mixed feelings as his loan spell at Newcastle United comes to an end. The Manchester United youngster has been on loan at St James' Park for five months, but has rarely figured in the Newcastle starting line-up.<br><br>The 19-year old American born Italian has made 13 appearances but just five starts for the Magpies, scoring only once (in the Carling Cup). However, Rossi believes his time on Tyneside has bene beneficial to his career.<br><br>Speaking to the Northern Echo, Rossi said: "It has helped me coming to Newcastle. "I'd have liked to have played more games, which has been a little frustrating. "But in life I believe that you take something from every experience, whether it is good or bad.<br><br>"I've enjoyed myself, I've had a few games under my belt, but it was only ever about coming here and taking that experience back with me to Manchester United. That was the purpose of the move." However, the former Parma striker can't wait to return to Old Trafford, and paid tribute to the Newcastle faithful:<br><br>"I'm really excited about going back. "It's a great time to be going back to Manchester United because we're challenging for the title and in the latter stages of the Champions League. Obviously I'd like to be involved in that. "I've spoken to Sir Alex Ferguson and I hope there will be opportunities for me to play when I go back.<br><br>"That's my main priority now, that's all I'm thinking about. He has said he wants to have a big squad of players in the second half of the season and there might be an opportunity for me to show what I can do.<br><br>"I'll always have fond memories of the Newcastle fans. They are so passionate and whenever we have gone away they have followed us in their thousands."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its about time too....i read in another forum, Rossi will be the sixth striker down the pecking order...sigh.   then, there is Dong Fangzhuo, who made up the seventh.<br><br>suddenly SAF will have many strikers.  But i think he need someone in midfield, hopefully he can fetch one in the transfer mkt come January.</div>
