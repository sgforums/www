The English media had suggested that Manchester United were ready to make an Â£8million bid to lure the Icelander back to England.</strong><br><br>Gudjohnsen departed the Premiership last summer when he quit Chelsea to accept the challenge at Barca. He was signed to replace Henrik Larsson and now, coincidentally, it is said that is what United want him to do at Old Trafford. Larsson has just left United after a successful short stint on loan from Helsingborgs.<br><br>Despite still being in the running for the Treble, United have been left short of striking options in recent weeks with Larsson's departure - as both Louis Saha and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer are struggling with injuries. Gudjohnsen has been limited to just 13 starts this season, but he has shown his importance with five goals.<br><br></div>
