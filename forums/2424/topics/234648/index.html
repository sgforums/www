            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed promising goalkeeper Ben Foster will return to Manchester United in the summer after spending a second year at Watford. Although the 23-year-old actually signed for the Old Trafford outfit 18 months ago, he has yet to make a senior appearance for United, having been sent to Vicarage Road by Ferguson in an attempt to further his experience.</strong><br><br>Foster has already played his way into the England squad, with Ferguson certain he will eventually gain full international honours. And, despite handing veteran Edwin Van der Sar a one-year contract extension and spending Â£4million on the Dutchman's current deputy, Tomasz Kuszczak, Ferguson will welcome Foster back into the United fold once the current campaign is over.<br><br>"Without question, Ben will come back here," said Ferguson. "All we have done in terms of the goalkeeping situation is identify really good talent and secure their future. "We know Ben has a good future in the game. He is doing well at Watford and, at his age, has everything in front of him, because I believe him to be England's best young goalkeeper."<br><br>Premier League loan rules prevent Foster from facing United at Old Trafford on Wednesday, when Ferguson's men will look to halt the Hornets' current two-match winning streak. However, while Ferguson will be denied the chance to see Foster in the flesh, he has been given a full analysis of the keeper's time at Watford by counterpart Adrian Boothroyd, who has impressed the United boss with the thoroughness of his background information.<br><br>"I get a fantastic monthly report from Aidy Boothroyd, which contains all the detail about how he trains, how he is as a professional and how he is developing," revealed Ferguson. "It is first-class professionalism from Aidy Boothroyd to take the time to go through all the games he plays in that month."<br></div>
