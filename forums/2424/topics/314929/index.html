              <h2>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson believes that Rio
              Ferdinand is capable of following in the footsteps of legendary AC
              Milan defender Paolo Maldini by playing until he's 40.</h2>
              <p>The 29-year-old England defender just penned a banner new deal that
              will keep him at the club past his 34th birthday, but his manager is
              convinced that this would not be the end of the road for him.<br><br>"Of course, Maldini is an exception and whether Rio wants to go on until he is 40 is another matter," said Ferguson.<br><br>"But
              with his athleticism and pace - and the fact he has no weight problems,
              there is no reason why he cannot play on well into his late 30s.<br><br>"His
              performance against Arsenal last Sunday was absolutely fantastic.
              Together with Gerard Pique, he took care of all the threats that can
              arise against Arsenal."</p>

              <h1 class="art-headline">Ronaldo's the master, but it's Rio who is in a class of his own</h1>
              <h2 class="art-byline">Â <a title="View other stories for 16 April 2008" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/columnists/holt/2008/04/16/"> 16/04/2008</a></h2>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">I understand why Cristiano Ronaldo will win by a landslide when journalists name their Footballer of the Year in May.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">I
              won't begrudge him it. Not one bit. I think he's been magnificent all
              season. He's taken a lot of physical punishment from defenders and
              never lost the courage to take them on.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">He's
              a virtuoso player who only needs to hang a Champions League medal round
              his neck for us to start making legitimate comparisons between him and
              George Best.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And of course there's also the small matter of the 38 goals he's scored this season.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But
              when I send my ballot form in tomorrow, I'm going to vote for Rio
              Ferdinand. Because I think Ferdinand's contribution has been just as
              important as Ronaldo's.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Because he has been Manchester United's anchor. Because he has become their strongest influence.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And
              because he is finally starting to play like the complete defender
              everyone hoped he would become when he was first starting out at West
              Ham.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Ferdinand has been the best defender in the Premier League this season by a street.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">In
              fact, identify me a better centre-half in the world at the moment. A
              fully-fit John Terry would run him close. Fabio Cannavaro maybe. Apart
              from them, I can't think of one.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Ferdinand's played at the heart of a United defence that has conceded fewer goals than any other in the division.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">He's
              played more games than any other United player this season, too. He's
              played the big games and the smaller ones. He doesn't get rested.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And he has disproved the theory that he needed Gary Neville close at hand on his right to do his thinking for him.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Most of all, he's turned himself into a real leader of men at last, a commander rather than a dilettante.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">In the past, others have held him together. Now he's the glue for the rest.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">In Neville's absence, he's become the heart of the side, a man others look to for their inspiration and their motivation.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">There were times, even in the recent past, when it seemed that Ferdinand was wasting his talent.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">His inability to stay out of trouble off the pitch appeared to be in direct correlation with his frequent lapses on it.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And
              his readiness to content himself with a limited role as a stopper
              prompted former England boss Glenn Hoddle to observe that Ferdinand was
              using only about 50 per cent of his potential. That's changed now. Some
              of his performances this season have been breathtaking.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">He was sublime in the 3-0 win over Liverpool a few weeks ago. And just as good in the 4-0 FA Cup demolition of Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">He
              has provided silk and steel in equal measure but as well as his
              imperious defending, he has shown fresh signs of becoming a creative
              force as he steps up into midfield.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And
              if all that wasn't enough it now seems that Ferdinand wasn't the
              organiser of United's Christmas party last December after all.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Ronaldo
              will carry off the award again because his talent is like a starburst.
              Ferdinand's impact has been quieter and all the more impressive for it.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">A
              couple of years ago, the idea of him succeeding Roy Keane as the soul
              of Manchester United would have been laughed out of town.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But now it's Rio who's laughing last.</p>
