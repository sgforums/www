              <p><em>Gabriel spoke exclusively to MUTV’s Mark Sullivan, in fluent English, moments after being unveiled as a summer signing alongside Michael Owen and Antonio Valencia.</em></p>
              <p><strong>How does it feel to be here?<br></strong>I am very happy. I am proud to be here. I will try to prove to the boss what I can do and then we will see.</p>
              <p><strong>What do you hope to achieve here at Manchester United?<br></strong>I hope to become a better player, to improve and progress because I’m only 20. I know I’ll have to work hard.</p>
              <p><strong>There are many fantastic players here. Are you excited to be amongst them?<br></strong>Yes, very excited. I look forward to playing with them. I know I’m surrounded by great players like Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney so I know it will be hard (to get into the team) but I am very excited.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you feel that playing with these great players can make you a better player?<br></strong>Yes, even training with them is great. I hope I will have the chance to play with them on the pitch.</p>
              <p><strong>What can you tell us about your style of play?}<br></strong>I think I’m quick and technical – I do a lot of tricks. I like to dribble, to have the ball and take on a defender, face to face.</p>
              <p><strong>You’ve represented your country at various levels – for example you scored against England for the Under-21s. Is it your ambition to play at the very top for France?<br></strong>Yes, although it is pretentious to talk about the first (senior) team now. I am an Under-21 international now and I will work hard. Maybe then, at the end of the season, I may have a chance to</p>
              <div class="newsStory">
              <p>get in (into the senior squad.)</p>
              <p><strong>Who are your sporting idols?<br></strong>I love very much Rivaldo, the Brazilian footballer, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p><strong>So will you try and emulate some of Ronaldo’s ability here?<br></strong>I will try but he is a great player. He won the Ballon d’Or last year so it will be difficult. I will have to improve and progress a lot, then we will see.</p>
              <p><strong>We have had some fantastic French players here in the past – Eric Cantona, Laurent Blanc and Fabien Barthez – and in the present with Patrice Evra. Do you hope to follow in their footsteps?<br></strong>I hope so. It will be difficult. All the players you name are internationals so I hope I can follow them.</p>
              <p><strong>Did Laurent Blanc, your coach at Bordeaux, talk to you about your move to United?<br></strong>Yes, I called him before I left and he told me it was a big club with a big structure. He also wished me good luck. So that’s all he told me but he was very confident (for me).</p>
              <p><strong>Has Laurent been an influence on your career?<br></strong>A little bit, even if he was a defender and I am a forward. But he was an influence because he was very technical for a defender, clever with the ball. </p>
              <p><strong>Finally, we understand you have a slight injury at the moment. Nothing too serious, we hope?<br></strong>No, it’s not serious. I just have to be patient and wait to have a full recovery, then come back stronger.</p>
