              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21931/Patrice-Evra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Patrice Evra</span></span></a> says he too would consider leaving Manchester United if he felt the club were no longer capable of winning trophies, though the Frenchman has warned against assuming the club's ambition has been curtailed.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney's brief insurrection, ended when he signed a new five-year contract on Friday, saw the striker openly question whether the club would compete for football's top prizes in the future.</p>
              <p>Evra fiercely disagrees with that stance, but acknowledges he would contemplate his own future should United's legacy of trophy success come to a halt.</p>
              <p>"I know from experience that I could be in his situation one day and so could everyone," Evra told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>. "We are always open to him if he needs our help.</p>
              <p>"I myself would not play for this club if I knew we were not strong enough to win the league. That is why we all play for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"At this moment, I think everyone just needs to focus on their own job again and we will see at the end of the season. I agree with the criticism that United have not had the winning mentality this season.</p>
              <p>"We draw, we win and then we draw again and, of course, people will talk about this not being the same United because we are already behind Chelsea in the league. I know this is not normal for us, but after what has happened this week we need to make sure we win against Stoke and then everything will look better.</p>
              <p>"I only stay in Manchester to win trophies and my message is that if people think that United are finished they are making a big mistake. I say this because it is the truth and I believe it."</p>

              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21931/Patrice-Evra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Patrice Evra</span></span></a> could be set to leave Manchester United in the summer as reports suggest that he is keen to move to Real Madrid amid concerns over investment in the squad.</p>
              <p>Evra, who joined United for £5.5 million from Monaco in 2006, has a current deal that ends in the summer of 2012 and Madrid have been monitoring his situation as coach Jose Mourinho continues his search for a world-class left-back.</p>
              <p>The Glazer family are set to invest in United over the summer - possibly to the tune of £50 million - but, after the <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> contract saga, Evra has admitted to friends that he is keen to move on.</p>
              <p>"Patrice originally wanted to leave in January but now he is happy to sign a new contract and leave at the end of the season," a United source told <em>Goal.com</em>. "He is concerned about where the club are heading and is attracted by the possibility of playing for Real, a club he really admires."</p>
              <p>Evra claimed during the Rooney saga that "if one player doesn't trust the others he should not play in the team," but it now seems that the Frenchman could become the next United player in the spotlight.</p>
              <p>The source added: "Evra was the most angry when Rooney said he was going to leave and criticised the quality of the squad but that doesn't mean he swears blind loyalty to Manchester United. Like any player, he wants what is best for himself and his family and sees Real Madrid as the perfect move."</p>

              <p>I hope he stays on.</p>
              <p>He's still one of the best left backs in the world.</p>
              <p>Would be very hard to find a replacement plus considering the fact that Utd have been reluctant to splash big on quality players recently. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Patrice Evra claims Manchester United must spend as "little time" as possible thinking about their neighbours City.</p>
              <p>The sides meet in the eagerly-anticipated derby at Eastlands on Wednesday night but the United full-back believes the club's priorities are the Premier League and Champions League.</p>
              <p>The France international does not see the fixture as any more important than games against Liverpool or Chelsea.</p>
              <p>He told the <em>News of the World</em>: "Look, I like to win against Chelsea, I love to play against Manchester City and I hate to lose against Liverpool at Anfield. That's my mentality.</p>
              <p>"They're always rivals, but every year we've got to win the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"We don't think about Manchester City because they are not our problem."</p>
              <p>The full-back also claims City are a lesser side without skipper Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>The Argentine, who joined the Eastlands giants last year when he moved from United, is expected to be fit for the big derby after suffering from a thigh injury.</p>
              <p>And Evra said: "City have spent a lot of money, but for me Carlito is easily the best player they have.</p>
              <p>"They have other good players, but he attacks and defends.</p>
              <p>"They couldn't afford to lose him. He is a big player, the most important they have - and every single Manchester City player knows that.</p>
              <p>"I am still very friendly with Carlos. We speak every day and he still comes to my house and I go to his, we are friends for life.</p>
              <p>"Just because he went to City doesn't mean I cut my relationship with him."</p>
