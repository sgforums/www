              <p><strong>Nani believes the 4-0 victory over Hull City has set the Reds up nicely for Wednesday's Carling Cup semi-final second leg against Manchester City and the winger is tipping Wayne Rooney to fire United to Wembley.<br><br></strong>The in-form striker netted all four goals against Tigers, a win which not only took the Reds top of the table, but also provided a real confidence boost within the camp.<br><br>United currently trail 2-1 in the last four tie against Blues, but the Portuguese international insists Sir Alex’s men are champing at the bit to turn things around at Old Trafford.<br><br>“Everyone is very happy. It’s great to be top of the table and it’s given everyone a lot of confidence. We’re playing well, scoring goals and feeling good,” Nani told <em>MUTV</em>.<br><br>“The game against City will be very hard, but it’s great that we have someone like Wayne who is in good form and feeling confident.<br><br>“It’s great to see one of your strikers score four goals and it gives everyone confidence because we know we have someone who can score goals in every match.<br><br>“I’m sure it’ll be a fantastic atmosphere against City and I’d love to be involved. Hopefully we can get the win.”</p>
              <p>While Sir Alex Ferguson rightly heaped praise on United’s No.10 after yet another inspirational display, the United boss was also keen to highlight Nani’s impressive contribution during the 90 minutes.<br><br>The man himself was pleased to play his part in the Reds’ win and, having now returned to full fitness, wants to stake a claim for a prolonged run in the side.<br><br>“It was very frustrating to be out injured, but it happens in football. I’m back now and I feel very good,” he insisted.<br><br>“I was happy with my performance [against Hull] and I just want to keep improving every week so I can help the team be successful.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Groundhog Day at the Emirates - an action replay of last season’s Champions League semi final.<br><br></strong>Just as it was last April, United took a 2-0 first-half lead to completely take the wind out of Arsenal’s sails, scored a third goal in the second half to send the home fans heading for the exits long before the end, then conceded an unlucky late consolation goal.<br><br>And there was one more similarity with the European tie – a Portugese winger stole the show. Back then it was Ronaldo. This time it was Nani. I know there are a number of United fans who had lost faith in Nani. Was he ever going to turn potential and undoubted ability into consistent performances? The last week has hopefully provided us with the answer.<br><br>Man of the match against Hull, excellent again against City and dazzling at the Emirates. Last week I suggested here that Rooney may have benefited from Ronaldo’s departure. Perhaps the same can be said of Nani. He has emerged from his Portugal team-mates’s shadow.<br><br>The skill he showed for United’s opener was spellbinding – if Ronaldo had done that we would all have been drooling about it. He told me after the game that it was definitely his goal - as you'd expect! Sadly I fear it will go down as an Manuel Almunia own goal. That was the sixth own goal that United have benefited from this season – that must be some kind of record...<br><br>I have to be honest and say that (and please don’t tell the boss) when I was handed the teamsheet at the Emirates I really couldn’t see us romping to victory. I felt that a draw was the most likely outcome. No Rio, no Vidic and one man upfront against an in-form Arsenal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But that man was Wayne Rooney. “World class” was how Sir Alex described his performance to me. Every time he had the ball you sensed terror spread through the Arsenal ranks.<br><br>I remember thinking last season when Ronaldo was performing miracles, how lucky we all were to be seeing one of the world’s best players playing at his peak. That now applies to Rooney – the complete forward – we are so lucky to see him in action every week. He’s become just the 18th player to score 100 Premier League goals – and he’s only 24. And it's frightening to think just how much more he can achieve.<br><br>Arsenal were hopelessly outclassed, and I don't think they can now win the title. There is one thing about them that is Championship class at least – the food in the press room! Gnocchi followed by Ben and Jerry’s ice cream pre-match. Then fish and chips at half time. What a club!</p>
