Ronaldo declared he wanted to quit Old Trafford for Spain after last summer's World Cup, where he got United pal Wayne Rooney sent off in England's defeat to Portugal. But he stayed at United and has scored 13 goals this season to help them to the top of the Premiership. And United No2 Carlos Queiroz has dismissed Real's chances of signing Ronaldo, insisting he is close to agreeing a new bumper contract.<br><br>Ex-Real boss Queiroz said: Â“It is natural that the media talk about Cristiano Ronaldo with Real Madrid. Â“He is a great player and Madrid are a great club, but it is just speculation. They are fantasises.<br><br>Â“The football that he is playing in Manchester is an example that he is happy here and he has his head at United. He has talent and is the best in the world. Â“In addition to that, we are speaking with him about renewing his contract.<br><br>Â“The club have a clear policy. It is not necessary that a player has to finish his contract before we think about renewing it. Â“Ryan Giggs has been with us for 14 years and he has renewed his contract many times. Â“This club do not need the agents to recognise the work of the players.<br><br>Â“We anticipate things ourselves and that is what we are going to do with Cristiano.Â” Queiroz also revealed an insight into the dedication Ronaldo has demonstrated this season. He added: Â“He is always the first to arrive at training and the last to go.<br><br>Â“Many times when the session has finished, we shower, eat and then we look at the pitch and he is still training. Â“He is a player who has a divine gift. He was born to be the best in the world.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RUUD: RONALDO WELCOME AT REAL</strong><br><br>Ruud van Nistelrooy denied any feud with Cristiano Ronaldo, and says he'd be welcome at Real Madrid. The Portuguese star has been strongly linked with Real in the Spanish media this week - and is reportedly at the top of Predrag Mijatovic's summer shopping list.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy was reported to have had a training-ground dispute with the winger when the Dutchman was still with Manchester United, but played down talk of any bad blood between the pair.<br><br>He told Real's official website: "It was nothing serious. The press talk a lot about the subject, but they were lies." About the possibility of a transfer, van Nistelrooy added: "This is between Real Madrid and Manchester. If players come they are always welcomed.<br><br>"He is very young, a favourite of Ferguson."<br><br>As a player van Nistelrooy is in no doubt about Ronaldo's talent. "He is a fantastic player. This season is the best he has had since he has been at Manchester, scoring many goals and playing very well.<br><br>"He is young and he has much experience from the World Cup and European Championships."<br><br></div>

Reports in Spain suggest the nine-times European champions are preparing a massive Â£35million offer for the 21-year-old, who expressed a desire to join the club during last summer's World Cup. Since then, Ronaldo has returned to Manchester, has risen above the abuse of opposition fans and produced the best form of his life.<br><br>With 13 Premiership goals to his name, Ronaldo trails only Didier Drogba in the scoring charts and he is one of the major contenders for this season's prestigious player of the year awards. Earlier this week, Ferguson's assistant Carlos Queiroz suggested United were ready to open contract negotiations with Ronaldo, even though the Portugal international's present deal does not expire until 2010.<br><br>Ferguson joked he would be 'in a wheelchair' by that time, although he was deadly serious when he stated Real have no chance of getting their man. "We sell players we want to sell and there is absolutely no way Cristiano Ronaldo is leaving," he said.<br><br>"The boy has done fantastically well. He is developing as a professional, as a person and as a player. "He is happy here. He has a contract until 2010 and we are not interested in even thinking about selling him."<br><br></div>
