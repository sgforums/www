            <div class='col-md body'>Reports suggest Southampton defender Gareth Bale is set for a medical at Tottenham, with a view to joining the Londoners in the next few days.<br><br>The 17-year-old Welsh international has allegedly been the subject of interest from United and Arsenal as well as Martin Jol's side, and Southampton's failure to secure promotion to the Premiership via the play-offs seems to have paved the way for his departure.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson's interest in Bale was a recurring transfer rumour throughout last season as the teenager turned in a string of top performances for club and country.<br><br>Previously, Southampton boss George Burley had expressed his desire to keep hold of the highly-promising defender, who can also play further forward.<br><br>"The position has not changed," he told www.saintsfc.co.uk. "I want to keep him for at least another season and we will be speaking to him, his family and his agent in the next week or so to see how they feel about it."<br><br>"It would do him good to stay another year and to play regularly, but we need to discuss things with his advisors."<br><br>It now seems Bale's ambition for top flight football will take him to White Hart Lane.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>United on back foot in Bale race<br>Stuart Mathieson<br>24/ 5/2007<br><br>UNITED'S left-back merry-go-round could grind to a halt if Southampton's Gareth Bale is snapped up by Tottenham instead of the Reds.<br><br>All United's senior No 3s - Gabriel Heinze, Patrice Evra and Mikael Silvestre - are interesting foreign suitors.<br><br>Clubs in Italy, France and Spain had been alerted to a potential mini-clearout to make way for 17-year-old Welsh international Bale's arrival.<br><br>But the Premiership champions are going to have to be quick if they still want to add Bale to the squad as Tottenham have leapt to the head of the queue with a bid reportedly accepted. Spurs have had a bid for Bale on the table since the January transfer window.<br><br>They have reportedly offered Â£6m in cash and then add-ons that would take the fee eventually up to around Â£10m.<br><br>Saints want money in quickly to keep their head above water and though manager George Burley is still talking up the possibility of keeping Bale it is believed the club have resigned themselves to losing him.<br><br>The player has just one-year left on his contract and Southampton do not want to lose out on a windfall next summer when he'd be a free agent.<br><br>Bale had been for talks at White Hart Lane in January but decided to stay on until the end of the season at St Mary's Stadium.<br><br>But Tottenham's bid still stands and they are said to now be in pole position.<br><br>Interest<br><br>If United are still keen they cannot afford to dally but if their interest has cooled, then it could put the brakes on sales.<br><br>Heinze, Evra and Silvestre, who have all contested the left-back berth this campaign, are all on various shopping lists for the summer.<br><br>UnitedÂ’s 2005 Player of the Year Heinze is the most likely departure as he can buy out the remainder of his two-year contract by law having served three years of the five-year deal he signed in 2004 when moving from he signed for Â£7.9m from Paris St Germain for Â£7.9m.<br><br>Now Juventus, long-term suitors of the Argentinian, are back in Serie A a move to Italy could tempt Heinze.<br><br>Valencia are also understood to be monitoring his situation at Old Trafford, which is no longer as rock-solid as it once was.<br><br>EvraÂ’s injuries forced him to concede the left-back battle late on after his early-season form won him FergieÂ’s vote. But now he is in BarcelonaÂ’s sights.<br><br>The Spaniards are looking to replace Giovanni Van Bronckhorst and are impressed by EvraÂ’s speed and attacking ability from defence.<br><br>Silvestre wants to remain at Old Trafford but Lyon are keen again, having been rejected by the defender in January 2006.<br><br>If United trump TottenhamÂ’s bid for Bale then one of the current left backs is almost certain to depart.<br><br>Even if they donÂ’t Heinze might voluntarily trim the numbers in the department anyway.<br><br><a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1007/1007645__united_on_back_foot_in_bale_race.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1007/1007645__united_on_back_foot_in_bale_race.html</a></div>
