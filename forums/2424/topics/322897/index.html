              <h1><strong>Madrid And Marca In Ronaldo Limbo</strong></h1>
              <h2>Manchester United have discussed which players they could sign with
              the money from the possible sale of Cristiano Ronaldo, according to
              Marca.</h2>
              Sir Alex Fergsuon held his first meeting with club officials since
              returning from holiday and the subject of the Portuguese star was
              discussed openly.<br> <br> The report in Marca, which has been at the
              forefront of the push for Ronaldo to join Madrid, appears to be
              designed to reassure Madrid fans in the light of the club's possible
              failure to land their man.<br> <br> Ronaldo is still on holiday and the
              club are refusing to ring him to discuss the situation for fear of it
              being conceived as a sign of weakness, the story states.<br> <br> If he
              were to leave, then the first player that would be approached is
              Dimitar Berbatov, who Tottenham would let leave for a starting price of
              €35m.<br> <br> Despite claims in England that the north London club are
              loathe to sell to United, Marca have rehashed the Red Devils' interest
              as the pressure mounts on a deal for Ronaldo being done.<br> <br> The
              exit of Berbatov would, in turn, allow Juande Ramos to then make higher
              bids for Samuel Eto'o or David Villa, despite the former claiming he
              did not want to go to Spurs and the latter set to stay with Valencia.<br> <br> Marca are convinced that United will continue to put on a brave face until they realise that Ronaldo is determined to leave.<br> <br> Madrid
              president Ramón Calderón has made the player his main aim this summer
              and his reputation, despite two league titles, could hang on succeeding
              in this bid.<br> <br> After promising to sign Cesc Fàbregas, Kaká and
              Arjen Robben, the arrival of only the injury-prone Dutchman has left
              many Madrid fans disgruntled with him.<br> <em><strong><br>Lucas Brown, Goal.com</strong></em></blockquote>
              <p>Ok... if ronaldo goes for lets say 80 million pounds</p>
              <p>i would get</p>
              <p>1. villa for 20 million</p>
              <p>2.quaresma for 25 million</p>
              <p>3. richards for 15 million</p>
              <p>4. a good left or right back (tempted to say lahm but not sure after his mistake at the finals) for 10 million.</p>
              <p>5. remainding 10 million plus whatever United has for transfer budget to secure tevez on permanent deal.</p>

              <p>Villa definitely won't be worth 20 million only after his Euro heroics.</p>
              <p>Quaresma has left Porto right?</p>
              <p>Don't think Richards will leave Manchester City this coming season.</p>
              <p>There are not much left or right back worth mention at the moment.</p>
              <p>Securing the Tevez deal will be good.</p>

              <p>20m for Villa is something Valencia would not accept.</p>
              <p>And what's with people and Lahm? Seriously, I don't find that he is any good, decent but definitely won't fit in for a bill as good. In my opinion, he is as clumsy as Igor Biscan and bad as Kromkamp.</p>
              <p>He can't defend to save his life, having him is equivalent to playing 3-5-2</p>

              <p>United don't need another left back... They already have Evra and if Silvestre stays... That settles that. Anyway, Silvestre is also able to be cover as a centre back...</p>
              <p>United may not need another right back also for another year as there is Brown and Neville to use in that position... Again, Brown is also able to act as cover for the centre...</p>
              <p>What they need to get urgently is a striker and not just any striker... They must get a big and tall striker who can bring another dimension to their game if need to. Therefore Villa is out of the equation cos he will just be another similar style to Tevez and Rooney or Saha... Anyway, United was never even remotely link to him...</p>
              <p>This season, Fergie want someone in the mould of Berbatov, Huntelaar or Santa Cruz... They can give a new and different approach to United's attack if need to... Whatever, they must get one of them...</p>
