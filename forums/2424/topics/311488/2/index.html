              <p><strong>Boss hopes for Edwin bonus</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Edwin van der Sar could bring his vast experience to bear on Sunday's big match against Liverpool after being rated as "hopeful" by his manager Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br></strong>The Dutch goalkeeper has missed United's last two games at Derby and at home to Bolton, enabling Ben Foster and Tomas Kuszczak to make rare appearances in the first team. Although both shot-stoppers performed well to keep clean sheets in Edwin's absence, the United boss would love to welcome back his number one for such an important fixture.<br><br>Speaking at a press conference before Friday's training session, Sir Alex said: "We’re waiting to see how Edwin van der Sar trains this morning. <br><br>"He and Rio Ferdinand both have to train really to give me the confidence to play them. I’m doubtful for Ferdinand, I’m hopeful for van der Sar. One out of two would be a bonus, given their experience."<br><br>Van der Sar has yet to concede a league goal against Liverpool while playing for United. He's faced the Merseysiders six times since his summer 2005 transfer to Old Trafford and has only been beaten once, by Peter Crouch's FA Cup winner at Anfield.<br><br>United's only other injury concern is over Louis Saha, who started the midweek win over Bolton before being replaced on 70 minutes by Wayne Rooney.<br><br>"Louis Saha got a knock on Wednesday," said Sir Alex. "We’ll have to see what he’s like this morning. I think he was okay yesterday (Thursday) but the injury flared up a bit after training. Other than that, everyone’s fit."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez cast aside his usual caution yesterday and boldly warned Manchester United: 'We are going to beat you.' The Liverpool manager normally fights shy of predictions but was adamant the force is with his improved team as they prepare to kick off a momentous double-header in the race for the Barclays Premier League title.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez believes Liverpool now have enough firepower to hold sway and said: 'We have come really close before, but we are better equipped now to go on and beat them. We have players who can change a game like Gerrard, Torres and Ryan Babel, players who can score goals.</p>
              <p>'We always had a plan going to Old Trafford. We tried to do certain things but in the end we did not have enough power. We have now. They have match-winners in Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez, but we have two or three who can do the same.'</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard's potent partnership with Fernando Torres may pose the biggest threat to United's three-point lead at the top, but Benitez feels one-time Old Trafford target Javier Mascherano's midfield dynamism could prove just as important.</p>
              <p>The Argentine, recently signed for £19million, will be on a mission to stop Cristiano Ronaldo and Benitez compared him to Roy Keane. He said: 'Javier is a strong character and leader and is the same kind of player as Keane. He is a key man for us who gives us balance, and his fantastic work-rate gives the likes of Torres and Gerrard the freedom to go forward.'</p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss also tipped his side to reach 100 goals for the season. He added: 'We have already scored 99, so we will watch a few videos of them and go there with a lot of confidence. We have the belief to go to Old Trafford and win.'</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Confident: Anderson is not afraid to stand up to Gerrard</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard is unlikely to have heard of a young Brazilian named Anderson before this season, but the Liverpool captain will tomorrow come face to face once more with a player who Sir Alex Ferguson believes was crucial to Manchester United's win at Anfield last December.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ferguson was overwhelmed by the manner in which Anderson stood toe to toe with the Liverpool captain as United won 1-0 and is expected to name the 19-year-old in his team for tomorrow's clash at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Anderson said: 'To me, Gerrard is a big footballer, but I went out that day determined to play with force and not to be preoccupied with him.</p>
              <p>'Names don't matter to me. I am finding that I can raise my level and offer more when I am playing against the big stars and this is how it was when I played against Gerrard.</p>
              <p>'He is one of the best midfielders in Europe and it is hard to stop him. It will be again. 'It was a tough battle with him when we played last time. He was hurting at the end but he was gracious and I respect him for that.'</p>
              <p>Anderson was bought by Ferguson last summer as a player for the future but such has been his impact in his debut season that he is likely to partner Paul Scholes tomorrow and consign Owen Hargreaves and Michael Carrick to the bench.</p>
              <p>The former FC Porto player has made 20 League starts this season, three more than the disappointing Hargreaves.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 'Anderson can handle anything. He's got a terrific belief in himself. Like a lot of Brazilian players, he was just born to play.'</p>
              <p>He added: 'I believe we have a better squad than Liverpool. In defence and midfield we are superior and perhaps the only place they can match us is in attack.'</p>

              <p>lol true. i find Fletcher similar as Carrick. But the one with lots of stamina is Park isnt it? That oxygen tank. For me to go Oh no, is seeing Saha in starting eleven.</p>
