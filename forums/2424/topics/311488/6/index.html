              <p>haha. Mascherano is a f*ckin' dumb a*shole. He should learn to keep his big mouth shut. It is Pool's free-kick. I don't understand why they have to kpkb. Torres had already moved away after being shown a yellow card, and Mascherano kay kiang ran all the up the pitch to remonstrate and kpkb, and that's why he picked up his second yellow = red card; as he was booked for dissent.</p>
              <p>But to be honest, Gerrard was anonymous in the match. He was supposed to rein in his fellow troops but he really did nothing at all.</p>
              <p>And I think MOTM should be Vidic for his solid-as-ever defending or Ronaldo for his off-the-ball running which caused Pool endless probs. I think Scholes had a rather ordinary match, nothing special but he did his job well.</p>
              <p>Giggs really cmi luh. Time to give him much lesser playing time. Nani to the fore!</p>
              <p>Anderson should really practise his shooting &amp; finishing more often. Rooney too. </p>
              <p>And I say, give Brown a new contract with his terms &amp; requests fulfilled! haha.</p>

              <p>to be fair, united were the better team even before the mascherano red card</p>

              <p>Omg, Anderson shooting birds?</p>
              <p>Haha, Nani's goal was a supprise! Didnt see it coming hahahahaha!</p>
              <p>My favorite chance of the game was the pass from VDS to Rooney, great  control over the ball, saved by Reina, Anderson missed the 2nd chance tho... &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p><br>I think SAF might be resting Tevez? How the played Giggs as a striker :P I've always prefered giggs as a right winger actually.</p>

              <p>Its not over yet... If we look at United's fixtures, You know we will have some problems from now till the end of the season... I have been saying that United need to go into April with a 6 points margin for insurance cos they will be meeting teams that have alway given them problems... Take this Sat match against <strong>Aston Villa</strong>... cos united will be playing in the CL on the following tue, so some players will be rested... possibly even Ronaldo. And hopefully this won't effect the result... Then there is an away match against <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> between the 2 legs <strong>Roma</strong> games... Middlesbrough has also given us problems on many occasions... and my guess is non first team players will be needed to do the job here... as important players will need to rest.</p>
              <p>If we are able to get the points from those matches... We will still have <strong>Arsenal</strong>, not an easy game by any means even tho its at OT. After Arsenal, we have another away match against <strong>Blackburn</strong>... This will be a very tough one as well... United have lost 3 times in their last 5 visits to Blackburn... After all these... We will have one of the hardest match... <strong>Chelsea at Stamford Bridge</strong>. We all saw how they took apart Arsenal last night after going behind. They are still unbeaten at home for 3 yrs plus... So you can see the big task ahead isn't simple or easy by any means...    </p>
              <p>Then in May, we will meet our jinxed team again in <strong>West Ham</strong>... This club have beaten United 3 times in our last 3 meetings regardless of where they are on the league table standings... This is one more to take note... Then the last game of the season we have to go away to<strong> Wigan</strong>. Honestly, I wouldn't want to have to go to Wigan to get the points needed to win the title... Wigan's pitch is terrible and they are struggling for premiership survival so you can expect them to give everything in this...</p>
              <p>All in all, United will start playing something like a game in every 3 to 4 days starting from April... And this is when the rotation starts and where the reserved have to be depended on if United are to bring back the league title... Thats why i say its still far from over... most important is not to lose the 6 points games against Arsenal and Chelsea...</p>

              <p><strong>ALEX FERGUSON was amazed at Javier Mascherano’s incredible show of contempt for referee Steve Bennett in a week when everyone in football was condemning the curse of dissent.</strong></p>
              <p>The hotheaded Argentinian was shown a second yellow card and dismissed just before half-time after abusing Bennett and his assistants no less than SIX times in a non-stop tirade at Old Trafford. He then refused to leave the pitch and had to be restrained as he tried to confront Bennett. </p>
              <p>Bennett was the fourth official in the Tottenham-Chelsea game four days earlier, when Ashley Cole was blasted for turning his back on Mike Riley when the referee showed him a yellow card for a vicious tackle. Ferguson, who boasted this week about how he “went off his head” with players who surrounded referees, said Mascherano could have no complaints.  </p>
              <p>He explained: “I don’t know why he got involved. He came across from central midfield to argue with the referee. “With what happened during the week with the Ashley Cole thing, there’s been a focus on dissent. He’d already been booked and he kept badgering the referee. Dissent is dissent — and I think that was dissent.”</p>

              <p>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez amazingly tried to defend his player. The Spaniard said: “He knows he made a mistake but in this kind of game it is wrong to leave a team with just 10 players because one of them asked why. “I talked to him in Spanish from the touchline and I kept telling him to stop, saying ‘It’s finished’. He doesn’t know the referees so well and I wanted him to stop.</p>
              <p>“Mascherano is a fantastic professional and has been playing at the maximum level for years. When you play a big game like this you are surprised by something like this. And you want to know why you are sent off. “We are talking about players who are passionate and who want to win. Mascherano was trying to work really hard, like everyone else, and we are disappointed with what happened. </p>
              <p>“All of my people are disappointed and no one is more disappointed than me. We had our chances but with 10 players, it’s just ‘forget it’. Before the sending off we had chances and maybe we could have scored. But then we were losing 1-0 after a mistake and after the sending off everything was over.”</p>

              <p>i never expect this kind of score! on papers, pundits were writing us off before the match. and ya, mascherano shouldn't have lost his cool in this type of big match.</p>
              <p>credits must be given to rooney~ even though he has not score for quite a while, but he still can assist!!</p>

              <p> due to rooney's non scoring since oct or whatever, alot of critics deemed it as low confidence but judging from this game, he did get good chances but just bad luck.</p>
              <p>for the first one, if he had not stayed and try to score and went down, he would have gotten a penalty, and the following take-downs which were simply world-class, but just too tight an angle to score.</p>
              <p>do you feel he is low on confidence or just plain bad luck?</p>

              <p>yep, Rooney is more a complete player, and he reminds me largely of Scholes.</p>
              <p>Pity, his takedowns were superb, and I hope he breaks his duck soon.</p>
