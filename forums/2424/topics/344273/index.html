              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED were last night planning a £14million bid for Wigan star Wilson Palacios.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Latics rejected a £10m bid from Tottenham for the Honduras midfield powerhouse yesterday. SunSport understands that Wigan told Spurs they will not do business for less than £14m.</p>
              <p class="article">Wigan chairman Dave Whelan insisted: “It’s not enough money. They can come back or forget it.” Latics boss Steve Bruce confirmed he plans to hold talks with Palacios, 24, over his future today.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “We’ll see what happens when the money men start talking. “But it’s difficult, it’s not about me or the chairman, it’s about the player. “How can you deny them a life-changing opportunity? You can bet it will be a huge contract. “He will be as good a midfielder as there is in a couple of years.”</p>
              <p class="article">United manager Alex Ferguson is a huge fan of Palacios and was planning a summer swoop. But the Spurs offer has forced United’s hand as Whelan will sell to the Londoners for the right price.</p>
              <p class="article">Spurs manager Harry Redknapp made the move after his struggling team were run ragged by Palacios in Sunday’s 1-0 defeat at the JJB Stadium. Palacios has been a revelation since joining for just £1m from Deportivo Olimpia last January.</p>
              <p class="article">He has also attracted interest from Spaniards Real Madrid and German giants Bayern Munich.</p>

              <p>There is two possibilities here... One is maybe Fergie is helping his old friend Dave Whelan to force Spurs to pay more... at the same time, get back at Levy... The other is, he really want this guy...</p>
              <p>I think Palacios is a very good DM, and at 24 yrs old only... I think he is better than Diarra, the one that went to Real for $20m.</p>
              <p>United currently have Anderson, Owen Hargreaves, Carrick and Darren Fletcher as DM... Soon, Carrick may have to take over Scholes position so they will be left with Anderson, Hargreaves and Fletcher. But Hargreaves no one know what will happen to him, even if he comes back he will be about 28, 29... Anderson is 20, 21 so maybe they might need one more and 24 is a good age as when Hargreaves reach 31, 32 he will be just 27.</p>

              Fletcher as DM ...no way.  He does not look he fit the job.  In fact I don't even think he fits Man U style of play.  His crosses are not good, he is not as creative as Carrick, he lack the physique to tackle or sit in front of defense.
              
              Thats why he still remain as fringe player of Man U and not in the first team.

              <p>yep, I felt he tracked back and disrupt a lot of plays. while fletcher is not a makelele-mould player, he does his job well. And he did score some important goals. Yes, by united standards, he may fall short of the flair and tricks but like park, work his socks off, and I realli appreciate him.</p>

              <p>true, rem how carrick was supposed to step into the #16 shoes, but did not do well initially, but now, his quality has risen to the top.</p>
              <p>Alas, I always tot Anderson was the one who was supposed to be the creative while carrick is the defensive. but it seems Carrick's passing has improved &amp; his willingnes to shoot is commendable..Sadly, Anderson is not consistent enough to hold his spot, to me, he faded in/out of games and doesn't dictate it like a scholes/keano..</p>
              <p>The only regret is Owen Hagreaves. Imagine if he is 5 years younger and 2 times fitter..  Well, I have nothing against this buy but like some others, questioned whether he will turn out to be another Klebersons.</p>
              <p>Also, we do have a lot of CMs coming thru so why not give them a chance.</p>
              <p>I rather all funds are kept for tevez but it seems SAF wants french instead of Argentinan..</p>
