"He has come back and cannot play in the next game for his country on Wednesday.<br><br>"He will have treatment here and will hopefully be fit for Saturday's game against Manchester United."<br><br>Berbatov, who was linked with United over the summer and claimed the Reds had tried to sign him, has impressed for Spurs since joining in the close-season. He scored his first Premiership goal in Tottenham's only win so far this term, a 2-0 win over Sheffield United last month.<br><br>If the Bulgarian international does not make the match, Spurs have plenty of options.

"We watched him quite a bit at Leverkusen and heÂ’s a really good player."<br><br>The Reds boss believes the Premiership has an abundance of lethal finishers, and has picked out two players to look out for this season.<br><br>"Andy Johnson will definitely help Everton,Â” he said. Â“HeÂ’s a lively bugger, heÂ’s quick and always on the move and heÂ’ll get them a few penalties this season. I reckon heÂ’ll score upwards of 15 for Everton this season and will prove to be a really good signing.<br><br>"And I think Wigan will get a bit of joy out of Emile Heskey this season,Â” he added. Â“I donÂ’t think he has ever quite realised his potential at Liverpool or Birmingham, but it may be different at a smaller club like Wigan, if he could recover the form he showed at Leicester where he was the main player."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=360713" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=360713</a></div>
