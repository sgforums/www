            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has paid tribute to Alan Smith for his committment to Manchester United's cause, but insists the striker is still some way off making a return to the first team.<br><br>The former Leeds United star has returned to competitive action for the second string in recent weeks, following his serious leg injury sustained against Liverpool in February.<br><br>While the fiery Scot has been pleased with his combative forward's determination to recover from the double leg break and dislocated ankle injuries, he has moved to quash speculation that the player could be included in the squad for United's crucial home tie against Tottenham Hotspur.<br><br>He is not ready, It is AlanÂ’s enthusiasm that he says Â— if the manger picks me he will play Â— of course he would, he would play with his leg broke in two that is the type of character we are talking about," Ferguson told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"I gave at the time a realistic assessment and thought it would be September, but having seen him back in training you donÂ’t realise how serious the injury was.<br><br>"But the progress has come and he has played three reserve games now and it is fantastic.<br><br>"The thing that makes it fantastic for him is his attitude, the never say die spirit. He is chirpy and has handled the whole thing well Â— but he is not ready to play."<br><br>Meanwhile, the club's multi-million pound midfielder Michael Carrick has been named in The Reds' starting line-up for Saturday, alongside returning club captain Gary Neville.<br><br>Carrick joined United just six weeks ago after two successful seasons at White Hart Lane and Ferguson is hoping he can return to full fitness after a frustrating start at the Theatre of Dreams through injury.<br><br>"He was a lot to Tottenham, they took a chance on him at West Ham when others didn't and I think the good thing is that he has left in the right way.<br><br>"Everything was peaceful and I don't think there are any recriminations from either side. They knew the boy wanted to come here, so we are pleased about that.<br><br>"But he will start tomorrow and hopefully we will see an improvement in his fitness."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Carrick poised for United debut<br>(adds Jol quotes)<br>By Pete Oliver<br><br>MANCHESTER, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Michael Carrick will make his full debut for premier league leaders Manchester United against former club Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday, manager Alex Ferguson confirmed on Friday.<br><br>Carrick joined United from Tottenham in July for a fee that could rise to 18.5 million pounds ($34.66 million) but is yet to start a match after sustaining an ankle injury in pre-season.<br><br>The 25-year-old midfielder is now fully recovered and after one substitute's appearance for United will get the chance of an early meeting with his former employers.<br><br>"I think he will be glad to get it over with. I think anybody playing for the first time against their old team will want to get it out of the way," Ferguson told reporters.<br><br>"He owes a lot to Tottenham. They took the chance on him at West Ham when maybe others didn't."<br><br>Carrick has a key role to play for Ferguson's side, particularly following United's failure to land top target Owen Hargreaves from Bayern Munich before the transfer window closed.<br><br>United sit at the top of the table after opening with three straight wins, mirroring their start to last season.<br><br>Captain Gary Neville is set to return for United after recovering from a calf injury but Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes are still suspended.<br><br>Tottenham manager Martin Jol said: "I've had to cope with the idea of not having Michael (Carrick) for the last six or seven weeks so it hasn't been easy because we wanted to keep him.<br><br>"But he wanted to move up north and in particular to Manchester United. So when they paid us I had to let him go.<br><br>"I saw the problem of us not being able to pick a pass against Everton (when Tottenham lost 2-0 at home) and we just have to work on it."<br><br>He added: "The amount of money we received for him doesn't make me proud because I would've loved him to stay.<br><br>"Michael will continue to get better. I don't agree with people who say he isn't the complete holding midfielder because nearly every one of our attacks started with him."<br><br>Egyptian striker Mido is expected to replace injured Bulgarian forward Dimitar Berbatov and make his first appearance since joining from AS Roma for 4.5 million pounds having spent the previous 18 months on loan at Spurs.<br><br>Ledley King, the England international and club captain, returns in defence after missing the first three games of the season with a knee injury. France international defender Pascal Chimbonda will also make his Spurs debut after his 5 million pounds signing from Wigan last week.</div>

But it wasn't the most convincing display. Spurs wasted several chances, while United were hanging on by the end. However, having stumbled in September last season, Sir Alex will be pleased his players stuck to task and retrieved what is so vital at this stage of the season: victory by any means necessary.<br><br>United were out of the blocks quickest. Cristiano Ronaldo, in his first foray down the right wing after five minutes, carved open the best early opportunity. Booed by the Spurs fans, the Portuguese winger responded with some quick-footed trickery to glide past Benoit Assou-Ekotto before testing Paul Robinson with a curling low shot.<br><br>Old Trafford was bathed in bright Autumn sunshine, and it was clearly causing the Tottenham goalkeeper problems. When Louis Saha was floored by Edgar Davids 35 yards from goal, Ronaldo struck a dipping, swerving shot from the subsequent free kick, which Robinson could only palm up in the air. Ryan Giggs, who had earlier collected the award for AugustÂ’s Player of the Month, was quickest to react and nodded the ball off the underside of the crossbar to make it 1-0 after 12 minutes. The ideal start.<br><br>United faced a nervous period without the Welshman, who was forced off for a full five minutes to receive treatment for a bloodied nose midway through the half. Sir Alex was seen gesturing on the sideline that he felt it was as the result of an elbow from Davids, who had challenged Giggs in midfield. In unstoppable form, though, the 32-year-old was soon back on the pitch running at TottenhamÂ’s defence.<br><br>Michael Carrick received a regular bout of boos from the travelling Spurs supporters following his Â£14million summer move from White Hart Lane, but he endeared himself to the home fans by showing signs of creativity in the playmaker role Â– much the same position as Juan Sebastian Veron undertook at Old Trafford Â– with his varied and incisive array of passes.<br><br>Despite United's good start, it was Spurs who ended the half strongest. They could have equalised but for a fantastic double save from Edwin van der Sar just before the break. Penned into their own half, the Reds failed on several occasions to clear the danger. And when Davids flicked a pass over the back four, van der Sar first had to smother a shot from defender Michael Dawson before rushing out to block a second effort from Ledley King.<br><br>UnitedÂ’s Dutch goalkeeper was forced into another impressive save seven minutes after the break, when Pascal Chimbonda overlapped down the right flank and saw his cross deflected following RonaldoÂ’s sliding challenge. Van der Sar had to palm the ball over the bar for a corner, from which Dawson powered his header wide. Gradually Tottenham had loosened UnitedÂ’s grip on the game. And Spurs boss Martin Jol wasnÂ’t settling for a draw. His intentions were clear when he made a double attacking substitution on 57 minutes, replacing Davids and the ineffectual Robbie Keane with, Reto Ziegler and Jermain Defoe.<br><br>United, meanwhile, had hit a lull in their performance, and needed something to lift the side out of it. Ronaldo almost found it after 65 minutes when he burst onto SahaÂ’s deflected cross from the right and forced Robinson to tip his powerful shot over.<br><br>But it was Tottenham's substitute who nearly changed the game. Defoe was proving to be a real handful. His run down the right wing earned Kieran Richardson a yellow card after the United midfielder tried, but failed, to slide in and steal the ball. Then the diminutive forward rose highest in the box, but the ball ended up going over off his shoulder. Still UnitedÂ’s lead remained intact, but it made for nervous viewing, particularly as last September was the time Sir AlexÂ’s side stumbled, with draws against Manchester City and Liverpool and a defeat to Blackburn spoiling the good start to the 2005/06 campaign.<br><br>Mido was the next to threaten UnitedÂ’s slender advantage, and he should have done better with a clear scoring opportunity. He climbed above Wes Brown to meet Assou-EkottoÂ’s cross, but made minimal contact with the header and didn't test van der Sar.<br><br>At the other end, United wasted chances of their own. Ronaldo went on a 50-yard run, but his final ball was neither a squared pass to Saha in space nor a shot on goal. Saha, too, passed up great chances to kill the game off. He was played in superbly by RedsÂ’ substitute Darren Fletcher, but blazed his shot over the bar, then missed a one-on-one with Robinson.<br><br>Tottenham threatened again late on, but the Reds held out. Another three points is exactly what was required to put United back on top of the Premiership, but the performance will certainly need to improve against Celtic in midweek and Arsenal next Sunday.<br><br>Team Line-ups<br><br>United: Van der Sar, Neville (c), Brown, Ferdinand, Evra, Ronaldo (Silvestre, 90), OÂ’Shea, Carrick (Fletcher, 80), Richardson (Park, 71), Giggs, Saha.<br>Subs not used: Kuszczak, Solskjaer.<br><br>Goalscorer: Giggs (12)<br><br>Tottenham: Robinson, Chimbonda, Dawson, King (c) (Murphy, 82), Assou-Ekotto, Ghaly, Jenas, Davids (Ziegler, 57), Zokora, Keane (Defoe, 57), Mido.<br>Subs not used: Cerny (GK), Huddlestone.<br><br>Attendance: 75,453 (Premiership record)</div>

He has been a fantastic player at this club, there is no question about that.<br><br>'He will go down as one of the greatest players of all time and he is using his experience to get the best from himself.'<br><br>After seeing first Arsenal, then Chelsea strike early in previous title-winning campaigns over the past three seasons, now Ferguson feels it is United's turn.<br><br>Eleven points in front of the Gunners - who visit Old Trafford next week - eight head of Liverpool and three clear of Chelsea, Ferguson is now calling on his team to make their early ascendancy count.<br><br>'We have said in the past few years how teams have got off to a good start and never stopped,' observed Ferguson.<br><br>'The Premiership title is about sometimes playing great football, sometimes having a bit of luck, sometimes gritting your teeth and sometimes getting through by sheer determination to get over the line.<br><br>'Now, we hope to get on the type of roll which would leave our players feeling we can to it this season.'<br><br>Having lost Aaron Lennon to a worrying knee injury in training yesterday, Tottenham boss Martin Jol was proud of the way his side performed.<br><br>But he lamented the missed chances which cost Tottenham the chance to record a third successive draw at Old Trafford.<br><br>However, he apportioned no blame to Robinson, who was deceived by the flight of Ronaldo's free-kick.<br><br>'It was a terrific shot, if a stupid goal,' he said.<br><br>'At half-time I asked Paul if he felt he should have punched it but I had a look at it again on the video and the shot swerved a lot to his left, so he could not do anything about it.'<br><br>England star Aaron Lennon could be facing an extended spell on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury in training yesterday.<br><br>The 19-year-old winger, a second-half substitute in the Euro 2008 qualifying win over Macedonia in Skopje on Wednesday, was expected to be in the Tottenham side to face Manchester United at Old Trafford this evening.<br><br>Instead, Lennon missed the 1-0 defeat, with Tottenham boss Martin Jol confirming he is awaiting the results of tests on the knee.<br><br>With important UEFA Cup and Barclays Premiership assignments to come over the next month, Jol will be desperate to have one of his key men fit, as will England boss Steve McClaren as Lennon would be an automatic choice in the squad for next month's double-header with Macedonia and Croatia.<br><br>'Aaron was injured in training yesterday so he could not be considered for today's game,' said Jol, who appeared particularly downbeat.<br><br>'There could be a problem with the cartilage in his knee.<br><br>'We will make an assessment on him tomorrow, when we will probably know the extent of the damage for sure.'<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=199118&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=199118&amp;cc=4716</a></div>
