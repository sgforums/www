              <p><strong>After a long, gruelling fight for the Premier League crown,
              Owen Hargreaves is calling on the Reds to ready themselves for battle
              one more time, and clinch the title against Wigan Athletic on Sunday.</strong><br><br>Hargreaves’
              former Bayern Munich team-mate Michael Ballack claimed that, for
              United’s players, this would be “the longest week of their lives”. The
              Chelsea midfielder's claims that all the pressure is heaped on United
              are an attempt at psychological mind games, but Hargreaves isn’t paying
              much attention.<br><br>“As long as we’re controlling our destiny I don’t think we need worry too much,” he told <strong>MUTV</strong>. <br><br>“We
              are full of confidence. We believed we would beat West Ham because our
              home record is so good. Wigan have done themselves a favour by beating
              Aston Villa, so this game doesn’t mean a lot for them. But to us it
              means everything.<br><br>“We’ve got 90 minutes to play and it’s a great
              position to be in. We’ve had no midweek game so we’ve put in some good
              training and hopefully we will be ready for the weekend.”<br><br>Going
              into the last day of the season needing to win the league is not an
              alien concept for Hargreaves. Back in 2000/01, Hargreaves helped Bayern
              beat Schalke 04 to the Bundesliga crown in dramatic fashion on the
              season’s final day. <br><br>Bayern led Schalke by three points,
              needing a draw in their match against Hamburg to clinch the title.
              Schalke beat relegated Unterhaching 5-3. Bayern’s match started five
              minutes late after fan disruptions, but with 90 minutes gone and the
              score 0-0 they looked to have done enough. Then Sergej Barbarez headed
              Hamburg in front. <br><br>Over at Gelsenkirchen, Schalke’s fans ran onto the pitch  celebrating a first title since 1958. But their jubilation lasted just three minutes and 43 seconds. <br><br>Back
              at the Parkstadion, defender Patrik Andersson struck a free kick
              through the wall and into the net – his first and only goal for the
              club – and sealed the title for Bayern. Three days later they beat AC
              Milan on penalties in the Champions League final.<br><br>“To be in this
              position feels comfortable for me, I’ve been there before,” says
              Hargreaves. “At the start of the season if somebody had offered us one
              game, just 90 minutes, to win the league, we would have jumped at that.
              We’re in a good position.<br><br>“We’ve worked so hard all season. Not
              just the players, the staff, and all the time and energy everyone puts
              in at this club. That’s what makes this a special club. So for them, to
              see us win the league would be a fantastic moment. We’ll go out on the
              pitch on Sunday and give everything we have for 90 minutes.”</p>
