              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson has backed Wayne Rooney to top Manchester United's scoring charts this season after confirming he will play as a striker.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Rooney has been deployed in a variety of roles in recent years, with the England international often shifted out wide or into a deeper position.</p>
              <p>But with Cristiano Ronaldo having moved to Real Madrid, Ferguson needs to find another regular source of goals and he believes Rooney will relish the challenge.</p>
              <p>The United boss said: "I don't think the responsibility of getting more goals will affect Wayne at all.</p>
              <p>"He's got the mental strength for all that kind of thing.</p>
              <p>"He's proved that time and time again.</p>
              <p>"He will be used as a central striker this season. He goes on these bursts of goals.</p>
              <p>"Last season I think he hit seven in a row at one point - but if he can do that more consistently over the season, he will get to 25 and above.</p>
              <p>"But Wayne is a totally different type of player to Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>"I don't think you can compare them, they are such different types."</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Sir Alex Ferguson claims Michael Ballack should have been sent off in the FA Community Shield as Chelsea beat Manchester United on penalties.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>The United manager was in no doubt the "deciding" moment of the match came in the build-up to Chelsea's second goal on 70 minutes.</p>
              <p>Substitute Ballack appeared to elbow Patrice Evra as the full-back charged down the left flank - but with the United player down, Foy allowed play to continue as Chelsea broke quickly, with Frank Lampard's shot beating Ben Foster.</p>
              <p>Although the Premier League champions, who took the lead through Nani, forced a penalty shoot-out when Wayne Rooney slotted home in stoppage-time, Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech was the hero with two saves.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who saw Nani go off with an injured shoulder, believes Foy should have intervened when Evra was left flat out on the Wembley turf.</p>
              <p>"I think the referee has made a rod for his own back," said the United boss.</p>
              <p>"He stopped the game twice, first when Nani was down, then on the second occasion Ballack has gone down, which we have seen before with him.</p>
              <p>"I asked the referee, he said he thought it was a serious incident, and he thought the player needed treatment, whereas he [Ballack] was up right away.</p>
              <p>"Once he has done that, I do not understand why he has not stopped the game when Evra is lying down?</p>
              <p>"With a replay you can see Ballack has elbowed the boy, and if the referee had seen it properly, it is a red card.</p>
              <p>"The referee is in line with it, and should have at least stopped the game, but he did not.</p>
              <p>"Of course, then they went on and scored the second goal.</p>
              <p>"It is hard to blame the Chelsea players, because it is a professional game.</p>
              <p>"But it is making it very difficult for referees [to know] when players are acting to get the game stopped.</p>
              <p>"It is an area I am concerned about and we have got to find a solution to that part."</p>
              <p>Ferguson continued: "If we are putting the responsibility back on the referees and they are deciding when the games should be stopped, then fine.</p>
              <p>"He has got to be correct in that respect. As we saw today, he never got it quite right.</p>
              <p>"You have to be consistent."</p>
              <p>Portugal midfielder Nani impressed, but Ferguson revealed he could now be set for a spell on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>"We could not put the shoulder back in, so that is the worrying part for us," said Ferguson, who has had to reshape his attack following the summer departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>"He had done very well, and we are very pleased with his performance."</p>
              <p>Ferguson felt United should have put the game beyond Chelsea following their dominant first half, with defender Ricardo Carvalho eventually pulling the FA Cup winners back in it on 52 minutes.</p>
              <p>"We should really have put the game to bed," he said.</p>
              <p>"The equaliser really knocked us back, and at that point Chelsea were the better team.</p>
              <p>"The second goal was the deciding factor."</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: "We should have been three or four goals up. When you get chances in big matches and do not take them, you can suffer and we did today."</p>
              <p>For new Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti, it was a first piece of silverware in English football.</p>
              <p>The Italian coach made several tactical changes during the second half, which paid off.</p>
              <p>"We found it difficult, but we were better in the second half when we put more strength on the pitch. In the end, we deserved to win," Ancelotti said.</p>
              <p>"It was an important start to the season and now we have to continue to work and improve.</p>
              <p>"I like the mental attitude of the players and the organisation of the club.</p>
              <p>"We are now ready to start a very important season and want to do the best.</p>
              <p>"This result is important because it proves our possibilities."</p>
              <p>On the controversy in the build-up to the second goal, the Chelsea manager said: "The referee can stop the play and also the players can put the ball out.</p>
              <p>"However, for sure they did not see Evra down on the pitch, because a Chelsea player would put the ball out if they saw an opponent down."</p>
