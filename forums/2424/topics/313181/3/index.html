              <p>I thought Pique look unsure again... and not very good. On the other hand, Silvestre look really good coming back after almost a year out... Good thing he is back, hope Fergie partner him with Rio if Vidic still cannot play cos Pique really look gong gong... don't seem to know what he is suppost to do...</p>
              <p>On Neville's return... He didn't show much and had very little of the call coming on in the last 8 or 9 mins... But he looks pretty ok i feel...  Hope Rio will be alright from now on... he had 3 stitches during half-time so that he can continue.</p>
              <p>On other good points, Ronaldo, Scholes and Evra got a well deserve rest... Rooney also i guess...</p>
              <p>Last night, i felt that Fergie took a big risk but lucky it didn't backfire on him...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/m2.jpg"><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/m2.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="159"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Carlos Tevez struck as Manchester United defeated Roma to seal a Champions League semi-final match-up with Barcelona.</strong></p>
              <p>Roma should have taken the lead from the penalty spot after a foul by Wes Brown but Daniele de Rossi smashed the ball high over the crossbar. Edwin van der Sar denied Mirko Vucinic as Roma threatened but Ryan Giggs and Owen Hargreaves forced saves from Doni. And Tevez scored with a diving header from Hargreaves' cross to seal the tie. &lt;!-- E SF --&gt;</p>
              <p>The Argentine struck after 70 minutes and it was a goal that punctured any lingering hopes Roma harboured of a dramatic comeback. The Italians had been left stunned after their 2-0 defeat in Rome but, after enduring a poor start to the second leg, they showed great spirit to rattle their opponents.</p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had shown great faith in his squad prior to kick-off by leaving Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo out of his starting line-up. They were two of five changes from the team that drew at Middlesbrough on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Changes or not, United had more than enough opportunities to kill off the tie in the first 10 minutes. Hargreaves was a revelation down the right for United, using his superb athleticism to run on to passes from midfield, and he delivered two telling crosses. The first was met by Giggs while Anderson drilled a low strike from the second - both efforts drawing saves from Doni.</p>
              <p>But Roma should have forced their way back into the tie when referee Tom Hennin Ovrebo ruled that Brown had failed to make any contact with the ball while trying to tackle Mancini. De Rossi buried his head in his shirt after blazing the spot kick way over the crossbar but Roma took confidence from winning the penalty and enjoyed a spell of possession that saw them end the half on top.</p>
              <p>And after Tevez headed home another excellent Hargreaves cross the tie was effectively settled. Further good news for the buoyant home fans arrived with 10 minutes left when Gary Neville came on for his first appearance since picking up an ankle injury on 17 March 2007.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Man Utd 1-0 Roma: Leading 2-0 after the first leg, Sir Alex Ferguson decides to leave Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney on the bench.</p>

              <p>The Italians have a great chance to get back into the tie when Wes Brown concedes a penalty but Daniele De Rossi blasts it over the bar.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/cantona-3.jpg"><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/cantona-3.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="288"></a></p>
              <p>Among those watching is Man Utd legend Eric Cantona who receives a huge ovation just before the second half gets under way.</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/neville.jpg"><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/neville.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="288"></a></p>
              <p>With the tie beyond Roma, Ferguson brings on Gary Neville for his first appearance in 13 months after suffering with an ankle injury</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/088tevezDM.jpg"><img src="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u189/zomanu/088tevezDM.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="325"></a></p>

              <p><strong>PAUL SCHOLES will play his 100th Champions League game tonight.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Manchester United midfielder, 33, joins just eight others who have reached the landmark including Ryan Giggs, Raul and David Beckham.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Boss Alex Ferguson said: “He was out for 3½ months earlier in the season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“It took him a few months to get his rhythm back but recently he has been absolutely fantastic.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Skipper Gary Neville makes his comeback in what will be his 99th Champions League game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But asked if Scholes would be handed the armband, Fergie quipped: “Paul would regard that as punishment!”</p>

              <p>agree. I think at this stage, the teams that can cause us problems like the Milans, Madrids are gone, so MUFC does have a good chance.</p>
              <p>The key to this barca is that despite their attack, their defence is suspect and that plays to MUFC's strength.</p>
              <p>Henry is nothing new to MUFC's defence and to date, Barca is also chasing the La Liga so they are exerting also.</p>
              <p>Irregardless of Pool/Chelsea, they are both playing boring football and it is a shame arsenal did not get through for their endeavours.</p>
              <p>Pool is playing only with Gerrard and Torres, the rest 9 are for defence. Chelsea despite changing Grant is not playing any attractive football.</p>
              <p>I would prefer a Barca/MU final with all players fit so at least we get good football. With Chelsea, it is going to mechanic, with Pool, it is going to be boot and run.</p>

              <p>i think it is just a case of sore losers. Anyway, was quite surprised that SAF choose to rest him. But it is quite amazing the strength in depth.</p>
              <p>Cause one thing, with Evra, his aerial and physique are suspect, but with Silverstre, he is more a tank.</p>
              <p>And if GaryN get more match fit, his crosses are going to be so welcome.. but then, we don't have attackers with good aerial except Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Saha, the glass man is still injured.</p>

              <p>to me, Pool is doing the same as Milan. Pool, when they know they can't get title, rotates and keep their players soley for the UCL.</p>
              <p>If Rafa or Pool really goes for the title as they mentioned, I don't believe they would have gotten this far in the UCL.</p>
              <p>In a way, Rafa's smart, he is playing to the money and glamour of UCL. And in this way, keeps his job.</p>

              <p>in addition, i think carrick is doing well despite his low profile. His ability to keep the ball and to distribute is over-shadowed.</p>
              <p>However, i like his attitude of keeping quiet and just working hard. Hope he can score more goals like he did against Roma.</p>
              <p>It would be good if Anderson or him starts to knock in a few.</p>
