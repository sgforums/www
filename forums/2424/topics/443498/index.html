              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Darren Fletcher is taking an extended break from football as the Manchester United midfielder recovers from a serious health issue, the club have revealed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Scotland skipper, who made 15 club appearances this season, has been suffering from ulcerative colitis - a chronic inflammatory bowel condition - and is not expected to play again this season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>A club statement read: 'On behalf of Darren Fletcher, Manchester United wishes to announce that he is taking an extended break from football for health reasons.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Over the past year he has had several absence periods which we have attributed to a viral illness in order to respect his right to medical confidentiality. Darren has, in fact, been suffering from ulcerative colitis (a chronic inflammatory bowel condition) for some time preceding this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Whilst he was able to maintain remission of symptoms for a considerable period this has proved more difficult recently and Darren’s continued desire to play and his loyalty to both his club and country has probably compromised the chances of optimising his own health and fitness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He has therefore accepted medical advice to take an extended break from the demands of training and playing in order to afford the best chance possible of achieving full remission once again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We request that his privacy is respected and hope that the removal of the additional stress associated with speculation regarding his health will also aid his recovery.'</span></p>

              <p>• <strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/996071/man-utd%27s-darren-fletcher-forced-to-take-break-from-football">Fletcher forced to take break</a></strong></p>
              <p>Fletcher
               has been limited to just seven starts this season, and United announced
               on Tuesday that the Scotland international will take an extended break 
              from the game after a lengthy battle with ulcerative cilotis, an 
              inflammatory bowel condition.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils have struggled in the
               midfield department this season, with Fletcher adding to the losses of 
              Anderson and Cleverley. The situation recently forced Sir Alex Ferguson 
              to play converted winger <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8853/Ryan-Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> and centre-back <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/140032/Phil-Jones">Phil Jones</a> in the centre of midfield for their shock 2-1 Champions League loss to Basel.</p>
              <p>Cleverley
               acknowledges that the loss of Fletcher has done nothing to help the 
              midfield problem but, although the club are now missing nine first-team 
              players, he feels they have the cover they need to get by.</p>
              <p>"I am gutted for Fletch," Cleverley told <em>Sky Sports News</em>. "I'm not too sure about what it is, but I'm afraid it is bad news for him and bad news for the team.</p>
              <p>"He
               is a massive player for us and it is a shame because we are having a 
              bit of a problem in centre midfield, but we have got Giggsy, Ji [Sung 
              Park], Carrick, Phil Jones doing a job, and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/71653/Darron-Gibson">Darron Gibson</a> still in the squad, so that's what squads are for."</p>
              <p>There
               are concerns that the problem could severely hamper Fletcher's future 
              prospects. Professor Chris Probert, a consultant gastroenterologist at 
              the Royal Liverpool Hospital, said in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>: "I 
              would be very surprised if he could perform at the same level with this 
              condition. He must have been extremely fit to have been able to play for
               as long as he has with the symptoms of the condition.</p>
              <p>"It seems 
              inconceivable that he would not have had his performance impaired 
              somehow by the condition and it's no surprise that he's been forced to 
              take short breaks from time to time."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Cleverley has 
              been buoyed by Chelsea's victory over current league leaders Manchester 
              City on Monday and now expects United to turn up the heat over the 
              Christmas period.</p>
              <p>"It's blown the title race wide open but we were
               confident we'd catch them anyway," the midfielder said. "We've both got
               hard games coming up this weekend so let's see how it goes.</p>
              <p>"We've
               got great team spirit, the new players have bedded in perfectly, so if 
              anyone can bounce back [from Champions League agony] it's us. We've got a
               lot of games in a tough period, we've still got a chance in the FA Cup 
              and we're well-placed in the league."</p>
