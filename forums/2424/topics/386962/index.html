              <p> </p>
              <p>I find that Gibson is only good at trying to shoot at distance . Thats all. Maybe when he play good i'm not around too watch tat match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, he doesn't really chase the ball, or the dont have the pace to chase?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He's alertness is bad.Slow to react. And giving away ball cheap too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What do you guys think? Come lets share. =)</p>

              <p>Gibson is a terrible player. He is at best a lower table team player. Besides having a cracking shot at goal, he has no vision, no tackles, no pin point passing, no positioning etc. Without Carrick or Flecther or Scholes to mask his weakness, he revealed his true self yesterday.</p>
              <p>I didn't understand why SAF took out Anderson who was clearly the only midfielder player who seemed interested in the game.</p>
              <p>Anderson, was one of the most attractive attacking midfielder prospects prior his arrival. The problem is that he usually ends us playing as a holding midfielder or acts as Paul Scholes legs. He rarely gets chances to play as a AM. So I don't blame him. He is now getting the chances so lets see him improve slowly.He is still young. Most players mature at 25 so lets wait.</p>
              <p>Berbatov and Rooney are the worst forward pairing in the Top 4. Rooney is a good player...actually a very good player but he isn't world class. And he should quit trying to be one if he can't make simply 10 yard passes.</p>
              <p>We really need a left winger, goalkeeper and a pacy and strong striker.</p>
              <p>Legends like Scholes, Giggs and Neville should be used sparingly.</p>
              <p>Valencia was the only spark yesterday. Its amazing how much he has improved this season. Currently the only players we have that still deserve to wear the shirt - Our entire back 4 except Nev (a legend but he should  retire), MF (anderson, carrick, flecther, giggs, valencia, park), Forward (berbatov and rooney) though one of em should go.</p>

              <p>well, if you want to compare, by age, Nani/Gibson/Anderson fail when compare to Giggs/Scholes/Keano/Beckham/Butt.</p>
              <p>Gibson has a good shot, and that is always an advantage. Cause it mean tatical, he is a threat. Anderson lacks that, and while, he may be an AM, i still feels he lacks the "scholey"- quality of sneaking in and scoring goals. maybe, anderson's game is "muted" due to his DM ability, but in future, we may never know.</p>
              <p>In the Leeds game, due to the poor wings, Gibson/Anderson were pulled apart, and hence, it is not a good game to gauge.</p>
              <p>We need, one left winger, (giggs is old), two central midfielders (prefably, one creative and one keano mould), and one mobile, 25 goals a season to complement Rooney, our only brightspark.</p>

              <p>What Man United require - <strong>Forward Striker with pace and height, left winger to replace Giggs and a Goalkeeper AND a new Assistant Manager.</strong> We need a tactician or a coach and not a YES MAN Phelan. Ever since Carlos Queiroz left, the development of the kids has been stunted and we lack tactical nous that made us so attractive and deadly 2 seasons ago. When CQ was the Ast Manager, he was always sitting next to Fergie, sharing his thoughts and views or he will be on the technical areas shouting instructions. Yes Man Phelan sits behind Fergie and only opens his mouth during press conference LOL. Granted, CQ isn't a good manager but he is good tactician and coach.</p>
              <p>If Mama Diouf turns out to be a good player like Drogba or Saha, I propose a 4-2-3-1 formation like 2 seasons ago to tap into Rooneys and Berbatov strength.</p>
              <p>4 Defenders - 2 DM Carrick and Flecther - 3 Rooney, Berbatov (centre) and valencia - 1 Diouf striker.</p>
              <p>The front 4 will switch around to confuse defenders. This be the opposite of our current static front 2.</p>
