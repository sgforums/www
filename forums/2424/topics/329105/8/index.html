              <p>extract of fergie's post match comments:</p>
              <p>"But the two goals we lost were absolute shockers; the defending was very, very poor. People will think they are watching a Conference side when they see the highlights."</p>
              <p>when i read that,i knew united must have played damn bad ..ps.i didn't managed to catch the match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so now what's the problem?..slacken off cause they've won the double last season?or usual early season loss of form...cos we are usually slow starters..but we have chelsea AWAY next week,and from my memory we haven gained a point from stamford bridge for a long long time....</p>

              <p>a liverpool shot from outside the box got deflected. VDS and Brown (who was holding back Riera) went to challenge for the ball, but VDS was too late in getting a firm catch. So, he parried it away, into the path of brown. Then the ball ricocheted into the empty net.</p>
              <p>Riera was pressurising Brown, that's why Brown had to contest with VDS. Otherwise VDS won't be so panicky....</p>
              <p>2nd goal was a bit weird lah, kuyt happened to be at the right place at the right time....haiz. Maybe go watch highlights ya?</p>

              <p>Wasnt berbatov's fault.</p>
              <p>How to win when midfield was like totally anonymous?</p>
              <p>He needs service to perform, he's not Rooney and Tevez who come deep for the ball.</p>
              <p>Thats why the only thing i was worried when Fergie bought BBT was if the team would be able to adapt to playing with an out and out striker.</p>
              <p>It's been a long time since we played with one, guess both fans and players gotta take some time to adapt.</p>

              <p>Liverpool were hardworking and was willing to run and run... Anfield would always be a difficult place for United but the last few visits, United could match them for the physical play and also had some luck... The big difference last night was... United after taking the lead, decided to go into defensive mode but in doing so, gave Pool more confidence to come at them.</p>
              <p>Pool became better and better as the match progress and United couldn't keep up with Pool's pressing game. Scholes cannot cut it anymore at this level... His age make him a liability in the midfield with the style Pool were employing... Lost of Carrick made it worst as Giggs also cannot keep up with the Pool players... The only person doing the running and covering was Anderson which was not enough... Perhaps Fletcher would have been a better choice than Scholes yesterday...</p>
              <p>Now I feel United should only use Scholes and Giggs on lesser sides and also at OT. Playing away matches and in such a hostile crowd... They don't have the legs to keep running anymore...</p>
              <p>Anyway, apart from the mistake from Vds and Giggs, the referee played a big part too in this match... I personally thought that United should have had a penalty in the 2nd min for a Berbatov goal bound shot which was block by a Pool defender's hand...</p>
              <p>For all that have been said, I guess we have enjoyed our luck there for too long and yesterday's result was one I felt could happen even tho I thought a draw would have been a correct result... </p>

              <p>What are the odds of getting a penalty away from home + in the 2nd minute? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyways, John Terry always makes this kinda blocks where he will open his whole body up, normally the ball hits either his shoulder or arms, so far dont recall foul given.</p>
