              <h1>United game 'too soon' for Gerrard's Liverpool return</h1>
              <h2 id="stand-first"><strong>·</strong> Captain believes he won't be ready for crucial fixture <br><strong>·</strong> Reds must 'show more bollocks' against rivals</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/08/23/nigelroddis460.jpg" alt="Steven Gerrard" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p><em>Rafa Benítez had hoped to play his talismanic captain against United.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard has told Rafael Benítez that he is unlikely to be fit for Manchester United's visit to Anfield on Saturday and that Liverpool have to abandon their natural caution to close the gap on the Premier League's leading teams.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager has set Gerrard the optimistic target of this weekend's clash with the champions to return from two minor groin operations that caused him to miss England's World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Croatia. Benítez is desperate to have his captain available to face United given that Fernando Torres is also scheduled to miss out with a hamstring injury. But Gerrard believes it would be too much of a risk to press him back into service just 15 days after going under the knife and that he should be spared until Liverpool's opening Champions League group game on September 16.</p>
              <p>"That's a bit too soon," he said of a possible comeback against United. "I've a decent chance for the Champions League game in Marseille. I've spoken to the manager and told him I'd like to do a certain amount of training before I come back. I don't want to go into a big game only having had one session with the boys."</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether he and Torres miss United's visit to Anfield, Gerrard believes Benítez's Liverpool have to show greater ambition against Sir Alex Ferguson's team and Chelsea than in recent seasons. "Against Chelsea in the cups, we've done them more than they've done us, but in the league we have to be a bit more attack-minded to win," added the Liverpool captain.</p>
              <p>"Over the last couple of years we've gone into games against United and Chelsea very organised tactically - defensive if you like - and still lost 1-0. Have the same sound defence and show more bollocks going forward, and it could be 1-0 to us. In these matches the first goal is massive; if you concede it, nine times out of 10 you don't get back. It's important a few risks are taken to try to score that goal against these teams because it gives you such a psychological boost."</p>

              <p>But at the same time,i hope that Liverpool will lose badly,not only for this match,but also for the rest of the season,so that Benitez will wake up his idea.</p>

              <p>well, given how he is playing out of position, he is such an asset to any team if playing just behind the forwards. His drive and shooting ability are much better than even Lampard.</p>

              <p>As a Liverpool fan,i certainly hope Liverpool will win.</p>
              <p>But at the same time,i hope that Liverpool will lose badly,not
              only for this match,but also for the rest of the season,so that
              Benitez will wake up his idea.</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking,with the current Liverpool squad,they are
              never going to win anything.</p>

              <p>Dont really think it Benitez fault. Rather, its the board which refuses to release more funds isnt it? Anyway their new signings might prove useful...</p>

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Fergie sets sights on Reds record</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Prem/man_utd/ferguson_new.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="190"></p>
              <p><strong>While England and Scotland are gripped by World Cup fever, Sir Alex
              Ferguson is contemplating overhauling Liverpool as the most successful
              side in England. </strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool hold the record for league title
              wins, with 18 trophies to their name. The Anfield’s club’s last league
              title came way back in 1990 and as such Manchester United have whittled
              away at their lead during a period of Old Trafford dominance.</p>
              <p>Last season’s victory took The Red Devils to
              17 titles and a third successive Premier League crown would bring the
              great rivals level.</p>
              <p>It would appear Ferguson has mused about the subject as he has admitted Liverpool are in his sights.</p>
              <p>”I’ve been asked the question about levelling
              Liverpool’s total quite a lot since we won our last title,” said
              Ferguson. “We are on 17 now and Liverpool on 18, so maybe it’s natural
              that people will talk about it.</p>
              <p>”I haven’t placed a lot of significance on
              it. The way I see it is that, at some point, we will win more titles
              and hopefully get to the position of being level with, or better than,
              Liverpool’s 18.”</p>

              <p class="small bold"><em>READY ... Albert Riera</em></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALBERT RIERA wants a repeat of his first meeting with Manchester United when he makes his Liverpool debut.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Spanish winger completed his £8million switch to the Reds last week and is expected to make his bow in the big clash at Anfield on Saturday. Riera helped beat United on his Manchester City debut two years ago — and he now wants more of the same.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I remember my first match in Manchester was the derby and we won 3-1. "It would be perfect if the same thing happened on my Liverpool debut. Why not?</p>
              <p class="article">"It would be the perfect start to my Liverpool career. We can beat them. "It is only one match, only three points, but it is very important that we win, especially because it is at home."</p>
              <p class="article">And Riera, 26, reckons he will have the backing of a whole nation when he steps out at Anfield. He added: "I know about the rivalry. "Manchester United are the champions of England and the opinion in Spain is that they, along with Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, are the best teams in England. "But in Spain Liverpool are the most popular team because of the Spanish players here."</p>
