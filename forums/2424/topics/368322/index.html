Many of them don’t get the chance to see us very often so it’s great that we can over there and visit them."</p>

              <p><strong>Around 50,000 fans are expected to watch United's first open training session of the 2009 Asia Tour in Malaysia on Friday.</strong></p>
              <p>Supporters with special passes will see the Reds being put through their pre-season paces at Kuala Lumpur's Bukit Jalil Stadium from 10:30 BST (17.30 local), though this time is subject to change.</p>
              <p>Julian Kam, chief executive of tour organisers ProEvents International Sdn Bhd, said: "We would like to encourage fans to come early, to ensure they get to the stadium on time to catch the training."</p>

              <p><strong>'Green Soul' set Red goal</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It's a pre-season friendly for United and the opportunity to shake off a few cobwebs before the start of the title defence.<br><br></strong>But for many of Hangzhou Greentown's players, the game against the Premier League champions this month is the biggest of their careers so far.<br><br>The Chinese Super League team, who were only founded in 1999, are looking forward to facing Rooney, Berbatov and co. at the Yellow Dragon Stadium on July 24.<br><br><a href="http://www.manunited.com.cn/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ManUnited.com.cn</span></span></strong></a> caught up with the Greentown players at their Zheijang base ahead of the game, the fourth of United's <a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB2E13AA2-8F52-410B-A2C1-B842799D9338%7D&amp;categoryid=1238"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">2009 Asia Tour</span></span></a>.<br><br><strong>YORDAN VARBANOV, DEFENDER<br>How did you feel when you heard Greentown would be facing United?<br></strong>I was honoured and am now really looking forward to facing United. I did not expect to have the chance to play against a world-class team like United when I came to Hangzhou, not having had the opportunity earlier in my career in Bulgaria either.<br><br><strong>Which United players do you most admire?<br></strong>I admire Dimitar Berbatov, because he's a Bulgarian like me, but I also appreciate the defensive qualities of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand.<br><br><strong>And as a defender you may have the chance to face Berbatov...<br></strong>During the match I will be solely focused on my game, but I hope to speak to Dimi and the other United players after the match.<br><br><strong>What's your evaluation of the current Greentown team?<br></strong>We are a young team of great potential who expect to forge ahead in the Chinese Super League in the near future. And as the team progress, I personally will</p>
              <p>have more opportunity to develop.<br><br><strong>VALDO, FORWARD<br>How much are you looking forward to the game against United?<br></strong>Very much so. It'a rare for us to face a team of the calibre of United, so I will prepare well and hope to score in the game.<br><br><strong>Which player would you like to swap shirts with after the game?<br></strong>It has to be Anderson, my Brazilian compatriot.<br><br><strong>What's your prediction of the scoreline?<br></strong>It is difficult to predict. I only hope it's a great game and that I will be able to score – the result is not important.<br><br><strong>JIANG BO, GOALKEEPER<br>Do you know much about United's players? How do you see the match going?<br></strong>As a goalkeeper I know all about their strikers, but it's still going to be difficult for us to keep them out. There's a big gap between the two teams, particularly in terms of speed and reaction, but we'll give it our best.<br><br><strong>How important are your fans, known as the 'Green Soul'?<br></strong>They are a great help to us. They are passionate and follow us wherever we go, and are very supportive of our development and progress.<br><strong><br><strong>Who would you like to swap shirts with after the game?</strong></strong><br>If none of my team-mates protest and I complete the full 90 minutes, then certainly Edwin van der Sar, because we are both goalkeepers.<br><br><strong>ZHANG YE, FORWARD<br>You're the only Greentown player to have faced United before, having played for Shenzhen FC in 2007. What do you remember</strong></p>
              <p><strong>of that game?<br></strong>I must admit, I was very nervous the first time, because it felt strange to be playing against a team I had seen so often on TV. There's a big gap in quality between us. But I consider myself very lucky to be able to face them twice. Last time I came up against Darren Fletcher in the game, and hope that experience helps me to produce a better performance this time for Greentown.<br><br><strong>Do you follow the English game?<br></strong>Not many live English matches are broadcast in Hangzhou, but I watch them whenever I can. In the Champions League final, United were on top in the first 10 minutes but couldn't take their chances and Barcelona's first goal put them under a lot of pressure. But it was a high-quality game.<br><br><strong>WU WEI CHAO, DEFENDER<br>What do you hope to gain from the experience of facing United?<br></strong>My main goal is to learn and improve my game. Although I have faced other top teams in the past while playing in Hong Kong, I appreciate English football very much and we can learn a lot from the skill and spirit of the English league.<br><br><strong>You are a full-back – how are you going to stop Rooney and Berbatov if they play?<br></strong>Rooney and Berbatov are quality attacking players, so I will mark them closely and won’t give them too much space.</p>
