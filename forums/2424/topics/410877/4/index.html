              <br>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson accused Liverpool striker Fernando Torres of cheating as Manchester United beat their greatest rivals 3-2 at Old Trafford yesterday.</strong></p>
              <p>A superb Dimitar Berbatov hat-trick — the first by a United player against Liverpool for 64 years — ensured Ferguson’s team stayed in touch with Chelsea at the top of the table.</p>
              <p>But Torres found himself charged by Fergie of trying to get United defender John O’Shea sent off in the incident that led to Steven Gerrard converting a free-kick to make the score 2-2 in the second half. </p>
              <p>Despite the fact O’Shea could easily have been sent off after hauling down Torres, Ferguson said: ‘I have watched it again. Fernando Torres made a meal of it.</p>
              <p>'An absolute meal of it. There is no doubt he tried to get the player sent off.’</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson, the Liverpool manager — whose side have won just once in their first five league games — refused to be drawn on the matter, suggesting he hadn’t had a clear view of the incident.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Some of my coaches were jumping up and down but I didn’t have a great view. Sir Alex was closer to it.</p>
              <p>'I thought the referee had a good game. Sir Alex is entitled to his opinion but I prefer to talk about things that interest me. I am not a fan of game saying.’ </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>But Ferguson took another swipe at Liverpool, suggesting his team should have won by more goals. Having led 2- 0, United were pegged back by two Gerrard strikes and looked like surrendering a winning margin for the third time this season before Berbatov headed home his third in the 84th minute.</strong> </p>
              <p>The United boss said: ‘It was a game we absolutely dominated and I was saying to myself: “It could’ve been 10”.</p>
              <p>'So when it looked like ending 2-2, it would have been a travesty of a scoreline, but it was a great result at the end.</p>
              <p>‘They had the momentum when it went to 2-2, but they never offered anything did they?</p>

              <p><strong>‘This was always going to be a test. The build-up to these games is such that, if one doesn’t win, it’s a catastrophe. For Liverpool, this is a catastrophe.’</strong></p>
              <p>Hodgson disagreed with Ferguson’s assessment.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘I think that’s harsh. I thought United played well but to try and undermine our performance is harsh. Our performance was a lot better than our last two performances and I think we can take credit for the way we played in the second half.</p>
              <p>'Catastrophe? I am not sure about that. I have said all along that our aim is to get in the top four. That is our aim.’</p>
              <p>Berbatov said: ‘It was a magical day. It was special for me to score a hat-trick against our greatest rivals. But when I go home, to my kids, I am not that special.’</p>

              <p>o'shea and johnny evans are weak links. Yeh o'shea provided the cross for berba's 3rd goal but he tends to get caught out like how torres turned him late in the game. That should have been a red. His positioning was just so wrong that torres managed to turn him in the blink of an eye.</p>
              <p>evans also tends to lose concentration. He is also suspect when tracking back to man-mark players.</p>
              <p>haha and scholes is evergreen...as accurate as ever.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Referees consider a number of criteria when 
              faced with the question of the denial of an obvious goalscoring 
              opportunity. The law requires the forward to be moving towards the 
              opponents' goal - not just the penalty area - and that is obviously 
              fundamental in our decision-making process. The other criteria are the 
              possibility to control the ball, the position of the attacker, his 
              direction of movement as well as that of the ball, the distance to the 
              goal-line and the position of the defenders and or goalkeeper.<br> <br> Therefore, the referee asks himself: "Was the attack very likely to 
              produce a goal had it not been stopped by an offence punishable by a 
              free kick or a penalty kick?" It is vital that we look for the 
              PROBABILITY of a goal and not the POSSIBILITY of a goal. But nowhere in 
              law is the phrase "the last man" mentioned.</span></p>

              <p><br>Like I say again, his was going down easy totally different from intentionally trying to get or asking for someone to be sent off. But even then, it's also too unfair to him as just like week he was knock-down and the referee took no action and thought he was acting but later we saw he was bleeding from the mouth. If fact, bleeding is rather too weak a word to uesd as we could actually see blood was dripping down from his lips.</p>
              <p>Nani is a small built guy so it's very easy to get push over. There are times he goes down too easy but to be fair, most opponent knows he is the source of danger these days for United. So they won't hesitate to stop him early... Yesterday, during one tackle from Poulsen I honestly felt it was a clear foul but nothing given... Poulsen came in strong and elbow him in the rib area... I guess it was't clearly seen by the referee or the referee thought he was acting?</p>
              <p>I say again, going down easy isn't a good thing but intentionally trying to get or asking for someone to be sent off... is a lot worse.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A poor tackle is a poor tackle which needs to be punished. And a penalty is a penalty even if the offence occurs in virtually the last seconds of a match.</strong></p>
              <p>When Liverpool's Paul Konchesky brought down Manchester United's Nani with a strong, reckless challenge in just the fifth minute he should have been cautioned – of course commentators and fans appreciate leniency but it is not right in football law.</p>
              <p>Nani’s mood was affected and Konchesky’s work was done – if referees continue with this approach then the bad old days of defenders 'letting opponents know they are there' will return and players will be hurt.</p>
              <p>Howard Webb tried to let the game breathe and the game developed into a really good one but he needs to be consistent and lead this country’s 27,000 referees strongly. </p>

              <p><br> Like I say again, his was going down easy totally different from
              intentionally trying to get or asking for someone to
              be sent off. But even then, it's also too unfair to him as
              just like week he was knock-down and the referee took no action and
              thought he was acting but later we saw he was bleeding from the
              mouth. If fact, bleeding is rather too weak a word to uesd as
              we could actually see blood was dripping down from his lips.</p>
              <p>Nani is a small built guy so it's very easy to get push over.
              There are times he goes down too easy but to be fair, most opponent
              knows he is the source of danger these days for United. So they
              won't hesitate to stop him early... Yesterday, during one
              tackle from Poulsen I honestly felt it was a clear foul
              but nothing given... Poulsen came in strong and elbow him
              in the rib area... I guess it was't clearly seen by the referee or
              the referee thought he was acting?</p>
              <p>I say again, going down easy isn't a good thing but
              intentionally trying to get or asking for someone to
              be sent off... is a lot worse.</p>

              <p>Well, doesn't rolling around as if he had been shot equate to intentionally trying to get the opposition booked as well?</p>
              <p>He's gonna end up being opposition fan's public enemy no. 1 like Ronaldo soon if he doesn't cut it out. I don't think he needs this play acting in his game la, he's got the skills enough to torment any defence liao.</p>
              <p>PS : Couldn't see the bleeding. Maybe stream too blur. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I remember he got subbed out for cramp though.</p>
