            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Interview: Darren Ferguson<br><br>A United XI squad, one that could contain summer signings Owen Hargreaves and Anderson, travels to London Road on Saturday to take on Peterborough in a pre-season friendly.</strong><br><br>As intriguing will be the father and son managerial head-to-head, as Sir Alex and new Posh boss Darren battle it out for the first time. We caught up with former Reds midfielder Darren ahead of the game...<br><br><strong>How have you found your first few months in management?</strong><br>ItÂ’s been good, IÂ’ve really enjoyed it. I got here in January, but to be honest I didnÂ’t really want last season to end, we were just getting into it. But itÂ’s been good, the lads have been really good and we just missed out on the play-offs, but the main thing is that weÂ’ve set a good platform for next season. The pleasing thing has been the home form, as it was pretty shocking before I got here and that was the one thing I identified straight away and fortunately weÂ’ve done all right with that. IÂ’ve managed to get some new players in, and IÂ’m sure weÂ’ll be there or thereabouts next season.<br><br><strong>The obvious questionÂ… has your dad given you much advice about management?</strong><br>IÂ’ve not really talked to him that much about it, to be honest. IÂ’ve tried to do it my own way. I know that if I do need him, heÂ’s there and obviously it would be foolish not to ask him certain things, but IÂ’ve only had basic chats with him, nothing too in-depth. IÂ’m just trying to get my own identity, which I think IÂ’ve done ok.<br><br><strong>Do you feel like you have to go to extra lengths to be seen as your own man?</strong><br>I think you have to. Obviously itÂ’s not going to go away, IÂ’m his son and thatÂ’s never going to change. I made my mind up, you have to try and step away from it if you can and get your own identity. ItÂ’s not going to go away, but you can make it a lot easier.<br><br>Read more <a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=448641" rel="nofollow">Here</a><br><br>Father vs Son  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
