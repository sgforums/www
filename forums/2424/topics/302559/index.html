"I wouldn't disagree with the view that it would have been unimaginable to sign those four players if we had still been a PLC," said Gill.<br><br>"There is a new structure in place now and decisions can be made pretty quickly. I was on the telephone in Portugal to Joel Glazer over Nani and Anderson. He said just do it.<br><br>"It wasn't a long, drawn-out affair. Tevez and Hargreaves were, but for different reasons. "The family understand the requirement to have a successful team, playing in the Manchester United way, and they have backed the manager with funds."<br><br></div>
