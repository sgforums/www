              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>The Portuguese flier, surprisingly fit for tonight's Champions League clash with Marseille, wants to discuss a new contract and wage rise on the back of his sparkling season.</p>
              <p>But that has already been rejected and Nani, 24, has already told close friends he is considering a new challenge.</p>
              <p>He is just a year into a new four-year contract signed last March.</p>
              <p>That raised his wages to around £65,000 at a time when he was nowhere near as influential as he is now.</p>
              <p>The player's representatives now believe he should be among the top-paid players at the club.They would not expect him to get the £250,000 a week Wayne Rooney earns, but nearer the £100,000 the likes of Dimitar Berbatov pick up.</p>
              <p>But the club have told Nani's people there is no way they will be renegotiating with three years left on his current deal.</p>
              <p>Nani, who has quickly recovered from a badly gashed leg, has told friends he is interested in a move to Italy while Real Madrid have long admired him and would also be interested.</p>

              <p>Oh ya, Eden Hazard or his younger bro Thorgan Hazard. Both outstanding young talents that Fergie should tapped into. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It took Nani like 3-4 years to get to where he is now, so I doubt Fergie would entertain his request. Unless the signs of Fergie's retirement is fast in motion.</p>

              <p>To be honest, clubs are the ones that dictate your worth. Your worth is as much as your club pays you. If he thinks he is more than that, feel free to leave.</p>
