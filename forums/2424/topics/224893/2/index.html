            <div class='col-md body'>Its a great mix this current batch but surprisingly it was no different from last year's except the addition of Carrick.. But the changes were in the existing players.. They played much better this season.. Fletcher and Ronaldo in particular.. I'm guessing the training this season are wonderful.. Great team play and great pases and off the ball movement.. But one thing that seems to bother me is I think the current batch are not so fit.. Seems to be shagged out after the 3rd quarter of the match..</div>

We will leave that to Sir Alex and chief executive David Gill. They will keep it nice and private and, hopefully, we will get the players we want."<br><br>Charlton lauded the revival Ferguson has masterminded at Old Trafford in turning United into title contenders after some recent lean years.<br><br>He believes a start that has yielded 14 wins from 17 league games has set the foundation for United's title assault but Charlton knows there is still a long way to go in the race for the Premiership crown.<br><br>"For the first time we had a really good start to the season," said Charlton. "We got into matches at the start of the season whereas last year we would draw or even lose them - this year we have won them.<br><br>"We can only be judged when we win something and, as far as Sir Alex Ferguson is concerned, there is only one thing that you have to win and that is your own championship. Nothing else matters really.<br><br>"We are in a great position. We've got a few points start but we have a lot of football to play.<br><br>"There's a lot of things that will happen. People will make silly mistakes and referees will make stupid decisions. It will happen. It's all colourful and that's football."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sir Bobby Charlton was speaking at the launch of the Manchester United Opus, produced by Kraken Sport and Media, which is a 850-page history of the club and took two years to put together. </span></div>
