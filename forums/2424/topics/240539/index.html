            <div class='col-md body'>I think the match against pool, Evra din do his job properly - he has the pace but he got drawn away by Gerrard.  As a result, i saw Vidic being turned here and there by Bellamy.  Perhaps SAF employed man-marking but I would have thought Vidic was better at heading out crosses.  As a result, Pool's attack was primarily launched from the right, via Bellamy into the box.<br><br>Man U was lucky that Kuyt missed the perfect sitter.  I thought Evra should have prevented any crosses from the byline but he was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Vidic was tormented for the match.  Conversely, Gary Neville did okay on the other side, little or no cross came from there.<br><br>Vidic needs a rest i feel, but he cannot be totally blamed for the performance against Liverpool, he lacked the pace &amp; agility of Bellamy.  However, his performance against Fulham the previous match wasn't that good.  Ferdinand was a rock against Liverpool and so was Van der Saar.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Van Der Sar is very dependent and solid. If the defence collapse, we still hv him as the last wall. But he will be v stressed out.<br><br>Heinze should hv a chance to play, even as substitution. He's playing international for Argentina after all. He may lack a bit of pace, but he's got the passion and consistency.</div>
