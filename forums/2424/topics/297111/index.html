            <div class='col-md body'>Whisper it softly but have United finally learned to play without Paul Scholes?<br><br><img src="http://i6.tinypic.com/87i6sev.jpg"><br><br>Manchester United were expected to 'struggle' when talismanic midfielder Paul Scholes was injured in training and subsequently ruled out for three months after surgery in October.<br><br>There were more than a few tremors, as so much of the Red Devils success over the last decade has been subject to the former England international's displays.<br><br>With key games ahead, who would stand up to Arsenal or LiverpoolÂ’s midfield power during his absence? Who would assure a smooth negotiation of the Champions League group stages?<br><br>Who could offer the seamless transition from defence to attack, the peerless passing at short and long distance, or the thunderous goals?<br><br>The Times seemed to sum up the mood of many a United fan perfectly when they reported: "Losing such a key player for any length of time would come as a significant setback, particularly one as influential as Scholes."<br><br>Manchester United have midfielders, but the adage 'When Scholes plays, United play' still held.<br><br>Yet six weeks on, the player's absence has barely been felt, thanks to the emergence of a certain Brazilian called Anderson.<br><br>The 19-year-old summer recruit began poorly for United when he arrived, but has only become better with each match. After watching just one game, many detractors were quick to question Sir Alex Ferguson for dishing out 25 million euros. Others declared that he was two years away from playing senior team football for the Red Devils.<br><br>And yet, he was outstanding against Arsenal and earned more glowing reviews in the easy dismantlings of Fulham and Derby County.<br><br>Sir Alex is in no doubt as to the talent of his Â£17 million player.<br><br>"The boy has definitely got something special," he says. "Anderson has been absolutely superb.<br><br>"We've been delighted with him and he has proven himself to be a true central midfield player. He can tackle, he's lightning quick, he's brave and he can pass the ball.<br><br>Â“What he's got to prove is his goalscoring ability because that's something that Scholesy has always given us."<br><br>The ability to raid from deep, arrive late and punish opponents with a goal or two, seems to be the only element currently missing from the Brazilian starlet's game. A couple of thunderbolts, and he will duly be crowned Scholes' successor - surprising, considering that their styles are so different, and considering that two months ago he was still 'a big risk.'<br><br>That he is only 19 is actually a terrifying thought.<br><br></div>
