            <div class='col-md body'><strong>We Don't Fear Milan - Ferguson</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson insists a Champions League semi-final with AC Milan need hold no fears for Manchester United.<br><br>The six-time European champions are the only remaining barrier to an all-English final in Athens on May 23.<br><br>United met Milan two years ago, when they were beaten 1-0 in both legs, with the Italians far more superior than the final outcome suggested.<br><br>However, while Carlo Ancelloti's ageing team are not quite the force they were, Ferguson's side have emerged as one of the most feared on the continent.<br><br>Tuesday's seven-goal rout of Roma has established the Red Devils as favourites to make the final.<br><br>And, after detecting some trepidation during those high-profile meetings a couple of years ago, Ferguson does not believe United need be worried now.<br><br>"I am sure it will be a fantastic game but one thing is for certain, we are not going to be afraid of it," he said.<br><br>"There were one or two moments in the last game two years ago when there was a little bit of nervousness and caution about us.<br><br>"There is no need for that. We are playing a great side with a lot of experience. But we have a lot of attributes too."<br><br>Ferguson admires the longevity of evergreen defender Paolo Maldini - "how old is he, 91?" - and accepts Ancelloti's coaching prowess will ensure Milan will be formidable foes.<br><br>But, with Cristiano Ronaldo continuing to produce outstanding form, and Wayne Rooney happily hitting the Champions League goal trail again, he is confident in the abilities of his own team, although he does accept there are key lessons to be learned from their last visit to Milan.<br><br>"The last time we played them, we missed six or seven chances," he said.<br><br>"We know that cannot happen again, so the experience of our last games against them is going to be a big help."<br><br>Ferguson's is also confident the tie will pass off without trouble.<br><br>Given it will have only been a month since United fans were attacked inside and outside Rome's Stadio Olimpico, another visit to Italy has been viewed in some quarters as something to be avoided.<br><br>However, Ferguson played down the violence which erupted before last week's return leg at Old Trafford and feels there should be no problem.<br><br>"In terms of our experiences in Milan, the last time there were no problems and hopefully it will be the same again," he said.<br><br>"I didn't think there would be any problem before our game on Tuesday but there was a short spell of trouble.<br><br>"Unfortunately, it kept being repeated on TV so it made you think there was bedlam for an hour, which gave a bad impression.<br><br>"Overall, the police dealt with the situation absolutely brilliantly and hopefully the Milan police will have enough consideration to deal with anything that comes along over there."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
