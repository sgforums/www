              <p><strong>Mike Dean is the surprise choice to referee Manchester United’s Barclays Premier League showdown against Chelsea on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>The 41-year-old has been at the centre of a number of controversies this season but will be in the middle for what could be the title decider at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp criticised him after he gave Blackburn a soft penalty in their 1-0 win at Burnley on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Redknapp said: ‘As a footballer, if you are having a poor run of games, there is every chance you will be dropped. Does the same rule apply for referees?</p>
              <p>‘Mike Dean is having a woeful run of form, with a series of poor decisions.’</p>
              <p>Dean, an international referee since 2002, was criticised by Stoke City boss Tony Pulis earlier this month for sending off three of his players this season.</p>
              <p>Abdoulaye Faye, Andy Wilkinson and Dean Whitehead have all been dismissed by the Wirral official, who has shown seven red cards this season, prompting Pulis to complain to the Premier League and the Referees’ Association.</p>
              <p>United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was fined £10,000 and received a two-match touchline ban after ranting at Dean following United’s 4-3 league win against Hull City in November 2008.</p>
              <p>Chelsea’s last meeting with him was a 4-2 home defeat by Manchester City in February, when the official sent off Juliano Belletti and Michael Ballack.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="pageBreak"> </div>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/29/article-1262112-03AEAFA0000005DC-771_91x104.jpg" alt="Graham Poll" width="91" height="104"></div>
              <h2>Graham Poll - The Official Line</h2>
              <p>The appointment of Mike Dean to referee the pivotal Premier League clash between Manchester United and Chelsea is just reward for his consistent performances this season.</p>
              <p>Of course he has made mistakes - he is human - but he has not been afraid to back his judgment and make big decisions on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>On the vast majority of occasions he has been right, including the last time he was in charge of Chelsea and sent off both Juliano Belletti and Michael Ballack.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson believes the best referees are the ones with the confidence to make decisions; he is right. So far this season Dean has awarded 16 penalties in 24 Premier League games - one every 1.5 games; the average is one every 3.5.</p>
              <p>He also had the nerve to make Frank Lampard take one three times. The downside can be costly, as was seen at Turf Moor last Sunday.</p>
              <p>However, he now has the experience not to over react early in big matches, allow the momentum to build and act with strength if players overstep the mark.</p>

              <p>United must not lose to chelsea. hopefully united beat chelsea to end their title chase once and for all.</p>
              <p>chelsea got a week to rest while united travel to germany and play bayern tonight. that said, I think united players will feel very motivated to do well in these 2 matches.</p>

              <p>chelsea will go into this game with the slight advantage of being able to have the whole of this week off.</p>

              <p>Chelsea definitely have the advantage not just in being better rested but also more time to prepare tactics wise... Lotti has already said getting knock out of Europe actually help them for this match... Lotti has even mentioned that they will try to make this a high tempo match given United's players will be playing and travelling in midweek.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, they will be playing in OT, therefore United tired as they might be, may still be able to keep up with the high tempo till the end. The main thing for this match will be no important players gets injure playing Bayern... Rio, Vidic, Evra, Fletcher, Valencia and Rooney... and probably nani too... <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p><em><strong>Roar us to victory</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Darren Fletcher is calling for a choral onslaught from United fans as the Reds bid to overcome title rivals Chelsea in a titanic clash at Old Trafford.<br><br></strong>The champions lead Carlo Ancelotti's side by two points in the Barclays Premier League table. While Fletcher concedes that the Blues could strike a telling blow as they bid for a first title in four seasons, he feels home advantage gives United a platform to avenge this season's controversial defeat at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"The fans at Old Trafford are always great in the big games, so they’ll hopefully help us over the line," Fletch told <em>FourFourTwo</em> magazine. "It does give you a slight advantage but this is top Chelsea side we’re talking about.<br><br>"They’re capable of coming to Old Trafford and winning. It’s always nice to be at home, though, and having lost at Stamford Bridge it would be nice to turn that around."<br><br>While Fletcher recognises the threat of third-placed Arsenal, lurking four points off top spot, he feels Saturday's meeting pits together the two finest teams in England.<br><br>"Chelsea have led the league for most of the season, and there’s a reason they’ve done that: they’re a very strong team," he said. "A lot of the Chelsea players have experience of winning the league – albeit a few years ago – and I know they’re determined to get back to that level. It’s going to be a tough end to the season."</p>

              <p>This match could decide the outcome of the league title...</p>
              <p>I feel it's all depends on whether Lotti can motivate the Chelsea players to become a possessed team...</p>
              <p>I guess they are aware United had their mid-week match in Germany so they will be looking to take advantage and make this a high tempo game... United might be there for the taking considering Rooney is out, they travelled to Germany, and played a full CL match...</p>
              <p>Let's hope the gods will be smiling on United again and they get a goal out of the Blue and win this match... lol.</p>
              <p>This is a tough one to call i feel... Chelsea had one full week to prepare and plan while United have only 2 days...</p>

              <p> Manchester United v Chelsea – crucial but no title-decider</p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/4/2/1270206186512/Dimitar-Berbatov-001.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p>How effectively Dimitar Berbatov can fill the hole created by the injury to Wayne Rooney could determine whether Manchester United win a record 19th title. Photograph: Andrew Yates/AFP/Getty Images</p>
              <p>League championships are rarely settled by a decider between the leading contenders. An obvious exception was Arsenal's last-second goal at Anfield on a Friday evening in late May which snatched the title from Liverpool in 1989, but that game had been postponed following the Hillsborough disaster. It should have been played five weeks earlier.</p>
              <p>Tomorrow's encounter between <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> and <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a> has been billed as "possibly decisive" although it will not even be that. For while the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> trophy is almost certain to end up at Old Trafford or Stamford Bridge, Arsenal are by no means out of the running, and if the remainder of the season adheres to the pattern of the previous eight months there will be further fluctuations of form and more points dropped in unexpected circumstances to keep the plot boiling until the last.</p>
              <p>At best tomorrow's game will provide an indicator of who is likely to emerge triumphant. United would regard beating Chelsea as the strongest evidence yet that they are on course to win a record 19th championship, not to mention an historic fourth successive title. Chelsea, on the other hand, would see the completion of a season's double over United as further proof of their renaissance under Carlo Ancelotti even if the team is approaching its sell-by date.</p>
              <p>Either way, neither Ancelotti nor Sir Alex Ferguson is going to be left staring blankly into space at the final whistle as Liverpool's manager, Kenny Dalglish, did after Michael Thomas's goal had won the league for Arsenal 21 years ago. Ferguson has surely already suffered his worst moment of the week, in Munich on Tuesday when Wayne Rooney turned an ankle just as Ivica Olic was scoring Bayern Munich's winner in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>
              <p>The fact that Rooney is going to be out for weeks rather than months may have been greeted with relief by England but is likely to be of small consolation for Manchester United, who now have to prove that Alan Shearer was wrong when he declared, in a radio interview, that the striker "has been carrying United on his own at times" and without him "they would not be where they are in the league".</p>
              <p>Ferguson will now turn to Dimitar Berbatov, his second-highest scorer by some distance, to keep the momentum going at the top of the Premier League and turn the Champions League tie against Bayern around at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Berbatov's match-winning qualities are much subtler than Rooney's; he slips round to a side door whereas Rooney tends to crash through the front. It will be a bit like replacing Cannonball Kid with the Invisible Man.</p>
              <p>The reality is that the whole United team, not just Berbatov, will need to do a bit more to make up for Rooney's enforced absence. The most startling aspect of Tuesday's defeat in Munich was the way Bayern, having been bowled over by Rooney's early strike, made a conscious decision to go for stealth rather than speed as they sought to save the game, concentrating on keeping possession and only quickening up near goal. This had the effect of exposing the shortcomings in midfield which, in the Premier League, United have managed to disguise for much of the time.</p>
              <p>Manchester United are a team in transition, youth is on their side, whereas there is a touch of the old guard at dusk about Chelsea, who have a preponderance of players either in their late twenties or early thirties. For Chelsea, Didier Drogba is almost as much a talisman as Rooney is for United but they have stronger goal-scoring options and proved as much only last Saturday when they beat Aston Villa 7-1 with Drogba on the bench.</p>
              <p>Whatever the result tomorrow the Premier League needs a match of superior quality to cherish and not just another series of grim clinches. It has been a non-vintage season domestically, the interest being sustained as much by the slip-ups as the successes. When the question of who comes fourth prompts as much discussion as who comes top then clearly something is lacking.</p>
              <p>After the week's dramas in the Champions League tomorrow's game has some hard acts to follow. What a pity it has to kick off at 12.45pm. For some reason lunchtime matches produce few classics and this game should be occupying a prime spot on a Sunday, not sandwiched among the shoppers on a Saturday.</p>

              <p class="article">Hours before David Haye's heavyweight clash, the gloves are off when Chelsea visit Fergie's Manchester United in a title crunch.</p>
              <p class="article">Blues boss Ancelotti said: "I like to hurt the opposition. "United will want to control the game. This is a fight and that will decide the match."</p>
              <p class="article">If Chelsea win, they know the destiny of the title will be in their own hands. Ancelotti's side can go two points clear with only five games to play with a win and they are full of confidence after hitting 12 goals in two games.</p>
              <p class="article">But the Italian knows United will be a totally different proposition - even without Wayne Rooney. Ancelotti said: "My aim is to attack but first is balance. I don't like to concede goals.</p>
              <p class="article">"We have to show our quality and show personality and courage." Ancelotti has an impressive head-to-head record against Ferguson, losing only twice in eight games as manager of Juventus, AC Milan and Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: We want to play our football, attack and keep control of the game but it's the most difficult match to do this." Chelsea are the league's leading scorers - with the help of a 5-0 win over Portsmouth and 7-1 thumping of Aston Villa in their last two games.</p>
              <p class="article">They have netted six more than United and eight more than third-placed Arsenal. Sunderland were also hit for seven by the Blues. But Ancelotti says his Italian instincts are that defence comes first. He added: "I don't consider myself an attacking coach - I like defence. I like balance."</p>
