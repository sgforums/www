              <p>i think the destination of the title is now in the hands of spurs who will play arsenal, chelsea and man u in apr.</p>

              <p>I really hate to see United pack the midfield and play a lone striker - Especially so when Giggs and Scholes are playing with Berba upfront. 3 words: Cannot Make It.</p>
              <p>Neville should have long gone. Yes, he can cross the ball well but dont forget, he's a frigging defender! How many times has Valencia covered for him? Rio too, a couple of occasion and even Fletcher became the right back when Neville stroll back after joining the attack. Where's the sense of responsibility, Captain?</p>
              <p>Giggs has lost his touch. The first half of the season's heroic display ends after his injury. Not sure why Carrick is missing, it was his and Fletcher's partnership in the middle that makes the system work. Scholes is just too slow and ill-timed his tackles. He's lucky to not have been red-carded.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Park should stick to the front, supporting Berba, Giggs to be subbed off instead. Macheda should be on earlier. He had been left out for so long and we all know this kid is class. He's hungry so lets just feed him with Chelsea! Fergie certainly dont think so.</p>
              <p>All in all, United lost the first half and lost the game. It's Chelsea's title to lose now.</p>

              <p>agreed with what most of u'll had posted.</p>
              <p>We lost on midfield..the midfield was unable to get hold of possession.Starting giggs and scholes together without Nani was a big mistake.nani's been on form for quite a while.He is the only one currently in the team with that bit of flair and able to create openings on his own but he nv started!Park tried hard,giggs was awful in 1st half ,couldn't hold on to ball,gave away balls cheaply...valencia was stuffed out..His one dimensional play proved to be out of sorts against big sides with capable defenders..only see one useful cross from him today.Berbatov as always isn't a natural goal scorer.Rooney would have done better with the chances he has got today..a couple of headers and square balls played to him.</p>
              <p>Hopefully fergie realises his mistake in midfield selection,we need a win against Bayern..hope this dreadful run will end on wed.Dpn't make it 3 in a row........</p>

               I can't understand is the linesman's directly in front of it," Ferguson

              penalties.</p>
              <p>United had two penalty appeals turned down at Old 
              Trafford while Chelsea also looked to have a good shout when <span class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Gary Neville</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon

              <p>Asked whether Dean had 
              been affected by the comments, Ferguson added: "I don't know about that 
              but when I saw Mike Dean I did worry, I must admit."</p>
              <h5>Favourites</h5>
              <p></p>
              <p>The
               win moves Chelsea two points clear of United with five games to go, and

              <p><em><strong>Chelsea's fresh legs too much for jet-lagged Manchester United</strong></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2010/4/3/1270304451940/Manchester-Uniteds-Gary-N-001.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p class="caption"><em>Manchester United's Gary Neville has had a long week. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</em></p>
              <p>On the basis of all evidence this should have been an exalted occasion. As so often, however, a lunchtime kick-off seemed to take both teams by surprise, as if they had unexpectedly been shaken from their sleep. <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a> suffered that to a far lesser degree, but the first half was drab. Joe Cole's goal, however, was slickly constructed and delightfully finished.</p>
              <p>There will be arguments about everything else, particularly from the losers. <a title="Mike Dean had lost his normal tendency to give penalties" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/apr/02/mike-dean-manchester-united-chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Mike Dean had lost his normal tendency to give penalties</span></a>, but each team was denied in that regard. <a title="United's disgust about Didier Drogba's winner" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league"><span style="color: #005689;">United's disgust about Didier Drogba's winner</span></a> from an offside position is all the deeper because they were in no shape for this test. Even Federico Macheda's late goal for them could have been disallowed.</p>
              <p>The effort was great after the interval, but Chelsea had the benefit of freshness. It was their opponents who struggled with the after-effects of last week's Champions League match. There comes a moment when willpower is asked to take over from flair or strategy. United had none of their normal verve and even basic proficiency wavered.</p>
              <p>Paul Scholes, a masterful footballer, typified the trouble for Sir Alex Ferguson when he hit two terrible passes in succession soon after the interval. The second of them went straight out of play. His team's sense of direction was so poor in the first half that they could hardly locate the Chelsea goalmouth.</p>
              <p>The visitors were much less careworn and that was entirely natural. They had appreciated a clear week, with nothing to distract or undermine them as they considered this encounter. That advantage was, of course, highly regrettable for Carlo Ancelotti, his squad and, assuredly, the club's owner Roman Abramovich. Elimination from the Champions League by Internazionale was no part of any Stamford Bridge strategy.</p>
              <p>None the less, they had a clarity and focus here that their opponents struggled to attain in the wake of the defeat at Bayern Munich on Tuesday. It was only the ingrained pugnacity that saw United pin Chelsea down in their own area for periods after the interval. The jaded tone could not be shed and that truth was betrayed by the comparative lack of involvement for the Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech before the late Macheda goal.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney was certainly missed, but that was, in part, for the energy he always summons up when taking on a defence single-handed. Hardly anyone can replicate that, and certainly not the minimalist Dimitar Berbatov. The Bulgarian is a very fine footballer but this was exactly the wrong occasion for a languid personality. United now have to rediscover their dynamism for Wednesday's rematch with Bayern.</p>

              <p>haha no lar. there is no sentimental in football. you are as good as your last match. is gary as good as his last match? dun think so right. I also dunno how fergie think one.  last time he dun play them in consecutive matches as their legs cannot take it , so I can't and dun understand why he played scholes and gary in consecutive matches. he should have played carrick and Nani instead and then play scholes and giggs against bayern, so that they would be refreshed and recover from their midweek exertions.</p>
              <p>Carrick (29) and Nani (23) is so much younger than scholes (35), giggs (36), so play them in consecutive matches is ok what. their bodies and legs can recover much faster than the oldies.</p>

              <p>When chelsea is able to bring drogba from the bench, and MU has their top scorer on crutches, and needs to rely on a 18yr old speaks volume. of course, the officials may not be entirely blameless, but then, without a slow motion replay, what u expect?

              <p>same here la, Nani has the potential to unlock Chelsea. Yes, he may be erratic,but he does his dues defending too. But SAF decides on Giggs. Scholes was pulling the strings in MF, but over-run many times by Chelsea's younger legs in MF.</p>
              <p>Doing the same with park-berba vs Bolton and Bayern is not going to surprise Carlos/Chelsea. MU paid the prize for that sadly.</p>
              <p>Ironically,Can Pool be our "saviour" and stop chelsea at anfield?</p>

              <p>well, Pool may want some pride and having a say in the title run, though I suspect the blue juggernaut will steamroll them.</p>
              <p>well, april is the hardest for MU, and already, we got two defeats.</p>
              <p>also, read that they are trying to rush Rooney back for UCL 2nd leg, not sure it is a wise decision. Capello must be hanging on his seat, really tightly.</p>
