              <p>And the Serbian hardman was on the receiving end of another nasty injury after an elbow from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/newcastle-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Newcastle </span></a>striker Obafemi Martins.</p>
              <p>Vidic was left with blood pouring out of a wound under his right eye after the collision during United's 2-1 victory at St James' Park.</p>

              <p><em>Cristiano Ronaldo lies holding his face after a tangle with Stephen Taylor, a confrontation which continued into the tunnel at half-time </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In an extraordinary spat as United restored their seven-point lead at the Premier League summit, the pair traded insults at half-time just moments after the United forward had been left writhing in agony, clutching his face on the cinder track, following an intemperate challenge by the England Under-21 captain.</strong></p>
              <p>According to witnesses, Ronaldo and Taylor were involved in a war of words as they headed to their respective dressing-rooms which saw the World Player of the Year allegedly ridicule his opponent's footballing skill.</p>
              <p>Taylor hit back by branding the Portuguese international "ugly" as temperatures rose before Ronaldo's team-mate, Rio Ferdinand, and referee Steve Bennett, intervened.</p>
              <p>The fracas occurred shortly after Ferdinand was booked by Bennett for his furious reaction to Taylor's challenge on Ronaldo. Newcastle's caretaker manager, Chris Hughton, defended his player. "Steven's not a malicious type of player," he said. "He's a player of high energy and enthusiasm and that's what we expect from his play.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldo was going past Steven and it was probably a bit headstrong of Steven but in his endeavours to pull him back he caught him on the shoulder and I think that's all it was. I have had the opportunity to seen it again on television. Anybody that would have looked at the incident again would have seen where it made contact and he made contact on the top of his shoulder and his neck."</p>
              <p>Hughton said that he did not know if any United players had been enraged by Taylor's challenge on Ronaldo in which he used his hands and feet.</p>
              <p>Hughton did, however, speak with Taylor in an attempt to avoid having him sent off as he had been booked by Bennett. "The only word that we had with Steven was the same as we would have with anyone that had been booked in the first half," Hughton said. "That's that they have to be careful because they are only one booking away from a red card."</p>
              <p>Newcastle are just one point above the relegation zone and were also the subject of reports of a training ground altercation between team-mates Andy Carroll and Shola Ameobi.</p>

              <p>The dirty Newcastle team was trying to intimidate this United side with the over physical style of football... I think they are a disgrace to the previous Newcastle sides who played with more skill and style... Last night all I saw from this bunch was, kicking at opponents, elbowing, pulling down opponents in the box... all sorts of rubbish they dish out and the referee let them get away with it... United had 2 good penalties calls and this referee didn't give a thing... The way they set out to play, I thought they were worse than Bolton and Blackburn...</p>
              <p>In the end, I guess its very fitting that they lost by a stupid goal... lol</p>
              <p>Serve them right...</p>

              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy">United striker Rooney took exception to Taylor’s attempted forearm smash on Cristiano Ronaldo just before half-time and was overhead in the tunnel saying to Taylor: “You’ve always been a s*** footballer.”<br><br>The Newcastle defender responded with: “I might be a s*** player but at least I’m not ugly like you. You’ll always be ugly.”<br><br>They lunged at Taylor but were restrained by team-mate Rio Ferdinand as tempers flared. The FA are certain to investigate if referee Steve Bennett saw the incident and includes it in his match report.<br><br>The game had another shock as Edwin van der Sar was finally beaten after 1,311 minutes when Peter Lovenkrands put Newcastle ahead in the ninth minute.<br><br>But Rooney equalised 11 minutes later and United moved seven points clear of Chelsea and Liverpool when Dimitar Berbatov fired the winner after 56 minutes.</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Taylor: No row with Ronaldo</h1>
              <p><strong>Steven Taylor has played down suggestions he was involved in a bust-up with Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo. </strong></p>
              <p>Taylor and Ronaldo clashed towards the end of the first half in Newcastle’s 2-1 defeat at St James’ Park.</p>
              <p>The England Under-21 international appeared to manhandle Ronaldo,
              shortly before scything down Michael Carrick, and it was suggested that
              the altercation sparked a brawl in the tunnel.</p>
              <p>Taylor refused to be drawn on reports of a tunnel bust-up but claims he and Ronaldo parted on amicable terms.</p>
              <p>“There was no bust-up with Ronaldo,” said Taylor. “I shook hands with him at the end of the game.”</p>
