            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Alan Smith's aim since breaking his leg in January has always been to be fit for the start of the season - and he appears to be on schedule. </strong><br><br>The feisty forward, who suffered the double blow of a broken leg and dislocated ankle against Liverpool in February, insists he is getting close to full fitness.<br><br>"My aim has always been to be around for the start of the season and fingers crossed I will not be far off," he told MUTV.<br><br>Smith feels fortunate that, at the age of 25, this is the first serious injury he has had to endure. Which is all the more reason he will be fired up and ready to return.<br><br>"I was lucky to get this far without a major injury because football is a physical game," he added. "You realise how much it does mean to you when you come in every day and are putting in the work after being injured. When I return that hunger will be the same for me."<br><br>Smith's attitude and approach to his rehabilitation from an injury Sir Alex Ferguson described as "one of the worst I've seen" has been regularly commended. The Yorkshireman says the key was to remain positive and stick to the advice given my the medical team that have overseen his remarkable recovery.<br><br>"It would be easy to cut corners but you should never do that," he says. "I like taking part in sport anyway, so doing bike rides and things like that was fun. The good thing for me was that I had the right people in the right place at the right time.<br><br>"On the Sunday afternoon (he was injured on the Saturday) my leg was fixed and in place. You could not ask for more and from then on I had a positive outlook. I cannot speak highly enough off the way I have been treated at United. Ever since my injury I have had great feedback from everyone."<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=353067&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=353067&amp;page=1</a><br></div>
