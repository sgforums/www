Tom's going to be a great footballer, I really like him," Ferguson told <em>Inside United</em>.</p>
              <p>"I've heard the fans are starting to talk about Tom, and I think they're right to do that because he could very well be the next top player to come through the ranks."</p>
              <p>After impressing during United's pre-season tour of the United States, many had expected Cleverley to be included in the club's first-team squad from the start of the season. But Ferguson belives the decision to give him six months exposure to Premier League football at the DW Stadium was the right one.</p>
              <p>"I felt it could be hard to give him enough football," he said, when reviewing the decision to allow his temporary exit.</p>
              <p>"I think five or six months on loan could really help him. He'll benefit from first-team football in the Premier League."</p>
              <p>Cleverley, who previously enjoyed a successful long-term loan spell at Championship side Watford, has been able to make just one appearance for Wigan so far this team due to a knee injury.</p>

              <p>Gibson has also scored alot of powerpacked goals last season and that delightful chip against Scunthorpe in the League Cup this season. And yet he's nowhere to be seen in the league and europe. So will Cleverley make any difference? Hmm...</p>
              <p>Obertan should play. I'm just afraid he'll leave this January. Just like how Tosic did. Look at how well Tosic is playing. And Giuseppe Rossi. And Pique. The list goes on! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Though Gibson can score those odd power pack goals, his major weakness is his passing and winning control of the midfield... Not being able to do this well effect the whole team on the pitch. Cleverley on the other hand, though still very young but he seems a little better in this area and has room for improvement. He is a more closer thing to <span lang="EN-GB">Jack Wilshere than Gibson. And I believe this Gibson isn't that young anymore compare to these two...

              <p>And the wierd thing is, Cleverley is out on loan for experience and Fergie now claims that he is willing to give him chance while Gibson is still hanging around, not given much time to impress and thus not gaining the much needed experience for his age.</p>
              <p>I say Gibson will be sold at the end of the season. Just like Lee Martin before him, Michael Stewart, Luke Chadwick(remember him?), etc.</p>

              <p>I really think the report on Fergie trying to find the Drogba Clone is true. A clinical striker who is physically inclined to hold up ball and provides support for his teammates.</p>
              <p>First of them all was Sylvian Ebanks-Blake, a promising Reserves striker who unfortunately is unproven at the top level, sold to Plymouth. Then there was Frazier Campbell, Manucho was next, then Tevez before Bebe.</p>
