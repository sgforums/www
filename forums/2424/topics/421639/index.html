              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/11/01/330/Anders-Lindegaard-Manchester-United-FA-Cup-Fo_2556447.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p>Anders Lindegaard has declared his intention to succeed Edwin van der Sar as Manchester United number one by stating: "I am not here just to sit and pick my nose."</p>
              <p>Lindegaard realised a lifelong dream by making his United debut in Saturday's 2-1 FA Cup win at Southampton.</p>
              <p>Having moved to Old Trafford just two months earlier from Aalesund, the 26-year-old looked certain to start behind Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak in the goalkeeping pecking order.</p>
              <p>But having been selected ahead of Kuszczak - just 48 hours after Van der Sar announced he would retire at the end of the season - a meteoric rise for Lindegaard suddenly does not appear pie in the sky.</p>
              <p>He certainly does not lack confidence, having recently usurped Thomas Sorensen as Denmark number one, and he now wants his United career to follow the same pattern.</p>
              <p>He told MUTV: "I have a taste for more. Everyone wants to play at this club. I am no different. I dream of playing. I am not here just to sit and pick my nose."</p>
              <p>Lindegaard's selection ahead of Kuszczak was especially significant because the latter had started United's previous domestic cup ties this season.</p>
              <p>The Pole also recently threatened to quit the club if he was not anointed Van der Sar's successor when the latter quit.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman's fitness and the standard of United's upcoming FA Cup opponents may determine whether Lindegaard or Kuszczak will get another opportunity to impress manager Sir Alex Ferguson before the end of the season.</p>
              <p>But, for the moment, Lindegaard is simply revelling in having made an appearance for one of the world's biggest clubs.</p>
              <p>"It was one of the most enjoyable days of my life so far," he said.</p>
              <p>"I have dreamt of representing a club like this since I was four.</p>
              <p>"Finally, the dream comes true. Obviously, it is a very big thing.</p>
              <p>"All beginnings are difficult and Rome was not built in a day.</p>
              <p>"It was nice to come out of the match with a win and a good debut.</p>
              <p>"I had a moment with the fans when they hid the ball. It was very nice.</p>
              <p>"They have taken very good care of me. I owe them a big vote of thanks for supporting me."</p>
              <p>Playing behind a makeshift back four, Lindegaard was denied a clean sheet when Richard Chaplow lashed home on the stroke of half-time.</p>
              <p>But he could at least enjoy being part of yet another Manchester United comeback.</p>
              <p>"You dream of a clean sheet but not all dreams come true," he said.</p>
              <p>"I was always confident we could come back. The best thing about playing for Manchester United is that we always win.</p>
              <p>"You could say the match looked very much like the last one against Blackpool. We didn't do well in the first half. We didn't have many chances and they were 1-0 up at half-time.</p>
              <p>"But we still managed to change the picture in the second half, luckily for us. It is a very nice win."</p>
