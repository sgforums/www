              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Boateng urges Fergie to pick the kitman</h1>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p>George Boateng has urged Manchester Untied to play a severely weakened team on the final day of the season.</p>
              <p>Having wrapped up the title against Arsenal on Saturday, United now
              have no domestic concerns with which to occupy themselves ahead of the
              Champions League final against Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Hull are in a far from as luxurious position despite their 1-1 draw
              with Bolton but now know that their safety lies in their own hands.</p>
              <p>A win over United would guarantee a second year in The Premier
              League for Phil Brown’s side, while a draw would suffice should
              Newcastle fail to beat Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>"I'd like to think all the pressure is on Newcastle," said Boateng.
              "They have the tougher game. They couldn't beat Fulham at home, and
              going to Villa Park is harder than that. Aston Villa want to finish
              their season on a high. They are playing a team that is struggling and
              the game is sold out, so I would expect Villa to do their duty.</p>
              <p>"I'm quite confident that if we can get a point, we'll be okay because I don't see Newcastle winning at Villa Park.</p>
              <p>"I hope United's minds will be on Rome. Four days later they have a
              massive Champions League Final so I hope their kitman is on the
              teamsheet.</p>
              <p>"But ultimately it's about us. We proved against Bolton that our
              belief is back and the way we've played over the whole season, we
              deserve to be in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"It's an advantage for us. No, can I rephrase that? It's a massive
              plus that the title's over and done with now. But is the pressure ever
              off Manchester United? People are playing for their places in the
              Champions League final so it will still be a tough one. There will be
              no favours."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is considering throwing a 19-year-old goalkeeper who has played just once for </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> into a game that could decide the fate of </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Hull City</strong></span><strong> and </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Newcastle United</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>It is understood that, as he looks to protect his first-team players from injury ahead of next Wednesday's Champions League final against Barcelona in Rome, United manager Ferguson is considering handing young Ben Amos his Premier League debut at Hull on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Ferguson will not risk first-choice Edwin van der Sar, and with England's Ben Foster out of action for the rest of the season after a thumb injury, the United boss is also concerned about playing Van der Sar's other understudy, Tomasz Kuszczak, in case he is injured ahead of the European showpiece final.</p>
              <p>This leaves only Amos, whose sole first-team appearance was in a 3-1 Carling Cup win over Middlesbrough at Old Trafford last September. Ferguson is aware of the criticism he will receive if he fields a team of youngsters against Hull because Newcastle - who are at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a> on the same day - will definitely be relegated if United lose.</p>
              <p>He also knows that Rio Ferdinand, who has missed the last two games with a calf problem, wants to play for half an hour and that Cristiano Ronaldo is anxious for some game time as he looks to score the goals that could clinch his position as the league's top scorer.</p>
              <p>Yet both players are likely to be disappointed because Ferguson has already told his senior stars that most will not be needed at Hull and that they should instead concentrate on readying themselves for Rome.</p>
              <p>It is expected that the team United field will include experienced players such as Gary Neville, Darren Fletcher - suspended for the Champions League final - and Portugal winger Nani as well as talented young strikers Federico Macheda, Danny Welbeck and Republic of Ireland midfielder Darron Gibson. </p>

              <p><strong>Ferguson was slammed after an under-strength team lost to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>West Ham</strong></span></a><strong> when Carlos Tevez scored the winner on the final day of the 2006-07 season, thus relegating Sheffield United. Ferguson subsequently rang manager Neil Warnock to apologise.</strong></p>
              <p>But speaking ahead of the weekend draw with Arsenal that clinched the title for United, Ferguson suggested that any team he picks would be capable of winning at Hull.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I've got a fit and capable squad. I could pick two very good sides from this squad and the team I select for Sunday will reflect that.</p>
              <p>'I have to assess what's best for Manchester United, but also be fair to other clubs. That part of it is important.'</p>
              <p>He is obliged to play a strong side under Premier League regulations. Rule E20 states: 'In every league match each participating club should field a full-strength team.'</p>
              <p>Yet the rule is notoriously ambiguous and it is unlikely that the league would get involved unless Ferguson selected a youth team.</p>

              Newcastle, Middlesbrough and Sunderland have dismissed claims they could sue Manchester United if they field a weakened team at Hull on Sunday.
              
              Reports on Wednesday suggested the three clubs had held discussions as they prepare for a decisive final round of Premier League fixtures on Sunday with the highest of stakes. 
              
              Hull, who are currently a point clear of 18th-placed Newcastle inside the drop zone, face United at the KC Stadium four days before the newly-crowned domestic title-holders defend their Champions League crown against Barcelona in Rome. 
              
              Sir Alex Ferguson has already indicated he will use the depth of his squad with nothing but pride at stake for his club. 
              
              Middlesbrough, who face West Ham at Upton Park, need the Tigers to lose if they are to have a chance of staying up, while the Magpies have to record a better result than Phil Brown's men if they are to survive. 
              
              Sunderland could go down if they lose to Chelsea and both Newcastle and Hull win, meaning all three of the north-east clubs have a vested interest in the side Ferguson sends out. 
              
              However, each were quick to deny they are ready to go to the courts on the basis of Premier League rules which require member clubs to field full-strength teams. 
              
              A Newcastle spokesman said: "There's no truth in it whatsoever." 
              
              Sunderland refused to comment on the story, but insisted there was no foundation to it, while a Boro spokesman said: "It's not true, it's nonsense." 
              
              Newcastle boss Alan Shearer was asked about the kind of side he expected Ferguson to field at Hull in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's 1-0 home defeat by Fulham. 
              
              He said: "Alex, when he has been in that position, has always put out a side that does his club proud, so whoever he puts out, Manchester United are that professional so they will go out and try to win that game. 
              
              "I have not got any problems with that." 
              
              Ferguson has hinted that England defender Rio Ferdinand could yet play at the KC Stadium as he attempts to prove his fitness ahead of the Champions League final. 
              
              The 30-year-old has missed the club's last three games with a calf injury, but could be involved at the weekend. 
              
              Ferguson said: "I am hoping he will be fit for Sunday - if not, he is doubtful for Wednesday, that is for sure. 
              
              "I think he needs a game going into the Champions League final because him having not played for three weeks is too much."

              <p>well, so if MU fields a 1st team, but puts in a 10% effort, it is all clear??</p>
