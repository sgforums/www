There is no deal being done.<br><br>"He wants to move on. He knows that Atletico Madrid have invested lots of money in Sergio Aguero, about Â€26million euros.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Times July 08, 2006<br><br>Torres tops list as Ferguson lines up summer targets<br>By Oliver Kay<br><br>SIR ALEX FERGUSON, the Manchester United manager, is preparing a bid to replace Ruud van Nistelrooy with Fernando Torres, the Spain forward who emerged as one of the stars of the World Cup finals.<br>United have yet to make a significant addition to their squad this summer, prompting concerns among supporters about their prospects of competing in the transfer market under the ownership of the Glazer family, but Ferguson hopes to be given permission next week to proceed with a bid to sign Torres from AtlÃ©tico Madrid. He is also confident that a breakthrough will be reached in negotiations with Tottenham Hotspur over Michael Carrick, the England midfield player.<br><br>Torres will not come cheap, with his three goals for Spain in the group stage in Germany having strengthened AtlÃ©ticoÂ’s desire to keep him. Enrique Cerezo, the clubÂ’s president, has claimed that the 22-year-old cannot leave for less than the Â£41.4 million buy-out clause stipulated in his contract, but sources have indicated that CerezoÂ’s resolve may be severely tested if he receives an offer in the region of Â£ 25 million from United, Real Madrid, AC Milan or any of the other clubs in the frame.<br><br>UnitedÂ’s transfer plans have been thrown into some confusion since it became apparent that Cristiano Ronaldo is pursuing a move to Real, but they maintain that the Portugal winger is going nowhere. By contrast, they are increasingly hopeful of securing a deal for Van Nistelrooy after he fell out of favour with Ferguson last season. Bayern Munich have confirmed their interest in the Holland forward and are believed to be preparing a formal bid, albeit one significantly short of UnitedÂ’s Â£15 million valuation. Real have also expressed a vague interest.<br><br>Negotiations over Carrick have not progressed since United made a second offer of about Â£12 million three weeks ago, but a breakthrough is expected once Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, returns from holiday. Ferguson hopes to sign a ball-winner to play alongside Carrick in midfield, but after exploring options such as Mahamadou Diarra, Javier Mascherano, Marcos Senna and Didier Zokora Â— the latter too late to stop him joining Tottenham from Saint-Etienne Â— uncertainty remains over that position.<br><br>United have also inquired about Tomas Kuszczak, the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, after allowing Tim Howard to join Everton on loan.<br><br><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-2260848,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-2260848,00.html</a></div>

Petit, who scored an own goal as Portugal finished fourth at the World Cup, admits a move to the Premiership is no longer an option. He said: "Manchester United?

It is certain that I will stay there."<br>Gavin Glicksman, The Sun<br><br><strong>Unforgiven</strong><br>Ruud van Nistelrooy is ready to turn his back on the riches of Real Madrid - because Cristiano Ronaldo is heading there. The United striker has told Bayern Munich that he is prepared to ignore the overtures of the Spanish giants, and instead make a shock move to the German champions. Van Nistelrooy famously had a training ground bust-up with Ronaldo that seems to have effectively forced him out of Old Trafford, and he will refuse the chance to team up with the Portuguese winger again.<br>David Maddock, Daily Mirror<br><br><strong>Queiroz Sent To Retrieve Ronaldo</strong><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has sent United No.2 Carlos Queiroz on a last-ditch mission to persuade Cristiano Ronaldo to return to Old Trafford. Queiroz is so close to the winger that United players jokingly refer to him as Ronaldo's Dad, and Ferguson is banking on their relationship to heal the rift caused by the fallout over Wayne Rooney's red card in England's quarter-final defeat to Portugal.<br>Peter Edwards &amp; John Edwards, Daily Mail<br><strong><br>Fergie Chases Owen</strong><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has rekindled his interest in Owen Hargreaves in a move that has given Bayern Munich fresh hope of signing Ruud van Nistelrooy.

            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United have agreed a deal with Atletico Madrid for striker Fernando Torres according to reports from Spain. The Spanish striker will join the club for an estimated fee of Â£24 million.<br><br>Torres made his debut for AtlÃ©tico de Madrid in the Vicente CalderÃ³n Stadium on May 27, 2001, against Leganes and he scored his first goal for the club the following week, in a game against Albacete.<br><br>In March 2006, the Spanish striker said it was confirmed to him by AtlÃ©tico chiefs that Newcastle United had made a bid for him, which was subsequently rejected.<br><br>At his first ever appearance in a FIFA World Cup Finals match, Torres scored with a spectacular volley helping Spain beat Ukraine. In the second group match Spain rallied from a 0-1 deficit against Tunisia to win 3-1.<br><br>Torres scored in the 76th minute for Spain to take the lead 2-1 and then again from a penalty kick in the 90th minute. He was subsequently given a much-needed rest in Spain's third group match against Saudi Arabia, entering the game only to substitute JosÃ© Antonio Reyes in the 70th minute.<br><br>As Torres walked onto the field the crowd roared with excitement, showing just how popular he is among Spanish fans. Having managed to score 3 goals in the tournament, Torres is one of the leading goal scorers in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He was also the first player to score 3 goals in the tournament. Torres started the round of 16 matches against France, but after initially taking the lead, Spain went on to lose 1-3 and were knocked out of the tournament.<br><br><a href="http://www.talksoccer.net/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1152742108&amp;archive" rel="nofollow">http://www.talksoccer.net/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1152742108&amp;archive</a></div>
