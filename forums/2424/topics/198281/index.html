            <div class='col-md body'>Simao Sabrosa? I prefer Joaquin if that is possible. Even better, get that Dutch youngster Romeo Castelen. Highly skillful. 20m for Torres not possible. Don't think he will be let go by A.Madrid for just 20m. Maybe can try to get Hargreaves also? I think he's not bad playing that DM role for England.. Wasted lose out on Cicinho deal last time.. Is Evra gonna be any good? In FM he is good. Lets hope he is good.. Man U defence not too bad.. Centre Midfield is a disapointment.. Who you guys think Man U should get for Centre Midfield? Park Ji Sung not too bad..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two Premiership clubs - possibly Arsenal and Manchester United - are in the running to sign Ghana hero Stephen Appiah, according to his agent.<br><br>The Fenerbahce midfielder, who won many admirers after his impressive displays during the World Cup, is now being linked with a high-profile move away from Turkey, with England's top flight the preferred destination.<br><br>The Gunners and United both seem likely options for the former Juventus man, who has turned down chances to join Portsmouth and Middlesbrough in the past, with both clubs desperate for a commanding central midfielder.<br><br>But although his agent Frank Trimboli did not reveal which clubs are interested in the Â£7million-rated 25-year-old, he insisted the main Premiership suitors had both qualified for the Champions League.<br><br>"Stephen's performances at the World Cup attracted a lot of interest. There are three or four clubs serious about signing him, but probably only two who have a chance," Trimboli told the Daily Express.<br><br>He added: "Stephen wants to play in the Premiership and I'm sure one day he will. He has been in Europe for 10 years and wouldn't have any problem with the English game."<br><br><a href="http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1778_1319144,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1778_1319144,00.html</a></div>

And that could see him eventually succeed the Scot.<br><br>Fergie is a long-standing friend and huge admirer of the former Juventus manager.<br><br>He once said of the Italian: Â“Just looking into his eyes is enough to tell you heÂ’s in command of himself and his professional domain.Â”<br><br>Ferguson, 64, is expected to relinquish the reins after 20 years in charge at the end of the coming season. Italian sources believe Lippi, 58, could either work in tandem with the United supremo or under him Â— with Fergie promoted to general manager.<br><br>A source close to Lippi said: Â“He is not looking for a lucrative contract since he has achieved success at the highest level. And working abroad is the only thing that interests him.<br><br>Â“He will not find it diminishing to work either alongside or under another manager.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Appiah is a good choice!<br>He never show his true potential when he was at Juventus cos the coach doesn;t play him that often. Subsequently he was offloaded to Fenerbahce becos of the arrival of Patrick Vieira.<br>I hope he realises his worth at United.<br>And please! No Gattuso! He sucks!<br>He belongs to the "brainless" group of players, always committing fouls and plays ugly football.
