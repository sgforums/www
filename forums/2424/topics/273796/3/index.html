Steve Bennett sent him off at City [in January 2006] and he will have loved the opportunity to send him off again.<br><br>"Cristiano was simply responsible for falling into a trap of intimidation. It happened to him a few times during the game and he's only himself to blame. It left us with ten men and now we're going to miss him for three games. It's a big blow.<br><br>"You get provoked and you have got to have the calmness to just remind yourself you're a better player than these players and that is why they are doing it," he said. "He has fallen into the trap and paid the penalty for it.<br><br>"[If you react] you have no recourse. For instance, Paul Scholes last season against Liverpool raised his hands, he didn't touch the player, but he was given three matches for that."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i saw the match highlights. i think man utd played rather well, just that they din convert their chances. much like the reading game.<br><br>so all in all, just not having the luck of scoring the winning goals. now that rooney and ronaldo are out, have to rely on tevez liao.... think he is settling in. hope they have better luck against man city</div>
