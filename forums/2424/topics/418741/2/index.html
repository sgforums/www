              <p>Neville should be graceful enough to finally call it a day. Cant defend, runs as fast as my neighbour's toddler. My heart was literally at my mouth while he stayed on the pitch. I cant recall him having a good match recently while he played. That stupid handball that presented Bayern with a freekick that was eventually scored by Ribery is still fresh on my mind and today he's just really really lucky.</p>
              <p>I've no idea why United ended the match with 4 central midfielders playing together.</p>
              <p>I thought Obertan was better on the wings than Gibson. Gibson is really useless on the wings and he cant even control the ball properly! Anderson on the left?! He looked so lost throughout the entire match. He's a box-to-box dynamo player so why is he doing in the wings?!</p>
              <p>Fabio was rusty, unlike his brother Rafael whom I feel is rightfully the best Right-Back at United at the moment.</p>
              <p>Rooney's hobbling was a worrying sight and his fighting spirit is damn ups. Hopefully it's nothing serious. Thumbs up!</p>
              <p>Well, even if United didnt play well, the 3 points is still in the bag, lady luck must be smiling.</p>

              <p>yeh i thought fabio was a little shaky. Rafael shd be the first choice right back but perhaps his legs are too young and fergie wants to stretch him for the season.</p>
              <p>Obertan was quite crappy really....most times just that pace and shimmy here and there. He hasnt got that many accurate crosses into the box for a winger. Gibson is going to follow in the footsteps of the likes of bardsley, richardson, higgingbotham etc soon.</p>

              <p>He stepped on the Boss' foot earlier this season and Fergie is a petty man. See how he deals with Preston when his son got sacked? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And since Brown's contract is up in a couple of months' time, he'll probably leave United at the end of the season.</p>

              <p>United were very lucky last night to take all 3 points but then again, I kind of think it levels out from the Birmingham match... lol... Cos in that match, they didn't deserved to draw, it should have been a win there but in a last min free-kick or something there was not only a foul on Rio getting to the ball but also a handball to get it to the player who eventually scored for Birmingham. So, I guess it even out in some way... lol...</p>
              <p>On another note, United seems like they don't have enough quality players to rotate this time... And the likes of Fletcher, Carrick and Anderson isn't totally bad but last night's match was their 3rd in 6 days... Of course the lost of Valencia, Nani, Park, Scholes and Hargreaves have seriously damage their midfield too...</p>
              <p>On the transfer window, I think it's quite tricky cos Nani could be back on Tue and maybe Scholes too not too sure whats wrong with him, didn't came across any news about their injury... Park could be back by the 3rd week of Jan or 1st week of Feb depends on how Korea does in the Asian Cup but their final is on the 29 of Jan. Then there is Valencia and Hargreaves... If they could make it by March, I guess it would be consider as a bonus... </p>
              <p>Yesterday was a good 3 points to take given the WB player shoot his penalty way off... lol.</p>

              <p>whatever happened to O Shea or Wes Brown?</p>
              <p>I cant believe I am seeing Gary Neville playing? his days as top class, never mind second or third rate player was over a few seasons ago. it is better he retire than to see a slower, lack of pace and 4th rate right back for united. surely fergie can see gary was done as a top player in 2005 or 2006.</p>
              <p>I hope I dun see gary play in the latter stages of the season, such as the CL or against top of the table clash with man city, arsenal or chelsea. I rather evans play in an unfamiliar position as right back than see gary's pathetic performance in a united shirt.</p>
              <p>sure he has experience and leadership qualities, but physically he was done and he cant be fergie eyes and ears on the pitch now. if scholes were to be like gary, I rather scholes retire gracefullly than to see his pathetic performance on the pitch. you are as good as your last match, so may I ask when was your last good perfornance on the pitch? not that I can remember he played well for the last 3 seasons.</p>

              <p>you are as good as your last match, so when was your last good match for man united? 2006 season, that was like 4 years ago.</p>

              <p>United need to build up a lead of at least 5 to 7 points by March cos they have some very difficult away matches coming up and we all know this season they haven't done well away from home...</p>
              <p>Away matches to Spurs, follow by Chelsea and Liverpool in the first 5 days of March, then Arsenal in April... These are potentially very difficult matches considering their present away form...</p>
              <p>So, I feel United need to have a lead of around 7 points to have a chance... Arsenal is looking dangerous and with no serious injury concerns, they are a real threat if they don't shoot themselves in the leg again like the usually do from Feb onwards... City too are looking stable and have a very good squad to take them to the end...</p>
              <p>United's most important strength is, if they can manager to keep Rio and Vidic fit all the way... They have a good chance come May.</p>

              <p>I think most of home matches are tough as those teams had drawn with Man U during reverse fixture. (Except that Man U will win Fulham, Everton, Birmingham) A Villa and Man City consider as a tough opponent. Man U can trounce Chelsea at OT.</p>
              <p>Man U will have more away wins since they had beaten those opponents in the reverse fixtures at OT. Spurs lost to Man U 3-1 last time. So should not have any problem for Man U to win again. Pool, hard to say. Unless they produce lacklusture performance against Man U (which will be impossible) Suspect Wolves will threaten Man U again just as the 2-1 dignity loss. They almost get a stunning draw. The rest, all can clear bahx. Man U can get at least a draw at Anfield &amp; Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>So, no problem for Man U to win BPL again!!!</p>

              <p>2nd half of the season i wonder how the team would cope.Seriously if not for Fergie,give other manager this kind of midfield,we would have lost like 4-5games by now.Just recall all the away games that we have literally SCRAPE thru every1 of them including the only 2 away 2-1 wins at stoke &amp; WBA.</p>

              <p>I think most of home matches are tough as those teams had drawn
              with Man U during reverse fixture. (Except that Man U will win
              Fulham, Everton, Birmingham) A Villa and Man City consider as a
              tough opponent. Man U can trounce Chelsea at OT.</p>
              <p>Man U will have more away wins since they had beaten those
              opponents in the reverse fixtures at OT. Spurs lost to Man U 3-1
              last time. So should not have any problem for Man U to win again.
              Pool, hard to say. Unless they produce lacklusture performance
              against Man U (which will be impossible) Suspect Wolves will
              threaten Man U again just as the 2-1 dignity loss. They almost get
              a stunning draw. The rest, all can clear bahx. Man U can get at
              least a draw at Anfield &amp; Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>So, no problem for Man U to win BPL again!!!</p>
