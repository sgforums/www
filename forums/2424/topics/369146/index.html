              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov has admitted he expects to do better for the Red Devils ahead of the start of the new season.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson splashed out a club record £30.75million to lure the Bulgarian north from Tottenham last summer.</p>
              <p>Although Berbatov was good in patches, finding the net on 14 occasions, largely his debut campaign for the Old Trafford outfit has been written off as a disappointment.</p>
              <p>In fact, failing to make the starting line-up for the Champions League final defeat to Barcelona in Rome led some to suggest Berbatov might be sold on, less than 12 months after his arrival.</p>
              <p>Yet it seems Ferguson has certainly not lost faith in Berbatov's silky skills.</p>
              <p>If anything, the 28-year-old is now an even more important figure for the Red Devils given Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez have left for pastures new.</p>
              <p>It just increases the pressure a notch, not that the ultra laid-back Berbatov has ever given any indication of being affected by such trivialities.</p>
              <p>However, he does concede the need for improvement. And he expects it to come.</p>
              <p>"I think I can do better," he told MUTV. "I think I can do more. That's why I am happy to be here on the pre-season tour.</p>
              <p>"It is always beneficial to start well and have a good pre-season and I feel I am training well at the moment.</p>
              <p>"I am here to score goals and I hope to score more and more for United this season."</p>
              <p>Berbatov has yet to open his account on a tour that, after two matches against a Malaysian outfit, now sees United tackle FC Seoul on Friday in a game where Park Ji-sung will undoubtedly be the centre of attention.</p>
              <p>Given Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Federico Macheda have all found the target, Berbatov is playing catch-up in the personal scoring duels.</p>
              <p>Yet, as Ryan Giggs knows only too well, for United life at the moment is about getting used to operating without the talents of Ronaldo and Tevez.</p>
              <p>The departed duo were major inspirations behind United's Champions League-winning campaign two seasons ago. And while Tevez ultimately left in bad-tempered fashion, annoyed at his lack of first-team opportunities, Ronaldo was also a key figure in a third straight Premier League title last term.</p>
              <p>However, in his 18 years as a United regular, Giggs has seen countless stars come and go. On each occasion, the Red Devils have responded in the perfect manner.</p>
              <p>And the Welsh veteran can see no reason why it should be any different this time round.</p>
              <p>"Since I came into the team the likes of Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Eric Cantona, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Roy Keane and David Beckham have left the club," he said.</p>
              <p>"But that is what the manager is so good at - reshaping and re-energising the team.</p>
              <p>"Carlos and Cristiano were great players but we move on. As players it's like ships in the night. You just get on with it."</p>
