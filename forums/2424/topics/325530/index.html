              <h1>Pique Urges Fletcher To Leave United</h1>
              <h2>Former Manchester United Gerard Pique defender has suggested that Darren Fletcher must leave the club if he wants regular football, according to the Sunday Mail.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/27291_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="174"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Pique left United this summer and re-signed for Barcelona having struggled to force his way into the first team at Old Trafford. Pique made only five league starts last year as he found his place in the side blocked by Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.</strong></p>
              <p>However, Pique admitted that leaving Manchester United didn’t necessarily have to be a step down. He said: “I have shown you can leave United and go to another big club. I was happy at Old Trafford but wasn’t playing as much as I wanted.”</p>
              <p>Pique went on to reveal that he had only left the club due to his lack of first team action but admitted that the depth of talent at Manchester United meant that opportunities were limited.</p>
              <p>“The problem at United now is they have the best players in the world,” he said before adding, “In every position good players are fighting for a place and it’s difficult for some of the guys.”</p>
              <p>The Barcelona defender then went on to speculate over Darren Fletcher who remains on the fringes at the club and Pique went on to suggest that it might finally be time for the player to move on.</p>
              <p><strong>Time's Up</strong></p>
              <p>“He’s a great player but at United he’s up against Owen Hargreaves, Michael Carrick and Paul Scholes,” he said before admitting, “If Darren wants to play every game he has to accept his time at United may be over. He has the quality to go to another massive club.”</p>
              <p>However, despite suggesting Fletcher’s United career may be over,  Pique did reveal that he thought Fletcher still had a promising future ahead of him. He confessed: “I’m not sure what he wants to do. He can either stay and accept being involved in just 25 or 30 games a season or be a main player for another team.”</p>
              <p>Fletcher has been at United since joining as a trainee in 2000 and this may be one factor which makes it hard for him to leave, a fact Pique acknowledged: “Darren has been there a long time and sees it as home so it’s a hard decision for him.”</p>
              <p>Whilst a number of clubs have been linked with a move for the Scottish midfielder, Pique suggested he had a good idea where Fletcher may suit best. He revealed:  “He’s a real fighter and has never let the club down. I know Everton are interested and they are close to Manchester so maybe it’s right for him.”</p>

That match against Bolton where he went for a ball that wasn't his to begin with and out jump every one and thing even the ball... In the end, the ball landed nicely on Anelka's feet for him to turn and score and won that match for Bolton...</p></div>
