It would be unbelievable.<br><br>"Everyone knows what it means to the club, the [Sir Matt] Busby era and what happened at Munich."<br><br>The 33-year-old hopes to add the Champions league to the trophy the club won in 1999 and feels they have been close on several occasions since but have lacked the necessary luck.<br><br>United went out at the semi-final stage to eventual winners AC Milan last season.<br><br>Giggs said: "We have been so close since we last won it and we just have not gone that extra step.<br><br>"We have either not been good enough or we have had injuries, or not had that little bit of luck that maybe we got in 1999."<br><br>The Welshman says the Munich crash forms a large part of United's history and that every player who signs for the Red Devils is aware of the club's past and how important it is to the supporters.<br><br>Sir Bobby Charlton was one of the players who survived the crash and went on to play a record 759 times for United.<br><br>Giggs, who has been at the club since he was 17, is just 44 appearances behind Charlton and could surpass the Englishman's achievement at some point this season.<br><br>However, Giggs is reluctant to talk about breaking the record.<br><br>"I don't really like talking about overtaking Sir Bobby's appearances record because it might never happen," he said.</div>
