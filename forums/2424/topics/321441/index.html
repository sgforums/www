              <p> </p>
              <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to manage at the highest level one day - and remain with Manchester United. Solskjaer's twin targets lead to the obvious conclusion the Norwegian has designs on Sir Alex Ferguson's job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the ambition may be some way off being realised Solskjaer has time on his side and will begin the journey by taking charge of United's reserve team next season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I do have ambitions to go into management. I want to stay in the game and I want to stay at this club,' he said. 'But it is just about taking one step at a time. I was very good at that as a player and I don't want to jump into a job before I am ready for it.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solskjaer feels the reserve team job, where he will be assisted by Warren Joyce following his return from Royal Antwerp, should suit him perfectly and, using Roy Keane as an example, denies it has come too early.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I am not really surprised - I thought that maybe the reserve team was somewhere the club would like to put me,' he said. 'It is the perfect job for me because I know the kids well and Roy Keane didn't finish that much before me and look at what he is doing at Sunderland.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keane's appearance at Old Trafford as Black Cats boss last September marked the end of Solskjaer's career after finally accepting the inevitable after long-standing knee problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He gets the chance to officially say goodbye to the fans who still adore him on August 2 when he makes his farewell appearance in a testimonial against Espanyol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solskjaer has already pledged part of the proceeds to Unicef-backed school building projects in Africa, a further example of his willingness to use his name to help others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I always say football is the most important thing that is not important in life,' he said. 'As a footballer, you can create memories and happiness. If you build a school you can help change lives.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 35-year-old also revealed he never considered leaving Old Trafford during his playing career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I never fancied going. The only time it was even an issue was when the club accepted a bid for me from Tottenham in 1998,' he added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I went to see the gaffer but he said 'I didn't accept it, I want you here and you will play a big part in my squad'. I just thought that is good enough for me I will stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'My agent was not very happy with me because I was so stubborn but nowadays even he admits I was right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The thing is, Manchester United always fitted me quite well. And I will be remembered as an important member of the team during a period when Manchester United has been very successful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I can see now that I will always be in the history books. That makes me very proud</p>
              <p> </p>
