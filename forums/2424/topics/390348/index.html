              <h3>RIO FERDINAND and Nemanja Vidic have been paying secret visits to a specialist sports clinic to save their Manchester United careers.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The defensive duo have been making regular trips to the Blackberry Clinic in Milton Keynes, which proudly boasts it's "the last resort".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ferdinand has only just returned to the United team after spending three months on the sidelines with a mystery back injury.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vidic has been struggling with a calf problem and has not played for the club since December 30.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pair have been travelling to Milton Keynes together by train for weeks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United turned to the Buckinghamshire clinic for help after club physios struggled to find a solution to Ferdinand's long- standing back problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Blackberry Centre, which has been established for more than 20 years, specialises in the treatment of back, neck and joint pains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clinic director Simon Petrides is a musculoskeletal physician and has been overseeing their star clients' progress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "My greatest satisfaction is treating patients who perceive us as the last resort, then wish they had come much sooner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The sooner you seek treatment, the more beneficial the outcome."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United have placed their faith in a centre that is convinced its forward-thinking methods work and claims to have some of the best skeletal and muscular physicians in the world working for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Petrides uses a variety of methods including manipulations, injections and epidurals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He also refers patients to the clinic's team for a rehabilitation procedure that includes pilates sessions to aid recovery.</p>
              <p>It appears to be working. Ferdinand, who has been plagued by back trouble all season, finally returned to the United team for the 4-0 victory over Hull on January 23.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vidic has been having problems with his calf for some time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He pulled out of United's FA Cup third round tie against Leeds in the warm-up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That led to a fiery exchange between the central defender and manager Sir Alex Ferguson over the seriousness of the injury. Vidic, however, is still struggling to shake off the problem and is continuing to have treatment at the Blackberry Centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite being named on the bench for United's clash with Manchester City in the Carling Cup, he did not make it for the 3-1 victory at Arsenal last weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vidic is one of a number of players sweating on their futures at Old Trafford and the club have yet to open talks on a new contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His current deal ends in summer 2012 and it is now approaching decision time for Ferguson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vidic's relationship with the manager has been put to the test this season and the United chief is considering moving the big Serbian on in the summer.</p>

              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24529"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nemanja Vidic</span></a> has stressed his commitment to Manchester United and rejected rumours he is set to join Real Madrid this summer.</p>
              <p>There has been growing speculation that Vidic could leave for Spain at the end of the season and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> did little to dampen the speculation this week when he said: "A lot of clubs want to buy our players and we have to deal with that situation."</p>
              <p>However, Vidic has completely rejected any suggestion he has made contact with any other clubs and insists he fully intends to see out his contract at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"I repeat for the hundredth time: I have a contract with Manchester United until the summer of 2012 and I want to stay at Old Trafford until the last day," he told <em>Vecernje Novosti</em>. "The rest of the stories are without basis.</p>
              <p>"I have made a career in Manchester and I respect that fully. No one has contacted me and I have not spoken to anyone."</p>
              <p>Vidic has not featured for United since December but he believes he has now overcome his problems and is ready to return to action.</p>
              <p>"I am healthy," he said. "I feel strong and I believe I can return in full."</p>

              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed Rio Ferdinand will not be fit enough to captain England against Egypt at Wembley next Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand was expected to lead his country after inheriting the armband from John Terry following the Chelsea star's well-publicised personal problems.</p>
              <p>But after the 31-year-old felt a twinge in his back ahead of Manchester United's victory over West Ham on Tuesday, Ferdinand has now been consigned to the sidelines for a couple of weeks.</p>
              <p>"He won't be fit for the England game," said Ferguson. "That is obvious."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's Steven Gerrard would appear to be next on the list for Capello, who will be at Chelsea to watch their Premier League encounter with Manchester City - and the meeting between Terry and Wayne Bridge - on Saturday, with either Frank Lampard or Wayne Rooney acting as back-up.</p>
              <p>Not that Ferguson is overly interested in Three Lions affairs.</p>
              <p>He is more upset at losing Ferdinand to a back injury that has plagued him for 18 months just as Nemanja Vidic was returning to his starting line-up.</p>
              <p>"It is a blow for us because I was looking forward to having Ferdinand and Vidic back on Tuesday," reflected the Scot.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, it wasn't to be.</p>
              <p>"You never know with back injuries and we have been through this before, but we don't think it is too serious.</p>
              <p>"I don't think he will be fit for the AC Milan game but I don't think it will be long afterwards. We think he could be back in two weeks."</p>

              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> is a major injury doubt for England's friendly with Egypt at Wembley on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Rooney came off the bench to score his 28th goal of the season and win the Carling Cup for Manchester United against Aston Villa on Sunday. But Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed the 24-year-old was feeling slight discomfort in his knee afterwards.</p>
              <p>Rooney will be allowed to join up with the England squad but will be assessed by team medical staff before Fabio Capello knows whether he has his talisman available to face the African Nations Cup winners. "He got a whack right away,'' said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"He has been complaining a little about that for a few weeks and was holding it a bit today. In fact I thought we might have to take him off but he wanted to stay on so it was good. The doctors are assessing it and I don't know what England are going to do.''</p>
              <p>Ferguson revealed he knew weeks ago that Rooney would not be starting the Wembley showpiece, having decided to pair <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=12724"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dimitar Berbatov</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7930"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Michael Owen</span></span></a> in attack. Owen grabbed United's equaliser with a typical poacher's effort before picking up a hamstring injury the former Real Madrid man feels will keep him out for a number of weeks.</p>
              <p>Rooney needed no prompting to get involved and marked the occasion by looping the late header past <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7777"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Brad Friedel</span></span></a> to give United the trophy for the second year running. "I was chomping at the bit to get on,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"You want to play in finals. Thankfully I have managed to do so and left my mark on the game. I knew on Wednesday or Thursday I wouldn't be playing. I had a little bit of a stomach bug and the manager was looking for an excuse to leave me out.</p>
              <p>"When he found out about that it made his mind up. I was still disappointed but it was the correct decision by the manager.''</p>
              <p>Worries about Rooney's availability for the Egypt game will only heighten fears that too much is being asked of a man who is so important to both club and country. But he is not concerned about burn-out, and neither is he setting himself any scoring targets, even though he is only two short of the 30 mark Ferguson has put down as a very conservative aim.</p>
              <p>"I don't feel any pressure or burden really,'' he said. "To be honest I have probably had pressure since I was 16 so it is something you get used to and deal with in your own way. I have done that and it is not something I am going to get concerned about now.</p>
              <p>"I am enjoying playing at the minute and enjoying scoring goals. Hopefully that will continue. Cristiano got 42 but I am just looking to contribute to us winning medals. If that happens (42) it would be great but as long as we win medals it would be even better.''</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Nemanja Vidic skirted round the red card row over his fourth-minute tackle on Gabriel Agbonlahor. The Serbian conceded the penalty that allowed James Milner to give Villa the lead.</p>
              <p>However, referee Phil Dowd opted not to send Vidic off, as Villa boss Martin O'Neill claimed should have been the case. "Is it a red card? Some referees give it, some not,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"It is only four minutes into the game and is the first tackle. Probably you can see it better on TV and judge for yourselves.''</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand also confirmed he would not be heading to the England camp in Watford, even though he had been pencilled in to replace John Terry as skipper. Instead, he will have further treatment on his back injury in the hope of being fit enough to face Wolves at Molineux on Saturday, when victory would take United back to the Premier League summit.</p>
