(touch wood).<br><br>but the key to this game is to stop spurs' attempts to play their game and stamp MUFC's tempo.once spurs can't play their game, they will self-implore.<br>So the first 15mins is key.<br><br>If MUFC maintains their ratings of 7.5/8, it should be a MUFC win.<br></div>

However, the chances of Boro winger Stewart Downing joining Woodgate at White Hart Lane are now said to be "close to zero" by sources close to the deal.<br><br>Instead Spurs will redouble their efforts to sign Juventus midfielder Tiago for Â£9m - a deal they expect to go through when Mohamed Sissoko completes his move from Liverpool to Juve later today. The one sticking point remains Tiago's wages, with the midfielder wanting Â£50,000-a-week and Spurs offering Â£10,000-a-week less.<br><br>Elsewhere, Spurs believe they are close to agreeing a pre-contract deal with Hutton that would see the Rangers defender move to London during the summer, and they are also hopeful that the Hertha Berlin left-sided wingback Gilberto will be moving to London in a Â£2.5m deal after he fell out with his club over his demands for a new contract.<br><br>"[The move] is all in the hands of Dieter Hoeness [Berlin's general manager]," Gilberto told Bild. "If he says I may go, I am away." Hoeness, meanwhile, sounded just as trenchant: "Our entire recruitment budget for the winter break would be taken up meeting Gilberto's demands," he said.<br><br>Spurs are becoming a very good side... They will have a few new players joining them very soon... Hopefully they won't be in time for this match... But we can be sure they will have another one or two new players for the second meeting next week...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Spurs face the Red Devils in the fourth round at Old Trafford looking to build on their midweek 5-1 Carling Cup semi-final hammering of Arsenal.</strong><br><br>And England striker Bent, 23, insists Juande Ramos' side are in the mood to beat the Premier League champions. He said: "It's going to be a tough game Â— they're in sizzling form at the moment and it's always a hard game when you play against them. "It's going to be difficult but with the way we're playing at the moment, there's no reason why we can't go up there and get a result. "We lost 1-0 to them earlier in the season but we played well and had a few good chances to win."<br><br>Bent, who joined Spurs from Charlton for Â£16million last summer, will miss the trip to the Theatre of Dreams with a knee injury. But he is backing his team-mates to pull off a shock win over Sir Alex Ferguson's men. Bent added: "I think we've definitely got enough to beat them, more than enough."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson yesterday warned that Tottenham Hotspur, buoyed by their comprehensive midweek victory over Arsenal and led by the attacking talents of Dimitar Berbatov, pose a serious threat to Manchester United's hopes.</strong><br><br>The United manager restated his belief that his squad are better equipped than at any previous stage to maintain a challenge on three fronts but they must first overcome a reinvigorated Spurs side who will arrive for tomorrow's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Old Trafford having scored 73 goals in all competitions, more than any of their top-flight rivals.<br><br>An admirer of Berbatov, Ferguson is well aware of the threat posed by the Bulgarian, who is expected to be a principal transfer target for United next summer, and accepts that the partnership between Berbatov and Robbie Keane, together with Spurs' overall improvement under Juande Ramos, offers the visitors hope of a first win at Old Trafford in 19 years.<br><br>"Berbatov to me, without doubt, has been fantastic since he arrived from Bayer Leverkusen," said Ferguson. "He is a good player. He is a big strong lad, too. People don't realise how strong he is. He is well balanced and hard to shake off the ball. And Robbie Keane scored his 100th goal last Saturday and that is a terrific record considering that Spurs have not really been that successful over the last few years. They also have [Jermain] Defoe, so they have quite a potent force."<br><br>One of Ramos's most notable achievements has been to improve Spurs' fitness and the Spaniard even said this week that his side's stamina would overwhelm United. Ferguson, though, offered some counter-evidence. "Against Reading we had our best stats in terms of distance run for each player," said the manager, who insisted the midweek trip to the Middle East had not drained his players.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Juande Ramos's side have improved since he took over from Dutchman Martin Jol in October. The former Sevilla coach is aware of Spurs's poor record at Old Trafford but far from overawed by it.</strong><br><br>"Normally when you play away against the big teams like United, Arsenal and Chelsea they are the favourites," Ramos told reporters. "But don't forget in the Spanish Super Cup we (Sevilla) beat Real Madrid 5-3 at the Bernabeu. No one expected that to happen."<br><br>Only eight Premier League sides are still left in the competition, with at least one certain to be eliminated when United meet Spurs.<br></div>
