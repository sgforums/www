            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><strong>Opposition: Arsenal fan</strong></span><br><br>Ahead of United's Sunday clash with Arsenal we caught up with Gunners fan Ike, editor of Arseonline, for his thoughts on the season so far...<br><br><strong>What have you made of your start to the season? </strong><br>Poor. This has been our worst start for many years and considering the high points we finished on last season (albeit losing in the CL Final) and moving into a beautiful new stadium, its all been disappointing really. The problem is that our dominant performances over the last few seasons create the expectation that you dont have problems with teams like Villa, Man City and Boro.<br><br><strong>What exactly has gone wrong so far? </strong><br>The loss of experienced, big game players. Bergy, Vieira, Sol, Pires, Cole, Edu, even Reyes - you tell me what team wouldn't suffer with the loss of quality on this scale. Sure, we have younger replacements now, but it takes time to settle and this season I predict as one to consolidate the 'new' face of Arsenal for seasons to come. Tactics is another area Gooners are concerned with, we need a plan 'B'. Most opposition have, to some degree, sussed our game plan and when we are struggling to break a team down we need another dimension to our game to change things.<br><br><strong>Have you had to adjust your expectations for the season?</strong><br>Sure. I don't think I'm the only one who foresaw a tough time ahead and if the would-be affects of losing key players wasn't apparent during the close season, it is now. Wenger has a budget and the new stadium has impacted his capacity to spend - but realistically, we have lost ground to teams spending big. CFC is an obvious example, with Man U and Liverpool spending more than us again. But it's not that we have been complacent - it's just that these teams are raising an already high bar, taking the Premiership to a new level with their investments. We have new, young team. Yes, we lack English talent but as Wenger admits, he picks players who can do the job, regardless of nationality. It will take time, but we will be challenging for the top spot not this season but in the coming seasons after the youth have gelled. I believe for us, now is not too dissimilar to the golden era Fergie inherited a few years back with your youngsters which dominated domestically for so long.<br><br><strong>What are your initial impressions of the Emirates Stadium? </strong><br>It's a fabulous stadium. All the mod cons and a great pitch but I miss the aura of the old place. The new ground is still close, but we are finding it a bit longer to get to and the increased capacity means more people scrambling in less space in and around Highbury. My seat is nowhere near as good as the old one and personally for me, I miss the Clock End faithful who are now spread all over the place at the Grove. The atmosphere is good but it's all gone corporate now and that manifests into a lot of day ticket cling-ons who are there for the hospitality and chit-chat rather than what goes on on the pitch.<br><br><strong>Are you glad to see the back of the Cole / Reyes sagas?</strong><br>Reyes played a handful of decent games but overall seemed to flop. He was lightweight and never adjusted to the English game, but I guess you win some and you lose some. At least he was straight about his intentions, not like Cole. That guy is a different story. What he did amounts pretty much to treachery in eyes of fans. Even if the Club supposedly reneged on a monetary sum for his new deal, that doesn't give him an excuse to act like he did. We made him and not the other way around.<br><br><strong>You must be happy with your replacement buys... </strong><br>Arsene knows. No matter how bad or average we play this or next season, we all know it's a blip and a transitional period for us. Wenger has the full support of the Arsenal hardcore and we know that the long-term game plan is there. We believe in his direction for us and never once has anyone questioned his leadership for the club. I think Baptista and the others may well turn out to do well. Time will tell. What is clear is that Wenger won't splash stupid money on players.<br><br><strong>Who have been your best players so far this season? </strong><br>Kolo, Rosicky and Cesc. Van Persie will have a big season for us this year, just watch.<br><br><strong>Are you more confident coming to Old Trafford on Sunday? </strong><br>We are always confident. The pundits love the way we play but the fact is, we need to be effective with the beautiful way we play and kill teams off. If Fergie fears anyone at home, it's Arsenal.<br><br><strong>Which United players can do you some damage on Sunday? </strong><br>My answer to that would be Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. Those two are the key to your success and if we are to have a real competitive game, it's those two we have to keep quiet.<br><br><strong>Likewise, which Arsenal players do we need to keep an eye on? </strong><br>You know, that - for once - is a hard question. Henry may miss the game with an injury but I think Van Persie and Baptista will be the ones that shine. Julio knows that a big game here will make him an instant hero with the Gooner faithful and we expect big things from the Beast. I think Tomas Rosicky has really played well recently and he too is due a big game now for us. Keep an eye out for Theo (Walcott) too, he'll spring a few surprises if he gets the chance to play.<br><br><strong>Finally, are you confident of getting a result to kick-start your season? </strong><br>Yes, I think we can put a dent in the Manc machine that's steaming ahead of the crowd this season and grind out a result. Wenger and Fergie always are up for it and I'm sure this will be yet another titanic clash between the two best clubs in the country. Question is son, will you bring the pizza - or shall I?<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362969" rel="nofollow">http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=362969</a></div>
