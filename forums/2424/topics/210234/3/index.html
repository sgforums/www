            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday's match, there wasn't any attacking flair. Man U suck at corners and free kicks. Scholes and O Shea was ok. Its Fletcher and Ronaldo. Both of them full of nonsense yesterday. Carrick and Richardson should have played instead. Defensive wise, the only problem is not closing them down early. Its good that they are not committing in the tackles but close down nearer lah.. The mroe they come the more the defence move back as a result they can easily pick their options such as through balls and all. Haiz.. Sucks to lose..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was a disappointment. But I agreed that the better team won. United really lacked form and off colour yesterday. Rooney's presence was barely felt  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Ronaldo tried hard, pity his skills left him yesterday. Think should sub Solskjaer in earlier.<br><br>I thinked Adebayor played a great game, even thou he was lucky with his goal. He played very well during the World Cup too. IMO, he was the decisive player for Togo during WC.<br><br>Anyway, hope United picked up the pieces fast and win their next game!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don't understand why SAF plays Wes Brown on Adebayor.  He is not the same Wes Brown before his long injury.  I thot vidic recovered liao ?  Why isn't he playing ?<br><br>Evra as well, he is fast but lack bite.  Ronaldo seem to like to dribble.  He lost the ball a few times, once just moments before the goal &amp; luckily goalie saved.  The other one led to goal.  What is he thinking of ?<br><br>haiz, last night match is a disaster, if they cannot win against a depleted Arsenal, how can they expect to get the championship again?

            <div class='col-md body'>Captain is very important, if MU for keane in the squad I think the game will be totally different. Altho Arsenal have 5 Midfield, Cses is the one who press  MU defend hard all the time, he don't need the captain to tell him what to do.<br>Look at Rooney on the other side, he din really go for the ball as you see what  Solskjaer can do in the last 15 min of the game. Remember the 49 unbeaten run end at old trafford when MU badly needed a win as Rooney score the 2nd goal and drive on the first goal for panelty, His attitude is not there last nite. During that 2-0 win game most of the players are still in last nite MU first team, it is Arsenal who had the different team. Keane is more important to MU than Viera to Arsenal.<br><br>Alex hair dryer factor may not work liao, just like the tiger beer ad. Players really treat it as a mobile dryer one ear in one ear out.</div>
