              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fernando Torres' miserable season reached a new low on Sunday as one of the worst misses in Barclays Premier League history helped Manchester United to a 3-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Torres, who had already scored his first goal of the season to give Chelsea hope in the first minute of the second half, rounded United goalkeeper David de Gea in the 83rd minute only to slice his shot into the Stretford End. </span><br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Torres' goal soon after the break certainly made things interesting but the second half was also notable for a late challenge in the penalty area by Ashley Cole on Javier Hernandez. </span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON branded Ashley Cole 'shocking' and 'reckless' after a horror tackle on Javier Hernandez. </h2>
              <p>The United boss hit out as his side stayed top of the Premier League, while Chelsea's Fernando Torres was also left howling over an amazing miss that could have pulled the Blues back to 3-2 down. </p>
              <p>Hernandez could now be out for a fortnight and Fergie raged: "It was a shocking tackle. He's very reckless at times, Ashley Cole. </p>
              <p>He is committed of course but he sometimes can go over the edge a bit and the tackle was an example of that."</p>
              <p>The challenge came in the six-yard box as Cole's scissor challenge sent the Mexican crashing to the ground. </p>
              <p>Ferguson added: "The referee has booked him for it so I don't know why it wasn't a penalty. I must ask him. </p>
              <p>"We will have to see what the damage is in the morning. His leg is numb. He could be out for a couple of weeks."</p>
              <p>Ref Phil Dowd did not give the penalty as the ball was already out of play when the challenge was made.</p>

              <p>Actually I thought Torres was one of their best player on the night... He was a threat whenever he gets the ball... Only thing is he fail to score from an 'open goal'... This it seems has taken away all the good work he did in the match compare to the others... Cos people seemed to focus on this incident only... </p>
              <p>When compare to the rest... Sturridge was like non existence, Mata don't track back enough for a winger... Lampard was being his usual self... So Torres was one of their best if not the best for them on the night in my opinion...</p>

              <p>Already they got serious enough injury problems with Rafael, Vidic, Rio, Cleverley, Welbeck and now even Hernandez will be out... How much more thinner can the team gets before it shows... All this together with a new keeper still learning how to adapt in the premier league not to mention a new language...</p>
              <p>So it' still early days... it's just one match... For all we know United could drop points at Stoke away next week and City win and go to the top of the table...</p>
              <p>Even if they got a lead of 15 points by Jan I still won't be counting my chickens cos it has been proven before that it can still be caught...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>rio and vidic is coming back soon, so its a good thing fergie bought Jones when they are out, as he can also play RB and CB, and also defensive midfield to add to his versatility. The thing is Fabio isnt injured and why fergie didnt pick him play, so that smalling and Jones can partner in central defence and dun let that dodgy Evans play. whenever he plays, I scared for the worst, as he either clumsily concede a pk or fail to mark a striker. good to see fletcher back to his marauding best as defensive midfielder, doing the dirty work in midfield like chasing, tacking etc. Valencia too is back, so its good news in the injury department. I think Rafael will start training in a few weeks time, so its all not too bad.</p></div>

              <p>We were very very lucky with this game, truly.</p>
              <p>I really don't know what else I can say about Evans. Many times
              he was oblivious to movement around him, made one great
              interception, but other than that always got on the wrong side of
              opponents and relying of the side ref.<br> <br> Perfect example was just above me, after Torres' miss, it cuts to
              Fletcher and Evans who are the closest behind and they stopped in
              their tracks, never even tried to run back expecting an
              offside.</p>
              <p>Either way, I am depressed Rooney missed two chances. I'm happy
              for Torres as a player to finally get a goal, because it must be
              killing him to be goalless for so long. But let's not forget some
              of the saves De Gea made lol.<br> <br> Good win, but lucky. I hope the momentum continues, and that
              performance picks up again. (Like that game against Tottenham, and
              Bolton)</p>

              <p>agree with you.. MUFC did not really "control" the game esp a home game.</p>
              <p>This was too open, and the results could have swung either way. MF wise, MUFC is seriously lacking.. The only highlight is Jones and Wing plays (nani). I still think MUFC needs a Keano or Scholes type of figure that can control the tempo better and not lose the ball so often.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's strikers had a torrid time, not sure whether MUFC will have this "good" fortune if faced with more on forms strikers..</p>
              <p>Also, in all fairness, two of MUFC's goals were off-site.  Of course, Nani still have a lot to do in the 2nd goal, even when he first got the ball (offsite position). </p>

              <p>Actually I thought Torres was one of their best player on the
              night... He was a threat whenever he gets the ball... Only thing is
              he fail to score from an 'open goal'... This it seems has
              taken away all the good work he did in the match compare to
              the others... Cos people seemed to focus on this incident
              only... </p>
              <p>When compare to the rest... Sturridge was like non existence,
              Mata don't track back enough for a winger... Lampard was being his
              usual self... So Torres was one of their best if not the best for
              them on the night in my opinion...</p>

              <p>I agree.. if MUFC can swap berbacock, Owen for him, it will be best.. cause with the support Torres can get from Nani, Rooney, or Young, he will have even more chance to perform/score..</p>

              <p>rio and vidic is coming back soon, so its a good thing fergie
              bought Jones when they are out, as he can also play RB and CB, and
              also defensive midfield to add to his versatility. The thing is
              Fabio isnt injured and why fergie didnt pick him play, so that
              smalling and Jones can partner in central defence and dun let that
              dodgy Evans play. whenever he plays, I scared for the worst, as he
              either clumsily concede a pk or fail to mark a striker. good to see
              fletcher back to his marauding best as defensive midfielder, doing
              the dirty work in midfield like chasing, tacking etc. Valencia too
              is back, so its good news in the injury department. I think Rafael
              will start training in a few weeks time, so its all not too
              bad.</p>

              <p>err... in all fairness, even with Rio/Vidic, I still think Torres can run rings around them. Jones is younger, and faster, and he dealt with Torres better.  Torres or chelsea became "better" when Mata played behind Torres and gave him the ball more. I think the fault lies with Fletcher, Anderson, they are simply too slow and their cover poor. Fletcher is a poor shadow of what he can do. Even Carrick is not pacey enough..</p>
              <p>if MUFC face Barca again now, the results may be same as per the last time they met.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>With everything said and done, I'm really inclined towards having Evans, Carrick and Gibson shipped out in a year or two, assuming we don't get injury-heavy, and that we bring in another def and midfielder, Fletch is pretty much second-string now.<br><br>Unless Pogba can fill that gap, who knows. There is still De Laet in Norwich, but the first few games he wasn't exactly fantastic.</p></div>
