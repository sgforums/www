              <p class="article">The striker’s owner Kia Joorabchian is frustrated United have not gone through with their promise to turn the Argentine’s loan deal into a £32million move.</p>

              <h1>Carlos Tevez Getting Closer To Real Madrid?</h1>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Just last week, Madrid-based sports daily <em>Marca</em> boomed proudly on its front pages that Carlos Tevez will be playing for Real Madrid next season.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Now, even
              the English press are convinced that the Argentine is bound to exit Old
              Trafford for the Santiago Bernabeu sooner rather than later.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">According to <em>The Daily Express</em>,
              United’s refusal to tie up a permanent deal for the 24 year old, who is
              not only growing frustrated with his unresolved future but also with
              his lack of first team football this season, could prompt Madrid to
              make a move for him during the January transfer window, instead of the
              proposed July trade period next summer.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The Red Devils are currently shelling out €7 million as part of Tevez’s two year loan deal from West Ham which ends on </span><span lang="EN-GB">30 June 2009</span><span lang="EN-GB">,
              but they would have to separate with €27 million if they are to
              exercise their purchase option and acquire his services permanently.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">According to <em>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Sun</em>, businessman<em> </em>Kia
              Joorabchian, who owns Tevez’s economic rights, is believed to be
              disappointed with United for not completing the deal as promised and as
              the global financial crisis continues to hit hard, he could be tempted
              to listen to Los Blancos’ offer, should they make one come January.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Madrid</span><span lang="EN-GB"> themselves are desperate to boost their attacking firepower following the season-ending knee injury to Ruud van Nistelrooy. </span></p>

              <p><br>Well, lets see... What were we comparing then and what is it now... Its apple and orange isn't it? What I mentioned there i still very much stick to it. You were talking about getting Benzema for a suppose "cut price" just because its in a downturn as you called it. You serious?</p>
              <p>As i have mentioned earlier, Benzema is not going to come cheap... Lyon's president is famous for getting the best deals for his players simply because they are not a club in need of cash... They are rich too and probaly the richest in France... They didn't win the last 7 straight league titles for no reason... Mainly bacause they can afford to keep the star players they want and only sell if the price is very huge to the liking of their president like the then unknown players Essien and Mahamadou Diarra...</p>
              <p>They were not well known names in World football like our Frank Lampard or our Frank Ribery... But because of his hard headed behaviour in negotiations, these 2 unknown players back then cost Chelsea a then club record $38m Euros and Real $26m Euros after much hassle... For you info, United were very much interested in Essien before Chelsea came along but the priced quoted for a not fully established player then frighten them away... It took a very rich Chelsea then to pay a club record $38m Euros for him. Today they probably wouldn't take such risk with an unknown player anymore.</p>
              <p>Adding now that Benzema signed a renew contract just this year or a few months back to extend it to 2012, thats a very long contract. So you seriously think the Lyon's president Jean-Michel Aulas is going to let him go cheaply just because its in a "downturn"?</p>
              <p>Downturn or no downturn, if there are enough clubs able to afford him, his price won't come down even in a downturn... The likes of Real, Barce and you can also add Man City... are there and waiting as well... Lyon also don't really need to sell or may not want to sell for that matter...</p>
              <p><strong>Anyway, if you had notice... The topic here is...</strong> If Tevez wants to leave because he is not getting games... What do you think? This is the main point of discussion in this thread... And I said in Fergie I trust. Because if Fergie thinks he is not worthy of a place in the starting eleven and use him as a sub, but he is not happy with it, then he is free to go to another team that can offer him first eleven place. At the end of the day, the team matters more than any individual, or worse an unhappy individual.</p>
              <p>Player like Solskjaer joint United as a 23 yrs old and stayed there till today... He never complaint of whether the got to play of not... But whenever he came on he did his best for 11 yrs of his playing career... All i am saying is... This are the type of players the club should keep. Those that are not happy can leave... Simple as this...</p>
              <p>Lastly i notice you keep saying whatever it is i wouldn't wanna go on with it again and again.. but It seems to me like you can't get over it and you keep coming back... I actually forgotten about this already, I didn't even bother to reply to your last post which was more or less a repeat of your earlier post and you actually bother to return to it in different forum folder and different thread too... man... get over it lah...</p>

              <p><br>Simply put it, if a good player wants to stay they should keep him. But if he is unhappy and wish to leave for reasons known to himself... Then they should let him go where he can be happy again cos there is no point in keeping an unhappy player in the squad.</p>
              <p>Yeah we both had our takes and it has been fun, i hope for you too... nothing personal, just an opinion thats all.</p>

              <p>if we swap benzema for tevez, how many will say "yea"..</p>
              <p>do note, Tevez is already proven goalscorer in EPL, and plus his work antics gave him a huge advantage..</p>
              <p>plus I don't benzema, rooney or Berba would want to sit on the bench much.</p>

              <h1>Ferguson Not Sure How Tevez Fits Into Manchester United's Plans</h1>
              <p>Carlos Tevez scored four goals against Blackburn Rovers to send
              Manchester United through to the semi-finals of the Carling Cup - and
              yet he found himself on the bench for Sunderland's visit to Old
              Trafford at the weekend.</p>
              <p>The Argentine striker is becoming increasingly frustrated with his
              bit-part role, and speculation over his future will continue to swell
              as the January transfer window approaches.</p>
              <p>But Sir Alex Ferguson said in <em>The Sun</em>: "I explained to
              Carlos that if the team had not played so well in the previous league
              match against Manchester City, then he would have started.</p>
              <p>"He understood exactly and when he came on against Sunderland he brought a real energy."</p>
              <p>However, there remains the long-term problem - if one can even call
              it that - of United boasting three other world-class forwards in Wayne
              Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>There was plenty of quizzical muttering when Berbatov moved from
              Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the summer - not only due to the less
              than graceful manner in which he left White Hart Lane, but also because
              the Red Devils had so much attacking talent at their disposal already.</p>
              <p>And even Ferguson has admitted that he is yet to determined whether all four players can be crammed into his starting XI.</p>
              <p>"I would like to be able to do it but I’m not sure if we can," the United boss said.</p>
              <p>"Each player is certainly flexible enough to play in different roles.</p>
              <p>"It would make for a very attacking frontline. I have been doodling
              on my notepad trying to work out how I can fit in all these players."</p>
              <p>Real Madrid and Inter Milan have been keeping tabs on Tevez, who is
              yet to be offered a permanent contract by the Manchester giants. His
              loan spell expires at the end of the season.</p>
