On the face of it, the champions could not have had a more troubled start to their title defence.<br><br>The area where they seem a player short is in attack. It is obvious what they are trying to do. They have terrific footballers with exceptional movement and they are trying to pass their way through teams.<br><br>Sometimes that does not work and you need to mix it up, you need a plan B. With Louis Saha regularly injured, they don't have a typical No 9, a player who can "run the other way" and who can hold the ball, who is big and strong and will lead the line.<br><br>Where is United's Didier Drogba? Rooney and Carlos Tevez are very similar, they're more effective coming short, linking the play, turning and running at defenders with quick feet, rather than operating with their backs to goal.<br><br>Rooney can play that way but it is not him at his best and it was very difficult for Tevez against a strong defender such as Sylvain Distin at Portsmouth. Next up: Richard Dunne and Micah Richards.<br><br>Tevez linked beautifully with Scholes for the goal on Wednesday but they are still crying out for a different forward, like Mark Viduka or Dimitar Berbatov, someone to give them more attacking variation.<br><br>If United stay with what they have, they will hope to get Saha back on the pitch some time soon and, let us not forget, it is only two matches into the new season.<br><br>Only a fool would write them off. How long will it be before we are writing about their brilliant football?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Every team needs time to settle.<br><br>Last season, there was really only one new addition to United, Carrick. This season there are 4. I really do feel that they do need a good traditional centre-forward to mix things up a bit, but the only one we had who fit the mould is now a toon, and he's playing midfield too.<br><br>Oh well, maybe when they get it right, they will be unstoppable again. I just feel that the team is still in transition, with Giggs, Scholes and Neville still in. Once the Old Guard goes, that's when the team is complete.</div>
