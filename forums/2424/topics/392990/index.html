              <div class="sp-clear"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span> will be allowed to spend up to £80 million this summer as he targets a new striker and goalkeeper.</strong></div>
              <div class="sp-clear">
              <p>Ferguson has been reluctant to spend big money and has said in recent months that he feels there is a lack of value in the market, but he now acknowledges that Manchester United cannot continue to rely so heavily on <span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span> and will look to bring in a new forward when the transfer window reopens.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Edwin van der Sar</span> recently agreed a one-year contract extension to remain at Old Trafford next season but, at 39, his time at the top level looks limited, so Ferguson would like to bring in one of the world's top goalkeepers to replace him.</p>
              <p>United raised £80 million from the sale of <span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span> to Real Madrid in the summer but reinvestment in the market was limited and there were suspicions that the Glazers were using the remaining funds elsewhere in the business. However, it has emerged that the cash pile is still available for new signings.</p>
              <p>An insider told <em>Soccernet</em>: "There is no doubt that the money from the sale of Ronaldo is there for Sir Alex to spend, and any other money he raises through sales. Sir Alex needs a striker and a goalkeeper, and the players of the quality United demand means that they would be extremely expensive and, while Sir Alex likes value for money, he does need these two players for next season as a matter of priority."</p>
              <p>Ferguson has been left to deal with team matters without any interference from the Glazers, and for that reason he is supportive of their ownership of the club and unwilling to go behind their backs to back the Red Knights' potential takeover.</p>
              <p>"Sir Alex is not involved with the Red Knights, nor would he be," the insider added. "It's preposterous to even suggest it. In any case, their bid is not reality.</p>
              <p>"No one is going to force the Glazers to sell, and I would doubt whether the Glazers would even entertain these guys, even if they did change their minds one day. There seems to be no proof of funds - the likelihood is that they would borrow heavily in any case - so what is the difference?"</p>
