              <p>Nemanja Vidic says he has embraced the responsibility that comes with being captain of Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Manager Sir Alex Ferguson handed the armband to the Serbian at the start of the season and the team have made an excellent start to the season.</p>
              <p>United reclaimed top spot in the Premier League on Monday by beating Arsenal and stretching their unbeaten start to the season to 16 top-flight matches - a club record.</p>
              <p>"I feel very proud," Vidic told United Review. "It came as a bit of a surprise but I am enjoying the role.</p>
              <p>"You have to think about your responsibilities - your behaviour, the way you play, the way you train. I know that I need to set a good example on and off the pitch.</p>
              <p>"In terms of my game I do not think anything has changed. I've always talked a lot on the pitch. You have to communicate as a defender and organise things whether you are captain or not.</p>
              <p>"I tend not to think about it (the captaincy) when I'm playing. I am just focused on doing my best for the team as I have always done."</p>
              <p>Vidic insists there are a number of leaders to help him in the role at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"The likes of Rio (Ferdinand), Gary (Neville), Giggsy (Ryan Giggs) Scholesy (Paul Scholes), Edwin (Van der Sar) set the example," he said.</p>
              <p>"The way they help the other players is fantastic. They have helped me develop and I want to help the younger lads do the same."</p>
              <p>Vidic has a special affinity with his central defensive partner Ferdinand and added: "Rio and I have a great understanding on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"I also have to say Mladen Krstajic and I had a great relationship for the Serbian national team.</p>
              <p>"I am not being disrespectful to the other players I've played with, but the results I've achieved with those two players shows what a good understanding we have. They have both helped me improve as a player."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anderson took time to settle in Manchester having joined from Porto in 2007, where he was the Portuguese side's key player despite still being in his teens.</p>
              <p>However, the sometime Brazil international has produced more consistent performances this season and has been rewarded with the new deal.</p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "We are delighted Anderson has signed a new contract.</p>
              <p>"Anderson has developed tremendously since joining the club and he has fantastic potential at only 22 years of age, he is going to be a really top player."</p>
