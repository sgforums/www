              <p>Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has declared that it was his success at Stamford Bridge which forced Manchester United, now the defending English and European champions, to up their game.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/mazdau.jpg" alt=""><br><br>He said in <em>The Sun</em>, “When I was in England, Chelsea was the best team between 2004-06. That is why we won two consecutive Premierships.<br><br>“Manchester
              United at that time realised they needed to be better to win it and, in
              my third season, that’s what they did. And they went on to win the
              Champions League.<br><br>“That has given them so much confidence. They are certainly a better team now than when I was in England.”<br><br>Mourinho is now the head coach of Inter, who take on the Red Devils this week in the last 16 of the Champions League.<br><br>There
              is much anticipation surrounding the tactical battle between the
              Portuguese and Sir Alex Ferguson, both on and off the pitch, as they
              enjoyed a healthy rivalry during the former's spell in England.<br><br>But Mourinho said, “I have a great relationship with Sir Alex.<br><br>“You
              know during the game it is going to be a real war. But afterwards there
              is always happiness and we share some time together. I don’t want that
              to change, no matter who wins or loses.<br><br>“I have so many good
              memories of facing United. I beat them while with Porto in the last 16,
              in a Carling Cup semi-final with Chelsea and also at Stamford Bridge to
              claim our second title.”</p>

              <p>Back in the 90s, the EPL is won with 77-80 points. It would guarantee at least a 2nd place. Since mourinho's arrival, yeh a team needs 90 points now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mourinho is doing the same thing at Inter now....upping the bar. He's a huge favour to any league.</p>
