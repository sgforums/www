              <p><br>there is a midweek match to play against west ham. with this defeat, a win against west ham is a must, even though united is at home. but never underestimate your opponent and think all you have to do, is to turn up the match to win. after the match, united have 4 days to prepare against Villa. I think fergie will tinker his team for the 2 matches.</p>

              <p>Mhmm. Gone were the days when you could call on a Tevez or a Sheringham or a Solskjaer off the bench to salvage the game for you, I wouldn't have mind if Larsson was on the bench today even.</p>
              <p>Owen is a poacher, kinda fails when Fergie subs him on for the guy who's creating most of the chances for the team.</p>

              <p>The more i see Neville, the more i wish he would be seriously injured in a tackle and subsequently retire. The first 2 goals were created from his flank. You can see that he's trying to get back in position but lacked the pace to do so.</p>
              <p>So to Neville: If you want to save United from falling further behind, do the sensible thing. Retire. Give up your captaincy that is not rightfully yours. You cant lead, cant defend, talk rubbish all the time.</p>
              <p>I hope to see the back of Neville soon.</p>

              <p>I watched the highlights over and over again and still deem Neville as unfit of putting on the United shirt.</p>
              <p>I maybe bias against him but i have video to back me up.</p>
              <p>I was wrong about the 1st goal but definitely not the 2nd - the killer goal.</p>
              <p>The second goal, wasn't good work from Pienaar - Neville switched off and let Pienaar ghost past him and Neville made no effort in chasing Pienaar, he just jog back, looking around to see who else is backing him. Is that a defender's job? I thought a defender is suppose to defend?</p>
              <p>Yes, you can say that Valencia did not close Pienaar down but he is a right midfielder. He has been doing great on the right flank, assisting the frontline but surely u cant expect him to defend as well can you?</p>

Gary defensive qualities are still there this is not in doubt, but he lacked his pace a few years ago. pace is everything these days esp for a RB who need to venture up and down the pitch all the time. gary certainly doesnt have the legs anymore to do that, as is giggs and scholes. cant expect the old men to run up and time the same pace anymore.</p></div>

Berbatov was playing well and he was hauled off, he may be injured, ok thats fair enought but park was working off his socks and he was replaced by the pacy but ineffective obertan, whose crosses likened to Nani cross from the left lol. then fergie also hauled off Valencia, and in came owen, who did almost nothing on the pitch at all.  then fletcher had to play at right side instead in the centre, where he can run tirelessly and harry and tackle in the middle of the pitch. I wonder what might have been if Valencia and Park had stayed on the match. Maybe a draw beckoned, who knows.</p></div>

              <p>I personally think it's going to be very difficult for United to win the title this season. As it is, they are already 4 points behind Chelsea... Their last few matches isn't easy ones... With Chelsea, Spurs and away to City, I can't see them getting all 9 points from these. Therefore if they are going to win it, they must be at least 3 points ahead of Chelsea by the end of March to have any chance...</p>
              <p>And I am also not counting Arsenal out of the title race either... They are very close now and have a rather easier last 10 match fixtures...</p>

I believe this will be down to the wire. dun rule out arsenal yet, as they are just 2 points behind united. arsenal has a much easier run-in compared to chelsea and united. if chelsea and united both slipped up, arsenal may snatch the title from behind, who knows.</p></div>

              <p>I watched the highlights over and over again and still deem Neville as unfit of putting on the United shirt.</p>
              <p>I maybe bias against him but i have video to back me up.</p>
              <p>I was wrong about the 1st goal but definitely not the 2nd - the killer goal.</p>
              <p>The second goal, wasn't good work from Pienaar - Neville switched off and let Pienaar ghost past him and Neville made no effort in chasing Pienaar, he just jog back, looking around to see who else is backing him. Is that a defender's job? I thought a defender is suppose to defend?</p>
              <p>Yes, you can say that Valencia did not close Pienaar down but he is a right midfielder. He has been doing great on the right flank, assisting the frontline but surely u cant expect him to defend as well can you?</p>

              <p>I think you are wrong for the second one as well. How can you even blame it on Neville is beyond me... If you watch it again like I have just did only once...</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.footballepl.com/videos/play?id=AE78A76500000126EBC917140255F306"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">http://www.footballepl.com/videos/play?id=AE78A76500000126EBC917140255F306</span></span></a></p>
              <p>You will notice that Valencia was with Pienaar before he made his pass and Neville was marking Landon Donovan. But once Pienaar made the pass to the other player, he started his run. During this time, Valencia should have followed him like Park usually do on the left side rather than stop at the player Neville was guarding against... There is no way Neville could have caught up with Pienaar even if he was 10 yrs younger cos he was in a guarding position while Pienaar was already on a sprint.</p>
              <p>Valencia may be the right midfielder but helping out in the defence is also part of a winger's job nowadays especially with overlapping midfielders and defenders coming forward... It can be argue that it was his duty to keep close to Pienaar rather than Neville as Neville had Dovovan to watch over...</p>
              <p>Basically, it was Valencia's job to keep up with Pienaar and made it difficult for him as he would have started his run and sprint almost the same time and position as him. Had Valencia followed him, Brown wouldn't have been pull out to the right and yet not get close enough to him. He could have gave extra support in the middle and Pienaar wouldn't have been able to get a free run into the position that he did to make the cut back with ease.</p>
              <p>I understand your dislike for Neville but we shouldn't blame it on him just because he is old or you simply just don't like him... Personally I like Valencia a lot as a United player but he made a mistake and that's how I call it... I can't say he did right just because I like him, cos he didn't.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>For me, I think its better to sacrisfise the worthless cup, another needless game for united. if they lose with the reserves, so be it. but if united were to win, then its an extra bonus. United need to rest their key players like rooney and fletcher, especially. if not they run the risks of burnt out or injured.</p></div>

Valencia is great going up but he is just not very good with defensive duties... He need to improve on that part of his game... He can learn a bit from Park...</p></div>
