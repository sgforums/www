              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger’s next generation put Fergie’s babes in the shade on
              Tuesday night, but one emerging Old Trafford star is desperate for a
              shot at the young Gunners. </strong></p>
              <p>Jonny Evans would love to draw Arsenal in the Carling Cup quarter
              finals, so United can test their mettle against Wenger’s lauded lads.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson’s young players struggled to put away QPR at Old
              Trafford as Arsenal waltzed to victory over Premier League Wigan at
              Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>But Evans, 20, is keen on a revenge mission after United fell to
              defeat in North London on Saturday and knows they will have to beat
              all-comers if they want to claim the trophy.</p>
              <p>"I would like to get Arsenal," he said. "After the weekend it would be nice to get one back on them.</p>
              <p>"Any team is going to be tough at this stage. But if you are going
              to get to the final, you have to beat the good ones at some stage."</p>
              <p>While the Carling Cup remains low on the list of priorities for most
              United players, Evans believes the younger members of the squad are
              desperate for any opportunity to impress.</p>
              <p>"The incentive is there for this team because the manager says he will stand by us," Evans added.</p>
              <p>"You just have to do well to keep your place. It is really tough just getting into the squad here.</p>
              <p>"There are some outstanding players to come back in, although it is always going to be tough at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"You just have to keep grafting away, hopefully get more games and believe eventually your time will come."</p>
              <p>Evans remains firmly behind Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic in the United pecking order at centre back.</p>
              <p>The young Northern Ireland international had a successful two-year
              loan spell in the Sunderland first-team and admits it is frustrating to
              now have to watch from the bench. </p>
              <p>"I have only played four games, so I am not getting carried away," he added.</p>
              <p>"It would be nice to play a few more matches but I do feel comfortable and I am enjoying it.</p>
              <p>"You work hard on the training ground to ensure you take these kind of chances.</p>
              <p>"Playing for a club like Manchester United is what we all dreamed about as a kid growing up.</p>
              <p>"You owe it to yourself and your family to give everything. Whether it is good enough or not, at least you have tried."</p>

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Jay Simpson would relish United test</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Prem/arsenal/simpson_ramsey.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="190"></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal starlet Jay Simpson says the young Gunners players are
              desperate to test themselves against the very best in the next round of
              the Carling Cup. </strong></p>
              <p>Simpson scored two goals as Arsene Wenger’s
              side – with an average age of just 19 – beat a strong Wigan team 3-0 at
              Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>And with Manchester United defender Jonny Evans saying he would love to face Arsenal to get revenge for the Premier League defeat at the weekend, Simpson claims the team has absolutely no fear of anyone.</p>
              <p>"Now all of us want a big side, we want to test ourselves,” Simpson said on the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>“That's what it's all about – playing against the big teams, the big-name players and seeing what you can do against them.</p>
              <p>“If we get Manchester United or Liverpool,
              we'd want them to put out their first team because it would show
              they've got respect for us.</p>
              <p>“I'd be delighted if we got them in the next round."</p>
              <p>Simpson also revealed that Emmanuel Adebayor played a crucial role in his performance at Wigan.</p>
              <p>“I went up and spoke to Emmanuel Adebayor before the game and he gave me a bit of advice which paid off on the pitch,” he said.</p>
              <p>“He told me that, when I am shooting, just make sure I hit the target – don't concentrate too much on power.”</p>
