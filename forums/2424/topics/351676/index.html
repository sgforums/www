              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Nemanja Vidic has told how he would be honoured to be nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award. </strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United defender is among the favourites
              to land the prize after enjoying a fantastic season at the heart of the
              Red Devils' back four.</p>
              <p>He has been an integral part of a
              record-breaking defensive unit at Old Trafford, while he has also
              proven to be a useful attacking weapon after grabbing a number of vital
              goals.</p>
              <p>Vidic insists he has given no thought to the personal
              accolades which could be heading his way after a terrific campaign,
              insisting he is delighted just to be in the frame.</p>
              <p>"Just to be a candidate as player of the year would be a big honour, when you consider the players who are here," he said.</p>
              <p>"I
              have scored goals, so maybe people are thinking about that. We have
              also kept a lot of clean sheets and certain individuals have been
              praised, including me, so that might be part of it too.</p>
              <p>"It has been a good year for me and I am happy with the contribution I have made to the team.</p>
              <p>"But more importantly I hope everyone can see the improvement I have made.</p>
              <p>"All the players here are the same. They don't want to stay still, they want to get better and better."</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/man-utd/ferdinand_giggs480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Rio Ferdinand thinks team-mate Ryan Giggs should be considered for Premier League Player of the Year. </strong></p>
              <p>Giggs has received universal acclaim when he has played – often in a
              more central role – this season and was picked out for particular
              praise after his display against Inter in the Champions League this
              week.</p>
              <p>Whilst Ferdinand’s central defensive partner Nemanja Vidic has been
              lauded for his part in United’s watertight efforts at the back, it is
              Giggs that the England defender is keen not to see ignored.</p>
              <p>“This is a great team to be a part of,” he said. “Jose Mourinho said
              we’re at our peak because we have exactly the right blend of older
              ones, mid-age range and young ones.</p>
              <p>“I like to consider myself in the mid-age section as I’m only 30 but
              it’s unbelievable to see someone like Giggsy, who is five years older
              than me, is playing.</p>
              <p>“His performance against Inter was one of the best by any United
              player this season and shows why he is still so important to the club.</p>
              <p>“Giggsy might not play all the games but when he comes into the team he gives us so much.</p>
              <p>“For me, he will be up there for the Player of the Year awards right
              alongside Nemanja Vidic. Giggsy’s a Manchester United legend.”</p>
