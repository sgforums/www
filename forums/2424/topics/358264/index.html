              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester United have ruled Rio Ferdinand out of the second-leg of their Champions League semi at Arsenal on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says Ferdinand is out of the clash with a rib injury which left him coughing up blood.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand was taken to hospital after being hurt in a clash with United
              keeper Edwin van der Sar which has also ruled Arsenal striker Eduardo
              out of the Emirates return.</p>
              <p>Although X-rays revealed the England defender had not suffered
              a break near the end of United's 1-0 win at Old Trafford, the force of
              the blow from van der Sar's knee pushed his rib cage on to his lungs,
              causing the bleeding. Ferdinand was allowed home in the early hours of
              yesterday morning after being assessed at a Salford hospital.</p>
              <p>Further tests were carried out yesterday at Manchester's
              Whalley Range hospital to determine whether Ferdinand had suffered a
              punctured lung.</p>
              <p>It is understood the scans revealed no puncture but heavy bruising, which will require Ferdinand to rest for two weeks.</p>
              <p>"Rio is desperate to play but he'll take medical advice and
              won't jeopardise anything to the detriment of the team," said a source
              close to the player.</p>
              <p>"He was in a bad way after the injury but it was typical of him
              that he wanted to come straight back on and didn't know he'd already
              been subbed."</p>

              Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed Rio Ferdinand has not cracked a rib and hopes to be available for Manchester United's Champions League semi-final second leg away to Arsenal on Tuesday.
              
              The injury setback could have been a significant blow to Ferguson's hopes of retaining United's English and European crowns /i&gt; as Ferdinand was thought to be out for the Premier League fixtures against Middlesbrough, Manchester City, Wigan and Arsenal, as well as next week's semi-final second leg at the Emirates.
              
              The central defender has had X-rays on the problem and now looks set to give his side a boost in a vital period of the season.
              
              Ferdinand was allowed home in the early hours of Thursday morning after being assessed at a Salford hospital, undergoing tests to determine whether he had suffered a punctured lung.
              
              Ferdinand left the field clutching his right side after he ran into Eduardo, and moments later he was sandwiched between keeper Edwin van der Sar and Nicklas Bendtner contesting a high ball.
              
              "Rio is desperate to play but he'll take medical advice and won't jeopardise anything to the detriment of the team," said a source close to the player.
              
              "He was in a bad way after the injury but it was typical of him that he wanted to come straight back on and didn't know he'd already been subbed."

              Rio Ferdinand could be fit for Manchester United's Champions League second leg clash at Arsenal after scans revealed he had not cracked a rib.
              
              The England defender was forced off and had to be taken to hospital during the first leg of the sides' semi-final meeting at Old Trafford on Wednesday. 
              
              He will miss United's Premier League game with Middlesbrough on Saturday but manager Sir Alex Ferguson is confident he could be fit to face the Gunners. 
              
              "It's good news with Rio. It is not a cracked bone, he had a bit of bruising on the lung which was why he was coughing up blood but there has been 
              
              nothing since then," Ferguson said. 
              
              "Hopefully we can get him ready for Tuesday, he seems almost back to normal. But he won't play tomorrow. 
              
              "Of course when you see it at the time you fear the worst but now it is just a case of getting him back training, hopefully on Sunday, and getting him ready for Tuesday."
