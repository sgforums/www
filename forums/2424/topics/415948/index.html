              <p><strong>Darren Fletcher feels the Ibrox atmosphere could bring the best out of United on Wednesday night.<br><br></strong>One point in Glasgow will guarantee the Reds’ place in the UEFA Champions League's knock-out stages but Fletcher is targeting all three, the same yield from United’s last visit to Rangers in 2003 when Phil Neville scored the only goal.<br><br>“I am really looking forward to the game,” said Fletcher.<br><br>“Rangers are a massive club and it will be a special night at Ibrox, with a fantastic atmosphere. I experienced it from the bench when we went there a few years ago.”<br><br>As Scotland skipper, Fletcher doesn’t expect a hero’s welcome from the natives – far from it, in fact.<br><br>“I am sure I will get plenty of stick from the home support,” said the United midfielder. “But part of the challenge is playing in intimidating atmospheres.<br><br>“It’s what playing in Europe is all about, it’s something we all enjoy. But although we will enjoy it, we still have a job to do.<br><br>“We still need that point that is going to take us into the next round. We will produce a professional performance to try and win the match.”</p>

              <p>Although the central defensive duo trained at Carrington this morning, neither were part of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad for the Battle of Britain clash at Ibrox.</p>
              <p>With a Premier League meeting with in-form Blackburn looming on Saturday and a Carling Cup quarter-final at West Ham next Tuesday, Ferguson has opted to give both men a rest, believing his squad are capable of gaining the point required to secure qualification for the knock-out phase without them.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans, who has not featured since the Carling Cup win over Wolves in October, are expected to deputise. </strong></p>
              <p>In addition, Darren Fletcher also sits out the return to Scotland. Although he has had a heavy workload recently, Fletcher would have relished an outing for United north of the border.</p>
              <p>Darron Gibson and Gary Neville were the other notable absentees from training this morning as United stayed at Carrington for their final session ahead of their short flight to Glasgow.</p>
              <p>Ryan Giggs took part in training and Wayne Rooney is expected to make his first start since the Premier League visit to Bolton at the beginning of last month.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Park Ji-sung, looking ahead to the Battle of Britain collision, does not feel it quite matches the games he plays for South Korea against Japan.</p>
              <p>'We have a long history with Japan,' he said. 'When South Korea play against Japan the fans tell us that if we lose they are going to throw the players into the sea. Without doubt, they are the biggest thing for us.'</p>

              <p><strong>Yet Park is acutely aware of the cross-border tensions that surround English meetings with Scotland.</strong></p>
              <p>His own experiences involve Celtic. But he knows he should expect something similarly special.</p>
              <p>'The atmosphere in the stadium is totally different,' he said. 'You cannot compare it to a league game or others in the Champions League. It more aggressive on the pitch and the atmosphere in the stadium is really high. There is a lot more media attention as well.</p>

              <p>Darren Fletcher was missing from training this morning as <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> opted to have their final session at Carrington ahead of their <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> match with <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Rangers" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rangers"><span style="color: #005689;">Rangers</span></a> tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson and his players are not due to fly into Scotland until this afternoon but it already appears Fletcher will not be required in his homeland, although no reason has been offered for his absence today.</p>
              <p>Darron Gibson and Gary Neville were also absent, although Ryan Giggs was there, along with Wayne Rooney, who is expected to make his first start since the Premier League visit to Bolton Wanderers at the beginning of last month.</p>
              <p>United require a single point to confirm their place in the last 16, although it will not be easy in a highly charged atmosphere at Ibrox. However, while Park Ji-sung acknowledges the intensity of the all-British clash, he does not feel it quite matches the games he plays for South Korea against Japan.</p>
              <p>"We have a long history with Japan," he said. "When South Korea play against Japan the fans tell us that if we lose they are going to throw the players into the sea. Without doubt, they are the biggest thing for us."</p>
              <p>Yet Park is acutely aware of the cross-border tensions that surround English meetings with Scotland. His own experiences involve Celtic. But he knows he should expect something similarly special.</p>
              <p>"The atmosphere in the stadium is totally different. You cannot compare it to a league game or others in the Champions League. It is more aggressive on the pitch and the atmosphere in the stadium is really high. There is a lot more media attention as well. Nobody has to say anything, it is just a natural feeling that this is a different game. And it doesn't only apply to the British players. It is equally special for the foreign ones as well."</p>
              <p>A clash with this particular member of the Old Firm holds unique allure for Ferguson, a former Rangers player. But United are focused on getting the point that will secure a place in the knock-out stages with a game to spare.</p>
              <p>"If we get a draw we will be through," said Park. "But we are not going there to get one point. We want three. If we get through the manager can rest a few players for the last game, which is a far better option for home when you consider the number of league games and other cup ties we still have to deal with."</p>

              <p>Boring first half. United never step up a gear when it was clear that Ranger played the "Park Bus" tactics with Kenny Miller the lone targetman upfront. The rest of the outfield players are all behind the ball.</p>
              <p>Giggs looks out of sorts. So many mistimed passes and lousy first touch.</p>
              <p>Berbatov is getting on my nerve with his constant complains. Same goes to Nani, who goes down at the slightest contact. Mental game maybe?</p>
              <p>Rooney lack of match fitness and lack of understanding with his teammates is obvious. He is also lacking of confidence to take a shot.</p>
              <p>Lets hope for a better 2nd half. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>So Rooney did score although it was via a penalty which I personally felt that Naismith should have been shown a straight red for that X-Rated Challenge on Fabio. A few more inches up and Fabio is sure to be concussed.</p>
              <p>An average performance by United but at times like this where anything more than a draw away from home is considered a better performance. Oh well, United qualified for the next round. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
