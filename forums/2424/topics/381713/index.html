              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> has admitted he was wrong to mouth '12 men' to a TV camera in the aftermath of Manchester United's controversial defeat to Chelsea on Sunday. Rooney also pledged his future to United and claimed he must win the World Cup with England to become a true great of the game, ahead of England's friendly with Brazil.</p>
              <p>United felt hard done by for both Martin Atkinson's award of the free kick against <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8871"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Darren Fletcher</span></a> that led to Chelsea's goal, and apparent interference by <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=18727"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Didier Drogba</span></a> as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8931"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">John Terry</span></a>'s header floated inside the far post. As Rooney left the pitch, he implied down the lens of a TV camera that the referee had been on Chelsea's side.</p>
              <p>"I probably should not have said it,'' he said. "I was disappointed at the end of the game and felt we deserved more out of it. Your emotions are high at the end. I felt we didn't get the decisions but that is the way it goes. It was probably our best performance of the season but it was a disappointing result."</p>
              <p>Rooney dashed the hopes of Barcelona and any other suitors by pledging his future to Manchester United, revealing he expects to open talks over a contract extension at some point over the next few months.</p>
              <p>The Catalan giants are thought to be interested in adding Rooney to their impressive attacking arsenal while old team-mate <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=22774"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></a> has issued a cheeky "come and join us'' plea from Real Madrid. Ronaldo admitted Rooney had the perfect home at Old Trafford and it's a view Rooney concurs with.</p>
              <p>Holding court in Doha, ahead of England's glamour friendly with Brazil, Rooney revealed his hopes for the future. And they all revolve around United.</p>
              <p>"It is nice to be noticed but I have said before, I am really happy at United,'' he said. "Unless they tell me otherwise, I can't see myself leaving. I have got two years left on my contract after this year and I am sure we will be negotiating a new deal in the next few months. I love the place. It is 30 minutes from home and all my family, and I have got a great chance of winning trophies.''</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Rooney claimed he must win the World Cup to join the the true greats of the game - and played down the status of his former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo given he hasn't made that achievement.</p>
              <p>"There are players like George Best and (Cristiano) Ronaldo who are geniuses,'' he said. "But if you want to be compared to players like Romario and Ronaldo and be up there with them, I feel you have to win a World Cup.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldo was one of the best, if not the best, forward ever. When he was at Barcelona, the things he did were incredible. In later years, Ronaldinho and Kaka were both world player of the year. For me to be considered among that group of players, I must win the World Cup with England.''</p>
              <p>Rooney is very much like Ronaldo in the way he goes about his task and the strength he can use to bulldoze opposition defenders away from the ball. But Rooney feels <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7976"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joe Cole</span></a> is much closer than he is to the style of a Brazilian player.</p>
              <p>"Obviously, I am happy when people say I play like a Brazilian because I love the way Brazilians play, but there are other players in the England team who are a lot more skilful than me; Joe Cole, for example,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"I know Ronaldo was powerful, strong and tough but he was also skilful as well. The time he went clean through, did four stepovers and sent the goalkeeper the wrong way, that was one of the best goals I have ever seen. I never really try skills but when you see Joe Cole, he is more skilful than me.''</p>
