              <p><strong>Sunderland manager Roy Keane has supported Cristiano Ronaldo's fight to leave Manchester United by saying clubs are just as disloyal as the players.</strong></p>
              <p>The Irishman is still hurt at the way he was forced out of Old Trafford after sterling service for The Red Devils when a controversial unbroadcast MUTV interview saw him openly criticise his team-mates individually and signal the beginning of the end of his United career.</p>
              <p>Although he is strongly fancied to return to Manchester one day to manage the European champions, Keane has clearly not forgotten the way in which he was swiftly ushered out of the club.</p>
              <p>Despite not referring specifically to his former team-mate, Keane did state that his advice to players is to look after themselves. "I think it's always been the case if players fancy leaving and make it hard for a manager and their attitude isn't up to scratch, then you sell them," he declared.</p>
              <p>"Having said that, in defence of players, when a club is finished with you, they get rid. "My advice is look after yourself. If you get a chance for bigger and better things, then go for it. "I've experienced that myself.</p>
              <p>"People question players' loyalty. I question clubs' loyalty. "It's a business to them. If you're not needed then you can be out of the door in 10 minutes, and I'm speaking from experience. "It works both ways."</p>

              <p>Roy Keane may have had his experience, and chance to do bigger and better things. Good for him.</p>
              <p>But if Ronaldo wants to screw himself over by going to RM, good for him as well. Can't be bothered anymore.</p>

              <p>Keane is a loose cannon... I didn't like him even before the day they sack him... He was a frequent troublemaker... I think he was the only one that always thought he was bigger than the club...</p>
              <p>To think he himself hold the club to ransom with his contract demands and wanted to be the club's highest paid player regardless of who join later... And the club even gave in to him...</p>
              <p>The way he was sack was rather befitting for a loose cannon... Fergie put up with his nonsense for far too long even when he was playing like shit towards his last few seasons... I always said he has the behaviour to be the next Jose Mourinho... And to think Fergie still helped him when he became a manager... Had Fergie not help him with so many loan players to Sunderland... They would still be in League One.</p>
              <p>What an ungrateful dog himself...</p>

              <p>I think some of your views here are rather out of touch. If anything, Keane's only problem was being too much of a realist which may not be acceptable to many (especially those who choose to live in denial). As far as his take on this issue goes, it's pretty much just a stance of his throughout his career - and he has been on both sides of the coin in that time - and this did not come just at the end when he was shown the door.</p>
              <p>After all, here is a man who turned down Kenny Dalglish's Blackburn at the eleventh hour despite having all but sealed a deal having verbally agreed to sign for them on a Monday, only for United to hijack that deal during the weekend prior to that. Throw in the fact that he brokered a new deal that broke United's then wage structure in 1999 and it might be easy to label him as an opportunist waiting to cash in and exploit any situation to his advantage.</p>
              <p>That said, for all those who criticised his style of negotiating his contract, it's easy to forget all he said was he wanted to be paid something that reflected his worth and unlike some players at other illustrious clubs, he did not actually have any clause inserted in his contract that set him out to be the highest earner at the club. On the contrary, after signing his contract, it was he who said he didn't care how much others at the club earned when they signed their new contracts after him and he had done so only to look after his interests. To be fair, the offer he ultimately accepted at United was hardly the highest that had been offered to him at that point in time - Bayern and Real had publicly and distinctly bandied around figures far higher than what United were reported to have offered Keane.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, while those examples may reveal a side of Keane that is obssessed with self-interest, it's equally easy to forget here was someone who stood on the side of Jaap Stam when he was controversially sold to Lazio after falling out with Fergie. If anything, the fact he suggested footballers were treated like "expensive pieces of meat" back then had already revealed an indication of his stance in the belief that players are effectively just commodities for the clubs. The fact he made the statement then could hardly have been for self-interest since he only left United some 4 years later.</p>
              <p>Likewise, his criticisms of United's performances in the aftermath of the Boro game was something that had been blatantly obvious to any objective neutral observer. While his delivery may have been harsh, his verdict was hardly misplaced as United sank to a pathetic low by their own lofty standards that season with their first elimination in the Champions League group stages.</p>
              <p>Say what you want about Keane's manner of delivery, I reckon his objectivity and pragmatism has - over the years - more often been spot on than not and I'd hardly think there's too much for him to be bitter about over an issue for which he has been on both sides of the coin.</p>

              <p>Too much of a realist? Well, thank goodness there isn't too many out there and especially in the United team...</p>
              <p>Keane was and still is a self centred figure... His earlier years in the United squad were great, almost every United fan love him. But unfortunately, like with most great players, he let it got to his head and it give him the impression that he was indispensable to them...</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about his stand, we could see Keane has a very revengeful character throughout his playing career... The guy deliberately inflict a knee high injury to Alf-Inge Haland in the last 5 mins of a match between United and City... Many believed it was an act of revenge from an earlier foul and later Keane proudly acknowledged it in his autobiography in 2002 in which he stated he intended to hurt Haland on purpose... This in itself was a disgraceful act that no fan even United should support him for.</p>
              <p>You are right that he did went back on his words and agreement with Blackburn on the eleventh hour so as to join United... But what was Blackburn then... In 1992, Blackburn were just a newly promoted side from the old division one league... Something like Stoke City today or Sunderland last year... Of course Keane being like almost every other player, jump at the chance... So what was loyally or his words even in those days... we could very well see his take on this already... And yet just last year, he criticized players of not wanting to join Sunderland cos there wasn't enough shopping centres for their girlfriends to shop in... Yeah I would say definitely from both side of the coin but from different views which suit his cause better...</p>
              <p>Here was a Keane that only thought about himself when in 1992, sensing Forest could be relegated, negotiated a new contract which had a relegation escape clause inserted. The negotiations were lengthy and troublesome just like the one he had with United until then manager Brian Clough described Keane as a "greedy child". Anyway, i don't know where you got your info that he don't have a clause of being the highest paid player at United, cos i recalled i read it before...</p>
              <p>And "To be fair, the offer he ultimately accepted at United was hardly the highest that had been offered to him at that point in time" ?</p>
              <p>Like you have said, he broke United's then wage structure. Although I am not too sure but I think he was the first $100k player in United and maybe even the Premiership and that wasn't high enough? The rumour with Bayern and Real... were just plain rumour. It wasn't as tho there was an offer on the table like Lampard today...</p>
              <p>Keane's swell headed behaviour seem to have no end... Just like in the 2002 World Cup, he demanded this and that and everything else and brought disruptive feelings into the Ireland squad until he was sent home... He had no respect for the manager and openly argue with him in front of all the other players... Coincidentally, Ireland went on to have one of their best WC showing after his expulsion from the squad. Just like United went on to do better after his sacking... Keane was a disruptive force and the younger players were afraid of him...</p>
              <p>On Stam, its hard to say but Keane was in the midst of negotiating a contract of his own then as well so its hard to say if he wasn't in it for self interest too...</p>
              <p>To summarize it, I would just say Keane is becoming like Jose Mourinho but unfortunately in behaviour only... In managerial skill, he still has a very long way to go... But looking at his purchased like Richardson for $5, 6 million... I feel he will never get to Jose of Fergie's level... and he may even shoot himself in the foot again with Sunderland like he has done so with most of the employer he had...</p>

              <p>Are you on another bout of your deluded binge-drinking? For the record, Blackburn finished fourth (92/93) in the season before his transfer to Man Utd.</p>
              <p>Firstly, what's new in a relegation-release clause? It's not a marriage you're talking about, is it? Do you expect a player to stick by a club through thick and thin if circumstances change midway through the agreement? If you're going to criticise Keane for holding out for something he believed to reflect his worth (and he clearly wasn't deluded considering the terms he wanted would have been matched by other clubs if United weren't prepared to offer), are you in turn going to criticise Ferguson and Man Utd for their sloppy treatment of Stam and Beckham? Maybe you'd like to engineer a defence for Fergie's overnight turnaround of wanting to offload Stam after hailing him as "one of the greatest defenders this club will ever see" when he first signed him?</p>
              <p>Apparently, it seems you have a problem separating fantasy from reality in that players - just like club management - are perfectly entitled to hold out for a deal in which their respective interests are properly secured.</p>
              <p>For the record, you may wish to consult this : <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/10/19/sfnman20.xml">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/10/19/sfnman20.xml</a> . When Keane put pen to paper on his new deal in 2001 (<span style="color: #ff0000;">and that's his last contract at United</span>), he had become the highest paid player in the Premiership at that time. Surely, if there was a clause in his contract that pegged his wages to the highest paid at the club, he wouldn't have gone on about a certain footballer who was earning £120,000-a-week who had apparently not pulled his weight in his infamous rant on MUTV, would he?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>And "To be fair, the offer he ultimately accepted at United was hardly the highest that had been offered to him at that point in time" ?</p>
              <p>Like you have said, he broke United's then wage structure. Although I am not too sure but I think he was the first $100k player in United and maybe even the Premiership and that wasn't high enough? The rumour with Bayern and Real... were just plain rumour. It wasn't as tho there was an offer on the table like Lampard today...</p>
              <p>Keane's swell headed behaviour seem to have no end... Just like in the 2002 World Cup, he demanded this and that and everything else and brought disruptive feelings into the Ireland squad until he was sent home... He had no respect for the manager and openly argue with him in front of all the other players... Coincidentally, Ireland went on to have one of their best WC showing after his expulsion from the squad. Just like United went on to do better after his sacking... Keane was a disruptive force and the younger players were afraid of him...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rumours? Are you deluded yet again? Are Karl Heinz Rummenige and Florentino Perez fictitious characters from your deluded superheroes series? Or were they real folks who held the helm at Bayern and Real Madrid respectively? So if those blokes actually came out and stated what they had offered, are you for a moment suggesting they're rumours? Oh hang on...or are you going to suggest Lampard's offer from Inter is also a rumour? If not, how do you justify his offers being genuine but not Keane's?</p>
              <p>Obviously the source of your readings are dubious enough. For the record, a full interview with Keane on this issue can be found at <a href="http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/17072008/4/loyalty-way-street-keane.html">http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/17072008/4/loyalty-way-street-keane.html</a> . Ostensibly, the report you've cited omitted certain quotes in them to dispel and distort the appropriate context upon which those comments are made.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, you may wish to note you've forgotten to include the following quotes from the article you quoted from :</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">I am 50-50</span>. I am the manager of a football club now, but it only seems like yesterday I was playing."</p>
              <p>"I don't really know what is going on at United with Ronaldo and <span style="color: #ff0000;">I wouldn't like to comment on it</span>, but there have been other cases and other situations. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I do believe, generally speaking, it works both ways</span>."</p>
              <p>Clearly, it wouldn't be hard to observe Keane was actually giving his views on the issue of loyalty rather than advocating Ronaldo's move to Real Madrid, is it? Or are statements of opinions and facts too convoluted for your substantially challenged intellect to tell them apart?</p>
              <p>Perhaps, reading more tabloids and upholding their biased reports (if you had read the whole interview, how the topic could even reasonably be entitled "Bitter Keane supports Ronaldo" is beyond me) as gospel truths might suit you fine. I'm not sure if anyone capable of rational reasoning would fine that acceptable though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>On Stam, its hard to say but Keane was in the midst of negotiating a contract of his own then as well so its hard to say if he wasn't in it for self interest too...</p>
              <p>To summarize it, I would just say Keane is becoming like Jose Mourinho but unfortunately in behaviour only... In managerial skill, he still has a very long way to go... But looking at his purchased like Richardson for $5, 6 million... I feel he will never get to Jose of Fergie's level... and he may even shoot himself in the foot again with Sunderland like he has done so with most of the employer he had...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a classic case of believe-what-you-want, isn't it? Amazingly, even for the consiracy theories often abound that sound ludicrous, this has got to be as ludicrous as it gets? Stam was shown the door inside 168 hours of Lazio initiating contact and the deal took place in August 2001. Keane's contract was signed in October 2001 and it was a record-breaking deal that had no bearing on the Stam saga? So what reasonable conflicts of interests between the two episodes are you drawing to back up your conspiracy theory?</p>
              <p>Lastly, nowhere did I - or anyone for that matter - suggest Keane has proven his worth as a manager. How you can draw such frivolous conclusions to discredit the man is beyond me. You could do by keeping the scope of your discussion to simply Keane's take on loyalty instead of going all and sundry firing on a "loose canon" that hardly helps to reconcile the merits of your argument with reality...</p>

              <p>Wah your post is so long and messy i get a headache just from trying to read it...</p>
              <p>Ok, to this day, I still agree what Fergie did with him was absolutely correct. Sacking him was the correct thing to do. He may have defended him at times like all managers do but on certain incident like the one on Alf-Inge Haland... there was no two ways about it... What Keane did wasn't like the incidents you have mentioned, where it was spontaneous... This was a premeditated assault, it wasn't just within a match, it was for a match played much earlier in the season... Thats what made it worse.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you may care to take a look at this clip and you can understand better what actually happened...</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_st29mlQwU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_st29mlQwU</a></p>
              <p>Having watched the clip, I think Keane actually tried to dive to earn a penalty in an earlier match... But Alf-Inge Haland came over and told him not to fake it. Keane being Keane, kept it for a few months and the next time they met again, he waited until the last 5 mins to take his revenge... From this incident alone, we can see the bitterness he harboured. This is the character of the man. This is the point i am making... The bitterness in him doesn't go away easily...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry I don't indulge in binge-drinking... The story goes like this... Blackburn was promoted in mid 1992, Kenny Dalglish had spoken to Keane about the possibility of a move at the end of that season (1993)... With Forest struggling, Keane had a clause inserted in his new improved contract with Forest with an eye to join Blackburn should Forest go down. At the end of that season when Forest did went down, Blackburn agreed a £4 million fee for Keane with Forest, and Keane soon agreed a contract with them too only to go back on his words and agreement with Dalglish...</p>
              <p>On Stam, well... we can say it was either a mistake or it was good business...</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Fergie:</p>
              <p>In a speech in his home city of Glasgow, the United boss admitted selling Stam was a mistake. "We got the offer from Lazio, £16.5million for a centre-back who was 29," said Fergie. "It was an offer I couldn't refuse. But in playing terms it was a mistake because he is still playing for Ajax at a really good level. At the time he had just come back from an Achilles injury and we thought he had just lost a little bit."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>There was no guarantee that Stam could continue to play at the top level after his injuries and coming to 30 yrs old... $16.6 million for a defended at that time was alot of money. Of course, Stam turned out to be able to continue for another 3, 4 yrs at top level but had he not, how?</p>
              <p>Karl Heinz Rummenige and Florentino Perez... Hmmm yeah hear of their names... yup rumour... I don't recall they had any offer on the table for him? Lampard currently have a concrete offer with actual $$$ mentioned... Did Keane had any then? Just like today, how many players are currently link to United? Don't have 20 also got 10... But Fergie today said they have only made one (1) offer to a player believe to be Berbatov... Like i said, rumours...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I asked you... who was Keane to condemn the 6 young players and assistant manager Carlos Queiroz? Was he the manager? No, He was just a player who was on a $100k per week deal himself and was he performing on the field?</p>
              <p>A lot of talk and blaming and yet couldn't bring it himself when called upon to play... It so typical for someone who was great at one time but was on the wane and couldn't accept it and started blaming others for the team's under performance...</p>
              <p>I would just say again, Keane is a loose cannon and becoming like Jose Mourinho but without the managerial skill yet... He has a very long way to go by the looks of his pursue of 4 Spurs squad players for over $20 million... But he is still new to management and that could explain his current views... But he may change it when he has been a manager for much longer...  </p>

              <p>You'd get a headache separating fantasy from reality given your limited intellectual capacity anyway, so what's new?</p>
              <p>Your "story" is as credible as Ferguson's justification for offloading Stam. You may wish to get the facts of your "story" right by first reading in-depth what Haaland had said to Keane when Keane tore his cruciate ligaments, instead of concocting a "story" that revolves around a "dive to earn a penalty". Go read up on the real issue before coming back to shift your goalposts further by diluting the geist of the issue at hand.</p>
              <p>Your other "story" about Blackburn is no less colourful. For the record, tonnes of players insert minimum fee release clauses and relegation clauses, among other things. If such deals are negotiated in good faith to both parties at the time these deals are signed, who are you to whine about the merits of the obligations both parties have committed themselves to?</p>

              <p>So engaging in another bout of deluded schizophrenia to defend a hapless point, aren't you? You must be getting pretty desperate in trying to ram home the point of how a player approaching 30 was suddenly having his pedigree coming under fire and offloaded with such desperation when he had still been a regular feature in the side prior to the serialization of his autobiography...</p>
              <p>How long have you been a fan, really? Just yesterday? Amazing you know nuts about the issues I'm talking about and still taking a pot shot helplessly. The sort of "rumours" Rummenige and Perez had dangled to Keane are as real as your obssession with Inter's offer to Lampard. So how would you like to define a rumour? Anything that doesn't materialise in reality becomes a rumour?</p>

Would you like to show me some reports that suggest Keane had a clause in his contract that categorically stated his salary was pegged to the highest earner at the club?</p>
              <p>For someone desperately throwing all and sundry to discredit a chap who effectively gave an objective assessment on the issue of loyalty, yet persistently shifts the goalposts to mask your ignorance and lack of mental fortitude in churning out any reasonable claims is indeed laughable. No wonder you've got headache from making sense of something that doesn't conform with your warped version of reality.</p>
              <p>A loose canon he may be, but he certainly makes more sense than the loose canon in here going on and on about blatantly irrelevant points that can't withstand the test of scrutiny.</p>

              <p>My point to you on this whole subject and topic is : how does this incident suggest anything about his statement on the subject of loyalty?</p>
              <p>Instead of chucking out a bus-load of irrelevant issues, why don't you try reconciling your examples to the very issue you've been harping on and on about from the outset (even before my first post in this thread)?</p>

              <p>Really? And thanks to your link, I got the info that Keane became Britain's highest paid footballer at that time of signing... And this was hardly highest to you?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks to my link, you might wish to be enlightened your erroneous views that Keane had a clause inserted in his contract that pegged his wages to the club's highest earner is as ridiculous as your other claims so far in this thread. Are you that desperate to argue against facts?</p>
              <p>Before you decide to take my words out of context to win a futile argument with little merit, I said his wages - at the time of his departure from Man Utd - not being highest at the club was evidence of the fact he never had a contract that pegged his wages to the highest earner. Now, what has that got to do with the fact that he was the highest paid player at the time he penned his new contract? Perhaps, it's high time you went back to attend basic grammar classes if you can't tell the two instances apart.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Do you need me to recommend a basic grammar school for you? That might be a more dire need of yours in view of your hopelessly incoherent comprehension of fundamental logic.</p>
              <p>Failing which, I'm happy to stand corrected if you could dig up something concrete to back up your fallacious arguments instead of happily switching stance upon having your points rebutted with evidence to the contrary.</p>

              <p>The player I worship? Have you mistaken a sense of interpreting a simple statement objectively for an obssession?</p>
              <p>Is your grasp of the language so woeful you could actually mistake my challenging the merits of your title of "Bitter Keane supports Ronaldo" on the basis of flimsy, biased reporting for an obssession with a subject in the report itself?</p>
              <p>If I were to start talking about the subjects of my worship, you'd be even more incoherent than you already are considering your memory on events in the early 2000's are as foggy and credible as your incoherent logic. Then again, you'd do well by making proper sense of statements quoted in the appropriate context for starters...</p>

              <p>The constant attack on Fergie since he was sack and now after his Sunderland has been promoted is very disappointing... For a period, when he first started in management, he called Fergie not only for advise but also help with players loan...

              <p>Take a look at the pattern he has taken throughout his career, it won't be too far off to think he could still be bitter over the way he was sack.</p>
              <p>This is a person that certainly doesn't show any gratitude despite what Fergie has done for him...

              <p>Its a good thing that Fergie has taken back Johnny Evans and Danny Simpson and decided not to loan them to him again now... Maybe this could probably make him angry again... lol</p>
              <p>What I am saying here is... Look around, when others like Johnsen, Schmeichel, Irwin, Sheringham, Strachan, Pallister, Bruce, Ince, Beckham, ... even Cantona who is more deserving than him doesn't go on such a crusade... Even if he has nothing better to say, he can at least keep his mouth shut... But apparently Keane seems to jump in the moment the chances arises... This whole thing isn't just about Ronaldo...

              <p>Lest I forget, you may wish to note that your propensity for quoting articles blindly is mind-boggling at the very least. You may like to consider re-looking at the thread entitled "Berba will be the new Cantona" and the garb you quoted blindly as follows :</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sir Alex himself is positive the deal will be completed, complimenting the Bulgarian and hopeful of discussing a transfer with Tottenham Hotspur shortly. "We have good expectations this deal will go through," said Sir Alex. "Berbatov has been impressive for a long time and would be a great addition to our attack.</span></p>

              <p>So, are you such a dimwit you can't look beyond tabloid reports whose credibility are no better than yours and simply paste attention-grabbing quotes up without first independently verifying the authenticity of such sweeping statements? Or would you, in your defence, <span style="color: #ff0000;">like to argue such statements are actually a matter of fact</span> just because you've found them somewhere else and that Ferguson was lying when he said he didn't make those comments? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/sunglasses.png" alt="sunglasses.png"></p>
              <p>Perhaps, staying away from tabloids would be a good start if you can't tell opinions and facts apart. Then again, can you even identify tabloids in the first place?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Firstly, regardless of the avenue through which views are expressed, logic remains logic.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As a matter of fact, I am still waiting for you to clarify how Keane's interview - when viewed in its appropriate context (a source of which I've included for you lest you're overwhelmed by the task of finding it) - would justifiably come across as bitter.</span> Your quoting and taking other incidents into account does not, on its own merit, render it appropriate to cast aspersions and distort the credibility of the words taken in its original context "bitter", does it?</p>
              <p>Given your limited intellect, let's rephrase it another way. I can't reasonably expect to call someone who has stolen something a "murderer" and expect whoever's listening to be able to decipher I am actually referring to an act of theft from the term "murderer", does it? This is simple logic, not an opinion.</p>
              <p>By the same token, I'm still waiting for you to clear up your warped perception of how "I belief in a forum, everything is more or less an opinion but some are facts" stands at the expense of opinions actually defying logic.</p>
              <p>For the record, lest your messed-up analytical process has misled you, the statement "<em>On Keane taking revenged on Haaland, this is a fact!</em>" is an opinion. The act of Keane lunging into Haaland is, however, a fact.</p>
              <p>After all, the credibility of an eye-witness is only limited to giving a take of an event that actually happens, and not assess the motive (or lack of) behind the event, isn't it?</p>

              <p>Lastly, I think using "big words" and all that to disguise a post to make it look impressive is ok but on close examination, post with little substance, will come across like one big messy drivel... You spent so much of your last post on me rather than on the points of the topic... thats getting weird... We are in a forum here... and belief me, just use simple words like everyone here and you will still get the message across nicely...</p>
              <p>I am rather surprise that for all the "big words" you cast around frivolously, you don't seem to grasp simple stuff...

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, what's "big"? Are you going to tell me "big words" is a fact in the sense that everyone will unambiguously agree on the same definitions of what constitutes a "big word"? If not, what even makes you think I'm using these "big words" to impress you? As a matter of fact, I was only using words I thought would best describe and convey my thoughts. What business is it of mine should you choose to view them as "impressive" and "big" due to your linguistic incompetence and/or intellectual handicap?</p>
              <p>Just to illustrate the merits of this point, I'm sure someone who's linguistically more gifted than I am will hardly find my words "big" or "impressive". At best, these are mere words that convey my thoughts. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Apparently, now that you're done with sorting out the notion that "big words" are subjective, it is indeed amazing you could actually regard something blatantly illogical to the rational mind as "simple stuff". Believe me, if you would so much as spend time attending basic grammar lessons and hone your critical thinking skills in the process, you would have little trouble putting across more cogent arguments instead of hopelessly insisting opinions as statements of fact!</p>
              <p>Oh, and do yourself a favour - you may wish to consult some other decent publications before blindly quoting anything from tabloids in the future and it may jolly well save you the agony of trying to explain a moot point which is lost on most rational folks... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Already says it all... I have already said its not just about Ronaldo, loyalty, or anything else, its more about the character's general feeling of bitterness towards Fergie and the club.</p>
              <p>First of all, perhaps you can start by telling us here your opinion on his attack on Haaland... I won't even bring out the Mick McCarthy and his behaviour in the Ireland team.The questions are rather simple but you don't seem to be giving us here a straight answer... So in order not to be given more ambiguous replies, I have made it simple for you with a YES or NO reply... But before answering them, maybe it would be good to have a quick read of Keane's autobiography first... And an admission that the tackle was in fact a premeditated assault...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Do you think it was revenge motivated?  -  YES / NO ?</li>
              <li>For someone who could wait 4 years, whats your opinion of this?</li>
              <li>For the way he went about to planned and carried out his attack (waited till last 5 mins of the match) -  whats your opinion to this?</li>
              <li>And thanks to you, I have read in-depth what Haaland supposingly had said to Keane... (criticised Keane for the nature of the tackle and suggested that he was feigning injury to avoid punishment) So in your opinion, does it render such a vicious attack on a fellow player?  -  YES / NO ?</li>
              <li>And is it still your opinion that it was "one of those foolish things he did as has been done by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so many other players</span>" ?  -  YES / NO</li>
              <li>Do you think Keane was bitter over Haaland's comments? - YES / NO</li>
              <li>In your honest opinion, Do you think Keane show signs of a retaliative character?  -  YES / NO</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p>The Press are known to may have stretched it a little at times for the sake of sensationalizing it. This isn't something that is unknown to us who read them regularly. But to claim that all are falsehood is also incorrect... </p>
              <p>Always blaming on the Press alone is rather odd cos there is no smoke without fire is there? One time, you can say its mis-quoted, Second time, maybe really badly mis-quoted, third or more times? Maybe a characteristics pattern developing perhaps? Or you may care to reason yourself out of it by giving us here your views as to this... </p>
              <p></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Why is it always Keane being "mis-quoted" and not Schmeichel, Irwin, Sheringham, Strachan, Pallister, Bruce, Ince, Hughes, Beckham or Cantona? </li>
              </ul>
              <p>It leave us to wonder doesn't it like why its always Keane and not the others? Bruce just had his say recently but why wasn't he "mis-quoted" ? Or does Keane still has a hidden bitterness towards Fergie for his sacking? It shouldn't be too surprising even if he does from his characteristic qualities... But this is just an opinion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So to you, I can't separate opinions from facts two months on? This is how you look at it? When all i said then was the G14 is no longer in existence... Period.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>So was what I said a fact or not? ... YES / NO ?</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cos you returned with his reply:</p>
              <p>You must be fairly deluded to even believe the G14 is no longer in existence when directors/executives from those clubs still meet regularly (check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-14 just in case you haven't got a clue what G14 stands for). Or are you so bored you've decided to challenge facts when you can't withstand your opinions being challenged?</p>
              <p>Honestly, I have no problem with my opinions being challenged, I welcome them actually. I only don't find it good when someone twist and turn theirs for the sake of any discussion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>So should i take this as your opinion or your facts now? Am I to say that when you made this statement, it was just your opinion in reply to the G14 is no longer in existence? Cos your present reply that I still can't separate opinions from facts two months on seems to suggest it that way... I suggest you make yourself clear on this and not give us another ambiguous reply.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are telling me that its just your opinion now, Then i will more or less get the full picture. You conveniently changed your "facts" into an opinion and let your opinion be taken as facts until its expose?   </p>
              <p>I no longer need a reply to your suppose Karl Heinz Rummenige and Florentino Perez offer to Keane anymore, as i am more or less quite clear whats it all about now...</p>
              <p>As again, I like to state that the thread title is about...</p>
              <p><strong>The post is purely about Keane the person, The characteristic of the man. The way he has behave over the years... The pattern of actions the man takes... The grudge he could bear against those he felt had done him wrong... Nothing else... Go and take a look at today's Straits Times page S23 to understand better.</strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>So did you check out Sat's paper? Anyway, I can't belief it when even in a Friendly match, Keane as a manager can get sent-off... I can't recall when was the last time a manager was sent off in a pre-season match... Do you? That more or less show us the character he is...</p>
              <p></p>

              <p>Another bout of delusion dictating your irrational actions? Is it beyond your dense skull to figure your title is illogical when viewed in the complete context of Keane's words? Or are you deranged beyond salvation such that anything which remotely casts aspersions on the accuracy of your statements (which seems to be an eternal trend anyway) regarded as a sense of spite on the part of anyone reading your statements?</p>
              <p>Have you gone for your basic grammar classes yet to ascertain the distinction between statements of opinions and facts, instead of haplessly posting long tales with little in way of substance?</p>

              <p>Maybe you could answer the part in red by first going over a dictionary and understand the term "bitter" and try explaining how it applies to an article which you have obviously misquoted as a consequence of your intellectual handicap.</p>

Are you that desperate that you're actually at your wit's end towards substantiating an argument which had no merits to begin with?</p>
              <p>Was your first post not meant to address what was obviously a statement of opinion on the issue of loyalty? Was your second post (and that was before I even posted my thread) not ramblings to substantiate what is in your view, his poor character to justify his bitterness when he had none to begin? In short, were you not trying to distort the objectivity of the article by painting a bias slant in the hope of having people come round to buy your deluded opinion which you tried portraying as "fact"?</p>
              <p>To illustrate how acutely deluded you're in claiming Keane harbours ill-feelings towards "Fergie and the club", you may wish to check out <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/sportsnews/topstories/2008/05/14/roy-keane-backs-fergie-to-wipe-out-liverpool-records-89520-20417251/">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/sportsnews/topstories/2008/05/14/roy-keane-backs-fergie-to-wipe-out-liverpool-records-89520-20417251/</a> . Would someone harbouring ill-feelings actually wish his nemesis well? Obviously, you haven't done sufficient homework, have you? It's incredibly amazing how you could have ostensibly overlooked an article from your favourite tabloids and making general sweeping statements with little to back you up. Oops, as if that wasn't ridiculous enough, when you're presented with evidence to the contrary of your nonsensical claims, you actually resort to challenging the validity of the "evidence" which you so desperately seek.</p>
              <p>As for Keane being mis-quoted, he wasn't. You were the one who mis-quoted him with the aid of some tabloid reports whose entire interview excerpt was not even present! Surely, if you've got a vendetta against someone, you'd at least do your homework to ascertain the credibility and completeness of your sources, shouldn't you?</p>
              <p>So, gonna retract your statement "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>its more about the character's general feeling of bitterness towards Fergie and the club</em></span>"? Or should this go down as <span style="color: #0000ff;">one of the countless faux pas</span> that is an indispensable part of your shallow facade? <img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>
              <p>To blur the lines further, you may now wish to shift the discussion towards Keane's well-wishes to United in May, rather than substantiate how he was being bitter in his statements. After all, shifting the goalposts aimlessly to cover your alarming and burgeoning factual errors is the new order of the day, ain't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>

              <p>You must be fairly deluded to even believe the G14 is no longer in existence when directors/executives from those clubs still meet regularly (check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-14 just in case you haven't got a clue what G14 stands for). Or are you so bored you've decided to challenge facts when you can't withstand your opinions being challenged?</p>
              <p>Honestly, I have no problem with my opinions being challenged, I welcome them actually. I only don't find it good when someone twist and turn theirs for the sake of any discussion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>So should i take this as your opinion or your facts now? Am I to say that when you made this statement, it was just your opinion in reply to the G14 is no longer in existence? Cos your present reply that I still can't separate opinions from facts two months on seems to suggest it that way... I suggest you make yourself clear on this and not give us another ambiguous reply. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are telling me that its just your opinion now, Then i will more or less get the full picture. You conveniently changed your "facts" into an opinion and let your opinion be taken as facts until its expose?   </p>
              <p>I no longer need a reply to your suppose Karl Heinz Rummenige and Florentino Perez offer to Keane anymore, as i am more or less quite clear whats it all about now...</p>

              <p>And since you could clearly remember saying "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I also did mention that "I stood corrected" on the issue of G14".</span></p>
              <p>Ok, now since you have already stood corrected 2 months back, Then why is it so different from your post this morning ?</p>
              <p>All I said was (Aren't you the one that said I was in delusion to even believe the G14 is no longer in existence just roughly 2 months ago?)</p>
              <p>Amazingly, you came up with this reply... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You still can't separate opinions from facts two months on,</span></p>
              <p>So 2 months back, it was first your "facts" ... You said I must be fairly deluded to believe the G14 has been disbanded... then it became an opinion after I have provided you with the latest news on it?</p>
              <p>But after <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I stood corrected" on the issue of G14"</span>. You went on to say <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You still can't separate opinions from facts two months on</span>, Today?</p>
              <p>Man, why is it somehow i get a feeling you are twisting and turning your words...</p>
              <p>So, is it still an opinion or a fact now?  So your sentence this morning was what?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, on the first post, I guess you should know its not from me right... You can also find it on the Straits Times... It was from a press report... and sorry to disappoint you, the title also didn't came from me either... I guess its more or less a general feeling of Keane towards Fergie by some... So you see, its not just me who feel that way too... Just providing one positive report doesn't take away the negative ones does it? Here lead us to my question which you have conveniently ignore...</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Why is it always Keane being "mis-quoted" and not Schmeichel, Irwin, Sheringham, Strachan, Pallister, Bruce, Ince, Hughes, Beckham or Cantona? </li>
              </ul>
              <p>It leave us to wonder doesn't it ? Like why its always Keane and not the others? Bruce just had his say recently but why wasn't he "mis-quoted" ? So does Keane still has a hidden bitterness towards Fergie for his sacking ? Its possible, why not right?</p>
              <p>So what <span style="color: #000000;">magnanimity are you talking about? You were exposed and faced with undeniable facts right in front of you. Only then have you no choice but to concede unless you want everyone here to see you as a liar... Even so in such a fashion that seem rather disgraceful... How about on the other issues, either you ignore it or avoid them...</span></p>
              <p>Perhaps, if you care to provide us your honest opinion on these points, maybe we can start to establish the characteristic of the man and why some do feel he could still harbour ill-feeling towards Fergie or the club for the way he was sacked. And here lay the reason for the thread title. Its not inconceivable to think Keane may have such thoughts... Afterall, looking at his track record over the years... its not totally unthinkable...</p>
              <p>Like I said earlier, blaming on the Press alone is rather odd cos if One time, you can say its mis-quoted, Second time, maybe really badly mis-quoted, third or more times? Maybe we can see a characteristics pattern developing perhaps? Or you may care to reason yourself out of it by giving us your honest views to this... I really like to know your take on this...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Do you think it was revenge motivated?  -  YES / NO ? </li>
              <li>For someone who could wait 4 years, whats your opinion of this? </li>
              <li>For the way he went about to planned and carried out his attack (waited till last 5 mins of the match) -  whats your opinion to this? </li>
              <li>And thanks to you, I have read in-depth what Haaland supposingly had said to Keane... (criticised Keane for the nature of the tackle and suggested that he was feigning injury to avoid punishment) So in your opinion, does it render such a vicious attack on a fellow player?  -  YES / NO ? </li>
              <li>And is it still your opinion that it was "one of those foolish things he did as has been done by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so many other players</span>" ?  -  YES / NO </li>
              <li>Do you think Keane was bitter over Haaland's comments? - YES / NO </li>
              <li>In your honest opinion, Do you think Keane show signs of a retaliative character?  -  YES / NO </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before answer them, maybe it would be good to have a quick read of Keane's autobiography first... And an admission that the tackle was in fact a premeditated assault...</p>
              <p>I have put the clip here so that you can refresh your memory by watching it first then reply...</p>

              <p>Yup, you sure did provide us a link to challenged your "facts" that the G14 has not been disbanded But I later pointed out to you that the link you provided has not been updated remember?</p>

              <p>And what's your purpose of you quoting the part you underlined? Trying to shoot yourself in the foot further to ensure a total whitewash in this argument? Is your linguistic incompetence so drastic you can't actually comprehend the essence of what you've underlined is identical to what I stated in the post taken from the original thread?</p>
              <p>Why don't you quote the entire post from the thread you've gone to great lengths to dig up so as to spare me the effort of embarrassing you further on that count? <img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>
              <p>As if your confusion between reality and fantasy wasn't acute enough, from where would you derive the notion that I wasn't aware of your claims? Rather, the more pertinent point is : are you aware of what I was disputing? Apparently, from your valiantly desperate, albeit futile, attempt to engage in self-contradictory quoting, you don't. Either that or you must be having another bout of Schizophrenia...</p>
              <p>For the record, the "link" you provided that you claim had not been updated had in no way suggested the G14 had disbanded. Why don't you go over that again before embarrassing yourself further?</p>
              <p>Or lest you get too carried away in a lost cause, why don't you try explaining the countless faux pas you've unerringly and consistently produced? <span style="color: #ff0000;">For starters, how's explaining your embarrassment of your insistence that Keane was bitter about Fergie and the club because of the manner of his departure, despite evidence to the contrary? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Perhaps, you could start by defending the following lost cause of yours : "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>I have already said its not just about Ronaldo, loyalty, or anything else, its more about the character's general feeling of bitterness towards Fergie and the club." <img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></em></span></span></p>

              <p>And since you could clearly remember saying "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I also did mention that "I stood corrected" on the issue of G14".</span></p>

              <p>Are you deranged or deluded? Would you like to quote me in the appropriate context? If you're going to quote me on that one, the least you could do would be to quote the post in its entirety instead of just two liners from a post which was effectively dealing with the interpretation of what constitutes the G14, rather than whether the G14 is in existence. It was in that context that I said "whether they're functioning or not is another matter" as the geist of my point was to ensure you understood the term G14 referred to.</p>
              <p>Apparently, your imbecilic intellect has actually permitted your stupidity to scale new heights such that you actually associated that quote of mine with my "I stand corrected" on what was effectively another issue. Or is that simply another faux pas arising from you being retarded? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>
              <p>Perhaps, to illustrate the sequential logic (or lack thereof) that typically exemplifies your idiocy as demonstrated above, why not try concocting a case to justify another faux pas of yours : namely, making sense of how your first post in this thread actually justifies the ludicrous notion that <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"this post is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">purely</span></strong> about Keane the person" </span><span style="color: #000000;">? <img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></span></em></p>

              <p>Amazingly, you came up with this reply... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You still can't separate opinions from facts two months on,</span></p>
              <p>So 2 months back, it was first your "facts" ... You said I must be fairly deluded to believe the G14 has been disbanded... then it became an opinion after I have provided you with the latest news on it?</p>
              <p>But after <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I stood corrected" on the issue of G14"</span>. You went on to say <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You still can't separate opinions from facts two months on</span>, Today?</p>
              <p>Man, why is it somehow i get a feeling you are twisting and turning your words...</p>
              <p>So, is it still an opinion or a fact now?  So your sentence this morning was what?</p>

              <p>Am I twisting and turning or are you quoting me out of context and ramming words down my throat? Refer above to what I've explained in my defence of the G14 issue. Do consult someone who is linguistically more competent than yourself to interpret my words in its originally intended context. Apparently, your inability to view and comprehend statements made in the appropriate context is uniquely dire and exclusive to a dimwit. <span style="color: #0000ff;">It surely can be no coincidence that your frequent knack of misquoting others (from the tabloids to yours truly) can be so unbelievably abhorrent.</span> For starters, you may wish to consider attending basic grammar school to facilitate your comprehension.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, <span style="color: #ff0000;">addressing the parts in red</span> quoted above in the meantime might save you the ignominy of having need to twist and turn. If you wish to discuss anything more about the G14, first do yourself a favour and explain the ignominy and self-contradiction of what you've typed in red above... <img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"> That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as your colourful and exhaustive list of faux pas goes...</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Ok, on the first post, I guess you should know its not from me right... You can also find it on the Straits Times... It was from a press report... and sorry to disappoint you, the title also didn't came from me either... I guess its more or less a general feeling of Keane towards Fergie by some... So you see, its not just me who feel that way too... Just providing one positive report doesn't take away the negative ones does it? Here lead us to my question which you have conveniently ignore...</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Why is it always Keane being "mis-quoted" and not Schmeichel, Irwin, Sheringham, Strachan, Pallister, Bruce, Ince, Hughes, Beckham or Cantona? </li>
              </ul>
              <p>It leave us to wonder doesn't it ? Like why its always Keane and not the others? Bruce just had his say recently but why wasn't he "mis-quoted" ? So does Keane still has a hidden bitterness towards Fergie for his sacking ? Its possible, why not right?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Was he misquoted or did you misquote him? If your misinterpretation has arisen from your stupidity, there is hardly anyone capable of helping you.</p>
              <p>As far as I'm concerned (and yes, this is a prime example of an opinion lest you get confused between opinions and facts), Keane's comments in its relevant and appropriate context smacks of nothing but objectivity and hardly anything that resembles your brand of bitterness.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If anything, your desperate attempt to mount a character assassination by painting colourful pictures of his previous misdemeanour to distort the essence of the article you were quoting is the sharpest illustration of bitterness seen here thus far</span>.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>So what <span style="color: #000000;">magnanimity are you talking about? You were exposed and faced with undeniable facts right in front of you. Only then have you no choice but to concede unless you want everyone here to see you as a liar... Even so in such a fashion that seem rather disgraceful... How about on the other issues, either you ignore it or avoid them...</span></p>
              <p>Perhaps, if you care to provide us your honest opinion on these points, maybe we can start to establish the characteristic of the man and why some do feel he could still harbour ill-feeling towards Fergie or the club for the way he was sacked. And here lay the reason for the thread title. Its not inconceivable to think Keane may have such thoughts... Afterall, looking at his track record over the years... its not totally unthinkable...</p>

              <p>Your loose canon must be getting the better of you. Either that or your linguistic inaptitude has got to be so overwhelming that would even put a toddler to shame.</p>
              <p>As mentioned above, go over my words in its appropriate context instead of selectively plucking my words from its original context and re-applying them elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Although labelling you a "liar" would hardly look out of place in view of the hidden vendetta you've been carrying with you in your earnest attempts to forcefully paint the world the way you see them. Perhaps, a foolish liar like yourself would like to back up the statements you made in red for a start instead of beating around the bush? Oops, and did I advise you to at least master the art of lying convincingly if you're gonna con your way around? No wonder they say empty vessels make the most noise. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>
              <p>As for your point on Keane having "such thoughts" (whatever they may be, but I'm not commenting further until you've addressed your points in red above lest I get quoted out of context - yet again!), how does the possibility of him having "such thoughts" serve to convey his "bitterness" purely from the article you quoted? Trying to force your way through a lost cause when you obviously can't justify the rationale behind his "bitterness", aren't you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>At least, there's a wee bit of saving grace from you here, although the logic still leaves much to be desired. Read what I mentioned above - who's misquoting and misinterpreting him?</p>
              <p>On the basis of his interview <span style="color: #0000ff;">in full</span>, how anyone could conjure up the sort of distorted and warp logic as yours is beyond me. Was he misquoted or did you simply choose to believe what you want on the basis of your own perceptions and biases which are not necessarily founded?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Before answer them, maybe it would be good to have a quick read of Keane's autobiography first... And an admission that the tackle was in fact a premeditated assault...</blockquote>
              <p>You really need to enlist the help of a decent grammar school, don't you? For the record, what you're stating is still effectively an opinion. </p>
              <p>To illustrate your dire lack of common sense and pathetic comprehension of facts and opinions, are you for a moment telling me you'd be hanged just by walking into a police station confessing to having committed a murder without any other forms of validation to ascertain that a case of murder has indeed taken place? Or for that matter, would my telling you your mum having had an extramarital affair (which may or may not be true) necessarily translate to be true?</p>
              <p>Perhaps, coming back for another dose of logic would do you some good if you could digest the above.</p>
