The 25-year-old rejected a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, with Cardiff and Smith's former club Leeds interested in a short-term deal. </strong><br><br>Smith said: "I am not leaving, it is as simple as that. There has been a lot of speculation but I am going nowhere. "I feel I'm good enough to play in this team. I have always believed that." Smith added: "The manager gave me the option to go out on loan but I didn't want to. "I am sure he thought it was in the best interests of both myself and the club but I told him I believed I was good enough to play in his team when I am fit and he accepted that."<br><br>After overcoming serious injury suffered in an FA Cup tie at Liverpool last February, Smith now appears to be ready to challenge for a place in the team. The striker played 70 minutes of Tuesday night's charity match against a Europe XI - which United won 4-3. And since the departure of on-loan forward Henrik Larsson, back to his Swedish club Helsingborg, Smith senses an opening, particularly as Louis Saha and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer are not yet fit from their respective injuries.<br><br>Smith said: "If I had gone on loan and Ole and Louis had been injured and Henrik had gone, we would have been down to one striker. "There would have been nothing worse for me than to leave and be somewhere else when this club was short on strikers. "I don't want to be on loan somewhere else and miss the games coming up when I feel I can be an important part of this squad."<br><br></div>
