              <h1>Five Missing As United Head To South Africa</h1>
              <p>Hargreaves has joined Cristiano Ronaldo on the treatment table, while
              Edwin van der Sar, Patrice Evra and Nani were given an extended holiday
              after their appearances at Euro 2008.<br><br>Speculation suggested that
              Hargreaves’ injury was worse than The Red Devils were making public,
              but Ferguson insists that the problem is a recurrence of last season’s
              tendonitis, and not linked to the his worries at Bayern Munich.<br><br>"It was apparent as soon as he came back to training. It is the same as last year. Some people get these things," Ferguson said.<br><br>"Maybe re-starting training on the firmish grounds brings it on or maybe it is just an inherent problem.<br><br>"We
              are trying to sort it out now with injections. That is what we did last
              November and it worked. Hopefully these work and by the time we come
              back from South Africa he should be okay.<br><br>"Owen is not written off for the start of the season at all. I am sure he will be okay."<br><br>One
              player who will definitely feature is long-term absentee and captain
              Gary Neville, who has struggled with injury over the last 16 months,
              and Ferguson has reiterated that the 33-year old will have the
              opportunity to win back his place in the side from Wes Brown.<br><br>"For
              Gary in particular this trip is very important. He came through his 45
              minutes at Aberdeen on Saturday with no problem at all, which is
              fantastic news," he added.<br><br>"The great thing about Gary is that he has not missed a training session since the last time he came back in April.<br><br>"We could have played him at the end of the season but Wes was doing so well.<br><br>"His
              form was so good I didn't want to have doubts in my mind about picking
              him. Wes had played in every game, so we kept it like that.<br><br>"But now, a new season is about to start and Gary will get his chance."</p>

              <h1>United Held By Kaizer Chiefs</h1>
              <p>The Red Devils did, by and large, have the better of the play, but were
              found lacklustre in the final third and fairly sloppy in defence.<br><br>Many
              poor clearances allowed the Chiefs to have occasional spells of
              sustained pressure and the lack of penetrating width was telling for
              the Premier League-Champions League double-winners.<br><br>The first
              half was played at a slow pace in front of an expectant crowd. United
              could not get a solid passing game going and the Chiefs did fairly well
              to fend them off and launch the odd counterattack of their own.<br><br>Both
              teams looked like heading into the break with scores level before a
              surging run into the box drew a foul from the returning Gary Neville,
              and a penalty was awarded.<br><br>Quartey stepped up and sent Tomasz Kuszczak the wrong way with a placed spot-kick into the bottom-left hand corner.<br><br>Little
              changed after the break as United still lacked killer instinct and
              direct running, with full fitness still looking a couple of games off
              and the Chiefs full of energy and eager to impress.<br><br>However,
              Carlos Tevez's influence on the game grew as things progressed, and his
              run out wide and magnificent cross landed on the head of Chris Eagles,
              who had been extremely poor, yet could not miss an open goal.<br><br>Wayne
              Rooney was withdrawn shortly after, as his infamously short temper
              threatened to see him sent off (having already been booked) as he once
              again struggled to perform. Eagles was also replaced by Frazier
              Campbell, who looked sharp and relatively dangerous up front. Gary
              Neville was given a rest after a fairly rusty performance for the
              lively Danny Simpson.<br><br>From then on, it was the Red Devils who
              looked more likely to score, but neither goalkeeper was called into any
              kind of serious action as the match ended level.</p>

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Fergie defends raging Rooney</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Prem/man_utd/rooney_angry.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="190"></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson backed Wayne Rooney after the unsightly side of
              the striker’s game reared its ugly head in Manchester United’s 1-1 draw
              with Kaizer Chiefs.</strong></p>
              <p>Rooney lost his cool as the Chiefs
              frustrated United for long periods in their first tour match out in
              South Africa, and he can consider himself lucky not to have been sent
              off.</p>
              <p>Twice the England man petulantly kicked out at an opponent, but Ferguson claims Rooney did nothing wrong.</p>
              <p>"He is learning how to control himself and it (the challenge) was next to nothing,” stated the United manager.</p>
              <p>"I do not think he was out of order in this instance."</p>
              <p>Gary Neville was also responsible for an
              illegal challenge, producing the trip that led to Kaizer Chiefs’
              penalty, but Ferguson was full of praise for the veteran defender.</p>
              <p>"Obviously his tackling has not improved,"
              quipped the Scot. "Gary's enthusiasm and speed of play was quite
              phenomenal. I am very pleased and he is a remarkable man.</p>
              <p>"Anyone who has played football knows that
              when you get to your 30s and been out of the game for 16 months, your
              comeback is very, very difficult. You have to give him a lot of
              credit."</p>
