              Ritchie De Laet admits making his United debut on Sunday against Hull City was a dream come true.
              
              The young defender arrived at Old Trafford in a low-key move from Stoke City in January and has since made 14 appearances for the Reserves. But he never expected to play under Sir Alex before the seasonâ€™s end.
              
              In fact, even when the boss announced his team to play Hull at the KC Stadium, De Laet still wasnâ€™t convinced he was about to run out for the Reds.
              
              â€œDuring the team-talk, the manager said Richard, and of course thereâ€™s Richard Eckersley in the squad as well,â€� the 20-year-old told MUTV.â€� So I wasnâ€™t sure until I asked somebody else and they told me I was playing left-back.
              
              â€œThen I couldnâ€™t think anymore. Everything went black before my eyes and I was thinking: â€˜I just need to do wellâ€™. When I came off they said Iâ€™d done well so Iâ€™ll watch it again tonight and see how I did.â€�
              
              De Laet was one of Unitedâ€™s best players on the pitch, covering a lot of ground down the left wing and making a number of crucial tackles. For those who have seen him at centre-back for the Reserves, his role out wide raised a few eyebrows, but he revealed heâ€™s comfortable playing anywhere across the back four.
              
              â€œIâ€™m an all-round defender, to be fair. I like playing on the right and left because I enjoy going forward. When youâ€™re centre-back you canâ€™t do that all day, although I do try! But I really enjoyed today.â€�
              
              His appearance at the KC Stadium capped a memorable seven days for the Belgian defender. 
              
              â€œI was given a new contract earlier in the week,â€� he revealed, â€œso itâ€™s been a great week, signing a contract and making my senior United debut. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d play a league game this season when I arrived from Stoke... so you can say itâ€™s been like a dream.
              
              â€œI need to thank [Reserve team coaches] Warren Joyce and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to play with the Reserves.  [Sir Alex] gave me a chance today and I think I grabbed it.  I can enjoy my summer now because Iâ€™ve made my debut
              
              â€œHopefully I can push on next season and maybe go on loan or be in the first-team squad.â€�
