              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Wayne Rooney could yet outshine Cristiano Ronaldo as the biggest star in world football, insists Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">First the Old Trafford boss must determine what his best position is.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">To
              those who believe Rooney has not fulfilled the potential that prompted
              United to pay Everton £27million for him, Ferguson said: "Sometimes
              he's too much of a team player, not a selfish player, not a selfish boy.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"He's
              a committed winner. That's his problem. So he does a lot of sacrifice
              which doesn't reflect on his overall performance but as a team player
              he's absolutely fantastic.</p>

              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"He says to me sometimes 'I can play centre-half'. He's said that half a dozen times to me - 'I'll play centrehalf.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">I
              played centre-half at school you know!' "Then I say to him, 'Yes Wayne,
              but we're playing against Drogba!' It's not a trouble or a problem with
              him, it's a fantastic asset he's got.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"Brian
              McClair was the same. You could ask him to go play right back and he'd
              just laugh, he was so nonchalant about it, so temperamentally capable
              of doing anything and so intelligent that he could do that."</p>

              <p>Actually, I still find Rooney overrated. It's just that he plays for England and Man U, two very high profile teams. He is full of battling spirit and has a strong physique, but in terms of talent there are easily many better than him. I'm not saying he's not good or lousy, just overrated.</p>
              <p>Players like  Berbatov, Drogba or even Robbie Keane possess more skill than him. Their touch of the ball, tactical awareness, holding of the ball.</p>
              <p>Rooney's attributes lie in his physical abilities and his battling mentality. He's more like a battering ram type of player to me. Given that he's young, he can improve in the above areas, but it would also involve dramatically changing his style of play. Rooney's also more about power than finishing, but this is the one aspect of his gaming that is more likely to change as he gets older.</p>

              <p> Yes, credit to him for that one goal. If you read properly, I did not say Rooney is not a good player, but I feel he is overated. Overated and lousy have different meanings, but being fiercely defensive of players of your favourite club and the kind of knee jerk reaction that happens in sgforums, I can understand your response.</p>
              <p>The goal against Cech did not come about just because of Rooney's credit alone. Man U in itself is a good team, Rooney is also able to shine at times because of the supply to him. Also, when he scored that goal, Chelsea were pushing forward and left more space at the back than they sometimes do, still credit to him for taking his chances.</p>
              <p>It's not like Rooney was the only player to beat Cech.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>If you ask me, for a team to be strong and be able to win the Champions' League or Premiership, the players have to play for the team. Yes, being a team player is an attribute and a good quality to have, but is not unique to Rooney.</p>

              Second to none is really very extreme, but please note that I did not say he is a lousy player, just that he is overrated in my opinion. Among the truly word class I wouln't consider him among the top five and I believe I won't be the only one.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>IMHO, i would rate Ronney as high was what was put out in the media, he might not have scored as much goals as those that you guys stated but i don't agreed that he is just about battling spirit and strong physique, his passing, his tactical awareness is what that puts him in the league of some of the best players in EPL.. maybe its due to his willingness keeps covering back for his fellow team mates which IMHO is what he shouldn't be doing so often, and that's also why England can't get the most outta him, he needs to understand that being at the position aloccated to him in a team is very important during a high density match and that he must have more trust in his team mate and not trying to take everything into his strips.. if SAF can makes him play in the position he supposed to be best in without venturing everywhere around the field i would be able to see him fulfilling more to the hype that he rightly commands..</p></div>
