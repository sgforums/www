              <p><strong>ManUtd.com readers have picked out Spain striker David Villa as the Euro 2008 player they'd most like to sign for United this summer.<br><br></strong>Our shortlist comprised 12 players who have either been linked with United in the press or recommended by fans on our message board.<br><br>Valencia star Villa received 25 per cent of the votes in the poll, no doubt in recognition of his impressive form in helping Spain to win Euro 2008. He finished top scorer in the tournament with four goals and is now reportedly on the wanted list at several clubs.<br><br><em>Artcaller7</em> posted on our message board: "David Villa is perfect for United. He'd make a great combination with Rooney and link perfectly with Carrick."<br><br><strong>David Silva</strong>, a club and country colleague of Villa's, was the runner-up in our poll with 16 per cent. He's also said to be attracting attention after some fine performances in Austria and Switzerland, with Arsenal and Liverpool among the clubs being linked with a move for the midfielder.<br><br><em>Ajwarne</em> posted: "I think David Silva looks great, he's always running and he shows real desire. Against Italy in Euro 2008 he demonstrated he has a decent strike on him too."<br><br><strong>Karim Benzema</strong> was in third place, despite France's failure to reach the knock-out rounds of Euro 2008. He has been consistently linked with United while leading Lyon's attack in their domination of the French league.<br><br><em>Dizzly</em> posted: "Benzema's got pace, he's a finisher, and his youthful exuberance and charisma will go well with our squad."<br><br>Fourth place was shared by Germany's <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong> and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Holland's <strong>Wesley Sneijder</strong>. Both midfielders impressed at Euro 2008, scoring two goals apiece, and many fans feel they would make good additions to United's squad.<br><br><em>RyeGuy</em> posted: "Schweinsteiger would be an amazing addition to the team. With a buying price of £10million, it would be a great deal. He's young, experienced, and extraordinarily talented."<br><br><em>Jamie G</em> posted: "Sneijder has got pace stamina, you only have to see the amount of ground he covers to notice how quick he can get up and down the pitch. Man United play on the counter attack and Sneijder could more then cope with the pace in our team."<br></p>

              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hmm Both silva and villa seems better chances of getting them if we splash big..benzema jus extended his contract sneijder wont leave for sure</span></em></strong></p>
