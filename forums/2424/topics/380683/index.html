              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney was excused from </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> training this morning to be by wife Coleen's side as she delivered their first son.</strong></p>
              <p>The child, named Kai Wayne Rooney, was born nine days overdue at Liverpool's Women's Hospital. The timing of the birth means that 24-year-old is likely to be involved in United's Champions League match against CSKA Moscow at Old Trafford tomorrow night.</p>
              <p>Rooney would probably have been left out if the the birth was overnight, but the fact that strike-partner Dimitar Berbatov is struggling with a knee injury means boss Sir Alex Ferguson may be reluctant to do without the England international.</p>
              <p>It is understood that the couple had been at the Merseyside hospital since 10pm on Sunday night and the Kai was delivered at 1.45pm today.</p>
              <p>Speaking before confirmation of the birth, Ferguson said: 'It depends on the situation with his wife. She is pregnant and in hospital at the moment so we just have to wait on that one.'</p>
              <p>Rooney was not the only big name missing from training this morning. They have a 100 per cent record from their opening three matches in Group B and require just one more win to qualify for the knockout phase.</p>
              <p>United will definitely be without Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, who missed Saturday's victory over Blackburn with ankle problems, while Ryan Giggs and Ji-sung Park have also been excluded.</p>
              <p>Berbatov also missed training. Park was able to train after a recent absence with fluid on his knee and may be in contentions to face Chelsea looming at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher has recovered from a foot injury and is in line to start against CSKA. Ferguson said: 'Darren was a substitute on Saturday and will play on Tuesday. 'I think most people recognise Fletcher as a big game player. We’ve been aware of that for quite a while. Now there’s an acceptance among most people that he’s a very important player for us.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'He has been missed in some key games recently so it will be good to have him back.' As for the problems at centre half, Ferguson put faith in his stand-ins.</strong></p>
              <p>'A lot has been made about Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic being out, but when you have the backup of Jonny Evans and Wes Brown, it can't be bad,' said the Scot.</p>
              <p>'If you take Ferdinand and Vidic out then there aren't many partnerships in the Premier League better than Brown and Evans.'</p>

              <p>The England striker was beaming with joy as he departed from the maternity ward with his wife Coleen, who gave birth to the baby boy on Monday afternoon.</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney’s wife Coleen gave birth to a baby boy this afternoon, Kai Wayne, after being nine days overdue.</strong></p>
              <p>The couple arrived at Liverpool’s Women Hospital on Sunday evening but when Rooney missed training ahead of our CSKA game tomorrow the rumours began.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">“Mother and baby are both absolutely fine,”</span></em> said their spokesperson. <em><span style="color: #333333;">“Wayne and Coleen are thrilled with the wonderful addition to their family life.”</span></em></p>
              <p>Kai apparently means ‘keeper of the keys’ in Scottish and Welsh. Kai means ‘ocean’ in Hawaiian and ‘rejoice’ in Finnish. Kai is a popular <span style="color: #000000;">Welsh</span><span style="color: #000000;"> name, although the name is normally spelt <strong>Cai</strong>. From the Arthurian legend </span><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Kay</span>.</p>
              <p>According to reports, Wayne was so happy to hold his first born that he started crying, after spending the entire labour at his wife’s side.</p>
              <p>Give it a few years and Kai will be in the academy, ready to fill the boots of his recently retired father. Sounds like a plan.</p>
              <p>Congrats Wayne!</p>

              <p><strong>The public will not be seeing many pictures of Kai Wayne in glossy magazines soon, though, as the new mum turned down a £1m deal with OK.</strong></p>
              <p>Coleen insisted she wants to keep the couple's first birthday out of the public spotlight. </p>
              <p>Her spokesman told the News Of The World: "There are no bids being accepted - there won't be any picture deals." </p>
              <p>A friend of Coleen reportedly said: "She wants the little one to have a normal upbringing and so she's decided to turn down the deal.</p>
              <p>"It's part of her beliefs and ideals."</p>
