              <p><strong>Ryan Giggs says that it is
              the constant surge of youthful exuberance coming through at Manchester
              United that has ensured his career has had such longevity.</strong></p>
              <p>Giggs defied his advancing years to be named PFA Player of the Year
              at the grand old age of 35 after a season that has seen him settle into
              a more reserved central midfield role.</p>
              <p>He may have started just 12 Premier League games all season but the
              former Welsh winger has since proclaimed his intention to keep playing
              for the final year of his contract….and perhaps even beyond.</p>
              <p>“You get inspired by seeing the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne
              Rooney and all the younger players coming through,” he said in The Sun.
              “This season it’s been Rafael.</p>
              <p>“When I’m playing against Rafael in training and he’s bombing past
              me, you’ve got to do something about it. It’s not nice but you’ve got
              to raise your game.</p>
              <p>“You know your career is coming to an end and that you’ve got to make the most of it.</p>
              <p>“Then there’s the manager’s desire, the constant difficulties of
              playing for Manchester United and the different challenges that it
              brings each season.”</p>
              <p>Giggs even suggests that he has, despite losing a yard of pace, become a better player as his career has progressed.</p>
              <p>“I remember back in 2003 I was getting a bit of stick and that
              wasn’t enjoyable,” he added. “It was the first time I’d experienced it,
              so to win the league and end the season so strong was pleasing for me.
              It meant I’d got through it.</p>
              <p>“Since I turned 30 I’ve been more consistent. During my 20s the odd
              game I played probably better than I do now but consistently, over the
              season, I’ve got better the older I’ve got.</p>
              <p>“I’ve had to make some sacrifices – diet, alcohol, yoga. I was missing a lot of games through hamstring injuries then.</p>
              <p>“It helps that I’m not as quick as I used to be so I’m not getting
              those hamstring injuries anymore and I don’t play as many games.”</p>
